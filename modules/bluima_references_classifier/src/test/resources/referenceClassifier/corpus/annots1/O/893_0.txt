The major findings of the present study in the
frontal cortex of young rats can be summarized as
follows (Fig. 13): (1) Large non-pyramidal cells in
layers II/III included CCK RS/BSNP, somatostatin
RSNP and parvalbumin FS cells. (2) Some of the
axon terminals of large CCK RS/BSNP cells were
apposed to other somata by multiple boutons. (3)
Large somatostatin cells were RSNP cells with wide
or ascending axonal arbors. (4) Parvalbumin cells
included chandelier cells with vertical rows of axonal
boutons as well as common FS cells with extended
axonal arborizations, some terminals of which were
apposed to other somata by multiple boutons. (5)
The axon terminals of FS cells including a chandelier
cell and of large RSNP cells were immunoreactive
for GABA. (6) Four to 35% of the synapses by FS
cells and 10 to 37% synapses by large RSNP basket
cells were on somata. (7) About 30% of the FS
cell terminals, but few of the RSNP cell terminals,
innervated the necks of spines as well as the dendritic
shafts from which spines protruded. (8) A small
number of the terminals of these FS cells and large
RSNP basket cells innervated GABA-positive postsynaptic elements, but an FS chandelier cell made
synapses only on GABA-negative axon initial segments. (9) An FS cell with few somatic innervation
(4%) innervated more GABA-positive postsynaptic
targets than the other FS cells.
The FS cells used for electron microscopic observations are considered to contain parvalbumin,
although they were not identified immunohistochemically. Some of the large RSNP basket cells
used for electron microscopic observations may
correspond to large CCK cells.

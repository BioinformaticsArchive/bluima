The Stepanyants et al. (2008) study is focused on the high
connectivity tapering from the soma down toward zero
within the dimensions of a column which is certainly a major
factor shaping columns and provide a detailed description of
the structural constraints that could underlie the invariance
of the circuitry. There are, however, many other factors that
are also likely to be very important in shaping functional
neocortical columns such as the degree of stereotypy of neurons, mini-columnar arrangement (vertical alignment, which
is more sloppy in rodents), nuclear reciprocity, microcircuit
plasticity, and synaptic plasticity which could all favor clustered activity. Thomson has also found that pyramidal neurons tend to place their synapses higher up on the apical dendrites as they move apart (see Thomson and Bannister,
2003), which could even bring single neuron computation
into the game. Top down control of dendritic tuft processing
and interneuron tuft control by Martinotti cells are likely to
shape an intense competition between pyramidal neurons to
become the center of a functional column since there may
not, in fact, be a fixed anatomical location for functional columns. Stepanyants et al. (2008) report very low connectivity
onto interneurons which is not consistent with experimental
findings.
Even with all these anatomical and functional facilitators
of clearly demarcated functional columns, the continuous
sheet of neurons so closely packed would make anatomically
fixed functional columns very unlikely. What is critically re-quired is punctuated input. In highly dedicated areas such as
the barrel cortex, punctuating takes on an extreme anatomical form, but the computational power of the neocortex most
likely arises from the generic capability to dynamically as-sign functional columns by punctuating the input across the
neocortex. While punctuating would be hardwired to some
degree in the thalamic bottom-up, associative top-down, and
hemispheric and cortical horizontal input pathways, there
may be considerable room for dynamic assignment of the
anatomical center, and perhaps even the function of functional neocortical columns.
The prediction is simpleâ€”if one could inject punctuated
stimulation at any point on the neocortex, a functional column would emerge with a diameter approximately that of the
average dimensions of the overlapping basal axonal and dendritic arbors of the neurons at the center of the stimulation,
and the dimensions of the column in each layer depends on
the specific arborizations of the axons and dendrites in the
respective layer and the function of the column would be de-termined by the nature of the input. The functional columns
may, therefore, be dynamically fixed in anatomical locations
and functionally assigned within the constraints imposed
through the macro-anatomy of the brain and the functions
being assigned to other areas. Such a relativistic theory of
functional neocortical columns could explain the growing
anatomical number of overlapping feature selective modules

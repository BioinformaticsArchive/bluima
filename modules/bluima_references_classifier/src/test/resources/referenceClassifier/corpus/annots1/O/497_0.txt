at ;0.05 nM aldosterone (Wehling et al., 1991b). Similarly, an apparent EC50 of ;0.2 nM was found in VSMC
(Christ et al., 1995a), suggesting that these effects may
occur at physiological plasma concentrations of free al-dosterone as demonstrated in rats [;0.2 nM (Menachery
et al., 1991)] and man [;0.1 nM (Al-Dujaili and Ed-wards, 1978)]. Unlike their high affinity to intracellular
type I MRs, cortisol and other glucocorticoids were ac-tive at supramicromolar concentrations only. Moreover,
the type I MR antagonist canrenone did not inhibit these
effects. In VSMC, the synthetic steroid fludrocortisone,
which is clinically used in an oral formulation for aldosterone substitution in mineralocorticoid deficiency,
showed a mineralocorticoid potency similar to that of
aldosterone. Rapid activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter
by aldosterone seemed to be followed by genomic activation of this electroneutral ion transporter. The rapid
activation of the antiporter was not blocked by inhibitors
of transcription and protein synthesis, whereas effects
after 24 h were suppressed (Ebata et al., 1999).
Furthermore, stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter
results in prolonged cellular alkalinization of VSMC as
demonstrated by BCECF-spectrofluorometry (Wehling
et al., 1996). After addition of 100 nM aldosterone, initial
acidification is followed by significant alkalinization oc-curring within 2 min, whereas 1 μM cortisol does not
affect intracellular pH. The latter findings are confirmed
in a recent paper by Alzamora et al. (2000) Aldosterone
induces an increase of Na+/H+-exchanger activity in
human strips of uterine and chorionic arteries within a
few seconds, which was not affected by spironolactone
(10 μM). However, those effects were blocked by the
open-ring MR antagonist RU-28318, a finding which will
be discussed in detail below (see Section IV.C.1.).
Immediate effects of aldosterone on intracellular cell
signaling have also been thoroughly characterized in
Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Gekle et al., 1996).
Aldosterone rapidly influences plasma membrane H+
conductance that in turn increases the activity of the
Na+/H+ exchanger (Gekle et al., 1997). These results
are in line with our findings and with earlier results by
the same group (Oberleithner et al., 1987), who demonstrated rapid aldosterone-induced changes in intracellular pH in the distal tubule of the toad kidney. However,
the onset of pH modulation was delayed to 15 to 20 min,
a time frame that is still compatible with a genomic
event. Because it was inhibited by amiloride, the effect
was believed to reflect an increased activity of the
Na+/H+ exchanger.
Rapid effects of aldosterone on Na+/H+-antiporter ac-tivity have also been reported in isolated colonic crypts.
Aldosterone applied at physiological concentrations
(0.08 – 0.2 nM) increased intracellular pH within 1 min.
Ethylisopropylamiloride, and Na+-free incubation me-dium, completely blocked aldosterone-induced effects.
As demonstrated in the experiments on Na+ influx in
VSMC (Christ et al., 1995a), these actions are not

pruned through retraction or degeneration to
develop the precise connectivity found in the
adult. These strategies ensure the establishment of proper functional connections and
provide a substrate for neural plasticity. Following, we present examples of small-scale
(Figure 1) and large-scale axon elimination
(Figure 2).

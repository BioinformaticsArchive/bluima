A long-standing question in neurobiology is whether astrocytes
respond to the neuronal release of neurotransmitters in vivo. To
address this question, acutely isolated hippocampal slices
were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye Calcium Green-1
and the responses of the astrocytes to electrical stimulation of
the Schafer collaterals were monitored by confocal microscopy. To confirm that the responsive cells were astrocytes, the
slices were immunostained for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. Stimulation of the Schafer collaterals (50 Hz,
2 sec) resulted in increases in the concentration of intracellular
calcium ([Ca2+] ) in the astrocytes located in the stratum radia- i

tum of CA1. The astrocytic responses were blocked by the
sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin, the voltage-dependent
calcium channel blocker v-conotoxin-MVIIC, and the selective
metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist Î±-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). These results suggest that the
astrocytic responses were induced by stimulation of metabo-

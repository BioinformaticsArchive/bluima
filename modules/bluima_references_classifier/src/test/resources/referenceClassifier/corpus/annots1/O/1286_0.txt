causes a conductance increase in KCs, shunting the odor-evoked synaptic currents (Fig. 4B)
and the current loops responsible for the LFPs
(Fig. 4A). It is possible, however, that GGN also
affects KCs by presynaptic action on PN axons.
Thus, although the results in Figs. 3 and 4 in-dicate a postsynaptic (shunting) action of GGN
onto KCs, we cannot exclude the possibility that
GGN also inhibits KCs presynaptically, by ac-tion ono PN axons.
Thus far, we have assessed the effects of GGN
only on individual KCs. Because thousands of
KCs converge on a small number of extrinsic
neurons in the output lobes of the mushroom
body (14, 20), we can use b-lobe neurons (bLNs)
as assays of GGN action onto the KC population.
We impaled bLNs in a dendrite (n = 10 bLNs) to
monitor odor-evoked activity. Manipulating GGN
membrane potential during the odor pulse changed
the recorded bLN's responses to the odor (Fig. 4,
C to E): A large GGN depolarization could si-lence the bLN [Fig. 4C (ii)]; conversely, hyperpolarizing GGN (moderately) increased bLN
firing rate [Fig. 4C (iv and vii)]. The action of
GGN on the bLN was not direct, for GGN had no
effect on bLN firing evoked by current injection
(fig. S8). Increasing depolarization of GGN during an odor caused a progressive reduction of
bLN firing and LFP power (Fig. 4E), consistent
with GGN's effect on current-induced firing of
KCs (Fig. 3, B to D). Hence, GGN affects bLNs
indirectly by its actions on the KC population
output.
Using simultaneous intradendritic, intrasomatic, and extracellular recordings in vivo and
in nonanesthetized animals, we assessed directly
and specifically the functional connectivity and
actions of a single, identifiable wide-field interneuron (GGN) in a structure implicated in learning and memory in insects. This single neuron
forms the negative arm of a feedback loop by
KCs onto themselves and thus regulates KC ex-citability adaptively, a function required to maintain the sparseness of odor representations by
KCs (SOM text, figs. S1 to S3). The effects of this
neuron are such that it can, on its own, shut down
entirely the output of the mushroom body. Conversely, its hyperpolarization can increase mushroom body output. Because GGN is also under the
influence of at least one other inhibitory neuron
(IG), however, the gain of the KC negativefeedback loop can, in principle, itself be modulated. This attribute is highly desirable in a circuit
involved in memory for it could allow the
lowering or raising of KC firing threshold and
thereby increase the probability of—and degrees
of refinement in—object recognition during recall.
GGN lacks action potentials, a property common in insect interneurons (21). Although the
implementation we described may be specific
to invertebrate brains (see fig. S9 for intracellular recordings from the Drosophila analog
of GGN, for example), the underlying principles may be widespread among circuits with
equivalent requirements for sparse represen-

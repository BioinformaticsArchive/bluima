Melanopsin-expressing cells
All of the cells recognized by the melanopsin antibody
were placed into a single cluster, M6. These cells are all
characterized by a small soma and a large, sparse dendritic field. We were able to visualize melanopsin-positive
cells with dendrites stratifying only in layer 1. However, one
other cell is included in this cluster, a YFP-expressing cell
with a morphology indistinguishable from the cells recognized by the antibody but whose dendrites were located in
layer 5 of the IPL. In addition, the one bistratified cell
forming its own cluster (* in Fig. 1) was similar in appearance to the melanopsin-expressing cells. Thus, there ap-pear to be three types of melanopsin cells in the mouse
retina-On, Off, and On/Off.

(Consortium, 1994). It should be noted that this knockout model
is less susceptible to a common criticism of knockout models, as
both fragile-X patients and these transgenic mice undergo
development without a functional FMR-1 gene.
A quantitative neuroanatomical study of Golgiâ€“Kopschstained human autopsy material from three male adult fragile-X
patients and three male age-matched controls was carried out in
order to quantify and further describe dendritic spine characteristics in fragile-X patients by comparing dendritic spine length,
morphology and density along apical shaft, apical oblique and
basilar dendrites on layer V pyramidal cells in the temporal
cortex of these subjects (Irwin et al., 1999) (S.A. Irwin et al.,
submitted for publication). The results showed that fragile-X
patients had significantly more long spines and significantly
fewer short spines than controls on apical shaft, apical oblique
and basilar dendrites (Figure 1). Likewise, fragile-X patients

SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF PKC SIGNALING

Lipid Second Messengers Control the Dynamics
of PKC Signaling
The crux of PKC activation occurs at the level of lipid second messenger production and turnover. For conventional isozymes, the most common pathway for lipid second messenger
production involves a Gq-coupled receptor triggering PIP2 hy-drolysis by PLCb isoforms. This produces DAG and IP3, which

Definition of the Outlines of a TC Projection Column
We used the anatomically well-defined TC projections from the
ventroposteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPM) as anatomical
landmarks to define a cortical projection column. TC axons
were labeled by virus-mediated fluorescence as reported in the
preceding article (Wimmer et al. 2010). Figure 1A shows the
fluorescence intensity of TC (VPM) projections in a semicoronal slice from rat barrel cortex. The barrels in L4 are
clearly discernible as areas of higher TC projection density. The
circumference of the TC projection column in the horizontal
plane was defined by the maximum outline of VPM projection
intensity in L4. We incidentally found that immunolabeling of
the 67 kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67)
permitted delineation of outlines that were well aligned to the

RFs of barrel-related pyramidal cells. Records from a L3
pyramidal cell located above the C2 barrel (Fig. 1A) are
shown in Fig. 1B and C. Deflection of both the principal
whisker (PW, w C2, Fig. 1B) and a surround whisker
(SuW, w D2, Fig. 1C) evoked large depolarisations, but
APs only infrequently. Figure 1D shows the ongoing
subthreshold activity of this neuron, which was
characterized by alternating down-states and up-states
with synaptic background activity. Figure 2 shows the RF
and the dendritic (red) and axonal (blue) arbors of this cell
in relation to the barrel borders in L4, with the dendrite
and axonal arbors projected to a horizontal (Fig. 2C) and
vertical plane (Fig. 2D). Deflection the PW and the SuW

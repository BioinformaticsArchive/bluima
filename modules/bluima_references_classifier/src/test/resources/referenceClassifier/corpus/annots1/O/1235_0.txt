Figure 7. Reproduction of SAP and DC potential in a single-compartment NL neuron model. A, Schematic drawing for the
formation of SAP. The convergence of phase-locked synaptic inputs from NM generates both SAP and DC potential in NL. B, Circuit
diagram of the model. Note that no somatic Na channels are included. C, Amplitude of SAP and DC potential plotted with respect
to half-peak width ( W) of unitary inputs from NM. The vertical dotted line indicates the value used in the model (also in F and H,
simulated sound frequency 4 kHz unless otherwise mentioned). D, Examples of voltage traces of the model with three different
W values (0.1, 0.25, 0.4 ms). Note that very small value of W (0.1 ms) is needed to reproduce similar amplitudes of SAP observed in
vivo experiments. E, Schematic drawings for the effects of spontaneous inputs of NM. Left, Low spontaneous NM spiking rate.
Right, High spontaneous NM spiking rate. As the spontaneous rate increases, sound-induced DC shift decreases, while SAP is not
affected. F, SAP (solid line) and DC (broken line) potentials plotted with respect to NM spontaneous spike rate. G, Schematic
drawings for the effects of sound-induced suppression mechanisms. Left, No suppression in the EPSC amplitude. Right, With
suppression in the EPSC amplitude. Sound-induced suppression reduces DC shift more than SAP amplitude. H, SAP (solid line) and
DC (broken line) potentials plotted with respect to the sound-induced EPSC suppression ratio. Note that DC decreases more steeply
than SAP due to the high spontaneous inputs from NM. I, Comparison of voltage traces with (thin black line) and without (thick gray
line) NM spontaneous activity and sound-induced EPSC suppression.

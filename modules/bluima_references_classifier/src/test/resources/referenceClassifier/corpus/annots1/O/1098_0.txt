FIG. 1. Distribution and properties of I channels in
h

cell-attached patches. A: slow inward currents evoked in
response to voltage steps from -52 to -152 mV (bottom
trace) in cell-attached patches obtained from the axon,
soma, and apical dendrite (at the indicated locations from
the same neuron). Each current trace is an average (30
trails: only 1 in 5 data points are shown for clarity) and was
fit with single exponential function (smooth lines). B:
pooled data (72 patches) of the average amplitude of slow
inward currents measured at steady-state (as indicated in A)
during voltage steps from -52 to -152 mV, indicate a
poverty of I channels in axonal or somatic patches, but an
h

increase in I channel density with distance along apical
h

dendrites. All data obtained at 20 –24°C. The line is an
unconstrained linear regression with a slope of 9 pA/100
μm. C: family of currents evoked in response to a series of
voltage steps (bottom traces). Each current trace is an
average of 5 trials and has been fit with a single exponential
(smooth lines). D: activation curve for I channels obtained
h

by tail current measurement (as indicated in C). Each point
is the mean 6 SE, and data were fit with a single Boltzmann function (solid line, 20 –24°C, n = 29). Dashed line
represents the Boltzmann function obtained at 34 –35°C
(n = 6). Arrow indicates the whole cell recorded resting
membrane potential. E: bath application of ZD7288 (100
μM) reduces the amplitude of slow inward currents, revealing the presence of a very slow current, the time course of
which was well fit with a biexponential function (smooth
line). F: time constants of activation (c) and deactivation
(E) at different test potentials. Each point is the mean 6 SE
and was fit with a single exponential for recordings made at
20 –24°C and 34 –35°C.

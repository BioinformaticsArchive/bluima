sically, we blocked major excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
transmission. On synaptic isolation, spontaneous network
bursting was reliably abolished. However, depolarizing current injections into synaptically isolated neurons revealed
intrinsic bursting that was not observed in control neurons,
suggesting that the intrinsic bursting was induced by activity
deprivation. This intrinsic bursting could be abolished by
bath application of cadmium chloride, indicating a contribution of calcium channels. Immunohistochemistry experiments

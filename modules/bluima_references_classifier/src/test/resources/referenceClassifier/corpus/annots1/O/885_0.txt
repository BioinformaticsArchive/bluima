2). CR and PV expression patterns further differed in the
neuropil: CR immunostaining was associated with vertical fibers
(Figs 1D and 4D) that often seemed to contact other CR-positive
profiles, and contrasted with the more irregular fiber labeling
pattern and the stained pericellular baskets seen in PV stained
sections (Figs 3B and 4C, E). The difference in PV and CR
neuropil staining was particularly striking in layer 1. Here, CR
immunoreactive axons and dendrites were abundant (Figs 1D
and 4B) and could be followed spreading horizontally for up to 2
mm from the cell body. In contrast, PV stained processes in layer
1 were sparse and more narrowly confined (Fig. 4A). These
diverse staining patterns suggest that CR staining neurons are
distinct from PV immunoreactive cells and that they constitute a
separate, smaller group of GABAergic neurons that account for
17% (102/538) of GABAergic neurons (Table 2).

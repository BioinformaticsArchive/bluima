Figure 7. Blocking GABA receptors causes a general shift toward high-pass tuning. A, Ef- A

fects of bath application of either 100 M picrotoxin in 0.3% DMSO (PTX) or 30 M gabazine on
IPI tuning. Each row represents a single neuron. Horizontal bars show the range of IPI stimuli
that elicited maximum depolarizations 85% of the maximum response. Gray bars show
tuning before wash-in, whereas red bars show tuning during wash-in. B, Relative frequencies of
low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, band-stop, complex, and all-pass neurons under five different
conditions: control, bath wash-in of vehicle (0.3% DMSO), bath wash-in of PTX or gabazine,
intracellular PTX, and intracellular PTX combined with bath wash-in of PTX or gabazine.

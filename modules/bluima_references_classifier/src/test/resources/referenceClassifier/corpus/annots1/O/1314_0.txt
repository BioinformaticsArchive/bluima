evoke thousands of inhibitory postsynaptic events per
second. The PNâ€“CN connection seems to be optimized
to deliver a rather steady inhibitory current as the strong
depression combines with regular simple spike firing of
PNs (Fig. 2A, Telgkamp & Raman, 2002; Pedroarena &
Schwartz, 2003; Shin et al. 2007), greatly diminishing the
influence of individual, unsynchronized single spikes on
action potential frequency and precision in the target CN
cells (Gauck & Jaeger, 2000; Shin et al. 2007; Jaeger, 2011;
Lang & Blekinsop, 2011). Transient synchronization of
simple spikes (Jaeger, 2003; Shin & De Schutter, 2006;
Medina & Lisberger, 2007; de Solages et al. 2008; Wise
et al. 2010) and of the lower-frequency complex spikes
(Welsh et al. 1995; Ozden et al. 2009, 2010; Schultz et al.
2009) may cause transiently synchronized PN output.
Importantly, synchronous pauses of PN firing may
result in a temporary lift of the tonic inhibition of CN
target neurons (Shin & De Schutter, 2006; De Schutter
& Steuber, 2009) which can play a critical role in
the generation of rebound activity in CN neurons, a
hotly debated phenomenon (Alvin~a et al. 2008; Zheng
& Raman, 2009; Hoebeek et al. 2010; Tadayonnejad
et al. 2010). Rebound spikes could potentially endow
the CN projection neurons with a capability to precisely encode both rate- and time-related signals (De

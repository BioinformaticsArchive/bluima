MATERIALS AND METHODS
Stimulation and rapid freezing of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures.
Slice cultures of hippocampus were prepared from postnatal day 7 rats in
the manner of Stoppini et al. (1991). Such organotypic slice cultures are
widely accepted experimental models (for review, see G ̈ahwiler et al.,
1997) and are essential for the present experiments because they provide
healthy superficial neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses that are
close enough to the surface to allow for rapid freezing with excellent
structural preservation (Pozzo-Miller et al., 1993) and no elemental
redistribution. The specific experimental setup is essentially similar to
that described and schematically diagrammed in Pozzo-Miller et al.
(1997), with one significant modification: two insulated nichrome wires
(20 m in diameter; California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA) for
afferent fiber stimulation were attached permanently to custom-modified
12 mm Millicell-CM filter inserts (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The slice
grew above one exposed uninsulated section of the wire that was fixed
flush against the filter insert membrane, such that the wire ran under the
dentate gyrus. The presence of the wires had no discernible effect on the
growth, anatomy, or synaptic circuitry of the cultures. Just before a slice
was transferred to a recording chamber, the exposed uninsulated section
of the second wire was lowered onto the slice parallel to the lower wire,
with a spacing of 1 mm, and was fixed to the edge of the insert with
silicone vacuum grease. The recording chamber was perfused continuously with oxygenated artificial CSF (aCSF) containing (in mM) 124
NaC l, 2 KC l, 1.24 K H2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 17.6 NaHC O3, 2.5 C aC l2, and
10 D-glucose; the solution was bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Field
EPSPs (fEPSPs) were evoked at low frequency by single pulses (100 sec
duration) delivered to the top wire by a multichannel stimulator and
isolator set-up (Master-8 and ISO-Flex, AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel) and
were recorded with a bridge amplifier (Axoclamp-1A, Foster City, CA),
using an extracellular glass microelectrode filled with aCSF (2 M final
resistance) positioned in CA3 stratum lucidum. This arrangement was
effective for generating fEPSPs along the apical CA3 dendritic field and
permitted selection of the stimulus strength that was necessary to evoke
subthreshold fEPSPs ( 0.5 mV, without superimposed population spike)
in each culture individually.
For slices with a 1 sec interval between stimulation and freezing,
cultures with the wires still in position were positioned briefly under a
dissecting microscope to wick off adventitious surface fluid and to place
(with a fine needle) three delicate copier toner marks that later would be
used to triangulate the CA3 region in frozen specimens. Cultures then
were mounted on custom-made freezing stages that adapted the
Millicell-CM inserts to a custom-modified rapid freezing machine (LifeCell CF-100; The Woodlands, TX). These steps required 10 sec; in no
case was the tissue touched or otherwise disturbed. The stimulator was
used to trigger the freezing machine as well as the stimulus train,
allowing rapid freezing at accurately programmable intervals as short as
a few milliseconds between the delivery of a stimulus to mossy fibers and
the instant of impact on the freezing block. The stimulus train used here,
50 Hz/1 sec, is a standard high-frequency train and is identical to that
described as the “single train” in previous work (Pozzo-Miller et al.,
1997). For 30 sec (and longer) experiments the interval is long enough
that cultures can be stimulated alternatively in the recording chamber
(and therefore can use cultures grown with or without embedded stimulating wires) and then mounted on stages and rapidly frozen. Experiments were performed to evaluate all permutations, and no differences
were found among the various procedures. Controls, i.e., nonstimulated
cultures, were subjected to all experimental manipulations except delivery of the tetanus. Again, no differences were observed between controls
frozen directly from the recording chamber and those premounted on
freezing stages.
Experiments were performed on slices 6–8 d in vitro. This relatively

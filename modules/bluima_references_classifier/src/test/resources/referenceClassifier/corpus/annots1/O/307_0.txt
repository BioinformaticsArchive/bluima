The H-reflex is a valuable tool in the pursuit of
understanding the means by which movements are
produced and controlled in humans. There remain
limited options for probing neural functioning during human movements. The H-reflex, although re-stricted in many respects as to the information that
can be obtained with its use, is capable of providing
much insight into the neural control of human
movements. Care in the use of the H-reflex is re-quired to ensure that the results obtained are meaningful and the conclusions drawn are valid. In many
cases, the information gained from H-reflex studies
in humans have been corroborated by evidence in
animal experiments, indicating that the H-reflex is
valid in its role. Given the strong publication record
of the H-reflex, and the creative uses of this relatively
simple test that have been developed in recent years,
it is reasonable to speculate that the H-reflex will
continue to be an extensively used tool in the field of
motor control neurophysiology for the foreseeable
future.

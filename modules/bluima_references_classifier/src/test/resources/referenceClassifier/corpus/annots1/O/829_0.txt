m. C, Polar plots of mean percentage responses of the same neurons depicted in B to randomly deflecting the principal whisker in eight different directions (onset deflections in black;
offset deflections in red; 223 deflections; circles in units of 10% response probability). D, Scatter
plots showing max/mean response versus the number of stimuli leading to AP responses for
each PW-related (n 130; left) and septum-related (n 54; right) neuron (onset in black;
offset in red). The max/mean response is defined as the ratio of maximum spike probability from
all eight stimulation angles to mean response probability for all angles. The bias, defined as the
max/mean response expected for a neuron with no angular preference and a given number of
observed APs, is shown in green. E, Probability distribution of bias-corrected max/mean re-sponse for both PW-related (left) and septum-related (right) neurons (0.02 bin width; onset in
black; offset in red; see Materials and Methods). Distributions interpolated using cubic spline.
Neurons consistently responding only to one direction display values 0, up to a theoretical
maximum of 7. Neurons responding evenly to all angles display 0. Shaded region corresponds to
values 0.30, the value corresponding to a tuning p value of 0.1 in a linear regression (supplemental Fig. 3D, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). F, Spatial map of
angular tuning. The maximal-response direction of each neuron was color coded (color scale,
bottom right) and plotted on an averaged barrel-centered map for deflection onset (left) and
offset (right). Minimum (green dashed line), maximum (red dashed line), and average (black
lines) barrel borders are shown. Arcs run vertically, rows run horizontally, and black crosses
indicate BCC. Scale bar, 200 m. G, Angle of directional tuning vector as a function of angular
anatomic coordinate for all PW-related neurons.

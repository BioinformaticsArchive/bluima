Results and Discussion
Using detailed morphologically and physiologically realistic compartmental models of tangential cells [19,20] we
calculated the passive steady state current transfer between
all dendritic locations and the root. We found that the current transfer from all dendritic locations to the axonal
summation point is strongly equalized throughout the
dendrite (Figure 1A). This corresponds well with findings
on many other cell types, notably CA3 pyramidal neurons
and Purkinje cells [14,16]. In principle, the root voltage
response (V ) to a constant steady synaptic current (I )
root syn
at each synapse location, x, would become independent of
that synaptic site if the ratio of the voltages between the

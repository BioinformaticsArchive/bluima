Discussion
We describe here a novel method for visualizing the detailed
morphology of non-pyramidal, presumed GABAergic neurons in
living neocortical slice cultures by GA D67–GFP transfection.
Using a novel computational metric of dendritic polarization, we
demonstrated that dendrites of ∼70% of the medium and large
GAD67–GFP expressing neurons are not randomly oriented, but
instead show a highly significant tendency to extend along the
vertical axis of the cortex.

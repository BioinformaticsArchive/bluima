Connections between layers 3 and 5
Layer 3 pyramids target large layer 5 pyramids
The first clear evidence that intracortical excitatory connections can be extremely selectively made came from
studies in which one cell in layer 3 and another in
layer 5 were recorded simultaneously and many pairs
tested for connectivity. When the layer 5 cell was a large,
tufted, burst firing pyramid and the layer 3 cell a pyramid whose soma was within 50–100 μm of the layer 5

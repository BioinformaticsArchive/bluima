The molecular architecture of the synaptic junction has been
studied intensely for many years, yielding information on its
composition and function based on studies of individual receptors or small groups of proteins (1). In recent years, with the
advent of proteomic technologies, a coherent map of the mammalian synapse proteome has been emerging. Mass spectrometry (MS)1-based analysis of the postsynaptic density (PSD)

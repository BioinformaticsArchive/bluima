Fragile X mental retardation protein and autism

Fragile X syndrome (see Box 5 - FXS) is the most common single
genetic cause of autism (2â€“6% of all autism cases) (Hagerman et al.,
2010). Darnell et al. (2011) also shed new light on the molecular
mechanisms of cognition and behaviour. A database (Croning et al.,
2009) search of newly identified FMRP target RNAs revealed
interesting parallels to mouse brain synaptic proteins. Moreover, there
was substantial overlap with genes that are well-known ASD candidate
genes [database for Autism Research (SFARI) database] (BanerjeeBasu & Packer, 2010), including neuroligin-3, neurexin-1, Shank3 or
tuberous sclerosis (complex) (TSC)2 (see below). These molecules have
all been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASDs in the past (Darnell
et al., 2011). In this context, an exciting hypothesis has been put forward
suggesting that mutations in proteins that limit translation may cause
autism (Kelleher & Bear, 2008). FXS exhibits strong clinical association
to ASD (see Box 4 - FXS and Box 6 - FXTAS). The study by Darnell
et al. (2011) provides new implications of FMRP in ASDs. FMRP has
been shown to bind RNA and contribute to RNA localization and
translational regulation. In summary, this work also successfully pushes
our knowledge of neuronal regulation and cognition further. In addition
to the gain of insight on the molecular level, the findings also provide
novel ideas for therapeutical approaches. In addition, as the translocation
of ribosomes is not stalled in the absence of FMRP, several antibiotics,
which slow down ribosomal translocation, have already been the object
of discussion in regard to clinical trials (see also Therapy strategies and
outlook). Given the data provided by Darnell et al. (2011), further
candidates are drugs acting on the Extracellular-signal Regulated
Kinases (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal
transduction pathways, as some components of these are regulated via
FMRP (Narayanan et al., 2008), and potentially ameliorate FXS and
autism symptoms (Darnell et al., 2011) (see Mammalian target of
rapamycin).
In addition to the implications of FMRP in translational control and
its links to autism, alternative associations of FMRP in ASD
pathogenesis have been previously put forward. FMRP is not only
present at the postsynaptic side of the synapse, but has also been
detected in presynaptic compartments in a complex referred to as
fragile X granules, mainly found in the developing brain (Christie
et al., 2009). FMRP localization in axons and growth cones may also
serve the regulation of local protein translation, e.g. needed for axon
guidance. This potentially suggests a key role of FMRP during brain
development (Li et al., 2009). Patients with ASD often develop
normally until the age of two. The majority of patients subsequently
suffer from a regression of abilities (Christie et al., 2009). A wellknown sign of ASDs in infancy is an enlarged brain (Courchesne
et al., 2003). This potentially points towards defects in pruning, which
typically involves presynaptic sites (Aylward et al., 1999). Defective
pruning per se is a key feature of FXS (Irwin et al., 2001). Therefore,
it was proposed that the clinical features in FXS as well as in autism
could be due to loss of FMRP function in presynaptic sites (Christie
et al., 2009).

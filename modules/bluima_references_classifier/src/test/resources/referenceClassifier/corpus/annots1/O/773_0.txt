46 degenerating callosal synapses were probably formed with the anterior pyramid while
6 were probably formed with the posterior
cell. Finally, comparison of electron microscopic degeneration and autoradiographic
procedures has indicated that degeneration
methods consistently underestimate by onethird the number of afferent synaptic contacts formed (6, 15). Therefore, the number
of degenerating callosal synapses should be
multiplied by 3, suggesting that the anterior
pyramid probably formed at least 138 synapses with callosal axon terminals while the
posterior neuron formed 18.
Figure 11 is a schematic summarization
of some of the conclusions of this study. It
is proposed that dendrites of pyramidal neurons receiving callosal afferents can be lumped
electrically in an equivalent cylinder model

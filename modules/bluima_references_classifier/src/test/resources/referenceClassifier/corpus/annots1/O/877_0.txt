Figure 2. The projection tube drawing of a biocytin-stained CR cell (same cell as in Fig. 1) from a 9-d-old animal. The arrowhead indicates the possible
site of axon origin. Note the location of the cell in the upper portion of layer I (indicated by the bracket at right of the drawing). Note also the thick single
dendrite with small finger-like appendages. Inset, A response to an injection of depolarizing current. Note slow action-potential time course and
progressive increase in spike width. Resting potential was -50.5 mV.

Cav1.4 time constants for inactivation ( h) at various voltages and
temperatures were obtained from monoexponential fits to raw
current data. Cav1.4 h at 23 °C was obtained from fitting traces
elicited by 15 s step depolarizations to various potentials. Between
23 °C and 37 °C, h was obtained from fitting traces elicited by 4 s
depolarizations to 0 mV, and at 37 °C by fitting traces obtained
from 0.75 s depolarizations to various potentials. Cav1.2 h at
various voltages and temperatures were obtained from biexponential fits to raw current data. Cav1.2 h was obtained from fitting
traces obtained from 15 s (23 °C) and 1 s (37 °C) step depolarizations to various potentials. Cav1.2 h was also obtained at 27 °C
and 33 °C by fitting traces obtained from 4 s depolarizations to
10 mV. An Arrhenius plot, according to equation 4, was used to

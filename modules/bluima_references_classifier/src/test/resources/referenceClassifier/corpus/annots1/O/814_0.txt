GABA depolarizes immature cortical neurons. However, whether GABA excites

immature neocortical neurons and drives network oscillations as in other brain structures

remains controversial. Excitatory actions of GABA depend on three fundamental parameters:

the resting membrane potential (Em), reversal potential of GABA (EGABA) and threshold of

action potential generation (Vthr). We have shown recently that conventional invasive

recording techniques provide an erroneous estimation of these parameters in immature

neurons. In the present paper, we have used non-invasive single NMDA and GABA channel

recordings in rodent brain slices to measure both Em and EGABA in the same neuron. We show

that GABA strongly depolarizes pyramidal neurons and interneurons in both deep and

superficial layers of the immature neocortex (P2-P10). However, GABA generates action

potentials in layer 5/6 (L5/6) but not L2/3 pyramidal cells, since L5/6 pyramidal cells have

more depolarized resting potentials and more hyperpolarized Vthr. The excitatory GABA

transiently drives oscillations generated by L5/6 pyramidal cells and interneurons during

development (P5-P12). The NKCC1 co-transporter antagonist bumetanide strongly reduces

GABA signaling. Thus, a strong GABA excitatory drive coupled with high intrinsic

excitability of L5/6 pyramidal neurons and interneurons provide a powerful mechanism of

synapse-driven oscillatory activity in the rodent neocortex in vitro. In the accompanying

paper, we show that the excitatory GABA drives layer-specific seizures in the immature

neocortex.

It can be seen in Fig. 3 that there is a large scatter of
predicted CEs and that this scatter yields values that can
either underestimate or overestimate the true CE. A linear
regression line through the data points indicates that in
general the predictor tends to be biased high for CEs less
than 0·07 and biased low for values above that. The slope of
the regression line is about 0·4 while the correlation coefficient, r, is 0·481. Most of the estimated CEs are less than the

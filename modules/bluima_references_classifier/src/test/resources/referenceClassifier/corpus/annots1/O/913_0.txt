Figure 6. Gene expression changes in the cortex and habenula with fear
conditioning. A, Pseudocolor images of in situ hybridization with the
genes indicated in the associative somatosensory (S2), parietal, perirhinal,
and insular cortices as outlined in Figure 3A by the blue box. The color
palette is the same as in Figure 3B, with black showing no signal, blue
showing the least mRNA expression, and yellow to white showing the most
mRNA expression. Sections are shown after in situ hybridization with the
indicated genes for the context (ctxt) and unpaired controls and at 30 min
and 2, 4, and 8 hr time points after odor-shock pairing. B, Pseudocolor
images as in A from the habenula as outlined in Figure 3A by the green
box. C, Pseudocolor images as in A from the caudate (act) or hippocampus
(nurr) showing that -actinin and nurr-1 do not show significant changes
in these regions after fear conditioning.

test for significance of the peaks and troughs in the unit crosscorrelograms, a nonparametric significance test, based on jittering of
spike trains, was used (Fujisawa et al., 2008). In short, the referred pointprocess dataset was jittered ([ 5, 5] ms interval) to produce 1000
surrogate cross-correlograms from which the exact p value for each time
bin was computed over the [ 30, 30] ms interval. For each crosscorrelogram, global bands at an acceptance level 99% were created from
the maximum and minimum of each jitter surrogate cross-correlogram
across the interval [ 30, 30] ms. Time bins with p 0.01 were considered significant for short latency peaks (or troughs; 1–5 ms) in the
original cross-correlogram when at least one bin was atypical with re-spect to the upper (or lower) global band. The significant bin effects were
considered to be attributable to excitation or inhibition of the reference
unit by the referred unit (Fujisawa et al., 2008). For cell pairs recorded
from the same shank, the 0 –1 ms bin was not considered because our
clustering program cannot resolve superimposed spikes. The cluster
properties of the neuron pairs, designated as monosynaptically connected by the statistical analysis, were visually inspected, and spurious
cell pairs attributable to potential clustering errors were excluded from
additional analysis. Using this method, 456 of the 1100 recorded units
were classified as excitatory or inhibitory neurons (see Fig. 8). Only this
physiologically defined subgroup was included for quantitative analyses.
Layer assignment of the neurons was determined from the approximate
location of their somata relative to the recordings sites (with the largestamplitude unit corresponding to the putative location of the soma), the
known distances between the recording sites, and the histological reconstruction of the recording electrode tracks (see Fig. 4 A).
Recording sessions were divided into brain states of theta and slow
oscillation periods. LFP theta epochs were visually selected from the raw
traces, assisted by the ratios of the whitened power in the theta band (3– 6
Hz) and the power of the neighboring bands (1–3 and 7–14 Hz) of EC3
LFPs (see Fig. 4 D). Spectral analyses were performed using direct multitaper estimates (Mitra and Pesaran, 1999; Sirota et al., 2008). Typically,
window sizes of 2– 4 s and three to five tapers were used. The theta phase
of the EC3 LFP was determined from the LFP filtered in the theta band
(adjusted for the dominant theta frequency in each experiment, typically
2– 6 Hz). The instantaneous phase was computed as the angle of the
Hilbert transform, and the distribution of the phases in each session was
tested for uniformity before unit analysis. Using linear interpolation, a
value of phase was assigned to each action potential (units and intracellular spikes).
To establish the gamma-phase modulation of units, the gamma bursts
in EC3 during theta epochs were detected (Sirota et al., 2008) and the
instantaneous phase of gamma oscillation was estimated by Hilbert
transform of the 30 –90 Hz filtered signal. Only neurons with at least 50
spikes and a firing rate 0.5 Hz during the theta epochs were included for
the LFP unit analysis. The theta and gamma phase modulation of action
potentials was determined by Rayleigh circular statistics (Fisher, 1993);
p 0.05 was considered significant. Group comparison tests of circular
variables were performed using circular ANOVA.
Coherence between the intracellular membrane potential (V ) and
m

instantaneous LFP theta was computed using the EC3 LFP signal because
recordings from this layer were available in all experiments. For the analyses of V fluctuations, the intracellular action potentials (3 ms) were
m

removed and replaced by interpolated values. Spectral power of V was
m

computed, and the relative power coefficient (ratio of the peak power
and the SD across all frequencies) was used to characterize the strength of
the dominant frequency of theta oscillation.
The phase and power relationship between V and the LFP signal was
m

assessed by spectral methods (Isomura et al., 2006). For the assessment of
V power–LFP power relationship, the correlation coefficient between
m

normalized spectral power values of the respective signals (V and LFP)
m

at all pairs of frequencies was calculated (“comodugram”).
The magnitude of theta phase modulation of gamma power (30 –90
Hz) and of the high frequencies ( 200 Hz) was estimated by calculating
the power of the gamma/fast frequency band in short (50 –100 ms) overlapping windows at all the recording sites and correlating the power with
the instantaneous phase of theta, obtained from the Hilbert transformation of the filtered signal from EC3 (see Fig. 11 E).

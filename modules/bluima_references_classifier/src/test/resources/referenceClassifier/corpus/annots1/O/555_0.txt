and membrane fractions (lanes 17 and 18) but not in the cytoplasmic fraction (lanes 23 and 24), indicating that loss or de-crease of the p97/VCP ATPase activity did not inhibit cytoplasmic protein degradation where proteasomes are functional.
Then, how is p97/VCP involved in the protein degradation in
places other than the cytoplasm?
We performed immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-GFP
antibody (Fig. 6C). Membrane and cytosolic fractions of TV and
TmV cells were resolved by 1% TritonX-100 and clarified by
centrifugations. The resultant soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 6C) or a non-related
anti-FLAG antibody as a control (data not shown), and precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by an antiubiquitin antibody via Western blot analysis. The results
showed that p97(K524A)-GFP co-precipitated more polyubiq-

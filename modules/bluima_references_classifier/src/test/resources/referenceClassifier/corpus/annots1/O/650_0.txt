All animal experimentation was conducted in accordance with the Na-tional Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Preparation of acutely dissociated neurons. CA1 hippocampal pyramidal
neurons were acutely dissociated using modified procedures of Kay and
Wong (1986). Sprague–Dawley male and female rats from 2 to 4 weeks
old were decapitated via a guillotine. Hippocampi were removed from the
brain and quickly blocked and placed in cold PIPES-saline solution (in
mM): NaCl, 120; KCl, 5.0; CaCl2, 1.0; MgCl2, 1.0; D-glucose, 25; PIPES,
20; pH 7.4. The blocked tissue was cut on a vibratome (Oxford) at ;450
μm thick while bathed in 48C oxygenated PIPES-saline solution. The
slices were placed on a black surface and punches were made in the CA1
area with a capillary tube. The punches were incubated at room temperature (20 –228C) in PIPES-saline solution with 1.5 mg/ml protease (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The incubation medium was stirred slowly and
smoothly with 95% O2/5% CO2 blown at its surface. After 30 – 45 min of
enzymatic digestion, punches were rinsed three times in oxygenated
PIPES-saline and triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette for
mechanical dissociation. The cell suspension was then plated into the
central concave area of a slide containing the standard extracellular
solution (in mM): NaCl, 140; KCl, 3.0; CaCl2, 2.0; HEPES, 10; pH 7.3. All
chemicals were obtained from Sigma.
Whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings. Whole-cell recordings were performed under voltage-clamp mode according to standard techniques
(Hammil et al., 1981). Both conventional as well as perforated whole-cell,
patch-clamp recordings were used in isolated CA1 hippocampal neurons.
The dissociated neurons were ;30 – 40 μM in diameter and were visualized with a Nikon inverted phase-contrast microscope equipped with
Nomarski optics.
Whole-cell recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicated glass
with a Sutter Flaming-Brown electrode puller and fire-polished with a
CPM-2 coating/polishing microforge. The electrode resistance was typically 2–5 MV in bath solution. The standard internal solution for recording electrode consisted of the following (in mM): CsCl, 140; NaCl, 4.0;
EGTA, 10; HEPES, 10; CaCl2, 1. The internal solution was adjusted to
pH 7.3 with CsOH. For perforated whole-cell recording, the electrode
was first submerged in standard internal solution for 3–5 sec. A small
amount of solution would reach the tip by capillary action. Then additional standard internal solution containing 100 mg/ml nystatin was added
to the electrode by backfilling the electrode.
After formation of a gigaohm (>1 GV) seal, the membrane was
ruptured by a slight suction in the case of conventional whole-cell recording. In the case of the perforated whole-cell recording configuration,
however, series resistance and cell capacitance from a capacitive transient
current evoked by voltage pulses (-10 mV, 20 msec) were monitored
after obtaining a giga-seal. During the development of nystatin perforation, the amplitude of the capacitive transient increased and the time
constant of the transient decreased. Whole-cell currents evoked by 20 mV
voltage steps (from -80 to +80 mV) gradually became larger with time,
the series resistance decreased to a stable minimal value (<12 MV),
indicating the establishment of perforated patch recording. This usually
occurred within 15–25 min. The subsequent recordings were held for
more than 45 min. The holding potential was -60 mV in both configurations, except in the case of studying the current–voltage relations where
the holding potential was varied from -100 to + 50 mV. Access resistance was compensated (80%) electronically and monitored periodically.

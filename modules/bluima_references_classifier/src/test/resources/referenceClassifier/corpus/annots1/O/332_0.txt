FIG. 13. Rhythmic antidromic discharges in primary
afferents during treadmill locomotion. A: experimental
set-up. Two bipolar Ag/AgCl electrodes are used to
record activity in a cut dorsal root filament (such as in the
Ba and Bd below) during locomotion on a treadmill belt
in a decerebrate cat. The proximal electrode is labeled #1,
and the distal electrode is labeled #2, and in that configuration, there is no doubt that the unit fires antidromically since it is cut from the periphery. To the right of the
spinal cord is another configuration in which the filament
is dissected but not cut. In this case, the direction of
conduction is determined using a spike triggered averaging method. Spikes were labeled as antidromic when the
first negative deflection recorded on the distal electrode
(#2) occurred later than the one on the proximal electrode (#1). Spikes were labeled as orthodromic when the
pattern of direction was opposite. The EMG activity of
several hindlimb muscles can be recorded at the same
time during treadmill locomotion (two only are shown,
VL and St). B: antidromic activity of two fibers recorded
in proximal stumps of cut dorsal root filaments during
locomotion. The top records in a and d are raw signals
from two filaments (Unit), and they are superimposed on
the EMG activity of the ipsilateral Srt, St, VL, and GL. In
b and e, the discharges are rank-ordered in raster formats
and triggered on the onset of activity in Srt muscle: below
the rasters: 1, onset of the Srt activity burst; 2, the end of
this burst; 3, the onset of the next Srt burst. In c and f, the
discharge frequency is presented in histogram forms. 1
indicates the onset of activity in Srt. The discharge frequency of the unit shown in a– c reaches a peak after the
onset of activity in the flexor muscle Srt, i.e., during swing
phase of the step cycle, while the discharge frequency of
the unit shown in d–f increases at the end of the flexor
phase and reaches its peak during the time of activity in
the extensor muscles VL and GL, i.e., in the stance phase
of the step cycle. [From Beloozerova and Rossignol (36).]

Layer V pyramidal cells in rat barrel cortex are considered to
play an important role in intracolumnar and transcolumnar signal processing. However, the precise circuitry mediating this
processing is still incompletely understood. Here we obtained
detailed maps of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto
the two major layer V pyramidal cell subtypes, intrinsically burst
spiking (IB) and regular spiking (RS) cells, using a combination
of caged glutamate photolysis, whole-cell patch-clamp recording, and three-dimensional reconstruction of biocytin-labeled
cells. To excite presynaptic neurons with laminar specificity, the
release of caged glutamate was calibrated and restricted to
small areas of 50 × 50 μm in all cortical layers and in at least
two neighboring barrel-related columns. IB cells received intracolumnar excitatory input from all layers, with the largest EPSP
amplitudes originating from neurons in layers IV and VI. Prominent transcolumnar excitatory inputs were provided by presyn-

total volume of 50 nL per oocyte. Before electrophysiological
recording, oocytes were incubated at 18 °C under gentle shaking on
a rotating platform for 2–4 days in defined nutrient oocyte medium
(Eppig & Dumont, 1976). Macroscopic current recordings were
performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) using the two-electrode
voltage-clamp technique with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon
Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). Oocytes were placed in a 200mL recording chamber and bathed with a solution containing (in mM):
Ba(OH)2, 40; NaOH, 50; KCl, 2; and HEPES, 5; (titrated to pH 7.4
with methanesulphonic acid). The endogenous oocyte Ca2+-activated
Cl– current was blocked by the inclusion of 0.5 mM niflumic acid in
the recording solution. Pipettes of typical resistance of » 0.5 MW
were filled with 3 M KCl. Acquisition and data analysis were
performed using pCLAMP (v6.03) software (Axon Instruments).
Leak currents and capacitive transients were subtracted on-line using
a P/4 protocol. Currents were acquired at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz.
Voltage steps were applied every 10–30 s depending on the duration
of the step, from various holding potentials. Current–voltage (I–V)
and steady-state inactivation relationships and activation and
inactivation rates were measured. Fits of I–V curves were obtained
assuming a Boltzmann-type activation curve: IBa = [g(Vt – E)]/
{1 + exp[(V1/2 – Vt)/k} where Vt represents the test potential, g the
maximum conductance, E the apparent reversal potential, V1/2 the
potential of half-activation and k the range of potential responsible for
an e-fold change around V1/2. The steady-state inactivation curves
were also described by a Boltzmann-type equation:
IBa = [1 + exp(V – V1/2)/k]–1 where the current amplitude IBa has
decreased to a half-amplitude at V1/2 with an e-fold change over
k mV. For current density estimation, membrane capacitance was
determined by integrating the currents obtained from a 10-mV step
depolarization from –90 mV and for 18 ms.

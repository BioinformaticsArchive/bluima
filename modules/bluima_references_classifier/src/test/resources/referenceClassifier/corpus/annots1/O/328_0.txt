type mice.41 Recent characterization of plasticity following SCI in three lines of mice lacking one or more Nogo
molecules has been similarly perplexing. While corticospinal axon sprouting following spinal hemisection
was evident and apparently robust in some mice,42,43
almost no augmentation of regeneration or sprouting
was seen in others.44 Immunizing mice with MAG-plusNogoA enhances regeneration and/or sprouting of
corticospinal axons following spinal hemisection; however, myelin immunization has a greater overall effect
than MAG/NogoA immunization.45,46 Manipulations
of OMgp have yet to be carried out, but one might
hypothesize that, like the focused targeting of MAG or
Nogo alone, specifically reducing OMgp activity would
have less effect on axonal regeneration than targeting
multiple myelin-derived inhibitors.
Fortuitously, recent data indicate that this trio of
myelin-derived inhibitors – NogoA, MAG and OMgp –
signal through a common receptor (the Nogo receptor,
NgR).47–50 As an apparent point of convergence in
inhibitory signaling, NgR has taken the stage as a target
of strategies aimed at increasing plasticity in the injured
spinal cord. A competitive antagonist of NgR, NEP1-40, blocks the inhibitory action of myelin in vitro51 and
enhances both growth of supraspinal axons and functional recovery when administered intrathecally or
systemically after thoracic hemisection.51,52 Another
antagonist, NgREcto, is a soluble, truncated form of
NgR, which has been shown to alleviate inhibition of
both Nogo and myelin in vitro (Fournier et al, 2002).
Recent work from our group examines the effects of
NgR activity using a different form of soluble NgR
in vivo;53 in these experiments, we found that NgR
antagonism augmented rhizotomy-induced sprouting of
both descending monoaminergic axons and peptidgeric
primary afferents in the cervical dorsal horn. The
discovery of an anti-NgR monoclonal antibody, capable
of inhibiting binding of Nogo, MAG, and OMgp, and
of blocking inhibition of myelin in vitro, has now been
reported.54
Downstream of NgR are several other molecules that
might also serve as targets for intervention after SCI.
The Nogo receptor is thought to transmit myelininhibitory signaling through its interaction with the
low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75.55,56 Recently,
LINGO-1, a neural transmembrane protein, has been
revealed as an essential component of the functional
NgR/p75 complex.57 Ligand-bound NgR associates
with p75 and LINGO-1 to activate the GTPase RhoA,
which transduces myelin-derived inhibition to the
cytoskeleton.58–60 Since p75 binds neurotrophins, its
contribution to axonal growth is complex (see below),
whereas the activation of RhoA leads to the recruitment
of Rho kinase and subsequent remodeling of the actin
cytoskeleton to inhibit regeneration. Targeting the Rho
pathway with the bacterial enzyme C3 transferase or
with specific inhibitors of Rho kinase has led to reports
of both corticospinal regeneration and functional
recovery after rat SCI.61,62 Interestingly, it seems that
astrocyte or meningeal cell-derived ECM molecules may

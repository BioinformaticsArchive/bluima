Immunoperoxidase Staining for MAP2 and PV
Sections were incubated for 1 h with PBS-TG at room temperature and
then 40–48 h at 4°C with PBS-TG containing anti-MAP2 monoclonal
mouse antibody (1:8000; Chemicon; Temecula, CA) or anti-PV monoclonal mouse antibody (1:50 000; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland).
After rinsing, the sections were placed in PBS-TG containing biotinylated anti-mouse IgG polyclonal goat antibody (1:200; Vector,
Burlingame, CA) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was
visualized by ABC incubation (one drop of reagents per 7 ml 0.1 M PB;
ABC Elite kits; Vector, Burlingame, CA) followed by diaminobenzidine
histochemistry with 0.03% nickel ammonium sulfate. In three of six
animals, MAP2 immunohistochemistry showed clear dendritic aggregation in layers 1 and 2 with very low interbundle background staining.
In one monkey, dendritic clusters were detectable in layers 1 and 2,
but the interbundle spaces also had background-like staining. The
remaining two animals had weaker MAP2 staining in layers 1 and 2.
In order to visualize PV-ir neurons together with Nissl-stained
neurons, we reacted some tissue by double fluorescent labeling for PV
and Nissl substrate. Sections were immunoblocked with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and
5% normal goat serum (PBS-TG) for 1 h at room temperature and
subsequently incubated 40–48 h at 4°C in PBS-TG containing anti-PV
monoclonal mouse antibody (1:5000; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland).
After rinsing, the sections were placed in PBS-TG containing Alexa
Fluor 594 conjugated anti-mouse IgG polyclonal goat antibody (1:200;
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and NeuroTrace 500/525 green fluorescent Nissl stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the
company's protocol for 1.5 h. Immunofluorescence for PV was
ordinarily much weaker in our hands than the immunoperoxidase
technique (however, see Fig. 5C).

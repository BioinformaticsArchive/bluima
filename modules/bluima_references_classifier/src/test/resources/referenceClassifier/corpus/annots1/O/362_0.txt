To minimize subjective errors and optimize throughput, we
have developed semi-automated tools for reconstruction
and analysis of neuronal geometry from CLSM and
MPLSM images (Rodriguez et al., 2003a). These techniques include noise filtering and deconvolution (Autodeblur, Autoquant Imaging, Troy, NY, USA), volume integration, automatic stack alignment and registration of adjacent
tiles (Volume Integration and Alignment System (VIAS)
system), surfacing and memory optimization for interactive
visualization (Rodriguez et al., 2003a) and digitization in
standard neuroanatomical formats.
Our VIAS software (http://www.mssm.edu/cnic/tools.
html), integrates multiple stacks of tiled optical sections
obtained from CLSM into a single volumetric dataset. VIAS
uses projected volumes and hardware accelerated drawing to provide real-time interaction with the data. An au-toalign tool corrects any small misalignments in the initial
registration of adjacent images, ensuring that the tiling is
accurately reassembled before the volume is integrated.

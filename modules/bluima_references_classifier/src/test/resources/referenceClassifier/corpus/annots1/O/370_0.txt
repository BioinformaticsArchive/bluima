Kiehn, 2003). The firing patterns of the dCINs were not homogeneous during NMDA and serotonin (5-HT)-induced
locomotor-like activity, ranging from highly rhythmic bursting
to dCINs that remained silent and did not participate in the mo-tor pattern (Butt et al., 2002). However, in these previous studies,
the “dCIN” pool analyzed included an unknown number of
adCINs, and thus it is not yet clear whether these two anatomically distinct CIN populations have different roles in fictive
locomotion.
In this study, we used the neonatal mouse spinal cord to characterize the cellular firing properties of identified dCINs and
adCINs during fictive locomotion evoked by the application of
NMDA and 5-HT (Cazalets et al., 1992, 1995; Kjaerulff and Kiehn
1996; Branchereau et al., 2000). CINs were monitored with
whole-cell patch recordings from the L2 spinal segment, and their
activity correlated to rhythmic flexor motor activity measured by
extracellular recordings from the L2 ventral roots. 5-HT is
thought to play an important role to organize the locomotor
network for rhythmic activity (MacLean et al., 1998; Madriaga et
al., 2004; Christie and Whelan, 2005; Liu and Jordan, 2005; Pearlstein et al., 2005), so we also studied the modulatory effects of
5-HT on the intrinsic membrane properties of dCINs and
adCINs that were pharmacologically isolated from most fast synaptic inputs. Our results indicate that, in the mouse, a majority of
dCINs fire rhythmically, whereas none of the adCINs show
rhythmicity during fictive locomotion. Furthermore, 5-HT de-

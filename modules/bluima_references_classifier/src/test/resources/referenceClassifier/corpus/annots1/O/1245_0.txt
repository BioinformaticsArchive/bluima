The goal was to understand if differences in the synaptic
physiology at successive stages of cortical processing could
contribute to the analysis of sensory inputs. Thus, we
compared visually evoked synaptic responses from the
first and second stations of the striate cortical microcircuit.
At the first cortical stage, layer 4, cells were able to capture

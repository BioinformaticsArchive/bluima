tially concentrated in the perinuclear region of the Alix-V5
transfectants (Fig. 6B). In contrast, in the co-transfected cells,
Alix-V5 was distributed in the perinuclear region (Fig. 6E), and
most of the Alix was co-localized with CHMP4b (Fig. 6, D and
F). A similar effect was observed using the pAlix C-V5 construct (data not shown).
Formation of Vesicle-like Structuresâ€”As shown in Fig. 7A,
unlike obvious punctate patterns of localization of FLAGCHMP4b in transiently overexpressed HeLa cells (Fig. 4) and

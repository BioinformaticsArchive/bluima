MAP kinase and CREB pathways leading to activation of
CRE-mediated transcription. Conversely, in glioma cells,
17 -estradiol did not increase the phosphorylation of
p42/44 MAP kinase or CREB, but instead activated signaling pathways leading to inhibition of CRE-mediated transcription. Furthermore, this attenuation of non-classical
transcription was specific to glioma cells that express ER ,
but not those that express ER . The various signaling
pathways activated by estradiol impact the cell's ability to
respond to different stimuli at a molecular level. This is
exemplified in the effects of estradiol on the PKA and MAP
kinase pathways in neuronal cell cultures. Estradiol activated PKA in SK-N-SH cells inducing neuropeptide ex-pression, whereas the treatment stimulated p42/44 MAP
kinase in HTER and HTER cells protecting them against
both -amyloid and glutamate toxicity.
Although activation of these membrane-initiated events is
independent of ERE-mediated transcription, there is “crosstalk” between the rapid signaling pathways and genomic
effects of estradiol (Shao and Lazar, 1999). ER has been
shown to be phosphorylated by a number of kinase pathways including MAP kinase, cAMP/PKA and PI3K/Akt,
which are activated by estradiol treatment along with other
stimulants (Arnold et al., 1995; Cui et al., 2004; Kato et al.,
1995; Sun et al., 2001). Phosphorylation at these sites
modulates the transcriptional activity of the ER at classical
ERE sites (Ali et al., 1993; Arnold et al., 1995; Bunone et
al., 1996; Le Goff et al., 1994), thereby allowing multiple
signaling pathways to converge and influence the functional activity of estradiol and may further complicate the
hormone's effects in various cell-types throughout the
brain.
Understanding the mechanism by which membraneinitiated signaling pathways interact with and modulate
transcriptional events may lead to the development of
more clinically beneficial treatments for post-menopausal
women. We surmise that the activation of these rapid
signaling pathways is integral to the protective and trophic
effects of estrogens in the pre-menopausal brain. Furthermore, the decline in circulating estrogen levels during
menopause may exacerbate the effects of aging leaving
the brain more vulnerable to the development of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Therefore,
understanding how estradiol can activate various signaling pathways such as Akt, MAP kinase and PKA in both
in vitro and in vivo models will enable the molecular,
pharmacologic and functional characterization which
may ultimately impact the development of therapeutics
for numerous conditions including menopause, stroke
and Alzheimer's disease.

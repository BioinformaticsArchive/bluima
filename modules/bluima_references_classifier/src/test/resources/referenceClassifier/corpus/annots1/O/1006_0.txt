Chameau et al., 2009). Since the expression
of the 5-HT3AR may be dynamic, we set out
to investigate whether the cells expressing
5-HT3AR embryonically are the same cells
expressing it in the adult. To this end, we
used two different genetic fate-mapping
strategies (Xu et al., 2008; Miyoshi et al.,
2010) to investigate from which zone the
cortical EGFP-labeled cells were derived.
Using the Nkx2.1-BACCre mouse together
with the red R26RtdRFP reporter mouse
(Luche et al., 2007), we labeled cells originating from the MGE. When these mice
were crossed onto the 5HT3aR-BACEGFP
mice, we saw no overlap between EGFP and
tandem-dimer red fluorescent protein
(tdRFP) expression, indicating that the
5-HT3AR-expressing cells in mature cortex
are not derived from the MGE (Fig. 3E,
quantified in G). We have recently shown
that one can efficiently label cells derived
from the CGE using a Mash1-BACCreER
mouse to direct the tamoxifen-induced crerecombination of a reporter line (Miyoshi et
al., 2010). We used the Mash1-BACCreER
mouse together with the R26RtdRFP reporter
to confirm that 5-HT3AR-expressing neurons originate from the CGE. Although
neuronal labeling was most prominent, we
observed some tdRFP expression within oligodendrocytes. The immunohistochemical
marker CC1 was used to exclude these cells
from the analysis (Bhat et al., 1996). We ob-served a 91 1% overlap between interneurons derived from a tamoxifen-induced
E16.5 labeling of the Mash1-BACCreER;
R26RtdRFP and the 5HT3aR-BACEGFPdriven EGFP expression, showing that
5-HT3A-expressing cells are derived from
the CGE and not from the MGE (Fig. 3F,
quantified in H ). This was also true at earlier
gavage points (data not shown).

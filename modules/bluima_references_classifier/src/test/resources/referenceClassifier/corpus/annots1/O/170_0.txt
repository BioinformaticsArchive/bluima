action potential initiation. The transient
fluorescence represents the response of
OGB1 to the transient increase in [Ca 2 ]i
that occurs throughout the cellular process under investigation (e.g., AIS or presynaptic bouton) in response to a single
action potential (averaged over 0 to 50 –75
ms after the spike). It should be noted that
this general increase in [Ca 2 ]i within the
process under examination in response to
an action potential is less than that occurring in local domains close to the Ca 2
channels activated by the spike and that its
time course is slowed considerably by the
properties of the dye (Yasuda et al., 2004).
The frequency of our data collection also

constants.

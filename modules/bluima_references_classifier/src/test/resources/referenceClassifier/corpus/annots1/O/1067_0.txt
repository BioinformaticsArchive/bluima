highly nonuniform subcellular distribution of Ih in these neurons
(Fig. 1 B). Three examples of variance-mean plots obtained from
recordings 270, 400, and 740 m from the soma are shown in
Figure 4 A. Figure 4 B shows that, when Po is plotted as a function
of recording location, for distances from 120 to 900 m from
the soma, no clear dependence exists on dendritic site. Similarly,
the Ih single-channel conductance, , was independent of the
dendritic recording location (Fig. 4C). Plotting as a histogram
indicates that represents a single population with average am-plitude of 676 35 fS (Fig. 4C, inset) (n 18). In contrast, N was
found to rise steeply with distance from the soma (Fig. 4 D). An
exponential fit to this data indicates that N increases e-fold for a
240 m path length along the main apical dendrite of layer 5
pyramidal neurons, similar to the e-fold change in current density (Fig. 1 B). At the most distal dendritic locations examined
(900 m from the soma), we observed as many as 2500 Ih
channels per dendritic patch, whereas at the most proximal sites
(120 m from the soma), as few as 40 channels per patch were
observed. This gradient is essentially identical to the reported
60-fold increase in immunogold-labeled HCN1 particles in layer
5 dendritic membrane (Lorincz et al., 2002). These data correspond to Ih channel densities of 9 â€“550/ m 2, assuming a membrane patch area of 4.5 m 2 (Engel and Jonas, 2005). The high

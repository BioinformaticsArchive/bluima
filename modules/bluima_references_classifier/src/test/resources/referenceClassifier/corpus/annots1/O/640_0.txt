MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture. L6 rat myoblasts (a gift from J. Lawrence,
Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.) were grown to confluence (150-mm plate) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) containing 10% calf serum, 50 U of penicillin per ml,
and 50 jig of streptomycin sulfate per ml. The differentiation of
L6 myoblasts was initiated by replacing the calf serum from the
above medium with 5% fetal horse serum. The composition of
the medium was kept the same until the end of the differentiation program, with medium changes every 2 to 3 days.
Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes
as described previously (14). Briefly, fibroblasts were grown to
confluence (150-mm plate) in DMEM containing 10% calf
serum, penicillin (50 U/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50
pLg/ml). Differentiation was induced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 U/ml),
streptomycin sulfate (50 p.g/ml), insulin (5 ,ug/ml), 0.25 FxM
dexamethasone, and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. On
the second day, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing all but the last two of the above components. Thereafter, the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and the antibiotics, with medium changes every
2 to 3 days. COS-7 cells were grown (100-mm plate) in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum and the above antibiotics.
rGDI cloning. The coding region of rat GDI (rGDI) was
cloned by PCR from single-stranded cDNA from rat brain.
PCR was performed with oligonucleotides with the sequences
CTGACCATGGACGAGGA(A,G)TA(C,T)A and CGCG
GATCCTACTGGTCAGCTTCCCC(G,A)AA(G,A,C)AC
(parentheses indicate redundant positions) as described before
(39). The PCR product was cloned into mammalian and
bacterial expression vectors by using the flanking restriction
sites engineered into the oligonucleotides used for the PCRs.
The cDNA insert was fully sequenced after subcloning into
M13 vectors by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination
method (28) with fluorescently labeled primers and Taq DNA
polymerase; sequencing reaction mixes were analyzed on an
ABI 370A DNA sequencer.
Screening of the mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. A
mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library constructed in the X gtlO
bacteriophage vector (Clontech Laboratories) was screened
with the full-length rat brain cDNA for GDI described above.
The procedure was essentially that of Strauss (35). A total of
800,000 PFU were plated on the C600 Hfl strain of Escherichia
coli as the host (Clontech). The plaques were transferred onto
nitrocellulose filters (Millipore), alkali denatured, and fixed for
2 h at 80Â°C in a vacuum oven. The cDNA probe was 32p
labeled by random priming (10). The filters were hybridized in
6x SSC (1 x SSC is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium

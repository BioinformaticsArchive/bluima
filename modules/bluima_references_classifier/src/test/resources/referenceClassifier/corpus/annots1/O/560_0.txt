Western blot analysis of SRC-1 and CBP

Animals were sacrificed by decapitation and hypothalamic brain tissue was
excised, placed in chilled microfuge tubes, snap frozen on dry ice and stored
at )80 C. Tissue was homogenised in TEDG (consisting of 10 mM Tris-base,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol 400 mM NaCl, pH = 7.4) and
protease inhibitors (1 lg / ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) using a
Teflon homogeniser. After tissue homogenisation, samples were centrifuged
at 12 000 g for 30 min at 4 C to sediment the cellular debris. The supernatant fraction was collected, and the protein concentration was determined
by Bradford assay. Eighty lg of total protein from each tissue sample was
gel electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1% SDS and
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA,
USA). Samples were analysed by Western blot as described previously (71)
for detection of SRC-1. Briefly, SRC-1 from brain was probed for using a

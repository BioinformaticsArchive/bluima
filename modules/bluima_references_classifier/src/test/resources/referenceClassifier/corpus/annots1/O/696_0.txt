sexdifferences were detected (Fig. 2, C and D). The staining
intensity of SRIF-IR neurones throughout the brain sections
was increased by colchicine treatment.
Single staining for the estrogen receptor showed a large
population of IR cellsin the MPOA (Fig. 1A). At the level of
the anterior hypothalamus, estrogen receptor-IR cells were

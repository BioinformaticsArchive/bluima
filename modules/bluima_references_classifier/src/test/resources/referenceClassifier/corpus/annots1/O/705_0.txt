explained by the fact that the BioLexicon contains
vocabulary from areas that are not specifically targeted
by the SPECIALIST lexicon, e.g., molecular biology. It
is only in the category of verbs that the SPECIALIST
lexicon covers most of the entries present in the BioLexicon. However, as explained in the Methods section,
the BioLexicon provides more detailed and domainspecific information about the syntactic properties of
verbs than is provided in the SPECIALIST lexicon.
The BioLexicon also deals with semantic aspects of
verb behaviour, which are absent from the SPECIALIST lexicon.
Many of the derivational forms covered by the BioLexicon are also missing from the other resources. In this
respect, WordNet has a higher coverage than the SPECIALIST lexicon, due to its emphasis on providing systematic links between words. So, for example, the
derivation retroregulate -> retroregulation is present in
WordNet, as well as the BioLexicon. However, since the
coverage of domain-specific words in WordNet is not
extensive, it is not possible for the coverage of biologyspecific derivations to be very high. In the SPECIALIST
lexicon, it appears that derivations are not dealt with in
a similarly systematic way. Although some nominalizations of verbs are present, the opposite is not always
true. For example, the nominalization retro-regulator is
present in the SPECIALIST lexicon, but the verb retroregulate is not included.

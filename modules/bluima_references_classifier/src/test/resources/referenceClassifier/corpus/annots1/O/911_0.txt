A possible functional role of CR cells
In this study we demonstrate that CR cells receive dense
GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input and in turn provide
synaptic output preferentially to pyramidal neurons of the underlying cortical layers, thereby constituting an integrative element
of an early cortical network. The total population of CR cells
provides a dense axonal network that establishes synaptic contacts over a wide range of cortical surface. Thus it appears
plausible that synaptic input from CR cells is required to anchor
the apical dendrites of their postsynaptic target cells in layer 1, as
hypothesized by Mar ́ın-Padilla (1998). The interaction between

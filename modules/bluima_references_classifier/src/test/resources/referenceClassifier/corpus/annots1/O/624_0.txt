Figure 7. Cerebral cortex immunocytochemistry with 62-3Gl (A), anti-GAD (B), anti-GABA (C), and the mAb 8-6A2 (0). Notice that the
GABAR, GAD, and GABA immunoreactivities are distributed through all layers. The mAb S-6A2 was used as a marker for neurons and for the
identification of the pyramidal cells (De Blas et al., 1984). The fixative was 4% paraformaldehyde/O. 1% glutaraldehyde. Sagittal sections.

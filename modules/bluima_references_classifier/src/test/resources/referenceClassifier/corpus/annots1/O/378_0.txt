Figure 1 Localization of endogenous VCP in cells harboring protein aggregates. Protein aggregates were induced by the treatment of
0.5 μM MG132, 0.1 μM PSI or polyglutamine expression for 2 days in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells. (A) Cells were fixed in ice
cold EtOH, and were then processed for immunofluorescence staining.VCP and ubiquitin were visualized via fluorescent microscopy
with FITC (green signals)- and Texas Red (red signals)-conjugated second antibodies, respectively. White arrows indicate positions of
aggregates. (B, C) VCP-GFP was expressed (time 0) in cells harboring pre-formed protein aggregates, and the cells were analyzed by
fluorescent microscopy. Representative photos of cells 24, 48, 60 and 96 h after the expression of VCP-GFP are presented in (B).
Alternatively, GFP signals were traced by time-lapse fluorescent microscopy for 3 days in a single cell (C). See also Supplementary Movie S1.

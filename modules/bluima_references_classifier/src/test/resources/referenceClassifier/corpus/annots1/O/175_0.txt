of image pixels had near-perpendicular in-tersection angles (61–90°) than nearparallel intersections (1–30°) between orientation and spatial frequency gradients
[normal ferrets, p 0.05 (Fig. 5K, *); monocular ferrets, p 0.01 (Fig. 5K, ); t test,
one-tailed]. In normal ferrets, there was a
positive slope between the intersection an-gle and the proportion of pixels with that
angle (r 0.87, slope of 0.27%/group) (Fig.
5J, red line), indicating a preponderance of
near-orthogonal intersection angles. This
positive slope was also present in monocular ferrets (r 0.97, slope of 0.29%/
group) (Fig. 5J, blue line). However, the
results do not indicate a difference, be-tween normal and monocular ferrets, in
the distribution of intersection angles. It
is possible that the noise associated with
experimental measurements may obscure the
slight difference predicted by the model (Fig.
1T ). [We showed in a previous study that, in
normal ferrets, the tendency for orthogonal
crossings between orientation and spatial frequency gradients is most pronounced in
those regions of the cortex in which high gradient magnitude regions of these two maps
coincide (Yu et al., 2005). This tendency also
holds for monocular ferrets (supplemental
Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material).]
Together, the differences between normal and monocular ferrets in the structures
of the orientation and spatial frequency
maps are similar to the differences predicted between four- and three-feature
simulations (Fig. 1). Thus, removing a map
experimentally produces similar effects as
mapping one less feature with a dimensionreduction model. Specifically, the wavelength of the orientation map is higher in
monocular animals, leading to a decrease in
the mean orientation gradient in V1. The
decrease in the orientation gradient occurs
preferentially in the high gradient regions

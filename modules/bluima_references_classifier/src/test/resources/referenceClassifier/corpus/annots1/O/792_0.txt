Synaptic Properties
Whole-cell recordings typically result in low-noise recordings. The root
mean square (r.m.s.) of the noise was measured 30–60 ms prior to the
onset of the evoked postsynaptic potentials/currents (PSP/PSCs) of
connected cells. Failures were defined as events in which the amplitude
was less than the r.m.s. The latency of PSP/PSC onset was defined as
the time from the peak of the A P to 10% of the PSP/PSC amplitude.
This measure therefore includes axonal, synaptic and dendritic delays.
PSP/PSC amplitudes were determined by averaging 3–5 points around the
peak (not corrected for the CV of noise). Series resistance and whole-cell
capacitance of voltage clamp recordings were in most cases (>80%)
compensated by >85%. R ise times of currents (RT) were measured as time
to rise from 20 to 80% peak amplitude (30–50 sweeps excluding failures).
Decay time constants (DTC) of PSCs were estimated as single exponentials because of multiple distributed release sites. Chord conductances
(G1) were determined as the slope of the line fit through amplitudes of
first responses and intersection at the reversal potential (negligible
rectification detected). Maximal conductances (Gmax) were calculated as
G1/Use (utilization of synaptic efficacy, equivalent to probability of
release). Charge was determined by integrating the mean unitary
inhibitory PSC (30–50 waves) excluding failures. Quantification of the
physiological properties of unitary excitatory PSCs was not performed
due to variable degrees of synaptic rundown (Rozov et al., 1998).
Parameters of synaptic connections (Ase, absolute synaptic efficacy; Use;
F and D, time constants for recovery from facilitation and depression,
respectively) were derived by fitting averaged synaptic responses (30–60
trials) to at least two different frequencies of presynaptic stimulation to
the model of dynamic synaptic transmission as detailed previously
(Markram et al., 1998).

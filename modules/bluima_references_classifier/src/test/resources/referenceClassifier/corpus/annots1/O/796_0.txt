mistic concept that NO is essential for LTP
development in the hippocampus4,5 or for
LTD development in the cerebellum6. The
article goes on to describe subsequent
reports that indicate that NO-dependent
and -independent processes exist7,8. As
Cr√©pel points out, a lot of evidence for the
role of NO in LTD development in the
cerebellum has accumulated since 1992 and
I should have mentioned this in the article.

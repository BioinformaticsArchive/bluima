on a wider range of social systems. Finally, to
understand the evolutionary significance of
network dynamics, we must explicitly measure their fitness effects on the social group
(7 ). This interplay between network dynamics and selection is just beginning to be ex-plored, and social insects have the potential
to be on the leading edge.

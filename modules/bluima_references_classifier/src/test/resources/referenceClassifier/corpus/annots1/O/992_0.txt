Figure 5. MFs are monosynaptically connected to SLCs in CA3. A, Dendritic (gray) and axonal (black) arborizations, firing pattern, the
spiny dendritic surface, and immunoreactivities of a representative SLC that received monosynaptic MF inputs. Note that the SLC dendrites
aligned with the stratum lucidum. Asterisk marks the severed main (presumably long distance-projecting) axon of the SLC on the surface
of the slice. Circle graph indicates the relative proportion of the SLCs (shaded black in the circle graph) that received monosynaptic input
from MFs of the 46 MFâ€“SLC pairs (BIO, biocytin; ori, stratum oriens; pyr, stratum pyramidale; luc, stratum lucidum) (calibration for the firing
pattern: 20 mV, 200 ms). B, Top (gray), Average action potential trace from a MF that was monosynaptically connected to a SLC. Middle
traces (black), Representative single traces from three SLCs that received monosynaptic inputs from MFs. Bottom (black), Average MF-evoked responses from all SLCs that received monosynaptic MF inputs (see C) (the average of the average responses from all 15 connected

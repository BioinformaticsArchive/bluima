returning almost to their baseline amplitudes (n = 4, not
shown).
In further experiments to confirm the identity of the
currents and receptor types involved, agonists were applied
at relatively high concentrations by puffer pipette. To show
that the modulated current was carried by Ca2' (or was at
leastCa2+andvoltagedependent),Cd2+wasappliedbefore
and during glutamate-induced suppression of the current
(Fig. 2A, n = 3, no CNQX or APV was present). The
currents evoked by the depolarizing commands were totally
abolished by Cd2' in both conditions, thus excluding contamination by outward currents and showing that glutamate reduces the inward Ca2+ current.
Quisqualate and glutamate were similarly effective when
tested in the same cells (Fig. 2 B, n = 2). In these conditions, with CNQX and APV absent, glutamate and quisqualate also produced a small (~30 PA) inward shift in the
baseline holding current that is not evident in these plots.
This steady inward current was probably carried by iono-

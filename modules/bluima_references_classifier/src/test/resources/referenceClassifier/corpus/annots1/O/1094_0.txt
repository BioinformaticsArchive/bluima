These interneurons and those in layer 5 whose axons ramify
extensively in layers 5 and 3 could act to coordinate activity in
these two layers, relatively independently of layer 4.
The axons and dendrites of some of the layer 4 interneurons
studied here were also largely confined to their layer of origin.
However, 10 of 27 layer 4 interneurons recovered had axons and
dendrites that extended into layer 3. These ascending projections ranged from single axonal and dendritic branches to
very wide axonal arbours involving many collaterals that innervated both layers. Some of the interneurons, situated in middle
to upper layer 4, that demonstrably inhibited layer 3 cells also
received excitatory input from layer 3. They differ significantly
from layer 3 interneurons, however, in that the majority of their
dendrites are located in a major thalamo-recipient layer. They are
well positioned, therefore, to integrate the inputs they receive
from layer 4 and layer 3 excitator y cells with direct thalamic
input, particularly those that are par valbumin immuno-positive,
par valbumin-containing interneurons being a major thalamorecipient class of interneurons in layer 4 (Staiger et al., 1996).
Indeed, the four layer 4 interneurons inner vating both layers
and excited by layer 3 pyramidal cells that were so tested were
all found to be par valbumin immuno-positive. The large CCK
immuno-negative basket cell with a fast, late spiking, stuttering
firing pattern may also have been par valbumin-containing. By
generating IPSPs in cell populations in both layers, these cells
could synchronize activity and/or provide a temporal framework
within which efficient and meaningful information transfer
between the layers could occur.
The long, myelinated, horizontal axon collaterals of some of
the larger, upper layer 4 interneurons generated well-separated,
tightly focused clusters of boutons hundreds of micrometres
from the soma. Some of these may be similar to the large basket
cells described previously (Somogyi et al., 1983; Kisvárday,
1992), which are reported to be densely interconnected
(Kisvárday et al., 1993). Interestingly, the only layer 3 interneuron (of nine tested) in the cat to receive excitator y input
from layer 4 had similar long, myelinated, horizontal axon
collaterals. These long collaterals could therefore provide patchy
inhibition (Kisvárday and Eysel, 1992) that was controlled by
correlated activity in layers 3 and 4 and direct thalamo-cortical
input. No equivalently long, patchy horizontal interneuronal
projections were found in the rat in this study, but one such layer
4 cell was reported previously (Thomson et al., 1996).

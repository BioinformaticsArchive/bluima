Figure 1. Enlargement of PF terminals and proximal expansion of PF territory in PC-Ca 2.1 KO mice. A–D, Immunofluorescence for calbindin (calb) in control (A, B) and PC-Ca 2.1 KO mice (C, D).

Arrows in D indicate spine-like protrusions from PC soma. The lobule number is indicated by numerals 1–10. E–H, Electron micrographs showing shaft dendrites of PCs (PCD; E, G) and neuropil
regions (F, H ) in control (E, F ) and PC-Ca 2.1 KO (G, H ) mice. Arrows in G indicate ectopic spines from shaft dendrites. Asterisks in F and H indicate PC spines in contact with putative PF terminals.

Arrowheads indicate PC spines thoroughly surrounded by enlarged PF terminals. I, J, Immunofluorescence for VGluT1 in control (I ) and PC-Ca 2.1 KO (J ) mice. Scale bars: A, 500 m; B, inset in I,

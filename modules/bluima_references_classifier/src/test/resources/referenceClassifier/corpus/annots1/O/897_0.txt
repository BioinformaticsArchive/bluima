Carlos and O'Lear y, 1992), in establishing the first projections of
the cortex. Their distinctive tangential distributions might be
involved in an early territorialization of the cortical vesicle that
clearly precedes the invasion of the subplate by thalamo-cortical
axons (Soria et al., 1998; Soria and Fairén, 1999). On the other
hand, the fact that pioneer neurons do not secrete Reln (Meyer et
al., 1998) sets them apart from the Cajal–Retzius cell group.
They are, moreover, early functioning neurons that express
functional GABAA and NMDA receptors (Soria et al., 1999).
Neurons with a similar morphology and axonal projection
pattern were described with the Golgi method in the earliest
stage of the embryonic cat cortex, but they were thought to
represent the early form of Cajal–Retzius cells, which later
would retract the descending axon and undergo a `horizontalization process' (Marín-Padilla, 1971, 1998).
An important question concerns the presence of pioneer
neurons in the human cortex, in which they have not yet been
described. Our preliminary data suggest that some calretinin-ir
neurons may be the homologues of the rodent pioneer neurons
(Fig. 7A,B).They are placed in the lower part of the MZ, have a
descending axon and invade the upper tier of the cortical plate.
Clearly, the identification of the early preplate derivative of the
human or primate MZ requires further investigation.
In sum, the theor y that all Cajal–Retzius cells are derivatives of
the preplate and remain unchanged from the first moments of
corticogenesis is no longer tenable. Recent observations suggest
that there are dynamic changes of cell populations in the
marginal zone during corticogenesis, with new neurons being
continuously added, while others die after having fulfilled their
developmental role. The Reln-producing members of the Cajal–
Retzius family are an important part of these populations. While
some of them may derive from the preplate, as it has been
universally accepted, others invade the MZ by tangential, subpial
migration. Retzius cells correspond more closely to what is
commonly understood as the prototype of the human Cajal–
Retzius cell, and they are transient, restricted to the period of
cortical migration. Cajal cells mature later in development, and
may persist into adult life. In addition to Reln-positive cells, the
developing MZ, from its earliest developmental stage, contains
Reln-negative pioneer neurons that establish the first efferent
projections of the cortex, and may play a significant role in the
territorialization of the early cortical vesicle.

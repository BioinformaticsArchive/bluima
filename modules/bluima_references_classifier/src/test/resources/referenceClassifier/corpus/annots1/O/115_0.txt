the wave-size and lifetime distributions now have the form of
exponentially truncated power-law functions (Fig, 2Câ€“E, green
curves). The correlations now decay rapidly, consistent with
strong desynchronization of the network activity through very
frequent intrinsic bursting (Fig. 2 F, right). These simulated waves
strongly resemble the patchy, nonpropagating activity observed in
more mature animals (Sernagor et al., 2003; Syed et al., 2004).
These observations show that this network undergoes a transition from a highly synchronized to a strongly desynchronized
state, and produces activity patterns clearly different from oscillatory, phased-locked behavior, where more compact event size

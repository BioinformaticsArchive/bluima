baclofen (from 0.61 0.13 to 0.26 0.27 nA and from
6.93 3.20 to 2.30 1.91 mV, respectively), without significant change of the onset voltage of PICs, again suggesting that
baclofen actually decreased the Ca PIC portion of the total PIC
as shown in the other neurons (Russo et al. 1998; Svirskis and
Hounsgaard 1998; Voisin and Nagy 2001).
We also tested the application of TTX (2 M) after baclofen
application (Fig. 4). In TTX and balcofen, a large calcium
plateau potential could be revealed during a current ramp
because the spikes were also blocked (Fig. 4C) (see details in
Li and Bennett 2003). However, the underlying PIC was
smaller than before TTX application because of the block of
the TTX-sensitive Na PIC (Fig. 4, F and G) (see Li and Bennett
2003). The remaining PIC and plateau were eliminated by 20
M nimodipine (Fig. 4, D and H) and thus were mediated by
L-type calcium channels. These results indicate that both Na
and Ca PICs persist with baclofen. Thus while baclofen likely
increases the Na PIC and decreases the Ca PIC (see preceding
text), it does not completely block the Ca PIC.

Influenced by Ramón y Cajal's ideas of neurotropism, they hypothesized that nervous excitation
must encounter some difficulty in crossing this space between neurons and that repetitive activity
of the neuronal path (such as during learning of a specific task) would lead to hypertrophy of the
neurons and thus facilitate easier crossing of the space between them (Tanzi, 1893). Lugaro
expanded on this view, combining it with his new insight on chemical neurotransmission which
attempts to explain how nerves find their targets via gradients of diffusible messengers (Lugaro,
1898, 1906, 1909). He also argued that coincident activity drives modifications of connections
between neurons and used familiar and modern-sounding terminology such as “The plasticity of
the nervous elements” (“La plasticità degli elementi nervosi cerebrali”) and “plastic activity of
neurones” (“attività plastica dei neuroni”). Lugaro was thus the first to coin the term plasticity to
synaptic modification (Lugaro, 1898, 1906, 1909).
By the end of the 19th century, it was widely believed that information flow must change in
the brain for learning and memory to occur, that synapses control the flow of information, that
they are the neural substrate of learning and memory, and that learning requires repeated and
persistent activation without competing inputs, and that it is the temporal organization of events
that determines the strength of associations - the glue to build memories.

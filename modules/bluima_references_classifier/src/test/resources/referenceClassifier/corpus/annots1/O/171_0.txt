Figure 3. Two “feedback” axons labeled with PHA-L, confined to layer 1 and showing terminations in area V1. A, B, Low-power sketches of lunate gyrus showing approximate path of
two axons through layer 1 and earliest appearance of axon (asterisk). The white matter (wm)
and V1–V2 border are also indicated (arrow). Axon shown in A and C–E is referred to as the
“thin” axon. C, Light microscopic reconstruction of the thin axon showing a long, unbranched,
bouton encrusted (small filled arrowheads) collateral. D, High-magnification (100 oil objective) light microscopic drawing showing detail of thin axon and frequently located boutons
(filled arrowheads). E, Light microscopic photomontage of thin axon in layer 1. Axon shown in
F–H is referred to as the “thick” axon. F, Light microscopic reconstruction of thick, branched
axon showing clusters of boutons (solid arrowheads). The computer assisted 3-D reconstruction
of the axon is rotated to provide the view from the surface of the brain. G, High-magnification
light microscopic drawing showing detail from one bouton cluster. H, Light microscopic photomontage of thick axon and bouton cluster. Scale bars: C, F, 0.5 mm; D, G, 25 m; E, H, 10 m.

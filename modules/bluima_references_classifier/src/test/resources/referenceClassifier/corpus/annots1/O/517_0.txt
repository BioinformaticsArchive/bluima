RS cells in Figure 4 one or two bins to the right, they would all
still have latencies shorter than those of the earliest IPSPs and
would justifiably be considered monosynaptic. However, in that
case, there would be some overlap with the earliest EPSPs in
upper RS cells, and the classification of some of the latter, specifically those earlier than 1.5 msec, may have to change from
di- to monosynaptic, or at least be considered ambiguous.
Undersampling of layers IV and VI
Both layer IV and layer VIb were pronouncedly undersampled
in our data. Reduced cell density may have contributed to the
paucity of impalements in lower layer VI; however, this explanation cannot apply to layer IV, which is the most cell-dense
layer of the barrel cortex. Layer IV is composed of small granular
cells, many less than 10 pm in diameter (Lorente de No, 1922;
Pasternakand Woolsey, 1975; Woolsey et al., 1975; Simons and
Woolsey, 1984); thus, its undersampling was no doubt the result
of microelectrode bias. Such bias does not seem to exist with
micropipettes used for whole-cell recordings, and recent studies
using this method (Agmon et al., 1990) have confirmed that a
great majority of layer IV cells in the barrel cortex receive strong
monosynaptic excitation from VB. Single-unit recording latenties are also consistent with monosynaptic excitation of layer
IV neurons (Armstrong-James and Fox, 1987).
The meaning of unresponsive cells and the origin of
disynaptic PSPs
Half of the cells in our sample exhibited either pure inhibition
or no response at all (Table 1, V-E column, -s). Lack of re-sponse cannot be attributed to impalement-induced damage,
since only cells that produced spike records indicative of good
impalements were included in the unresponsive group. Neither
can it be explained by incomplete retention of thalamocortical
fibers in the slice, by fatigue of the thalamocortical synapse, or
by stimulus parameters ineffective in activating the afferents,
since only when the layer IV field potential showed a clear
thalamocortical response were cells classified as unresponsive.
A potential source of error in assessing the fraction and laminar distribution of unresponsive cells could have been the relatively young age of the animals in our sample. Specifically, this
could have skewed our data toward an artifactually low fraction
of responsive cells in the upper layers, since during early de-velopment the upper layers lag behind the deep layers in terms
of neurite outgrowth and synaptic connectivity (Miller, 1988).
That this was not the case in the present study can be appreciated
by perusal of Table 1: 27% (7 of 26) of our upper RS cells were
from animals younger than 21 d, but they accounted for 40%
(2 of 5) of the disynaptic EPSPs in their class and for 44% (4 of
9) of the disynaptic IPSPs. Thus, young age in our sample did
not bias cells toward low connectivity.
We suspect that unresponsive or purely inhibited neurons are
cells in which potential polysynaptic inputs were not realized
because a precursor cell did not fire. When hippocampal slices
are bathed in low levels of GABA antagonist, polysynaptic re-sponses are uncovered in cells that did not exhibit them before
(Miles and Wong, 1987). The need to disinhibit the cortex for
such latent polysynaptic inputs to be expressed may be an ar-tifact of the slice preparation, since resting potentials in the slice
tend to be more negative than in vivo (Connors et al., 1982),
causing many cells that receive EPSPs not to reach firing threshold and consequently not to excite any of their follower cells.
Indeed, in our sample, cells that received excitation were usually

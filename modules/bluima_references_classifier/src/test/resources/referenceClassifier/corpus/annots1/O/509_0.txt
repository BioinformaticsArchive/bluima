Supraoptic nucleus. The SON is the major site of oxytocin
neurons that release their contents into the posterior pituitary
in response to the suckling stimulus. The majority of oxytocin
neurons and vasopressin neurons is located in the outside rim
of the SON,2 which coincides with the distribution of cFos
expression induced by suckling in the present study. Thus, it
is likely that most of the suckling-induced cFos cells in the
SON are either oxytocin positive or vasopressin positive, or
both. However, Fenelon et al.27 showed that the suckling
stimulus failed to induce cFos expression in oxytocinergic
neurons in the SON. The apparent discrepancy may in part
be due to the different paradigms used in the two studies. In
contrast to the activation of SON neurons, suckling or pup
exposure induced little or inconsistent cFos expression in
PVH. In agreement with the present study, Lawrence and
Pittman38 used electrophysiological recordings to show that
PVH neurons failed to respond to the suckling stimulus,
suggesting that PVH may not be involved in the suckling
reflex during lactation.

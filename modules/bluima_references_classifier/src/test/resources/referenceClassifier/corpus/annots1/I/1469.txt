not belong to the PD, because A ( G/R0 does not always hold in such
a design when k ( 1, i.e., ND2 ( G/`. To see this, we note that in the
regime ND2 ) G2/3, A ~ G/R0 must hold in the nonbranching pipe
model, because the pipe diameter P0 is much larger than R0. In other
words, when G/` ) ND2 ) G2/3, the gray matter in the nonbranching
pipe model resembles a sheet with thickness R0.
Scaling of the mammalian neocortex. The theoretical framework
developed in this paper allows us to derive several scaling laws for the
neocortex. Provided our perturbation theory is valid, the total
neocortical volume G should be proportional to the total nonwire
volume. Assuming that nonwire contains mostly synapses, we have

The interactive vasculo-neuro-glial system controlling energy supply in the brain is absent
in vitro where energy provision is determined by experimental conditions. Despite the fact
that neuronal activity is extremely energy demanding, little has been reported on the state
of energy metabolism in submerged brain slices. Without this information, the arbitrarily
chosen oxygenation and metabolic provisions make questionable the efficient oxidative
metabolism in slices. We show that in mouse hippocampal slices (postnatal day 19–44),
evoked neuronal discharges, spontaneous network activity (initiated by 4-aminopyridine),
and synaptic stimulation-induced NAD(P)H autofluorescence depend strongly on the oxygen availability. Only the rate of perfusion as high as ∼15 ml/min (95% O2) provided
appropriate oxygenation of a slice. Lower oxygenation resulted in the decrease of both
local field potentials and spontaneous network activity as well as in significant modulation
of short-term synaptic plasticity. The reduced oxygen supply considerably inhibited the oxidation phase of NAD(P)H signaling indicating that the changes in neuronal activity were
paralleled by the decrease in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, the dependence
of neuronal activity on oxygen tension was clearly shifted toward considerably larger pO2
values in slices when compared to in vivo conditions. With sufficient pO2 provided by a high
perfusion rate, partial substitution of glucose in ACSF for β-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate, or
lactate enhanced both oxidative metabolism and synaptic function. This suggests that the
high pO2 in brain slices is compulsory for maintaining oxidative metabolism, and glucose
alone is not sufficient in fulfilling energy requirements during neuronal activity. Altogether,
our results demonstrate that energy metabolism determines the functional state of neuronal network, highlighting the need for the adequate metabolic support to be insured in
the in vitro experiments.

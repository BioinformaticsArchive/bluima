The Subpial Granular Layer and the Subpopulation of
Cajal–Retzius Cells Contain Ventral Transcription
Factors
A transient subpial granular layer (SGL), described first in
primates (Brun, 1965; Gadisseux et al., 1992; Meyer and
Goffinet, 1998; Meyer and Wahle, 1999; Zecevic and Rakic,
2001) contains granular GA BAergic interneurons and
Cajal–Retzius cells. SGL cells originate from the SVZ close to the
olfactory bulb, migrate to the brain surface and give rise to
subpial granular cells (Gadissaux et al., 1992; Meyer et al., 1998;
Zecevic and Rakic, 2001). We have now established that SGL
cells were coming from the olfactor y region, and that the
majority of them express DLX. Either the Dlx cells first migrated
from the GE to the olfactor y region, or this transcription factor
was expressed there from the beginning, since both DLX and
NKX2.1+ cells were present in the olfactory region from
embr yonic stages. In addition, at midgestation, the mRNA signals
for the two transcription factors were expressed as a continuous
band between the GE and the olfactory region, stressing their
connection. At the time when the subpial granular layer starts
forming, these cells could spread over the forebrain surface as
part of this layer.
The SGL disappeared by 27–29 g.w., probably by inward
migration of its cells, as was described in the monkey (Zecevic
and Rakic, 2001). Rare TUNEL+ cells in this layer show that
apoptosis cannot be sufficient for the obser ved quick removal of
this layer (Spreafico et al., 1999; Rakic and Zecevic, 2000).
The existence of several subpopulations of Cajal–Retzius cells
indicated on the basis of different antigen expression (Lavdas et
al., 1999; Meyer et al., 2000, 2002; Zecevic et al., 1999; Zecevic
and Rakic, 2001), was confirmed in this study by their ex-pression of different transcription factors. Region specific
transcription factors can provide the information about the site
of origin for different cell types later on, after the cell migrated
to distant regions. In the case of Reelin+ Cajal–Retzius cells, the
presence of DLX in subpopulation of these cells speaks in favor
that this subpopulation has an LGE origin. Furthermore, bipolar
Reelin+ neurons with migratory morphologies were present in
the caudal GE of embr yonic brains, whereas a stream of Reelin+
cells was observed in continuum from the GE to the neocortex
and ventral telencephalon. At the same time the obser ved lack of
radially migrating Reelin+ cells in the cortical wall has been
suggested to be due to the fact that Cajal–Retzius cells express
Reelin only after migrating to their position under the pia (Meyer
and Wahle, 1999). However, present results show that migrating
cells in the GE can express Reelin. This is consistent with the
view that a subpopulation of Cajal–Retzius cells, traditionally
believed to be of cortical origin, could have a subcortical origin
from the GE. Recently, similar conclusions have been reached in
monkey (Zecevic and Rakic, 2001) and human (Meyer et al.,
2002) developing forebrain.
The lack of NKX2.1 expression in Cajal–Retzius cells
obser ved in this study is consistent with the results in rat, where
genetically labeled cells transplanted in the MGE migrated to the
MZ, but did not express Reelin (Wichterle et al., 2001). Another
transcription factor characteristic for MGE, Lhx6, is expressed in
some Cajal–Retzius cells (Lavdas et al., 1999). At the same time,
the expression of Tbr1 in many Cajal–Retzius cells argues that
a larger subpopulation of these cells comes from the cortical

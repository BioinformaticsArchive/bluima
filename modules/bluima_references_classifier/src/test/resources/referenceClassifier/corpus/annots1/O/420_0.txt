FIG. 3. Transcriptional interference of hPR isoforms in
HepG-2 cells. HepG-2 cells were transfected with the TCDD-responsive reporter GUD-LUC 1.1, internal control plasmid, and the expression plasmids encoding either hPR-A (4A) or hPR-B (4B). After transfection, cells were incubated in the presence of Org2058 (10-7 M),
RU486 (10-6 M), and ZK98299 (10-6 M) in the absence (hatched bars) or
presence (black bars) of TCDD (10-9 M). Transactivation is shown as the
percentage of the TCDD response in the absence of added hormone (H)
and represents the mean 6 S.E. of at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.

Astrocytes are integrated in complex spontaneous
active networks of neurons and glial cells
An important feature of spontaneous [C a 2 ]i oscillations in de-veloping neurons is the recruitment of active cells into synchronous networks that amplify the functional consequences of activity to control neuronal development (Yuste et al., 1992;
Buonanno and Fields, 1999; Feller, 1999; O'Donovan, 1999,
Wong, 1999, Ben-Ari, 2001). In our experiments, visual examination of the movies recorded in the neocortex and hippocampus
showed synchronous patterns of activity in neuronal populations
(Fig. 4), which have been described previously (Ben-Ari et al.,
1997; Garaschuk et al., 1998). Interestingly, spatiotemporal correlations of Ca2 signaling between GFAP/GFP-positive astrocytes were also observed.
Because high numbers of astrocytes and neurons can be accurately identified in GFAP/GFP-positive slices, we analyzed the
occurrence of patterned networks of correlated Ca2 transients
among astrocytic and neuronal cells in P5â€“P7 GFAP/GFPpositive hippocampal slices. First, we compared the astrocytes
and neurons present in the same fields for profiles of spontaneous
[C a 2 ]i transients. As above, astroglial cells were identified by the
emission of GFP fluorescence, whereas neurons were identified
by the lack of GFP expression and by their morphology and
location in the hippocampal layers (Figs. 4 A, B). Spontaneous
[Ca2 ]i changes were monitored simultaneously in dozens of glial
(Fig. 4 B, f) and neuronal (Fig. 4 B, ) cells, and the onset of each
calcium event in every active cell was labeled in graphed plots by
a mark (Fig. 4C). No statistical differences were found in the
percentages of active cells or in the rates of [Ca2 ]i oscillations
between hippocampal astrocytes and neurons (Fig. 4 D), indicating that astrocyte activity is a robust phenomenon. In contrast,
both the duration and the amplitude of these oscillations were

A new enzyme, p,w-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase which plays a role in the metabolism
of P,p-dimethyl-L-arginine, has been purified to ho-mogeneity from rat kidney. The enzyme consists of a
single polypeptide and its molecular weight is about
33,000. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is at pH
5.2. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic liberation of
the dimethylamino moiety of M,w-dimethyl-L-arginine and forms L-citrulline and dimethylamine. It is
highlyspecificforp,p-dimethyl-L-arginineandpmonomethyl-L-arginine, and the K,,,values for these
amino acids are 0.18 and 0.36 mM, respectively. The
enzyme shows the maximum activity at pH 6.5 and
requires no cofactor. The activity is strongly inhibited
by SH-blocking reagents (e.g. p-chloromercuribenzoate and HgC12) and divalent metal ions (e.g. Cd2+,
Cu2+,and Zn2+).

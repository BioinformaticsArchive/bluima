(Maher et al., 2009). In Drosophila, mutations in either of two gap
junction genes produced impaired electrical and chemical synapses in the visual system, and transgenic expression of electrical
synapses during development rescued chemical synaptic transmission in adults with these mutations (Curtin et al., 2002). Furthermore, studies of the neuromuscular junction revealed gross
developmental dependence between electrical and chemical synapses (Chang et al., 1999; Personius et al., 2001, 2007). These
correlations strongly suggest that transient electrical synapses are
necessary in either the formation of chemical synapses (Fischbach,
1972; Szabo et al., 2004) or their activity-dependent refinement
(Kandler and Katz, 1995), but the difficulty of modifying the development of individual identified neurons in vivo has been an obstacle
to a direct and specific test of these hypotheses. However, in embryos
of the medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana [previously grouped with
Hirudo medicinalis (Siddall et al., 2007)], we can follow the development of many individually identified neurons from their initial neurite outgrowth to their incorporation into mature functional neural
circuits (Stent et al., 1992). We used these robust and experimentally
tractable embryos to ask whether gap junctions are necessary for
chemical synaptogenesis. Even in embryos (Fig. 1 A, B), the somata
of the neurons in H. verbana ganglia are large (10 –15 m in diameter) (Marin-Burgin et al., 2005), they are in stereotyped positions
(Dietzel and Gottmann, 1988; Marin-Burgin et al., 2005), and for
chronic experiments, the ganglia are easily accessible through the
body wall (Fig. 1C). In addition, the behavioral function of many
leech neurons is known (Kristan et al., 2005), as is the developmental
timelineofneuronalconnectivity(Marin-Burginetal.,2005)(Fig.1D).
At least 12 different innexins (i.e., invertebrate gap-junction
protein monomers) have been identified in Hirudo sp. (Dykes
and Macagno, 2006), but Hm–inx1 is the only innexin that is
expressed in all central neurons (Dykes et al., 2004). To test

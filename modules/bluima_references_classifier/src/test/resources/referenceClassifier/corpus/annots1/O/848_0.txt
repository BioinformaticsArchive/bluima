Relationship of GAD-positive puncta to cortical neurons
GAD-positive puncta are present throughout the neuropil, but appear to have a
preferential relationship to the somata and dendrites of certain neurons. For instance,
puncta are observed in large numbers around the somata and the proximal portions of
the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells (Fig. 13; also see Ribak, 1978; Emson &
Hunt, 1981). GAD-positive puncta also are found in close approximation to more distal

Synaptic Cleft
Separating the PSD and the active zone is
the synaptic cleft, which measures 20 nm
wide in conventional EM and 24 nm wide
in cryo-EM (17, 18) (Figure 1b). Faint lines
bridging the synaptic cleft were noted by early
anatomists (19). Recent cryo-EM and tomography studies suggest that the cleft contains
more electron-dense material even than the
cytoplasm; the density peaks midway between
the pre- and postsynaptic membranes (17, 18).
The intracleft material appears to consist of
transsynaptic complexes that form extensive
lateral connections within the cleft (17, 18).
The nature of these cleft complexes are un-known, but cell adhesion molecules such as
N-cadherin (12) and glutamate receptors may
contribute (20).

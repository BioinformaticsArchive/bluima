Figure 4. Recovery of the I PSC after inhibition of uptake. a, Recovery of
the I PSC amplitude after NO711 was fit with a single exponential f unction
(same protocol as Fig. 1). Recovery from NO711 (t = 10.0 sec, n = 4 –7 cells
per time point) was similar to recovery from GABA (Figs. 1, 2b). Recovery
of the I PSC decay was much faster (see Results). b, Tiagabine (100 μM)
reduced the amplitude and prolonged the decay of I PSC s. The decay of the
I PSC was fit with the sum of either two or three exponential f unctions, and
the weighted decay was calculated by the equation A1t1 + A2t2 + A3t3 ,
where A is the relative amplitude of each component and t is its time
constant. Inset, Both uptake inhibitors prolonged the weighted decay. For
NO711, t = 46 6 7 msec in control and 50 6 7 msec in NO711 (n = 7). For
tiagabine, t = 57 6 9 msec in control and 79 6 13 msec in tiagabine (n =
8). The uptake inhibitors increased the amplitude of the slow component of
decay without altering the time constants. c, The recovery of the I PSC
decay to control values after removal of tiagabine (F, n = 4 –9 cells per time
point) was faster than the recovery of the peak amplitude (E, n = 3– 6 cells
per time point) in the same population of cells. The recovery of the
amplitude and decay were fit with single exponential f unctions (tamplitude =
13.3 sec, tdecay = 1.3 sec).

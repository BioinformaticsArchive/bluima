5.2 The Two-Dimensional Direct Linear Transformation Technique

The simplest way of transforming pixel coordinates obtained from a recording

to real world coordinates is the scaling technique. This technique simply consists of

placing a scale bar of known length in the recordings. However, this technique is only

accurate if the camera is placed directly perpendicular and horizontally levelled to the

activity plane (Brewin and Kerwin 2003). Even small rolls and tilts of the camera can

have significant negative effects on reconstruction errors (Brewin and Kerwin 2003).

Instead another technique, Two-Dimensional Direct Linear Transformation (2D-DLT)

where several points distributed over the entire field of view, can be used. This

technique provides much more accurate positional data independent of camera

position (Brewin and Kerwin 2003). The 2D-DLT technique, furthermore,

automatically incorporates separate horizontal and vertical scale factors that have

been shown to provide better accuracy in the scaling technique.

The relationship between the real world coordinates (x,y) and the image

coordinates (u,v) in the 2D-DLT technique can be describes with the following

equations (Walton 1981 cited in Kwon 1999)

neurons, showed little or no selectivity for the direction of
whisker displacement. This is surprising, because most SINs
receive strong thalamocortical input, much of which originates
in thalamocortical neurons that show strong directional selectivity. I will argue (below) that this results from a non-selective
convergence of thalamocortical input onto SINs of layer 4.
Similar results are seen in rabbit visual cortex, where most
corticocortical and corticofugal (corticotectal and corticothalamic) efferent neurons show both orientation and directional selectivity, but SINs are ver y widely tuned for both
orientation and direction of motion (Swadlow, 1988 ).
The above results for SINs in rabbit S1, S2 and V1 are very
similar to those reported for `fast-spike' neurons in layer 4 of rat
barrel cortex (Simons, 1978). These neurons also demonstrate
very high levels of spontaneous activity, and are very responsive
to peripheral stimulation, yet they lack the directional selectivity
seen in most VB neurons and in `regular-spike' neurons (presumed pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons) of this cortical
region.
It is not yet clear whether the above results in rabbit and rat,
showing a high sensitivity, but low degree of specificity in the
responses of SINs (or fast-spike neurons), hold for these elements
in sensory cortex of other species. A small number of GABAergic
interneurons have been identified in in vivo intracellular studies
of cat visual cortex. Both Martin et al. (Martin et al., 1983) and
Azouz et al. (Azouz et al., 1997) report that these neurons are
orientation selective, and these results are consistent with results
showing orientation selectivity in the IPSPs onto pyramidal
neurons of cat V1 (Ferster, 1986). However, recent intracellular
studies (Hirsch et al., 2000) have revealed inhibitor y interneurons that lack orientation selectivity in layer 4 of cat V1. It
would be useful to know whether these latter cells receive
significant monosynaptic input from LGNd and could, thereby,
mediate a broadly tuned feedfor ward inhibition onto spiny
stellate neurons (Troyer et al., 1998; Ferster and Miller, 2000).
Surprisingly, putative fast-spike inhibitory interneurons have not
been identified with any regularity in extracellular analyses of
feline visual cortex. This is curious, given the great number of
studies and intense interest in this cortical region. It may be that
these neurons are more difficult to isolate in cat or simply that
they have not been sought with sufficient effort.

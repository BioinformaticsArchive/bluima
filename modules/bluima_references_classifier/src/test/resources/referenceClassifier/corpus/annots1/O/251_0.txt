OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES experimental recordings have
revealed the presence of voltage-gated ion channels over the
dendrites of spinal motoneurons (10, 34, 35, 44, 50). Some of
these dendritic channels mediate a persistent inward current
(PIC), which is a depolarizing current that does not inactivate
with prolonged membrane depolarization. This dendritic PIC
plays a fundamental role in determining the response of the
motoneuron to synaptic inputs and in shaping the motor output.
After spinal cord injury (SCI), activation of PICs in motoneurons is no longer under the control of descending drive (e.g.,
lack of inhibition), leading to increased motoneuronal excitability and firing rate, muscle spasms, and long-lasting reflexes
in response to afferent inputs (45, 54).
Electrical fields have been used previously to study the
electrical properties and firing behavior of neurons in the brain

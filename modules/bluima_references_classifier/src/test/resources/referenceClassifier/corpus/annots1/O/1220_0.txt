PREDICTING THE DENDRITIC DENSITY FIELD FROM INPUT
AXON CONFIGURATIONS
While the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells, dentate gyrus
granule cells, and many other neurons exhibit complex DDFs,
some simpler ones such as pyramidal cell basal dendrites observe
basic principles which can be characterized by studying the statistical moments of their density distributions (Snider et al., 2010).
Stevens and colleagues have shown that the cable density distributions in dendrites roughly follow separate Gaussian distributions
for each dimension in space which are cut off at 2 standard deviation. What determines this particular density profile? In synthetic
dendrites generated using the MST, homogenously distributed carrier points lead to a homogeneous cable density. The MST alone
can therefore not be responsible for the observed Gaussian cable
density distribution. Intuitively, the shape of a DDF should be
determined by the set of axons which are a dendrite's potential,
i.e., anatomical connection partners. This simple intuition can
provide direct explanations for basic features of DDFs.
When input target points were distributed along one dimension, the MST was simply a straight line connecting these points
(Figure 2A). When these target points were extended to parallel
lines as in Figure 2B, and the MST was set to connect to each
axon once, the resulting synthetic dendrite was not changed. Out
of cable and conduction time minimization, a straight and direct
connection remained ideal. When more axons were added and
noise was introduced to their trajectories (Figure 2C), the MST
dendrite started to branch out. In a similar but more realistic setting, a dendrite connecting to a set of parallel axons traversing
space was flat according to the MST (Figure 2D). A flat dendrite
which lies perpendicular to a set of parallel axons was shown to
be the overall ideal geometrical arrangement given Cajal's wiring
costs (Wen and Chklovskii, 2008). It is therefore not surprising
that the MST approach reproduces this intuition. Such a planar

Lateral extent of connectivity
Most paired recording studies that mention the intersomatic distance between the recorded cells did not find
a very prominent drop of connectivity ratio for the first
tens of micrometres distance, either between layer 2/3 or
layer 5 PCs in somatosensory or visual cortex (Holmgren
et al. 2003; Song et al. 2005). This is in agreement with our
data: both FDDI and EPSP connectivity were relatively
stable for the first 100–150 μm. The connectivity started
to drop thereafter, and was best fitted with Gaussians
with a standard deviation of 265–290 μm. It needs to
be considered that any connectivity rates obtained from
acute slices suffer from bias in the estimates due to cut
dendrites and axon along the slicing plane. This bias can
be reduced if the recorded cells are located as deep as
possible in the slice but will always be a source of error
in slice experiments. Moreover, this uncertainty might be
larger for large intersomatic distances. Likewise, amplitude
drops of EPSP might be explained by a higher likelihood of
cut synaptic contacts for distant cells. Some of the synaptic
contacts between Martinotti cells and PCs are located at
the dendritic tuft, electrotonically remote from the soma.
It may be that due to the dendritic spread of PCs and
the axonal spread of Martinotti cells in layer 1, FDDI also
occurs at larger distances, but is mediated only by those
distal synapses that might escape detection by somatic
recordings.

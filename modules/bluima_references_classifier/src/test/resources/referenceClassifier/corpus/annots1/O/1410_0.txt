(b) Distinguishing public information from other
forms of social information
It has long been known that sociality can provide animals with access to a source of information about their
environment that is unavailable to solitary individuals: the
behaviour of other individuals. This social information can
be used in a variety of ways (reviewed by Galef & Giraldeau 2001). For example, it can be used to enhance the
recognition of novel prey types, as well as individual learning of novel behavioural traits involved in prey acquisition.
The social learning of novel skills has been well documented in a variety of species in both the eld and laboratory (e.g. Zentall & Galef 1988). Individuals can also learn
about the location of food resources simply by being
attracted to other foraging individuals, a process termed
`local enhancement' (e.g. Thorpe 1963; Poysa 1992).
Public information use therefore differs from social
learning in that it provides information about the quality
of an environmental resource, rather than how to obtain
it. Public information also differs from local enhancement
in two key respects: the point at which the information is
obtained, and how the information is used. Unlike local
enhancement (where social information is obtained before
an individual arrives at a patch), public information is
obtained after the forager has already entered the resource
patch. Public information thus allows a forager to assess
more accurately the quality of a resource patch and to
decide whether to stay or depart; local enhancement, on
the other hand, simply allows a forager to detect the presence or absence of a resource patch and thus to approach
or not (but see Smith et al. 2001).
We suggest that the term `public information' be restricted to vicarious sampling information obtained from
others about the quality of an environmental resource. We
believe it is important to emphasize this point because
some researchers have recently expanded the use of the
term to include any information obtained from others
such that all forms of social learning involve the use of
`public information' (e.g. Giraldeau 1997; Giraldeau &
Caraco 2000; Galef & Giraldeau 2001). However, this
broader use of the term is not consistent with its original
de nition (Valone 1989) and, to us, obscures the unique
aspect of public information as an extra source of sample
information used both to increase the rate of assessment

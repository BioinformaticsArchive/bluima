Modulation of excitability
GABABRs often activate inwardly rectifying K channels (Ga ̈h-wiler and Brown, 1985; Sodickson and Bean, 1996; Lu ̈ scher et al.,
1997) found in the spines and dendrites of pyramidal neurons
(Takigawa and Alzheimer, 1999; Chen and Johnston, 2005; Kulik
et al., 2006). Opening these channels can generate a shunting
conductance that changes passive membrane properties. We
found that bath application of 5 M baclofen decreased the input
resistance (Rin) recorded at the soma ( p 1 10 11, n 41
cells; ACSF, p 0.98, n 34 cells; baclofen vs ACSF, p 1
10 10) (Fig. 3 A, B). Baclofen also decreased the width at 10%
amplitude of the AP (width10%), which is a measure of the afterdepolarization (ADP) ( p 9 10 12; ACSF, p 0.03; baclofen
vs ACSF, p 2 10 10) (Fig. 3 A, B). However, baclofen had
only a small effect on AP amplitude, which was not significant
compared with ACSF controls ( p 0.03; ACSF, p 0.90;
baclofen vs ACSF, p 0.06) (Fig. 3B). Moreover, baclofen had no
effect on AP half-width (width50%) ( p 0.49; ACSF, p 0.30;
baclofen vs ACSF, p 0.76) (Fig. 3B). The change in ADP positively correlated with the change in Rin ( p 0.01) (Fig. 3C),
suggesting that changes in the AP waveform after GABABR activation reflect changes in passive membrane properties (Fernandez and White, 2009).
By changing the somatic Rin and ADP, GABABRs could influence backpropagation of APs into the dendrites and consequently
attenuate [Ca]bAP (Buzsa ́ ki et al., 1996; Tsubokawa and Ross,
1996; Leung and Peloquin, 2006). However, we observed no
correlation between the change in either spine or dendrite
[Ca]bAP and the change in Rin after baclofen (spine, p 0.05;
dendrite, p 0.05; n 80 spine– dendrite pairs) (Fig. 3D).
Similarly, we observed no correlation between the change in
spine or dendrite [Ca]bAP and the change in ADP after
baclofen (spine, p 0.05; dendrite, p 0.05) (Fig. 3D). These
findings suggest that modulation in spines and dendrites is not
attributable to changes in either passive membrane properties
or AP waveform.

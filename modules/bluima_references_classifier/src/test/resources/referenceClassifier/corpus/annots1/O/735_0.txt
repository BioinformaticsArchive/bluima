pending on variables such as neuronal density and activity.
Here we focus our attention on unit detection in the rat hippocampal area CA1.
Extracellular recording methods traditionally provide information only on whether a neuron fires a spike or not. To obtain
information about subthreshold variations in neuronal membrane potential, it is necessary to use intracellular recording
methods. In addition, intracellular recording has the added
advantage that it allows subsequent morphological identification of the recorded neuron. However, intracellular recordings
typically are obtained from one cell at a time under nonphysiological conditions, e.g., in tissue slices and anesthetized
brains. Since the extracellularly recorded spikes arise due to
transmembrane currents and concurrent changes in intracellular membrane potential, it should be possible to obtain more
detailed information about intracellular changes from close
examination of the extracellular spikes. However, this requires
a better understanding of the relationship between an intracellular action potential and the extracellular spike.
The present experiments provide important information
about the sensitivity of the tetrode recording method and in-vestigate the relationship between intracellular action potentials and extracellular spikes. Our investigations ask the following questions: what is the precise temporal relationship
between the intracellularly recorded somatic and dendritic ac-tion potential and its extracellularly recorded counterpart?
Does variation in the intracellular action potential contribute to
amplitude and shape variability of extracellular spikes? How
close does a neuron have to be to a tetrode to be detected and
subsequently isolated during analysis?

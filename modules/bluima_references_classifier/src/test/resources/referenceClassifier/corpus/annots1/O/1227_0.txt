Figure 2. Cell classification based on PCA. (a) Distribution of cells as a function of the first PC score based on the 38 features used to characterize the cell's electrical
properties (Table 1). Overall cell distribution is depicted by the dashed black line. Different subjectively classified e-types, according to PING convention, are marked by colored
lines. Classes are marked with different colors as shown in inset (FS, fast spiking; AD, adapting; NA, non-adapting non-FS; Stut., stuttering; Pyr, pyramidal; Other, other; Unspec.,
unspecified). (b) Each cell is plotted as a point in the space of the first 2 PCs (PC1 and PC2). Point color is as in a, transient e-type is indicated by marker shape (c) Percentage
of variance captured by each PC, PCs 1â€“10. (d) The weight of the contribution of each of the 38 features to the first (top) and second (bottom) PC. Features related to AP shape
are marked in gray, whereas features related to AP firing pattern are marked in dark blue. Feature descriptions are provided in Table 1.

Figure 1. Developmental changes in the subunit composition of NMDARs and neuronal
circuit activity in hippocampal culture. A, Ifenprodil-sensitive NMDAR currents. To determine
the proportion of ifenprodil-sensitive currents, whole-cell currents mediated by NMDARs were
recorded without drugs and with the sequential addition of ifenprodil and APV (n 5). B, Firing
rate in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Spontaneous neuronal firings were monitored by the
cell-attached mode of patch-clamp recording for 3 min (n 4 series of experiments). C, Neuronal density in culture. Neuronal densities were obtained by counting Hoechst 33258 and
MAP2 double-positive cells over 10 objective fields (0.15 mm 2) in each series of culture. Mean
data are plotted from four independent series of culture.

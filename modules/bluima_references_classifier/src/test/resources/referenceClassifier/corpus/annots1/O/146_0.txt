After retinal exit, our transplant experiments show that isotypic
interactions between retinal axons are important for three further
choice points that require Robo2 function (Fricke et al., 2001;
Hutson and Chien, 2002) (M. Hardy and C.-B.C., unpublished).
Misrouting in the optic chiasm leads to chiasm defasciculation (Fig.
6C); misrouting in the ventral optic tract leads to telencephalic or
ventral hindbrain projections (Fig. 5C; Fig. 6C); and misrouting in
the dorsal optic tract leads to aberrant crossing in the habenular or
posterior commissures (Fig. 5C). At all three choice points, mutant
axons can lead wild-type neighbors into error. Thus, axon-axon
interactions function throughout the entire course of the retinotectal
projection.
Several questions remain for future studies on axon-axon
interactions. What distinguishes pioneers from followers? We know
of no molecular markers that distinguish these RGC populations –
for instance, they both express robo2 (Campbell et al., 2007) – so
the only difference may be the time and position of their birth. How
do pioneers interact with followers within the eye? Most simply,
later axons may fasciculate with early axons, as seen in Fig. 4C-C ;
future experiments will test whether disrupting cell-adhesion
molecules leads to axon guidance errors within the retina, as in other
vertebrates (Brittis et al., 1995; Leppert et al., 1999; Ott et al., 1998;
Zelina et al., 2005). However, we cannot formally exclude other
possibilities. For example, early RGC cell bodies might secrete an
attractant that draws later axons to the optic nerve head.
Interestingly, WT>ath5 morphant transplants in which host axons
remained trapped within the eye tended to have fewer donor axons
on the tectum (data not shown), presumably reflecting fewer donor
RGCs, which might provide an insufficient level of attraction. What
underlies the apparent crucial period before 42 hpf? Both timing and
spacing are possible explanations. Ligands implicated in retinal exit
(Birgbauer et al., 2000; Deiner et al., 1997; Kay et al., 2005; Kolpak
et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2006) or their receptors,
might be expressed only transiently during this period, so that RGCs
born after 42 hpf would lack appropriate exit signals. Alternatively,
early-born RGCs may be close enough to find the optic nerve head,
whereas later-born RGCs are simply too far away to sense it.
Although most pioneer experiments have studied heterotypic
axon interactions, there have been a few studies of isotypic
interactions. In grasshopper, Myers and Bastiani (Myers and
Bastiani, 1993) found that the growth cone of the identified Q1
neuron interacts strongly with its contralateral homolog, and that
ablation of one Q1 often leads to midline stalling of the growth cone
of the other Q1. In the zebrafish, Bak and Fraser (Bak and Fraser,
2003) found that pioneer and follower growth cones in the postoptic
commissure (POC) display characteristic morphology and kinetics
(spread/slow and narrow/fast, respectively). After laser ablation of
pioneer growth cones, followers appeared to take their place and
behave like pioneers. However, POC pioneer ablation did not have
any effect on the pathfinding of follower axons, and indeed we do
not know of previous studies in vertebrates showing guidance by
isotypic pioneers.
Here, we found that isotypic interactions after retinal exit help to
guide retinal axons to the tectum. We were able to test the role of
axon-axon interactions in a new way: by replacing rather than
ablating RGCs, we tested sufficiency rather than necessity. Previous
studies on pioneers found that their ablation prevents normal
pathfinding by followers (e.g. Raper et al., 1983; Klose and Bentley,
1989; Pike et al., 1992; Whitlock and Westerfield, 1998); here, we
used zebrafish transplants to test how misrouted mutant axons affect
wild-type axons, and vice versa. We found that ast host axons can
misroute wild-type donor axons, whereas wild-type host axons

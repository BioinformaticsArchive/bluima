Figure 2. Temporal interactions of independent and partially overlapping inputs. (A, C,
E) Independent inputs. (B, D, F) Partially overlapping inputs in another cell. (A) With
independent inputs, the slope of the rise after simultaneous activation of both inputs
(solid trace) was similar to the sum of the rising-phase slopes of the individually
activated inputs (dotted traces). (B) In contrast, the slope of the rise after combined
activation of both inputs (solid trace) was smaller than the sum of the rising-phase
slopes of the individually activated inputs (dotted traces) in partially overlapping inputs.
(C, D) Combined activation of both inputs (relative delay –30, –15, 0, 15 and 30 ms).
With independent inputs, an action potential was generated when the delay was
minimal. If the inputs were partially overlapping, action potentials were only generated
with delays of –15 and 15 ms. (E, F) The mean number of action potentials for each of
the thirteen delays (from –30 to 30 ms, with 5 ms increments; total number of spikes
for each increment divided by the number of runs). In the case of independent inputs,
the highest probability for a spike was at zero delay. If the inputs were partially
overlapping, the spike probability had two peaks on either side of 0 ms. In these layer V
pyramidal cells, coincident inputs were mutually refractory due to partially overlapping
inputs. Vm = –65 mV at (A, C) and Vm = –70 mV at (B, D).

that the under-representation is attributable to a reduced stability of branches in
the JHm-treated neurons. (Figs. 4 B, 11 B).
Time-lapse movies of neurons between 48
and 72 hr APF also show that the period of
branch loss is prolonged in the treated
group (Fig. 12, movie 4, available at ww-w.jneurosci.org). A qualitative difference
between the neurons of the two treatment
groups also exists, with JHm individuals
continuing to generate interstitial filopodia along the lengths of lower-order
branches (Fig. 13D–F ), suggesting a
change in the stability of the cytoskeleton
in these regions. Both the branch lability
and the interstitial filopodia seen at late
times in the treated neurons are features
typical of the early, scaffold-building
phase of arbor growth. Hence, it appears
that neurons exposed to JHm fail to turn
off some of the cellular processes that are
features of their early phase of
development.

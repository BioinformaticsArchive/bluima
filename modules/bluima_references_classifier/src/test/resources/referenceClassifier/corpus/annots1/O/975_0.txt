asynchronous EPSPs evoked by CB stimulation were smaller than
those evoked by NCB, but there was no such difference for IPSPs
(Fig. 5). This finding allows us to infer that the smaller size of CB
EPSPs is most likely due to a difference at single synaptic
contacts, rather than in the overall number of synaptic contacts.
Similar asynchronous events have been shown to reflect quantal
release from single terminals and their amplitudes have been
used as a measure of quantal amplitude at single synaptic
contacts (Miledi and Slater 1966; Xu-Friedman and Regehr
2000). Thus, differences in their amplitude have been interpreted as reflecting differences in postsynaptic properties of
single synaptic contacts (Miledi and Slater 1966; Goda and
Stevens 1994; Bender et al. 2006). Based on these previous data,
the difference in the amplitude of asynchronous events between
CB and NCB synapses is most likely associated with a difference
in the properties of single excitatory synaptic contacts, and most
likely is based on some difference in postsynaptic properties of
single synapses, either their relative efficacies or their locations
on the postsynaptic cell.
The previous analyses do not rule out the possibility that the
CB and NCB synapses have different distributions on the target
cell's dendrites. However, a more detailed examination of the
kinetics of minimal and asynchronous EPSPs can be used to do
so. If CB synaptic contacts tended to be further away from the
site of recording in the soma than NCB synaptic contacts, the
CB responses would be smaller than the NCB because of

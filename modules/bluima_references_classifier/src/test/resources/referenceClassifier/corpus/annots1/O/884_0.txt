are plausible donors of Gβg for GIRK activation in vivo, but
the list may be longer than that.
It is generally accepted now that receptor-G proteineffector specificity is governed by integration of many factors: affinity and stoichiometry of interaction, GTPase ac-tivity of Gα, compartmentalisation or colocalisation of
components, and synergism or antagonism between the G
protein arms [55, 57, 81, 165, 18, 207]. Gβg seems to confer
little specificity, since GIRKs are similarly activated by
many different combinations of Gβ and Gg subtypes [115,
235]. A much better binding of Gβ1 and Gβ2 than of Gβ3 and
Gβ4 to the N-terminus of GIRK1 was detected by the yeast
two-hybrid assay [244], which may contribute to some ex-tent to specificity of coupling. Another important factor is
the formation of complexes of GIRK1 with heterotrimeric
G proteins, which presumably ensures that, upon activation, Gβg will be derived from the ``correct'' trimer [75]. A
detailed study of which Gα subunits preferentially form such
complexes is certainly warranted. An additional mechanism
of specificity is suggested by the recent finding that #100
pM concentrations of GTPgS-activated Gαi1 and Gαs, but
not Gαi2, Gαi3, or Gαo, suppress the activation of GIRK by
Gβg [196]. This modulation occurs in excised membrane
patches; it is therefore membrane-delimited. It is not due to
sequestration of Gβg because of a great molar excess of the
latter (20 nM), and because GDP-bound Gα's have no ef-fect at these doses [196]. Thus, like some adenylyl cyclases
[89, 218], GIRK may be a target for antagonistic modulation
by the two arms of activated G protein, Gα and Gβg. The
molecular mechanisms of these interactions and the physiological role of Gα modulation of GIRK in neuronal and cardiac cells are still unknown. Another mechanism for such
an antagonistic interaction is the inhibition of GIRK by
neurotransmitters coupled to PTX-insensitive G proteins of
the Gq class which activate phospholipase C and, eventually, protein kinase C (PKC) that inhibits the channel, as
demonstrated in Xenopus oocytes [199]. Inhibition of GIRK
by one such receptor, the metabotropic glutamate receptor
mGluR1a, was studied in detail. At relatively low receptor
expression levels that, however, already maximally activate
phospholipase C, the main effect on GIRK is PTX-insensitive, PKC-mediated inhibition [199; see below]. However,
when the receptor is heavily overexpressed, a significant ac-tivation of GIRK is also observed; surprisingly, unlike the
inhibition, this action of the receptor is mostly PTX-sensitive [193, 199], suggesting that a promiscuous coupling be-tween the receptor and a PTX-sensitive G protein takes
place in this case [see 55, 57], whereas the coupling between
the G protein and GIRK remains rather specific. These
studies imply that Gαs, Gαi1 and Gq may not normally be
good candidates for coupling to GIRK because they directly
or indirectly inhibit the channel; however, at very high ex-pression levels of receptors or G proteins, promiscuous coupling on various levels may occur resulting in significant
channel activation.
To summarize, it appears that several factors may contribute to specificity of G protein-GIRK coupling: formation of
complexes with ``relevant'' G protein heterotrimers; antago-

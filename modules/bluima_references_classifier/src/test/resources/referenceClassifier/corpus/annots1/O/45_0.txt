mice. As will be described below, we focused our analysis on
excitatory synapses to FS-GABA neurons in the present study.
Thus, we measured the resting membrane potential and input
resistance and then the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous
EPSCs and their rising and decaying times of 25 GFP-positive,
FS-GABA cells in slices of TG mice and 14 FS-GABA cells in slices
of WT mice. These 14 cells were judged as FS-GABA neurons,
based on the criteria described above. As summarized in Tables 1
and 2, we did not find any significant difference in these properties between FS-GABA neurons of the TG and WT mice ( p 0.1,
unpaired t test). Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that
membrane properties of FS-GABA neurons in the visual cortex of
GAD67-GFP knock-in mice are not different from those of WT
mice.

35 years, the neuropathological changes seen in DS brains
are identical to those seen in sporadic AD. These neurodegenerative changes are characterized by progressive accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and
occur with a similar regional distribution as in AD
(Wisniewski & Kida 1994).
At the microscopic level, neuronal density is decreased in
distinct regions of DS brains, including the cochlear nuclei,
cerebellum, hippocampus, basal forebrain, the granular
layers of the neocortex and areas of the brainstem. In the
neocortex, neuronal morphology is abnormal, and neuronal
orientation is aberrant (reviewed in Coyle et al. 1986; Flo ÃÅ rez
1992). Recently, it has been reported (Raz et al. 1995) using
MRI that young adult DS subjects have reduced volumes of
cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, ventral pons, mammillary bodies and hippocampal formation, even after adjustment for body size. In contrast, the parahippocampal gyrus
is enlarged. However, it is difficult to attribute the cognitive
alterations in DS to a simple reduction of brain size or neuronal density. Instead, different aspects of the threedimensional neuronal cell structure such as the size of the
basal dendritic arbors, their branching structure and spine density may have a specific pathogenesis and evolution in DS.
In this regard, several studies (Becker et al. 1986, 1991;
Marin-Padilla 1976; Suetsugu & Mehraein 1980) have
reported reductions in cortical width, abnormal cortical lamination patterns, altered dendritic arbors and dendritic spines,
aberrant electrophysiological properties of membranes,
reduced synaptic density and abnormal synaptic morphology
in DS patients (Reviewed in Benavides-Piccione et al. 2004).
Some of these alterations are probably due to an abnormal
development of the nervous system during postnatal life.
Quantitative analysis of dendrites in layer IIIc pyramidal
neurons of prefrontal cortex (prospective area 9) of the brains
of 2.5-month-old infants revealed no significant differences in
dendritic differentiation between normal and DS cases
(Vuksic et al. 2002). In contrast, basilar dendrites of cortical
pyramidal neurons were shorter than normal in DS subjects
older than 4 months (Takashima et al. 1981). These findings
suggest that children with DS begin their lives with morphologically normal layer III pyramidal neurons and that pathologic changes occur after 2.5 months of postnatal age.
Subsequent to this age, there is a steady decrease, so that,
in subjects with DS older than 2 years, these parameters are
reduced relative to controls especially in apical dendrites
(Becker et al. 1986).
In adults with DS cross-sectional studies demonstrate
marked reductions in dendritic branching and length, and in
spine density (Becker et al. 1991; Takashima et al. 1989).
Degenerative neuronal changes are also associated with
dendritic abnormalities. Two other reports on pyramidal neurons in parietal cortex (Schulz & Scholz 1992) and on nonpyramidal neurons in motor cortex (Prinz et al. 1997) support
these findings. In cases of aged DS brains that do not show
AD-like pathology, the number of spines in the middle and

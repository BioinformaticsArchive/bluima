As illustrated in Figure 74 thesedata were readily simulated
in the multicompartmental model with electrotonically separatedsitesofspikegeneration.Inthismodel,large,briefpulses
delivered at the soma were generally unable to affect spikes
generateddistally becauseof the low-passfiltering characteristics of the cable.
Figure 7B showsthat it wasalsopossibleto mimic this result
in the single-compartment model with two CaZ+channels.In

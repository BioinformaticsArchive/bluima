Cytoarchitecture
Our observations of the BST subnuclei agree, in general,
with the recent, relatively brief description by De Olmos et
al. ('85), so we have retained their terminology where possible while preparing the f.ollowing account. Based on its
cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry, and connections,
the BST may be divided into medial, lateral, and ventral
subdivisions (Moga et al., '87).
The medial BST begins at the dorsomedial border of the
nucleus accumbens and extends to the rostral aspect of the
thalamus; thus, it spans the entire rostrocaudallength of the
BST. This subdivision may be divided into anterior medial,
ventral medial, posterior medial, posterior intermediate,
subventricular, and intermediate subnuclei. The anterior
medial (AM) subnucleus forms the most rostral extent of
the BST (Fig. lA). AM consists of a heterogeneous cell population which includes many small, darkly staining cells
with little cytoplasm, and scattered larger, light- to me-dium-staining cells with coarse granular cytoplasm and
prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3A). At midlevels of AM, a triangular cluster of small, darkly staining, oval-shaped neurons is
present ventrally in AM just dorsal to the anterior commissure (Fig. 3B). While these neurons appear different from
the heterogeneous bulk of AM cells, there is no connectional
or immunohistochemical evidence at present to define them
as a subnucleus (Krettek and Price, '78; Woodhams et aI.,

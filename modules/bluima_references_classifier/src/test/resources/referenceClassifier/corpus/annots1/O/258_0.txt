Summary
Motoneurons in the spinal cord have intrinsic voltagedependent persistent inward currents (PICs; e.g. persistent calcium currents) that amplify synaptic inputs by
three- to five-fold in addition to providing a sustained
excitatory drive that allows motoneurons to fire repetitively following a brief synaptic excitation. In this study,
we examined whether prolonged involuntary muscle
spasms in subjects with long-term injury to the spinal
cord are mediated by the activation of PICs in the motoneuron. To examine this in the human, we used a paired
motor unit analysis technique where the firing frequency
of one motor unit of the pair (control unit) was used
to estimate the synaptic drive to the motoneuron pool,
including the drive to a second higher-threshold motor
unit of the pair (test unit). The degree to which a motoneuron PIC helped to sustain the discharge of a test motor
unit (self-sustained firing) was determined from the reduction in control unit firing at de-recruitment (DF) compared with recruitment of the test unit. This DF value
corresponds to the reduction in synaptic drive needed
to counteract the intrinsic PIC and, thus, was used an
indirect measure of this current. In the nine motor unit
pairs studied, the average estimated synaptic drive, or

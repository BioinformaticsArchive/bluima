MULTIQUANTAL RELEASE OF TRANSMITTER 601
(f) Magnesium and calcium. Variation in magnesium concentration over
the range 1-12 5 mm and in calcium concentration over the range 0-4 mm had
no effect on the relative frequency of giant potentials. At one junction
blocked by 12 mM-Mg the paradoxical situation was observed that, wbereas
a nerve impulse evoked a response of low quantal content (Boyd & Martin,
1956; Liley, 1956b) which never approached the muscle fibre threshold, an
occasional spontaneous giant potential of some 8-10 mV readily initiated a
muscle action potential. In these conditions no evidence was obtained that
giant potentials could occur as a response to a nerve impulse.

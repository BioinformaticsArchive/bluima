C. Significanceof individwl basepairs of the HRE
DNA binding experiments with synthetic oligonucleotides
in which relevant bases have been replaced by base analogs
and various protection and interference experiments have
revealed detailed information on how receptors interact with
their binding sites.
Position 1. The ER as well as the GR and the PR contact the
first T of a half-site by interacting with the 5'-methyl group.
Replacement of this base by 5'-deoxyuridine, as well as its
modification by potassium permanganate, interferes with
binding of these receptors (78, 80). According to missing
contact probing‚Äù experiments (Sl), the adenine opposite to
this thymine seems not to be directly contacted by PR (M.
Truss, unpublished observation), although it has been re-ported that modification of this base interferes with the
binding of GR (82).
Position2.Contact of all three receptors to the guanine at the
second position of the half-site is achieved by an interaction
with N-7 position as demonstrated by methylation interference or methylation protection experiments (78, 83). This
position appears to be an essential component of the high
affinity binding of receptors to HRE, as it is highly conserved
in natural receptor binding sites for ER, GR, and PR. This
suggests that it is contacted by an amino acid side chain
conserved throughout the steroid hormone receptors (see
below). Again there is no evidence for interaction with the
cytosine opposite to this guanine (80,82).
Position 3. The main difference between ERE and GRE/
progesterone responsive element (PRE) resides at the third
position of the half-site that is essential for discrimination
between the two classes of HREs. Replacement of the thymine found in almost all GRE/PREs by adenine results in

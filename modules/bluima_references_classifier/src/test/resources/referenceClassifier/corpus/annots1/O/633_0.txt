FIG. 4. ERC forms a complex with liprin- in vitro and in vivo. A–D, GST pull-down assays. A, GST fusion proteins containing the ERC-binding
domains of liprin- isoforms (aa 351–673 of liprin- 1, 369–696 of liprin- 2, 333–645 of liprin- 3, and 185–479 of liprin- 4) or GST alone were incubated
with HEK293T cell lysates transfected with EGFP-ERC2, FLAG-GIT1 (positive control), or Myc-GRIP1 (negative control). The precipitates were analyzed
by immunoblotting with EGFP, FLAG, and Myc antibodies. Input, 5%. B, GST-liprin- 1 (aa 351–673, 351–512, or 513–673) or GST alone was incubated
with HEK293T cell lysates transfected with EGFP-ERC2, FLAG-GIT1 (positive control), or Myc-GRIP2 (negative control). Input, 5%. C, GST-liprin- 1 (aa
351–673) or GST alone was incubated with HEK293T cell lysates transfected with EGFP-ERC2 (aa 1–957, 1–954, 1–693, and 773–957) or EGFP alone.
Input, 10%. D, GST-liprin- 1 (aa 351–673) or GST alone was incubated with H6-ERC2 (aa 1–957 or 725–957). The precipitates were analyzed by
immunoblotting with His antibodies. Input, 5%. E–K, coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cell lysates transfected doubly or singly
with the indicated HA-liprin- and EGFP-ERC constructs were immunoprecipitated with HA or EGFP antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were
immunoblotted with HA and EGFP antibodies. ERC1b is a splice variant of ERC1 (22). IP, immunoprecipitation. Input, 5%. L–M, in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. Deoxycholate extracts of the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain were immunoprecipitated with liprin- 1, ERC2 (1292 in L and
1296 in M), or control (IgG) antibodies and were immunoblotted with the antibodies indicated. Input, 10%.

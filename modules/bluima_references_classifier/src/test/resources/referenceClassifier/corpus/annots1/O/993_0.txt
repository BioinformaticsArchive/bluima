in Figure 9(C), this administration significantly attenuated
sensory recovery on the day 6, 7, and 8, as evaluated by the
adhesive removal test (Fig. 9C and Supplementary Video 1
online). In addition, the results from the contralateral side
indicated that the normal sensory function was not affected by
this bumetanide administration (Fig. 9D and Supplementary
Video 2 online). All these behavioral data suggest the significant
attenuation of functional recovery in sensory functions by the
bumetanide treatment.

Figure 2. Traffic and postsynaptic retention of AMPARs dependent on GluR1, Sg, and SAP97.
R is the nonphosphorylated form of the AMPAR Sg complex formed via the GluR1â€“Sg interaction, R is the exstrasynaptic phosphorylated form, R is synaptic R , R is the immediate
p ps p f
product of R dephosphorylation, and R is a nonphosphorylable form, which slowly converts to
ps d
R; L is SAP97, and L is phosphorylated L.

Figure 5. Evoked and spontaneous I PSC s have similar kinetics. A, Scatterplot of tdecay versus trise for 321 sI PSC s (open circles) recorded in a cell
at 35Â°C. The single slow sIPSC is the same event that is shown in Figure
4 A (second trace). The other 320 sI PSC s were recorded 30 sec before and
30 sec after this event. Also shown are the kinetic parameters for the
IPSCs evoked by SP and SL-M stimulation (open squares) shown in B. B,
Averaged and normalized fast sI PSC, SP-evoked I PSC, slow sI PSC, and
SL -M-evoked I PSC recorded in the same cell as in A. Fit parameters
include the following: fast sI PSC, trise = 0.4 msec and tdec1,2 = 3.5 msec
(56%) and 13.7 msec; SP-evoked I PSC, trise = 0.8 msec and tdec1,2 = 3.9
msec (62%) and 18.5 msec; slow sI PSC, trise = 7.2 msec and tdecay = 52.2
msec; SL -M-evoked I PSC, trise = 6.0 msec and tdecay = 53.9 msec.

(2010). The magnesium concentration in the external solution
is set to 1 mM; )m is the electrical distance of the magnesium
binding site from the outside of the membrane (set at 0.8); R, the
molar gas constant (8.31434 J mol-1 K-1); F, the Faraday constant
(9.64867.104 C mol-1); T, the absolute temperature (273.15 K); g 1
and g 2 are the conductances associated with the open states when
one or two glutamate molecules are bound and are 40 and 247 pS
respectively; a - 0.01 is the steepness of the voltage-dependent
transition from g 1 to g 2.
The total synaptic current is calculated from the sum of AMPAR
and NMDAR currents.

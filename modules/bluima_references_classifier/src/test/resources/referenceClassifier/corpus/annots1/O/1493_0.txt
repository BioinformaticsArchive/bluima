Conclusion
The evidence reviewed here and the numerous studies on
phase and frequency relations among oscillating cortical
networks suggest the existence of mechanisms for the adjustment of oscillation frequencies and of phase relations
among oscillating cell populations (reviewed in Ref. [39]).
Thus, the oscillatory patterning of neuronal activity offers
a range of options to exploit the temporal domain for the
dynamic routing of signals within the rigid network of fixed
anatomical connections. This, in turn, can be used to
support a variety of functions such as feature binding
[1,2], polysensory integration [72,73], sensory-motor coordination [6,21], attention-dependent selection of signals
[15,25,29,30,33,74], dynamic association of the ever-changing contents of working memory [17] and, through spike
timing-dependent plasticity, the formation of long-term
memories [16,75].
All of these functions are associated with oscillatory
activity, in most cases in the high-frequency range of the
beta- and gamma-bands. These high-frequency oscillations
appear to be particularly well suited for these functions
because there is a direct relation between the selectivity
with which dynamic routing can be accomplished and the
oscillation frequency: as the frequency increases, the precision of spike timing increases and, at the same time, the
network becomes more sensitive to small variations in
spike timing. These considerations suggest that the adjustment of spike timing by the gamma cycle is not an epiphenomenon but a fundamental mechanism in cortical
information processing [66,71].

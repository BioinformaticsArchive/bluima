The parameters of the fastest mEPSC time courses are
consistent with AMPA receptor-mediated currents and
this was confirmed pharmacologically. However, the time
courses were slightly longer than those reported in other
studies (Finkel & Redman, 1983; Silver et al. 1992; Jonas et
al. 1993). We think that this difference is largely due to
insufficient space-clamp since excitatory synapses are not
on somata of layer II pyramidal cells (Larkman, 1991) and
because we did not routinely compensate series resistance
or electrode and whole-cell capacitance.

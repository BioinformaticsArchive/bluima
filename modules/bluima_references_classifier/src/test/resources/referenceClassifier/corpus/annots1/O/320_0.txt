Figure 1. Stimulation of the raphe nucleus promotes plateau potentials in spinal motoneurons. A, Scheme of the brainstem spinal cord preparation. A catheter inserted between the
backbone and the brainstem was continuously perfusing the preparation with Ringer's solution
(arrows). A bipolar electrode was positioned at the ventral third of the midline of the brainstem
section (i.e., at the level of the raphe nucleus) (see Materials and Methods). Intracellular recording of motoneurons was performed with a microelectrode positioned in the lateral part of the
ventral horn of the spinal cord section. B, Control response to a depolarizing current pulse. C,
After stimulation of the raphe nucleus, the same current protocol induced a train of action
potentials occurring at a higher frequency and followed by an afterdepolarization with a superimposed afterdischarge (arrow), indicative of an underlying plateau potential. For B and C:
bottom trace, current injected intracellularly; middle trace, membrane potential; top plot, in-stantaneous spike frequency. D, Average response of a motoneuron to depolarizing current
pulses in control conditions (average of 20 consecutive traces; SD in gray). E, Average response
of the same motoneuron when the depolarizing current pulse was preceded by stimulation of
the raphe nucleus 300 ms before the depolarizing current pulse. Note the inhibition of the AHP.
The action potential was cut to fit in the frame of the figure.

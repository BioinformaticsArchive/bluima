tional constrained task. Cells and muscles were followed
through the repertoire of natural movements and sleep, providing a first glimpse of activity within the motor system during
normal behavior. Although patterns of correlation for individual cells could differ between conditions, the overall correspondence within our results supports the tacit assumption
underlying many previous experiments that data obtained un-der restrained conditions can be more broadly informative of
the neural control of natural movements. Furthermore, the
ability to record the same cells continuously for several weeks
opens up new possibilities for studying neural control of
complex behaviors and motor learning (Jackson et al. 2006b).
Finally, linking autonomously recorded cell activity to functional electrical stimulation may lead to the development of
neural prosthetics to restore volitional motor function after
injury.

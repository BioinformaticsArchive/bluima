Ambient GABA in vivo and in vitro

In order to persistently activate GABAB receptors, GABA had to be
present at a sufficient concentration in the extracellular space.
Estimated concentrations of ambient GABA vary between tens of
nanomolar and few micromolar (Tossman et al., 1986; Dalby, 2000;
Kennedy et al., 2002; Hernandez et al., 2003). Recently, the ambient
GABA concentration in primate PFC in vivo was measured to be
4.1 Â± 1.6 lm (Zhang et al., 2007). However, such high concentrations
of ambient GABA cannot be expected in an acute brain slice, as slices
typically display very low spontaneous activity (Sanchez-Vives &
McCormick, 2000; Neubauer & Berger, 2008). Therefore, we
approximated the in vivo situation (Zhang et al., 2007), by using a
mACSF (Sanchez-Vives & McCormick, 2000; Neubauer & Berger,
2008). Under these conditions, we found a substantial GABAB
receptor-mediated tonic inhibition of L2 / 3 mPFC pyramidal cells. Our
approach is further justified, as the ambient GABA concentration
found in vivo perfectly matches the EC50 for GABAB agonist-induced
currents. We found an EC50 of about 1 lm for baclofen-induced
outward currents in L2 / 3 mPFC pyramidal neurons. This value is
comparable to what is reported for other native GABAB receptors
(Bon & Galvan, 1996; Cruz et al., 2004), and also closely matches the
EC50 for GABA-evoked GIRK currents in a heterologous expression
system (Jones et al., 1998).
Phasic and tonic GABAA receptor-mediated currents are highly
correlated, suggesting that the main source of ambient GABA results

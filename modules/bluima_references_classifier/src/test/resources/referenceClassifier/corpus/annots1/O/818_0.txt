Mice
C57BL/6 mice were used. Morning of the vaginal plug is embryonic day
(E) 0.5; the first 24 h after birth is postnatal day (P) 0. Experiments were
done following institutional approved protocols. Brain sections were
prepared as described previously (Hamasaki and others 2004; Litwack
and others 2004).

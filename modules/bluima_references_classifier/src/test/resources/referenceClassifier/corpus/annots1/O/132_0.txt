proceeded well without using quantitative methods, any deeper
consideration of the structure of axons requires more systematic
and quantitative methods, some of which we have applied here.
Simple measures, such as the lengths of axons and the order,
number, and length of branches are needed, since there are so
few direct measurements of filled cortical axons in the literature. Here the 2D dendrogram is invaluable as a means of
organizing and representing the axonal tree. In the dendrogram,
the axonal branches and their relative lengths, and the tree-like
structure of the axons are readily apparent, quantitative measurements are easily made, and the topology of the axonal trees
can be characterized.

PARE 4.4. Just as with the standard statistical approach,
orbit convergence and binocular visual field overlap are
significantly correlated (r 0.82; P 0.01; n 27).
The standard and phylogenetically controlled ap-proaches are congruent in indicating that orbit convergence and binocular visual field overlap are positively
correlated. The two approaches are also in agreement that
convergence explains approximately 70% of the variance
in the size of the binocular visual field in mammals. Orbit
convergence is isometrically related to binocular visual
field overlap across mammals. In general, these data in-dicate that reorientation of the bony orbit such that they
face the same direction is highly correlated with expansion of the size of the binocular zone of the visual field.

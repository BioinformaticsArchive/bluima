et al., 2001) used in this study consists of a standard pairing protocol in which the frequency of
the pairing has been changed. We also considered a hippocampal culture data set (Wang et
al., 2005) which consists of pair, triplet, and
quadruplet protocols. Because both data sets
disagree on some specific protocols (at low frequency of the pairing protocol, no potentiation
is elicited in Sjo ̈ stro ̈ m's data, whereas a large
amount of potentiation is present in Wang's
data) and because the preparations are different, we fitted our models with different parameters for each data set.
Synaptic learning rule. Our new triplet-based
model of STDP is an extension of classical pairbased STDP models. Traditional mechanistic
models of STDP involve a small number of variables that are updated by presynaptic and
postsynaptic firing events (Kistler and van
Hemmen, 2000; Abarbanel et al., 2002; Gerstner and Kistler, 2002; Karmarkar and Buonomano, 2002). The new triplet rule is formulated
in such a framework.
To introduce the variables used in our
model, we considered the process of synaptic
transmission. Whenever a presynaptic spike ar-rives at an excitatory synapse, glutamate is re-leased into the synaptic cleft and binds to glutamate receptors. Let r denote the amount of
1

glutamate bound to a postsynaptic receptor.
The variable r increases whenever there is a
1

presynaptic spike and decreases back to zero
otherwise with a time constant of . This can
be written as follows:

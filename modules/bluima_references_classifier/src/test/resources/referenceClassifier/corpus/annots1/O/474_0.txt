Fig. 1. EB-Induced PR-A and PR-B Isoforms in the MBH of
Isoform-Specific Null Mutant and Wild-Type Female Mice
All female mice were ovariectomized and primed with EB
(0.5 g sc) 2 wk after surgery. The animals were killed under
anesthesia 48 h after priming, and MBH was isolated and
processed for Western immunoblotting as described in Methods and Materials. Cytosol protein (100 g) was loaded onto
7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane, membrane was probed with antibodies to progesterone receptors, and antibody binding was detected by
chemiluminescence as detailed in Materials and Methods.
The experiment was performed three times for each sample,
and a representative autoradiograph is shown. Top panel
depicts PR isoforms detected in MBH cytosol from PR wild
type (PR / ; lanes 1–2), PR-A isoform null mutant
(PRAKO / ; lanes 3–4), PR-B isoform null mutant
(PRBKO / ; lanes 5–6), and PR null mutant (PRKO / ; lanes
7–8). The molecular weight markers are in lane 9, adjacent to
lane 8. The bottom panel represents the -actin in the same
tissues. Each lane represents tissue from individual MBH (n
8 for each group). The PR-A and PR-B bands were quantified
by densitometry and normalized to -actin, and the ratios of
PR-A and PR-B to -actin were determined. PR-B/ -actin
ratios were 0.51 0.01 (PR / ), 0.50 0.02 (PRAKO / ),
0 0 (PRBKO / ), and 0 0 (PRKO). No significant differences were found between the PRAKO / and their wild-type
littermates in the PR-B/ -actin ratios (P 0.05). PR-A/ -actin
ratios were 0.40 0.03 (PR / ), 0 0 (PRAKO / ), 0.33 0.05
(PRBKO / ), and 0 0 (PRKO). Statistically significant differences were not found between PRBKO / and their wild-type
littermates in the PR-A/ -actin ratios (P 0.05).

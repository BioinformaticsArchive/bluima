3.4.1 Word Sense Disambiguation

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of determining which meaning of a word is be-ing used in a particular context (e.g., “hard” in the
sense of a challenging task vs. a marble floor). We
asked a user to employ DUALIST for 10 minutes
for each of three benchmark WSD corpora (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004): Hard (3 senses), Line
(6 senses), and Serve (4 senses). Each instance represents a sentence using the ambiguous word, and
features are lowercased unigram and bigram terms
from the surrounding context in the sentence. The
learned models' prediction accuracies (on the sentences not labeled by the user) were: 83.0%, 78.4%,
and 78.7% for Hard, Line, and Serve (respectively),
which appears to be comparable to recent supervised
learning results in the WSD literature on these data
sets. However, our results were achieved in less than
10 minutes of effort each, by labeling an average of
76 sentences and 32 words or phrases per task (compared to the thousands of labeled training sentences
used in previous work).

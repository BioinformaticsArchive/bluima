SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1. We tested several hypotheses with respect to the mechanisms
and processes that control the firing characteristics and determine
the spatial and temporal dynamics of intracellular Ca”' in CA3
hippocampal neurons. In particular, we were interested to know
1) whether bursting and nonbursting behavior of CA3 neurons
could be accounted for in a morphologically realistic model using
a number of the known ionic conductances; 2) whether such a
model is robust across different cell morphologies; 3) whether
some particular nonuniform distribution of Ca2+ channels is re-quired for bursting; and 4) whether such a model can reproduce the
magnitude and spatial distribution of intracellular Ca2+ transients
determined from fluorescence imaging studies and can predict reasonable intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( [ Ca2']J distribution for
CA3 neurons.
2. For this purpose we have developed a highly detailed model
of the distribution and densities of membrane ion channels in hippocampal CA3 bursting and nonbursting pyramidal neurons. This
model reproduces both the experimentally observed firing modes
and the dynamics of intracellular Ca2+.
3. The kinetics of the membrane ionic conductances are based
on available experimental data. This model incorporates a single
Na+ channel, three Ca2' channels (Ca,, Ca,, and Ca, ), three
Ca2+-independent K+ channels ( KDR, &, and KM), two Ca2+dependent I(+ channels (Kc and KAHP) , and intracellular Ca2+related processes such as bufffering, pumping, and radial diffusion.
4. To test the robustness of the model, we applied it to six
different morphologically accurate reconstructions of CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In every neuron, Ca2' channels, Ca2+related processes, and Ca2'-dependent K+ channels were uniformly distributed over the entire cell. Ca2+-independent K+ channels were placed on the soma and the proximal apical dendrites.
For each reconstructed cell we were able to reproduce bursting
and nonbursting firing characteristics as well as Ca2+ transients
and distributions for both somatic and synaptic stimulations.
5. Our simulation results suggest that CA3 pyramidal cell bursting behavior does not require any special distribution of Ca”-dependent channels and mechanisms. Furthermore, a simple in-crease in the Ca2+ -independent K+ conductances is sufficient to
change the firing mode of our CA3 neurons from bursting to nonbursting.
6. The model also displays [ Ca2+li transients and distributions
that are consistent with fluorescent imaging data. Peak [Ca2+]i
distribution for synaptic stimulation of the nonbursting model is
broader when compared with somatic stimulation. Somatic stimulation of the bursting model shows a broader distribution in [Ca2'li
when compared with the nonbursting model. Synaptic stimulation
in both models produces a [Ca”]i distribution that has a peak
around the site of stimulation.

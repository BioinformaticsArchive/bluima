grains compared to the background. Proximal dendrites
were thicker and clearly GABA-L-immunoreactive (Fig.
4A-C). Profiles that were not HRP-filled were also found to
be GABA-L-immunoreactive (Fig. 4A,B). The density of
gold particles over the various HRP-filled profiles and the
background was quantified as described in Materials and
Methods. Sections through the soma of the neuron showed

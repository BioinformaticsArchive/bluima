Simulation of growth cone migration and guidance
Various random walk models capable of capturing crucial
stochastic [5,27,28] and deterministic [5,27,29] aspects of
growth cone movement have been adapted to simulate
growth cone migration [9,30-32]. We use the simplest of
these models. Migration is simulated in 2-dimensions,
and correspondingly two equations are used. One equation models migration in the direction of axonal outgrowth (∆y ); the second models migration in the
ct
orthogonal direction (∆x ) [30]. Explicitly,
ct


∆xct = ext (1)

∆y = e + ∆y (2)
ct yt avg


where ∆x and ∆y equal the change in the growth cone
ct ct
centroid coordinates, x and y respectively, over a time
cc
interval τ. The e and e terms are drawn from independxt yt
ent and normal random distributions with zero means

and constant standard deviations σdx τ and σdy τ
respectively. These deviations are explicitly normalized
with respect to time step τ [33] to generate behaviors

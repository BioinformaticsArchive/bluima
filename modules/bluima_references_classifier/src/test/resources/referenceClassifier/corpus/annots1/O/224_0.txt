Putative functional role of dCINs
We can begin to speculate on the roles of the rhythmically active
dCINs on the basis of their preferred phase of firing. During
locomotion, ipsilateral iL2 flexor bursts are in-phase with contralateral cL4–cL5 extensor bursts to promote alternating movement of the limbs (Kiehn and Kjaerulff, 1996). Figure 8 shows
that dCI Ns that fire predominantly in-phase with iL2 (bins 6 –10;

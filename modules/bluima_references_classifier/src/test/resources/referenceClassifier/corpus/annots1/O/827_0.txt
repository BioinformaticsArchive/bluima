Reduction in the Spread of Activity between Used and
Deprived Cortical Areas
We next made an analysis aimed at establishing whether the
observed changes in the spread of activity through the layer
2/3 network were the result of enhanced propagation between
the 2 used cortical areas or a reduction in propagation between
the used and the deprived cortical areas. This involved
computing for each individual whisker response, the ratio of
the response recorded in the first-order SuW segment ROI to
that recorded in the PW ROI. The ratios of SuW segment-to-PW
ROIs for each time point were averaged across all whisker
responses to give the average temporal profiles shown in Figure 5.
The analysis revealed that DE pairing resulted in a major
reduction in the SuW segment-to-PW ratio calculated for C-row areas (Fig. 5A1) and concomitantly a more modest
reduction in ratios calculated for E-row areas (Fig. 5A2).
Consistent with this result, when the same analysis was done
for the experiments using the CD-pairing protocol, SuW
segment-to-PW ratios calculated for the deprived E-row areas
were reduced, whereas ratios calculated for the paired C-row
areas were unchanged (Fig. 5B1,B2).
For statistical comparison, we calculated the SuW segmentto-PW ratio in Av20to50 images. After DE pairing, the average
SuW segment-to-PW ratio for C-row areas was significantly
reduced in the DE-paired group (control 0.69 ± 0.03, deprived
0.53 ± 0.03, P < 0.001, data sets for control and DE-paired
responses as described above). The average ratio for E-row
areas was also reduced, though the reduction in this case was
more modest (control 0.64 ± 0.02, deprived 0.58 ± 0.02, P =
0.07). For the CD-pairing experimental series, segment-to-PW
ratios calculated for the deprived E-row areas were reduced
after CD pairing, though the reduction was not statistically
significant (control 0.65 ± 0.04, deprived 0.58 ± 0.02, P = 0.15,

PSW seizures are due to similar mechanisms that account for
the depolarizing/hyperpolarizing components of the slow sleep
oscillation, on one hand, and the spike/“wave” components of
SW complexes, on the other hand (see below). Although these
data point to cortically initiated SW seizures and to the steady
hyperpolarization in a majority of thalamocortical neurons
during such seizures, the remaining TC neurons are capable of
firing rebound spike bursts during a cortical SW seizure (Steriade and Contreras 1995) and thus may potentiate and disseminate cortical seizures. Thus our data point to the intracortical
origin of these seizures. After a few seconds, they irradiate to
the ipsilateral thalamus (Fig. 22) as well as to other subcortical
structures.
Subsequent research by other teams (Pinault et al. 1998;
Slaght et al. 2000) using intracellular recordings from TC
neurons during spontaneous SW discharges in a genetic model
of absence epilepsy in rats similarly demonstrated that the main
events which characterize the activity of an overwhelming
majority (>90%) of TC neurons are a tonic hyperpolarization,
present throughout the SW seizure, and rhythmic IPSPs. The
results of these in vivo study emphasized that the intracellular
activity of TC neurons during SW seizures does not involve
rhythmic sequences of GABA receptor-mediated IPSPs, but

Indeed, double immunofluorescent reactions demonstrated the presence of PV in
these large diameter horizontally running
axons (Fig. 7 H, I ). However, another part
of the basket cell axon, the pinceau, was
completely immunonegative for the
Nav1.1 subunit (Fig. 7H, arrow). Further
analysis of molecular layer INs revealed
that their AISs were Nav1.1 subunit im-munopositive. Double-labeling experiments demonstrated a polarized, nonoverlapping distribution of the Nav1.6 and
Nav1.1 subunits along the AIS (Fig. 7K ).
The Nav1.1 subunit immunolabeling was
restricted to a short, proximal segment of
the AIS whereas immunolabeling for
Nav1.6 subunit was evenly distributed in
the rest of AIS. The PV immunopositive
Purkinje cell processes were immunonegative for the Nav1.1 subunit (Fig. 7 H, J ).
In summary, Purkinje cells comprise the
only studied cell type without a detectable
expression of the Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits, and the examined Nav and Kv channel subunits showed the most complex
subcellular distribution patterns in the ax-ons of molecular layer INs.
A summary and a schematic illustration of our results are presented in Figure
8. Neocortical and hippocampal PCs do
not express the Nav1.1 subunit in their
AISs at a detectable level. In layer 2/3 and
CA1 PCs the density of the Nav1.6 subunit
gradually increases toward the distal part
of the AIS. The Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits
are present more distally and show a similar proximo-distal gradient along the AIS.
In layer 5 and CA3 PCs, a high density of
the Nav1.6 subunit is already seen at the
axon hillock and is uniformly present
along the whole AIS, whereas the Kv1.1
and Kv1.2 subunits appear at a detectable
density more distally. In M/T cells in the
MOB, only Nav1.6 and Kv1.2 subunits are
detected, and they colocalize along the en-tire length of the AIS. The AIS of cerebellar
Purkinje cells is immunoreactive only for
the Nav1.6 subunit, which is evenly distributed within the AIS. GABAergic INs in
the neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum,
and MOB contain all four subunits at high
densities in their AISs. These INs fall into
two categories based on the distribution of
the Nav1.1 subunit. In neocortical, hippocampal, cerebellar INs and deep SACs, the
Nav1.1 subunit is restricted to the proximal
part of the AIS, whereas in SACs of the EPL,
the Nav1.1 subunit is uniformly distributed
along the entire length of the AIS.

FIG. 8. Stimulation of L1 in vitro evokes excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
conductances. A, left panels: averaged synaptic responses of a layer 2/3 neuron
to distant L1 stimulation. Right panels: averaged synaptic responses of the
same neuron to local superficial stimulation. Dashed trace shows the V in the
m

absence of current injection. Continuous traces are the V with current steps of
m

100 pA. B: current–voltage (I–V) relationship for the peak amplitude of the
PSPs in A. Lines represent linear fits to the data. C: synaptic reversal potentials
calculated from the traces in A. D: total input conductances of the neuron in A.
E: derived excitatory (continuous lines) and inhibitory (dashed lines) synaptic
conductances for the responses in A.

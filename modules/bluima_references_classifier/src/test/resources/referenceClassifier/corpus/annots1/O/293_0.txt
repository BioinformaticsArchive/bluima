HOW CAN WE PROVE THAT DENDRITES
ARE INVOLVED IN COMPUTATION?

Proving that dendrites are both necessary and sufficient for a particular computation relevant to behavior is a very difficult challenge.
Necessity is within reach for the relatively simple case where the computation is accomplished by a single identified neuron, as is the case
for some invertebrate sensory neurons (see text) or when the un-derlying biophysical mechanism depends on a single channel type.
Demonstrating sufficiency is much more difficult, particularly be-cause dendritic computation is a process that is tightly interlinked
with the proper functioning of the entire system. Nevertheless, we
outline here a list of objectives that must be achieved to prove that
dendrites are required for computation. These should not necessarily
be addressed in a linear sequence; rather, it will be beneficial to attack
these problems in parallel.


Identify the Computation:

Probing the contribution of dendrites to computation is possible only
when the computation of the neuron bearing the dendrites is identified. This requires identifying a simple behavior that involves a recognizable kind of computation (e.g., filtering, convolution, pattern
recognition) and tracing it to the neurons responsible.


Defining the Mechanism:

Use recordings (e.g., electrophysiological or imaging) from dendrites
of these neurons in an accessible preparation (e.g., brain slices) to
define the dendritic signals and biophysical mechanisms that may un-derlie the behavior.


Correlation in the Intact Preparation:

Use recordings from dendrites in an intact preparation to show strong
correlations between dendritic signals linked with the identified computation and the behavior of the animal.


Manipulation to Define a Causal Link:

Manipulate a dendritic mechanism to determine if it is both necessary
and sufficient to explain the computation. Selectively knock out the
mechanism and demonstrate that the behavior is impaired. Activate
or modify the dendritic mechanism to demonstrate that the behavior
is modified in the expected direction.


Modeling the Computation:

Use modeling to define an algorithm that describes the
computation, or sequence of computations, performed by the dendrites that can plausibly explain the behavior. Modeling of single neurons and neural networks can also be used to confirm that the computation can convey a significant benefit (which can help to establish
sufficiency).

and electrical connections among inhibitory neocortical neurons
has not been determined.
Thus, we next studied electrical coupling among FS cells during the first postnatal week (Fig. 5). To test for electrical coupling,
we applied prolonged voltage steps (200 ms, 30 mV) to one of the
potentially coupled FS cells while current deflections recorded in
voltage-clamp mode indicated electrical coupling between these
two neurons. In P3â€“P5, animals we did not identify electrical
coupling among FS3 FS pairs (0 out of 13 pairs). The earliest

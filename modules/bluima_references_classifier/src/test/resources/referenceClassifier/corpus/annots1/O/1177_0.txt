For the current versions of Protégé, the above properties can be
set as the default set of properties for NIFSTD. NIFSTD has other
annotation properties associated with version control which will
bedescribedinSection“Versioningpolicy.”Whenextractingexternal sources using MIREOT principles, NIFSTD keeps the identical
source URIs along with the original identifier fragments unaltered. This approach allows NIF to avoid extra mapping efforts
with the community sources. Prior to the MIREOT approach,
the practice was simply to assign new class ID for any externally
sourced classes which led to maintenance difficulty due to too
many mapping annotations. We still have some mappings from
the BIRNLex vocabularies, as we did not have the MIREOT tool
when we started.

and final positioning. Notably, while the level of Robo1
mRNA expression remains constant in deep-layer neurons
(layer V), its expression in the upper part of layers II/III is
upregulated during the early postnatal period (Fig. 1). Moreover, Robo1 protein is predominantly distributed in the apical
neurites of these neurons and primarily near the MZ (Fig. 1P′,
U′). In agreement with its expression pattern, we found that
Robo1 plays a critical role in the positioning of these neurons
during postnatal stages, where the major changes in the neuronal distribution of Robo1-suppressed layers II/III pyramidal
cells occur between P4 and P8 (Fig. 5A). This implies that
possible interactions between Robo1 and other molecules
during the first postnatal week may be crucial in determining
the final positions of these cells, with those that lack Robo1
failing to descend to deeper positions in the CP.
What, then, is the cellular mechanism by which Robo1
regulates the correct positioning of layers II/III pyramidal
neurons? In principle, the precise inside-out distribution of
temporal cohorts of cortical neurons can be achieved through
a number of different mechanisms. Most simply, Robo1 may
regulate correct positioning of layers II/III neurons by promoting their early migration (Fig. 4), as delay in entering the
CP would result in their more superficial positioning.
However, although our results demonstrate that loss of Robo1
affects the time of entry of layers II/III neurons into the CP,
hence early migration is delayed, we found that most E15.5
Robo1-suppressed cells are able to reach the pia by P4, when
positional defects are least prominent. Furthermore, if all
Robo1-suppressed cells were delayed in their migration in a
similar manner, one would expect such cells born at E15.5 to
take deeper positions within the CP than cells born at E16.5.
However, this appears not to be the case in the sequential
electroporation experiments (Fig. 6). As such, these results
imply that neuronal positioning of layers II/III pyramidal
neurons requires later action of Robo1 after they reach the

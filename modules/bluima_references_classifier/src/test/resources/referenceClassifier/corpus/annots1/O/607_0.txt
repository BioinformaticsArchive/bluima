viable metabolic labeling tool to study higher or-ganisms in future proteomics experiments.
Taken together, isotope labeling is a well-es-tablished and serviceable tool in the field of
proteomics, especially advantageous in quantitative proteomics. However, it has intrinsic drawbacks. Other than being hazardous to operators,
metabolic labeling is obviously inapplicable to the
study of human proteome, where in vivo labeling
is obviously out of the question. Worse yet,
Yeargin et al. (39) recently reported that metabolic
incorporation of radioisotopes into mammalian
cells, including human peripheral blood lymphocytes, could significantly interfere with the cellular physiology. For example, an elevation in the
p53 concentration, owing to metabolic labeling,
was observed, causing human cells to undergo
apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Therefore,
one must be cautious when evaluating protein profiles generated by metabolic labeling. Furthermore, it has also been indicated that owing to the
low radioactivity in commercial 14C-leucine and
3H-leucine, metabolic labeling strategies using
these isotopes cannot detect low-abundance proteins efficiently (30).

4. Subproteomics Approaches
Subproteomics refers to the study of subsets of
proteins in a proteome. This is certainly desirable
in cases where only selected classes of proteins
are of interest. For example, phosphoproteins are
essential for better understanding of cellular signaling pathways. Fluorescent dyes that specifically stain phosphoproteins, as mentioned in
Subheading 2.2., offer the advantage of selectively identifying phosphorylated proteins from
other proteins in a complex proteome, thus eliminating the need to characterize total proteins (27).
Hydrophobic and low-abundance proteins for ex-ample, are normally “difficult” proteins to work
with when conventional two-dimensional techniques are used. They are therefore seldom re-ported in a standard protein profiling experiment.
Consequently, this makes them much more interesting “targets” to study because, typically, little
information is known about them. Subproteomics
approaches have emerged that allow studies of

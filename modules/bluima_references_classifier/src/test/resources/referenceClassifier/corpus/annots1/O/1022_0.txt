Due to its well-defined columnar and laminar organization, the vibrissal cortex in
rodents is a highly suitable model to study
cortical circuits.1-3 In particular, the segregation into column and septum related
regions of the vibrissal cortex allows one
to align and compare 3D morphologies
of neurons from different animals. In our
in vivo approach, the individual neuron
reconstructions are therefore always performed in the context of a common reference frame containing three anatomical
landmarks: (1) the barrel contours in granular layer 4, (2) the pia surface and (3) the

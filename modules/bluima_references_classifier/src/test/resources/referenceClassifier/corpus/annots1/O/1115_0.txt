Figure 1. Manual and algorithmic
identification of sPSCs, choice of the
template and recording mode
A, the first 2 s of a recording epoch broken up into
200 ms periods, each vertically separated. The total
number of events detected by eye was 67, of which 65
were recovered (0) and two were considered as
missed (1) by the template-matching algorithm.
B, the template was chosen from a representative
PSC. The template is truncated (continuous line),
with the truncated portion of the time course
indicated by the dashed line. C and D, two
subsequent recording sequences from the same cell
illustrated in voltage- and current-clamp,
respectively. E, the two templates used to detect
spontaneous synaptic currents in voltage- (black)
and current-clamp (grey). The current-clamp
template has been inverted to allow for better
comparison. F, cumulative probability density
functions (cPDF) of f1 for the data recovered in
voltage- and current-clamp shown in black and grey,
respectively.

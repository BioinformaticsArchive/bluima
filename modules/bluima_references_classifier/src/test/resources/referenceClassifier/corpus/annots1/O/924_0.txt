Axonal Measures. For the axonal parameters, star pyramids
showed more boutons than pyramids (P < 0.05) and, although
not statistically significant, also more than spiny stellates.
Another significant difference was that spiny stellate axons
sent more boutons to supragranular layers than star pyramidal
or pyramidal cells (P < 0.05). This fits well with their assumed
role as the main relay cell for translaminar intracolumnar
processing. Along the same line, also the second major difference can be interpreted (Table 2). Spiny stellate cells displayed

Methods. General procedures and patients. Twelve
paraplegic and six tetraplegic acute SCI patients, aged
between 15 and 63 years (mean, 35 years), were in spinal
shock when admitted to our paraplegic center for rehabilitation and were included in this prospective study. Ap-proval by the local ethics committee was obtained. All
patients gave their informed consent to the clinical and
electrophysiologic examinations. Three sensory incomplete
but motor complete tetraplegic patients (ASIA B), three
sensory and motor complete tetraplegic patients (ASIA A),
and 12 sensory and motor complete paraplegic patients
(ASIA A) with neurologic levels of lesion above Th10 were
studied (table). In five tetraplegic and nine paraplegic pa-tients, the study was performed over a period of 6 months.
In three complete tetraplegic patients (not listed in the
table), the flexor reflex was recorded at a chronic stage (2
to 4 years after SCI).
The clinical examinations and electrophysiologic recordings were performed in parallel as early as possible during
spinal shock, usually within the first week (see table), and
1, 3, and 4 weeks, as well as 2, 4, and 6 months after SCI.
Special attention was given to assure that the patient did

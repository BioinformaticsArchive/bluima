Fig. 1. Montage of CLSM tiled image stacks from CA3 pyramidal neuron, integrated with VIAS and skeletonized and digitized using
NeuronStudio. (A) XY, XZ and ZY projections of the integrated volume. Individual subtiles selected from the original 12 image stacks and
integrated with VIAS are outlined in green. (B) Skeletonized branches from the apical tree of the neuron in A. The medial axis is shown in blue,
superimposed on the XY projection. (C) Skeleton with superimposed diameters (red circles) computed using the Rayburst sampling algorithm
within NeuronStudio. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

1993a; Kang and Kayano, 1994). In group I, but not in group II
cells, the first action potential of the evoked firing was followed
by a DAP. Interestingly, in the cat motor cortex, it has been re-ported that pyramidal cells with DAPs displayed no adaptation,
while those lacking DAPs exhibited adaptation (Kang and
Kayano, 1994).
Second, in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses, only
the group I cells exhibited an initial depolarizing `sag' and a
depolarizing rebound at the cessation of the pulses. The initial
`sag' is classically attributed to the Ih current (Spain et al.,
1987). It has been proposed that the depolarizing rebound, also
observed in RS cells of guinea pig parietal and medial frontal
cortex slices (Friedman and Gutnick, 1987; de la Pe√±a and
Geijo-Barrientos, 1996), was due to a low threshold calcium
current.
Third, during the sustained evoked discharge, the sAHPs of
group I and group II cells presented distinct characteristics.
Indeed, the sAHPs of group I cells were monophasic and those of
group II cells were biphasic with a progressive lengthening of
the second component that was correlated with an increase in
the ISIs during spike frequency adaptation. In addition, the firing
threshold remained constant in group I cells and progressively
increased in group II cells. Thus, both the prolonged membrane
hyperpolarization due to the second phase of the sA HP and
the progressive increase in the firing threshold are likely to participate in spike frequency adaptation of group II cells. Recently,
a negative correlation between spike threshold and the rate of
membrane depolarization preceding the spike has been ob-served in cortical RS cells by Azouz and Gray (Azouz and Gray,
2000), who proposed that increases in spike threshold result
from a decrease in the availability of Na+ channels during slow
depolarizations. It can be suggested that a similar process is
involved in the progressive increase in firing threshold observed
in group II RS cells in the present study.

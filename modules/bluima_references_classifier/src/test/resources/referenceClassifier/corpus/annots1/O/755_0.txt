sion and 250-450 pm in the anteroposterior dimension. Terminal arbors having a sparser layer IV plexus (Table 1; Figs. 3,
8-10, 11A) extend 650-l 500 pm in the mediolateral dimension
and 400-l 450 pm in the anteroposterior dimension. This mixed
arrangement of terminal arbors occurs along with varying de-grees of overlap between arbors. Even arbors with a layer IV
plexus that was relatively restricted in the horizontal dimension
could have adjacent terminal fields with little or no overlap
(Fig. 6).
Relationshipbetweenprojectionareaandbranchdensity
In animals in which the infraorbital nerve was cut, the projection
area of the layer IV plexus ranges from 0.06 to 0.78 mm2 (Table
1). Thus, the sizes of the layer IV plexuses of terminal arbors
from the vibrissae region were larger, and individual values
varied to a much greater extent than was observed in normal
animals (0.02-0.21 mm*; Jensen and Killackey, 1987). Furthermore, terminal arbors from animals in which the infraorbital nerve was cut have, on the average, only 25.5% of the
density of branches of terminal arbors from the vibrissae region
of normal animals (normal: 436 -t 62 branches/mm$ nervecut: 111 ? 33 branches/mm3). In a manner similar to that re-ported for normal animals, the relationship between branch
density and projection area of the layer IV plexus of the reconstructed terminal arbors can be described by the hyperbolic
function:
Branch density = 6.76 * (projection area)-1-L8.
A log-log transformation yields a linear model (p < 0.01):
log(branch density) = - 1.18 * log(projection area) + 0.83.
The higher-order quadratic and cubic models are not significant
@ > 0.8). Furthermore, the log of the branch density is negatively carrelated with the log of the projection area (r = -0.86,
p < 0.01; Fig. 12). A comparison on the regression plot for
normal layer IV plexuses (Fig. 12, solid line; replotted from
Jensen and Killackey, 1987) with the plot for those from animals
with neonatal infraorbital nerve cut (Fig. 12, dotted line) indicates that for layer IV plexuses of the same size, those in the
animals in which the infraorbital nerve was cut at birth have a
lower density of branches than those in normal animals.

leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100) and prepared for immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as previously
described (Singh et al., 1999, 2000). Immunoprecipitation was performed, using an indirect technique with magnetic Dynabead separation
(Dynal ASA, Oslo, Norway). All procedures were performed at 4°C. In
brief, P7 wild-type and ERKO cerebral cortices were homogenized by
passing the sample eight times through a syringe fitted with a 20-gauge
needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 g at 4°C for 15
min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined
(Lowry's method; Bio-Rad Detergent Compatible Protein Assay kit;
Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, de-tergent was omitted from the lysis buffer. Depending on the species of the
antibodies to be used, the clarified lysates were precleared with either
anti-mouse or anti rabbit IgG-coated Dynabeads to reduce nonspecific
antibody – antigen binding. For immunoprecipitation of ER-X, the precleared lysates, recovered from the supernatant, were then incubated at
4°C for 12–24 hr with gentle shaking on a Nutator with 6F11, a mouse
monoclonal ER antibody raised against the full-length mouse ER-molecule, which has proven to be optimal for immunoprecipitation of
ER-X (Novocastra; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; 1:50 –1:100).
Primary antibody incubation was followed by the addition of anti-mouse
IgG-coated Dynabeads for 3 hr to capture and precipitate the antibody–
antigen complexes. The ER antibodies and coimmunoprecipitated proteins were separated from the Dynabeads by the addition of 1 sample
loading buffer, containing 5% -mercaptoethanol, and boiling for 5 min.
The Dynabeads were removed from the supernatant, using Dynal Magnetic Particle concentrators. The immunoprecipitated proteins were
boiled at 95–100°C for 5 min, and 300 –500 g samples were loaded onto
10% SDS-PAGE gels and separated based on molecular size. Prestained
rainbow markers (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular mass standards. The
gels were then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes.
Immunodetection of the protein of interest was performed by first
blocking the membrane in 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation; Nestle USA)
in TBS-Tween 20 (10 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20,
pH 8.0), followed by addition of the primary antibody. Wherever feasible,
the PVDF membranes were probed with antibodies different from those
used for immunoprecipitation to maximize the specificity of the immunoreactive product obtained. For ER-X in particular, we used either of
two antibodies highly specific for ER- : one specific for the ligand
binding domain (L BD) of ER- (MC20; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the other raised against amino acids 586 – 600
of the C terminus of ER- (C1355; 1:2000; Friend et al., 1997; Upstate
Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Both antibodies recognize ER-X on
Western immunoblots and by immunohistochemistry, but C1355 is not
effective for immunoprecipitation. ER- was identified with antibodies
directed against the LBD of ER- (1:250; Zymed, South San Francisco,
CA). Negative controls to test for the specificity of the interactions were
run in parallel and were performed by immunoprecipitation of the
precleared protein lysates with preimmune mouse IgG and subsequently
probed with the appropriate antibody. Additionally, a control peptide or
lysate (uterus, ovary) was always used as a positive control to verify
the identity of the band in the experimental lanes. The specificity of the
signal was determined by the apparent molecular weight (MW) of
the protein detected.
Antibody binding to protein was detected, using a secondary antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:40,000; Pierce, Rockford, IL),
and visualized autoradiographically on film, using enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL), as
previously described (Singh et al., 1999, 2000). All blots were stripped
and reprobed with the appropriate antibody to verify equal loading of
protein across lanes and were analyzed densitometrically. For studies of
ERK phosphorylation, the blots were first probed with phosphospecific
ERK antibodies to detect phospho-ERK1/2 [phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase,
(Thr202/Tyr204) (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA)]. The same blot
was reprobed for total (nonphosphorylated) ERK protein to verify equal
loading [ERK-1 (C -16), or ERK-2 (C -14)] (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution.
Densitometric anal yses. Densitometric analyses of ERK protein levels
were performed to ensure similar levels of protein loaded across lanes.
Autoradiograms were scanned in triplicate, using an HP Scanjet 6200C
(Hewlett Packard Company, Greeley, CO) and analyzed using Kodak
1D Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak, Rochester NY). Net
intensity values were calculated by subtracting the background within the
area measured for each band from the total intensity within this same

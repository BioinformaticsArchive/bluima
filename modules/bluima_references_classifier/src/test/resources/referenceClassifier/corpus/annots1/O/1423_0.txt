Derivation of Tolerance to Mistuning for a Network with
Parallel-stripe Shaped Band
We here derive equation (6) for the tolerance to mistuning of the
coupling strengths W in a network with the parallel-edge shaped band
defined by ron,i = ron, roff,i = roff, Wij = W = ζη, and equally spaced tonic
inputs

Functional plasticity in the mammalianbrain appearsto involve
both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms.In the rat hippocampus, long-lasting changesin synaptic efficacy that result from
high-frequency stimulation of the perforant pathway require
activation of postsynapticN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (Collingridge et al., 1983) and are also associated with persistentincreasesin the level of excitatory neurotransmitter releasedfrom presynaptic endings(Bliss et al.,
1986).The presynaptic changesmay involve the phosphorylation of one or more protein kinase C (PKC) substratessince
manipulations of PKC with phorbol esterscan either mimic,
enhance,or prevent long-term potentiation (LTP) (Akers et al.,
1986;Malenka et al., 1986).

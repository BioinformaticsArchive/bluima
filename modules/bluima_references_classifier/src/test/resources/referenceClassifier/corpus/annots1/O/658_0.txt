In this study, we have applied mass spectrometry based
peptidomics to examine levels of peptides derived from the
tachykinin and opioid peptide systems in nucleus accumbens in
morphine-dependent rats of two different strains during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. We observed significant differences
in several peptides both related to treatment regimen and to the
difference in strain. It is evident from the present results that
treatment with opioid agonists or antagonists may affect animals
differently depending upon strain. The response to opioids may
differ in a strain-dependent fashion.33-36 For example, the
development of opiate tolerance and the expression of withdrawal to opioids may differ due to genetic aspects.33 Here,
we have noted differences in the reaction to morphine withdrawal comparing Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. Moreover,
a strain difference was confirmed in the expression of peptides
in the nucleus accumbens following naloxone challenge in
Sprague-Dawley rats chronically treated with morphine. The

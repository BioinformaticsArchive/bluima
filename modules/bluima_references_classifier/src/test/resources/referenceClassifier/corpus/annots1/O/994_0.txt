59.1% covered chin as well as other parts of the face or occiput,
whereas the remaining 22.7% did not include chin. Finally, in
monkey LM31, 58.6% of the RFs were on the chin, whereas the
remaining 41.4% did not include chin. Therefore, mostly chin
inputs expanded in both area 3b and S2/PV; however, in S2/PV of
two of the lesioned monkeys, the expanded face representation
also included other parts of the face.

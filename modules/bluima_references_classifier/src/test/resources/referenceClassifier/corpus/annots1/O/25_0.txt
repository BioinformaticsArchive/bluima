Introduction
During synaptic transmission, release of neurotransmitter is supported from a pool of docked and fusion-competent vesicles that
can be defined functionally as the readily releasable pool (RRP) of
vesicles (Schikorski and Stevens, 2001; Sorensen, 2004). In recent
years, a heterogeneity of release probability has received considerable attention, because it has become apparent that some RRP
vesicles are released more reluctantly than others. At the calyx of
Held, a large glutamatergic synapse in the brainstem, vesicles
newly recruited to the RRP have an initially low release probability (Wu and Borst, 1999), and prolonged presynaptic voltage-

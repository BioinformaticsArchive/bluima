Fig. 1. Drawings showing pathway of antidromic impulse invading motoneurone. A: transverse
section of spinal cord showing typical path of axon to motoneurone in the biceps-semitendinosus nucleus, and the nodes of Ranvier, R (shown in exaggerated form) that occur in
its medullated segment, which is shown penetrating the grey matter and ending within
100 of the axon-soma junction. Note also micro-electrode in position. B: tracing from
a photomicrograph of an actual motoneurone (cf. Brock et al. 1952a, fig. 1A), which shows
in particular the beginning of the medullated segment, M (shown stippled) the non-medullated
segment, NM, with the thin segment and the axon hillock.

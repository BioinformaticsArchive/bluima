which also predicts a sparse but much more powerful potential effect of a single neuron on the circuit than previously
assumed. This bimodal functional connectivity is not be-cause the single- and few-synapse connections are missed
in experiments since electron microscopy has revealed
the absence of synapses in physiologically unconnected
neurons (Markram et al., 1997). The third line of evidence
came from the finding that reciprocal connectivity is
about three times higher than the unidirectional connection probability—a form of “nuclear recurrence or hyperreciprocity” (Markram, 1997). How can one explain the
discrepancy between a random structural and a non-random
functional connectivity?
Hellwig (2000) began to systematically separate 3D neurons in 3D space and examine how structural connectivity
changed with relative displacement. Examining pyramidal
neurons, he found the highest structural connectivity when
the somata of neurons were very close to each other with a
tapering off of the connection probability to zero within the
dimensions of a cortical column—not surprising since this
more or less encompasses the dimensions of the highest density of overlap in the local arborizations of the axons and
dendrites of these pyramidal neurons. Kalisman et al. (2003)
developed a template approach, which uses the mean de-scription of the arbors from many neurons to compute connection properties for a class of neurons. They generated
contours of connection probabilities around the soma which,
as in Hellwig's study, were constrained to within the dimensions of a cortical column. This analysis, as the one by
Stepanyants et al. (2002), predicted much higher connectiv-

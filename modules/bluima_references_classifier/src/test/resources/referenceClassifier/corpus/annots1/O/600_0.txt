against β-actin, Histone H4, and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; for each of these proteins, only one protein

spot was identified after 2D gel analysis. There is a good correlation of the results obtained by the two

techniques. For β-actin, both methods clearly show that there is an increase of protein after solar UV-B

irradiation compared with the no UV-B treatment under field conditions and β-actin is also higher in the high

altitude lines than in W23. However, treatment in the greenhouse does not change protein levels. For histone

H4, there is a decrease in the protein levels after both UV-B treatments in the field; while for ADP-glucose

pyrophosphorylase, there is an increase in enzyme levels by the same conditions. Thus, at least for this set of

proteins with only one form changed by UV-B in the 2D gels, the immunoblot analysis validates the results.

On the other hand, from supplemental Table 1, it is clear that some proteins are represented by more than one

spot. These spots may represent different products of two very closely related genes or post-translational

modifications of a single protein. Table 2 lists the subset of these proteins that showed opposite regulation by

UV-B. To investigate these differences further, immunoblot analysis was done using antibodies against some

of these proteins (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4B, Rubisco large subunit, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and

pyruvate, phosphate dikinase exhibit similar total levels in all treatments as determined by immunoblot

detection. This means that there are probably different isoforms regulated in opposite ways, or that one

isoform is post-translationally regulated. Unfortunately, these possibilities cannot be distinguished by

immunoblots blots after 1D gels. In contrast, for two heat shock proteins, differences in total levels of proteins

by western blots are observed. For HSP70 (Fig. 4), there is a decrease in protein levels after UV-B irradiation

in field conditions (both by solar and supplementary UV-B). Four spots corresponding to this protein were

identified by MS/MS after recovery from the 2D gels; three of these show the same down regulation by UV-B

in field conditions (Fig. 2, Table 2) while only was up-regulated. Thus, down regulation of 3 protein spots can

account for the observation with western blots. For UV-B treatments in the greenhouse, there is an overall

increase of protein levels measured by immunoblots. Only 2 of the 4 spots in 2D gels are regulated by UV-B in

the greenhouse, and both are increased by the treatments (supplemental Table 1). Therefore the results by

both methods are well-correlated in greenhouse conditions. For HSP90, there is no change in protein levels by

immunoblot in field conditions. In 2D gels, there are three HSP90 spots that are UV-B regulated, but only two

are regulated by UV-B in the field (Fig. 2, supplemental Table 1) and these two spots are regulated in opposite

ways. In contrast, there is an increase observed by immunoblots in greenhouse conditions. Of the three spots

Figure 2. Distinct properties of unitary IPSCs from CCK BCs and SCAs. A, Averaged traces of presynaptic action potentials (top) elicited in a BC and an SCA, and the respective postsynaptic
responses (bottom) in pyramidal cells. Note the faster and larger uIPSCs from the CCK BC compared with the SCA responses. One hundred postsynaptic responses are shown in gray, together with
their averages (black). B, Summary data showing the success rates and the uIPSC amplitudes from BCs and SCAs. C, Comparison of synaptic latencies and kinetics of uIPSCs. D, Example traces
illustrating the stronger asynchronous IPSCs evoked by firing in an SCA. Five postsynaptic responses (gray) and their averages (black) are shown, in response to a presynaptic train of 20 action
potentials at 50 Hz. E, Summary data of the asynchronous events (bin width: 20 or 100 ms, with the latter labeled as “averages” in the figure; the solid lines are single exponential fits to data binned
at 20 ms; decay time constant: BCs, 35.0 ms; SCAs, 134.4 ms). Time 0 is the end of the presynaptic action potential trains. Error bars represent SEM, and the asterisks mark p 0.05; ns, not significant.

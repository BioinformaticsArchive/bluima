glomeruli appears to be a more prominent function of the
cerebellar GABAergic input than its role in determining
the olivary firing frequency. On the other hand, it should
be noted that we did not investigate what the effects are
of the timing of SCP stimulation with respect to that of
MDJ stimulation. Such experiments are crucial for evaluating our hypothesis on the putative function of the olivary spines with their combined excitatory mesodiencephalic and inhibitory cerebellar input that the timing
between these two inputs is essential for the efficacy of
the inhibitory input.
The importance of the glomerular localization of the
vast majority of gap junctions in the normal inferior olive
can be illustrated by investigating the electrophysiological properties of hypertrophic olivary neurons, in which
most of the gap junctions are located on the somag.
Olivary hypertrophy, which can occur in humans after
lesions of the central tegmental tract, dentate nucleus, or
superior cerebellar peduncle, or bothh,i, can be experimentally induced after hemicerebellectomy in the catj
[for comparison between a normal (left) and hypertrophic (right) olivary neuron in the rostral medial accessory olive of the cat, see Fig. A]. Intracellular recordings of
hypertrophic neurons have revealed that MDJ stimulation usually failed to trigger the characteristic dendritic
after-depolarizing potentialb (Fig. B). However, the widespread dendritic tree of hypertrophic neurons is still ca-pable of discharging depolarizing potentials, as was occasionally noted when these cells fired spontaneously, or in
the rebound phase after MDJ stimulation. Since the
somata of hypertrophic cells have numerous spiny
appendages (Fig. A), which also show gap junctionsg, the
hypertrophic neurons are probably directly coupled to
each other at the level of the cell bodies. This somatic
coupling might dissociate, in part, the electrical activities
in the cell bodies from those in the dendrites, so that the
hypertrophic neurons fire mostly with solely somatic Na
spikes and no dendritic afterpotentials. This explanation
also clarifies why hypertrophic olivary neurons can reach
a much higher maximum firing frequency following MDJ
stimulation than normal olivary neuronsb. Thus, on the
basis of our investigations of the hypertrophic inferior
olive and comparison with the normal inferior olive we
conclude that the dominant dendritic localization of the
gap junctions is essential for the timing and integrative
operations in the inferior olive as well as for the cerebellar inhibitory input to regulate the coupling.

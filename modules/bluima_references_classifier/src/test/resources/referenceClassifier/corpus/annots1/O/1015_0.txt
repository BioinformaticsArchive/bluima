GABAergic neurons can be categorized by
soma size
We next turned to correlations based on soma area (Fig.
4D,E). The distribution of soma areas for all GFP cells
(red, Fig. 4D) was skewed to the left of the distribution for
only those GFP cells that are immunopositive (black, Fig.
4D). This indicates that many immunonegative cells (e.g.,
the very bright neurogliaform cells, Fig. 4A1, arrowed) are
smaller than average. We went on to compare the soma
areas of cells expressing a particular marker with the distribution of areas of all immunolabeled cells. An example is
in Figure 4E, which shows that the distribution of soma
areas of PV cells (red histogram) is skewed to the right of
the distribution of all immunopositive cells (black histogram), meaning that PV cells tend to be larger than average (Fig. 4A1, white circle). Compared to the mean soma
area of all immunopositive cells (149.7 1.0 m2, n
3016), only PV cells were larger on average (191.1 3.0

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The Neurolex and Neuron Registry grew out of the recognition
that neuroscience needs to begin developing and implementing
common information frameworks to bring together data acquired
across scales, organisms and techniques. In the genomic world,
every sequence is registered within a standard format to a central database where it can be compared algorithmically to all
other sequences. We do not have the luxury at the cellular level
of a simple set of characters for defining neurons. However,
having a standard grammar and centralized database where neuron descriptions can be deposited in a way that is amenable to
machine-based processing and where unique identifiers can be
assigned will be an important infrastructure for finally grappling
with the cellular complexity of the nervous system. We anticipate that such a resource can be used, much like the genomic
resources, for comparing neurons, determining functional or
structural groupings and for building multiscale models of the
nervous system.
There are multiple dimensions to the problem of neuronal
classification. Neuronal properties can be described in a variety of
ways (PING, 2008). Depending on the relation being described,
the values can take on different meanings. For example, genetic
markers in the context of development could be used to characterize neurons from a connectivity perspective. In addition to
species dependence, metadata about the experimental models,

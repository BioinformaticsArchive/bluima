Effect of SCI duration on the locomotor pattern
Figure 2 shows the recordings of the raw EMG from
four leg muscles of an acute patient (P3) 2 months after
SCI (Fig. 2B), of a chronic patient (P7) 5.5 years after
SCI (Fig. 2C) and, for comparison, of a healthy subject
(Fig. 2A). The timing of the leg muscle activity pattern
with a main activation of the extensors during the stance
phase and of the flexor muscles during the swing phase of

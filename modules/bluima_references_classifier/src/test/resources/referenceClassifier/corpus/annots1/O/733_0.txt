Figure 12. Comparison of the depth profiles of field potential and intracellular events during slow oscillation. (a) Depth profile of the LFP, CSD, and intracellular activity during transition
from silent to active state during natural slow-wave sleep. Arrows show approximate depth of the 2 neurons relative to the CSD profile (LFP and CSD plots are from Fig. 2). (b) Depth
profile of the onsets of active states in the LFP (data from Fig. 1) and the running average of active state onsets in intracellularly recorded neurons (data from Fig. 6d2).

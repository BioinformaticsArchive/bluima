Estradiol (10 M) alone did not significantly affect PP2A levels at any given time
compared with untreated controls. However, simultaneous treatment with 17 -estradiol and glutamate caused a rapid and
profound increase in PP2A expression at
15 and 30 min, followed by a return to
normal levels by 1 h after treatment that
persisted through 24 h treatment.

Decoding the Information About Nine Whiskers
Analyses were carried out to find out how information might be
decoded from the activity of groups of neurons responding to
stimulation of nine individual whiskers. The question was
how neuronal activity specifies stimulus site among these nine
whiskers (C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3, E1, E2, E3). To elucidate what
aspects of neuronal population firing are important for decoding
the location of the stimulated whisker, we computed how much
information the spike emission times of neuronal groups transmitted according to two decoding schemes: (i) labeled line,
which conser ved the identity of which neuron fired each spike,
and (ii) pooling, which ignored which neuron fired each spike.
We quantified the efficiency of pooling as a decoding mechanism by computing the difference between the labeled line and
the pooled information. Since labeled line decoding is an upper
bound on the information transmitted by a neuronal population,
this difference must be positive or zero (Cover and Thomas,
1991). This is analogous to the way in which Nirenberg and
co-workers (Nirenberg et al., 2001) recently assessed the in-formation cost of neglecting cross-correlations in the retina.
Results for a typical pair of cells recorded from barrel column
D2 are illustrated in Figure 1a. The left panel shows the times at
which spikes occurred for each of 50 def lections of whiskers
D1, D2 and D3 (here and in the following, stimulus onset was
defined as time = 0 ms). Both cells responded strongly and
rapidly to the principal whisker D2, but weakly and with longer
latency to non-principal whiskers D1 and D3. This obser vation is
consistent with the well-known functional properties of barrel
cortex (Armstrong-James and Fox, 1987). Since the individual
cells have similar response properties, the pooled response
maintains these characteristics. Pooled decoding was thus only
marginally less informative than labeled decoding for the
nine-whisker set.
Figure 1b illustrates results for a pair of cells recorded from
different barrel-columns, one neuron in barrel-column D1, the
other in barrel-column D3. Again (lef t panel), both neurons

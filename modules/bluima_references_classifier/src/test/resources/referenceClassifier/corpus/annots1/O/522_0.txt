Protein-protein interactions underlie a vast number of physiological processes. Cellular processes such as neuronal signaling, cell development, and growth all depend on a complex
network of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions in the cell. These interactions may be categorized as
constitutive interactions, such as between subunits of hemoglobin, and signal-dependent interactions, such as those be-

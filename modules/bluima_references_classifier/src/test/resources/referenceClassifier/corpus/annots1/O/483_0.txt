in absolute ethanol, rinsed, and incubated in the following solutions at room temperature: 0.1% sodium borohydride and 50 mM
glycine, and then in TS containing 2% human serum albumin
(HSA). The same anti-pLIMK antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) was used for the post-embedding electron microscopic analysis as was used in the preembedding EM analysis. All the ex-periments and measurements were conducted for total pLIMK,
and all results were given for total pLIMK distribution.
For single immunolabeling, grids containing sections were
incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-pLIMK antibody (Cell
Signaling Technologies [diluted 1:10]) overnight. The next day,
grids containing sections were washed, and incubated in secondary gold-tagged goat-anti-rabbit IgG F(ab=)2 (10 nm) antibody
(EMS [diluted 1:30]) in TBS (2% HSA and polyethyleneglycol
20,000; 5 mg/1 ml). Sections were washed and dried, counterstained with 1% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. The
sections were analyzed on a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope
(JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured by using the Ad-vantage charge-coupled device camera (Advanced Microscopy
Techniques, Danvers, MA, USA).
Controls for specificity of labeling by anti-pLIMK antibody.
Controls for specificity of labeling by the anti-pLIMK antibody were
performed. Control grids with thin sections were processed ex-actly as grids for the antibody experiments up to the step of
applying the primary antibody. 1) To control for the nonspecific
adsorption of the protein– gold complex of the secondary antibody
to the tissue section, the anti-pLIMK antibody was omitted. Omitting the primary antibody resulted in no gold particles at all on the
tissue sections. 2) To control for nonspecific adsorption of the
protein– gold complex of the secondary antibody to the tissue
section, the secondary antibody was replaced with normal nonrabbit secondary antibody, at the same protein concentration as
well. Only occasional gold particles were seen, and they appeared
to be randomly distributed.

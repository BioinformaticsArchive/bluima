Currently, none of these algorithms have been implemented and whether they are
competitive from a practical point of view to those described in this thesis
is a very interesting open question. As a small appetiser we give a high-level
description of their deterministic variants here. Let C denote a general constant
which is not necessarily the same in the running time bounds mentioned below.

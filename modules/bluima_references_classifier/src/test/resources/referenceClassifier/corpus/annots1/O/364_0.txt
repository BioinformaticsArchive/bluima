Input resistance of y-nwtoneurone8
The input resistance of a neurone depends upon the surface area of its membrane
and the way in which this is distributed between the cell body and the parts of the
dendritic tree, and also upon the specific resistivity of the membrane itself. The input
resistance of y-motoneurones should be relatively high compared to a-motoneurones
because of their small cell body size and the limited extent of their dendritic trees.
In addition, because the ratio of dendritic area to somatic area was less for y- than
for a-motoneurones, the component of neuronal input conductance that could be
attributed to the dendrites should be a smaller fraction of the total conductance.
It has been difficult to obtain adequate measurements of input resistance, but those
that have been made have indicated values in the range 1-3-49 MQ2, comparable with
those from the smaller a-motoneurones (Kemm & Westbury, 1978; Westbury, 1981).
If these unexpectedly low values are correct, then the present results imply that the
specific resistivity of the y-motoneurone membrane is lower than that of a-motoneurones. This situation has been suggested for abducens motoneurones by the
work of Grantyn & Grantyn (1978). Indeed, there would seem to be many similarities
between abducens motoneurones and the y-motoneurones studied here. Kernell &
Zwaagstra (1981) have also recently raised the possibility that specific resistivity of
the membrane is related to neurone size in their analysis of the properties of
a-motoneurones of different size.
To establish whether or not the smaller y-motoneurones have a lower membrane
resistivity than the large a-motoneurones would require satisfactory measurement
of input resistance coupled with careful reconstruction of the structure for each
neurone in the way that Barrett & Crill (1974) employed for their study of

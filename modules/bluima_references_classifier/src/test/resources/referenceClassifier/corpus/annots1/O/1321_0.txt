Concluding remarks
Recent technical advances have allowed direct observation
of the factors that control the amplitude and time course of
dendritic synaptic potentials in vitro. In support of early
work on spinal motoneurons in vivo [13], findings in CA1
hippocampal pyramidal neurons suggest that for individual inputs the somatic amplitude of EPSPs is independent
of synapse location, owing to a site-dependent scaling of
dendritic synaptic current [20]. By contrast, in neocortical
layer 5 pyramidal neurons, dendritic synaptic current is

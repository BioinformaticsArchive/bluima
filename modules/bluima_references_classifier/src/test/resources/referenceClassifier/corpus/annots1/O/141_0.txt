layer where thalamic connections are concerned and therefore
to involve perhaps both `forward' and `back' connections. Connections between excitatory cells in these two layers have been
recorded in one study of adult cat striate cortex (Tarczy-Hornoch
et al., 1999). The EPSPs elicited by layer 6 cells were reported to
be smaller on average than those elicited by layer 4 spiny cells
and unlike the layer 4 to layer 4 connections, exhibited facilitation, rather than depression. That study also reports a single
connection from a spiny layer 4 cell to a layer 6 pyramidal cell
whose morphology resembled that of cells projecting to the
claustrum. It will be of interest to determine which of the
several types of layer 6 pyramidal cells activates layer 4 cells (the
prediction from the previous discussion being the thalamocortical cells in upper layer 6 which most densely innervate layer
4) and whether interneurons, and interneurons of any specific
type(s), are also activated.

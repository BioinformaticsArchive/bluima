Figure 4. LTP and LTD are equally sensitive to fast and slow Ca 2 buffers. A, Buffering of
postsynaptic Ca 2 with 2 mM EGTA (open circles) or 2 mM BAPTA (filled circles) blocked the
induction of LTP by the sequence of an EPSP and three APs (50 Hz) at t 10 ms. A lower
concentration of EGTA or BAPTA of 0.5 mM blocked 40% of LTP. B, Titration curve for different
concentrations of EGTA (open circles) and BAPTA (filled circles) and their effects on the induction
of LTP. Data were normalized to the change in EPSP amplitude for no buffer added. The slow
Ca 2 buffer EGTA blocked LTP with the same concentration dependence as the fast Ca 2
buffer BAPTA. A sigmoidal fit yielded a half-concentration of 0.6 and 0.5 mM for EGTA (gray line)
and BAPTA (black line), respectively. C, A concentration of 1 mM EGTA (open squares) or BAPTA
(filled squares) was sufficient to blocked the induction of LTD by the sequence of three APs (50
Hz) and an EPSP at t 10 ms. A lower concentration of EGTA or BAPTA of 0.25 mM had no
significant effect on the induction of LTD. D, Titration curve for different concentrations of EGTA
(open boxes) and BAPTA (filled boxes) and their effect on the induction of LTD. Data were
normalized to the change in EPSP amplitude for no buffer added. A sigmoidal fit yielded a
half-concentration of 0.39 and 0.36 mM for EGTA (gray line) and BAPTA (black line), respectively.
The dashed lines indicate no change in EPSP amplitude.

Figure 6. Basic properties of bouton clusters emitted by layer IV spiny cells. (A) Frequency distribution of the diameter of individual bouton clusters. About 60% of clusters had
less than 500 lm in diameter. (B) There was no significant correlation between the number of boutons and the number of clusters per cell. (C) Cluster weight (proportion of
boutons contained in a given cluster) plotted against distance from the parent soma. Generally, proximal clusters represented a heavier weight. (D) Relationship between cluster
rank and cluster weight. Note that cells possessing only a small number of clusters (#2, dark gray) displayed steep curves. On the other hand, clusters with higher than 5 rank
had relatively small cluster weight. (E) There was an inverse relationship between cluster diameter and cluster rank. For definition of each parameter, see Materials and Methods.

dendritic properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in
culture.
Clearly, the electrical properties of the dendritic tree will be
determined with greater accuracy if electrical recordings are
made directly from the dendrites themselves, preferably using the
patch-clamp technique to avoid the electrical leak around the
electrode generated by microelectrode recordings. The use of
infrared differential interference contrast microscopy now makes
this possible (Stuart et al., 1993). Moreover, this method allows
recordings to be made from more than one site on the same
neuron (Stuart and Sakmann, 1994), allowing direct measurement of voltage attenuation between different locations. Here we
used simultaneous patch-pipette recordings from the soma and
apical dendrite of neocortical neurons in brain slices to measure
voltage attenuation along the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal
neurons. These recordings were then combined with morphologically realistic compartmental models of the same cells, to provide
the first estimates of Ri based on direct measurement of voltage
attenuation in neurons. The results suggest that Ri is lower than
estimated in recent modeling studies (Shelton, 1985; Stratford et
al., 1989; Fromherz and Muller, 1994; Major et al., 1994; Rapp et
al., 1994; Thurbon et al., 1994; Bekkers and Stevens, 1996) (however, see Thurbon et al., 1998). Furthermore, simulations of the
experimental data suggest that multiple resting conductances are
nonuniformly distributed, generating a “leaky” apical dendrite,
which increases the amount of steady-state voltage attenuation
and influences synaptic integration by decreasing EPSP amplitude and duration.

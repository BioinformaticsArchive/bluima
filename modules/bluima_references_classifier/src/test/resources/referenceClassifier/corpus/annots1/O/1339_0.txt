Figure 10. A log-log plot of density of branches (density) in the layer IV plexus of reconstructed terminal arbors versus the area of projection
onto layer IV (projection area). All reconstructedterminal arbors are included in this analysis(seeTable 1). Pearson'sr = -0.90, p < 0.0001. The
probability that the linear relationship occurred by chance is less than 0.0001. The intercept equals 1.83 + 0.10 and the slope equals -0.65 + 0.08
(a i 0.0001).

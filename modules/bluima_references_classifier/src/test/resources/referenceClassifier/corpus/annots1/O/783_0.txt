against corticotropin-releasing factor (Lewis et al., 1989;
Lewis and Lund, 1990) or against GABA transporter GAT-1
(DeFelipe and Gonza ́ lez-Albo, 1998; Woo et al., 1998); by
intracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase (Freund
et al., 1983) or Lucifer Yellow (Naegele and Katz, 1990);
and by intracellular staining with biocytin (Kawaguchi, 1995;
Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998).
Studies using immunocytochemistry for GABA or its
synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase showed
that chandelier cells are GABAergic and, thus, inhibitory
(Peters et al., 1982, Freund et al., 1983; Hendry et al., 1983,
DeFelipe et al., 1985; Somogyi et al., 1985; Buhl et al.,
1994). On the basis of immunocytochemistry, chandelier
cells may be chemically defined as GABAergic cells which
contain the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and
calbindin, but not calretinin, and which contain the
neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor, but not other
neuropeptides, namely cholecystokinin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and tachykinins
(for a review, see DeFelipe and Farin~as, 1992) (Fig. 2).
However, these cells are chemically heterogeneous, since,
depending on the species, cortical areas and layers, chandelier

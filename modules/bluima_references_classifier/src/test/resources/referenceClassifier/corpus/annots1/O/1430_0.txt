resulted in an increase of all morphometric parameters as-sessed, with the exception of the number of stem dendrites.
It is worth noting that the effect of BDNF on length related
parameters (Fig. 2B,C) occurred essentially before DIV 10.
Thereafter, no appreciable changes in total dendritic length or
the length of the longest dendrite could be observed in
BDNF-treated cells. Notably, BDNF also precluded the re-duction of dendritic length seen in controls after 24 DIV,
which probably reflects culture-related deterioration of these
cells. Similarly, the major effect of BDNF on branching (Fig.
2Dâ€“F), occurred within the first 10 DIV. As for the numbers
of stem dendrites, we observed only a slight increase after
BDNF treatment, and this was observed only in the samples
analyzed after 17 DIV.

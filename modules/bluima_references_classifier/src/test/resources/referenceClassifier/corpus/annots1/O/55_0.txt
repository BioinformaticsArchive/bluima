Figure 6. Two synaptically connected cat layer 6 pyramidal cells are reconstructed. The presynaptic pyramid (orange soma/dendrites, white axon) resembles a claustrally
projecting cell with a slender apical dendrite reaching layer 3 and an axonal arbour confined to the deep layers. The postsynaptic pyramid is a CT-like pyramidal cell (soma/dendrites
yellow, axon grey) with an apical dendritic tuft and extensive axonal arborization in layer 4. (A) The EPSP resulting from this connection exhibited paired pulse and brief train
depression that were more pronounced and involved a larger proportion of apparent failures of transmission (B) at shorter interspike intervals. (C) Recovery from paired pulse
depression was slow and was incomplete at 80 ms.

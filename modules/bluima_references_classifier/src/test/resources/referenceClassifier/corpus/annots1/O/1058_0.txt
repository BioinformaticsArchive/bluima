Fig. 4. Comparison of the means of the laminar thickness (± s.d.) and neuronal densities (± s.e.m.) between human, rat and
mouse. The values obtained in layers II, IIIa and IIIb of human, and layers Va and Vb of rat were recalculated according to the
relative thickness of these layers to estimate the representative values of layers II–III and V, respectively.

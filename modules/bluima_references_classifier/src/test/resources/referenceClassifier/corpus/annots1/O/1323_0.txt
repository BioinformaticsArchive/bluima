Materials and Methods
Preparation and identification of the neurons. Experiments were conducted on the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) of male crabs, Cancer borealis. Animals were obtained from local markets (Newark, NJ) and
maintained in seawater tanks at 7–10°C. The STNS was dissected out
under a stereoscope and the complete isolated STNS, including the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), the esophageal ganglion (OG), the paired
commissural ganglia (CoG), and connecting nerves and motor nerves
(Fig. 1 A; Selverston et al., 1976), were pinned down on a Sylgard-coated
Petri dish. The STG was desheathed to enable electrode penetration of
the pyloric neuron cell bodies. All preparations were continuously superfused with chilled (10 –13°C) physiological Cancer saline containing (in
mM) 11 KCl, 440 NaCl, 13 CaCl , 26 MgCl , 11.2 Trizma base, 5.1 maleic
22
acid, pH 7.4 –7.5.
Extracellular recordings from identified motor nerves (Fig. 1 A) were
made using stainless steel wire electrodes, with one end inserted inside
and the other outside of a petroleum jelly (Vaseline) well built around the
nerve, and amplified with a Differential AC amplifier (A-M Systems
1700). Intracellular recordings were made from the neuronal cell bodies
with sharp glass microelectrodes pulled using a Flaming-Brown P-97
micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and containing 0.6 M K SO
24
and 20 mM KCl (final electrode resistance 20 –30 M ). All intracellular
recordings were performed in single- or two-electrode current-clamp or
two-electrode voltage-clamp mode (Axoclamp 2B amplifiers, Molecular
Devices). Pyloric neurons are identified according to their characteristic
axonal projections in identified nerves and interactions with other STG
neurons (diagrammatically shown in Fig. 1 B; Weimann et al., 1991; Blitz
et al., 2008).
All data reported here are from PD neurons. Two PD neurons are
electrically coupled to each other (Fig. 1 B) and currents were measured
in one of the two PD neurons in normal saline without making any
attempt to uncouple them. Three currents were measured in two-

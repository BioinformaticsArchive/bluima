particular gene regulating morphology? At one
extreme, genes that endow neuronal precursors with
their identity might supply progeny neurons with their
`branching program'. At the other extreme, cell-type
specific morphology might require continuous action
of dedicated transcriptional regulators in post-mitotic
neurons. These alternatives might be addressed at a
very basic level by examining the temporal expression patterns of genes of interest and by examining
the morphological consequences of manipulating
levels of gene activity at different stages.
Returning to the transcription factors mentioned
above, the zinc finger transcription factor Hamlet is
expressed around neuronal birth [100]. The POUdomain protein Drifter and the homeodomain protein
Cut are expressed both in neuronal precursors and in
differentiated neurons [82,101], while the POU-domain
protein Acj6 and the BTB Zinc finger protein Abrupt
are expressed predominantly or exclusively in postmitotic cells [82,102,103]. Together with the finding
that dendrite morphology can be altered by postmitotic overexpression of any of these genes, these
data suggest that neuronal morphology can be controlled at the level of transcription both in neuronal
precursors and in post-mitotic neurons.
Our understanding of what causes different types of
neuron to take reliably distinct branching patterns is
clearly incomplete. The above results indicate that a
key future goal is to identify transcriptional regulators
and their targets that control morphogenesis. First
steps have been taken with the zinc-finger transcription factor Sequoia: microarray experiments indicate
that it regulates genes involved in neurite morphogenesis rather than genes controlling cell fate [104]. In
many cases, however, these genes are expressed in
morphologically heterogeneous populations of
neurons, and even non-neuronal cells, thus it would be
informative to profile restricted groups of neurons
[105–107]. A concurrent goal will be to understand how
these and other regulators act on the different phases
of dendritic growth; for example, scaffold building and
territory filling in the case of adult — and perhaps also
embryonic — sensory neurons. As genes that emerge
from such screens are examined in greater depth, we
may hope to converge on core conserved signaling
programs that regulate dendritic morphogenesis.

contribution of INaP is, none the less, considerable at
relatively negative voltages. Indeed, the conductance–
voltage relationship for INaP revealed a half-activation

In addition, the slope factor, k, of the same relationship
was higher than that found for INa by more than twofold.
As a consequence, the conductance–voltage relationship
for INaP was much more extended towards negative
potentials compared to INa, and, at subthreshold voltage
levels (260 to 240 mV), the relative degree of INaP activation was much higher. Overall, the activation “threshold” of INaP was negative to that of INa by approximately
10 mV. It should be noted, however, that the V 1 of

INaP appeared to be considerably more positive in EC
layer V cells than previously reported for EC layer II
cells (244.4 mV).36 Interestingly, although in both

Notch
Based on its ability to regulate axon outgrowth, a number of laboratories have begun to focus on Notch signaling as a potential
molecular regulator of dendritic growth (Franklin et al., 1999).
Notch is a cell-surface protein that functions as a receptor for its
ligand, Delta, and is involved in cell fate decisions during early
development (Redmond et al., 2000). As Notch continues to be
expressed at high levels in neurons during differentiation, it
has been hypothesized that it might regulate neurite outgrowth.
Young cortical neurons with low Notch activity readily extend
dendrites; up-regulation of Notch decreases dendritic growth in
these cells (Berezovska et al., 1999; Sestan et al., 1999; Redmond
et al., 2000). Similarly, more mature neurons with high Notch
activity exhibit little dendritic growth, and down-regulation of
Notch in these cells promotes dendritic growth (Franklin et al.,
1999; Sestan et al., 1999; Redmond et al., 2000). Molecular
perturbation experiments of Notch1 suggest that Notch1 signaling in cortical neurons promotes dendritic branching but
inhibits dendritic growth (Redmond et al., 2000). Thus, the
formation of interneuronal contacts may up-regulate Notch
activity and thereby restrict subsequent dendritic growth.

four different classes. For each cell, the
responsienadepolarizepdotential(up- per truce), hyperpolarized potential
(lower truce), and resting potential
(middle trace where present) are de- picted. Stimulus artifacts are blanked.
All tracesexcepthosewith actionpotentials (truncated) are averages of four
to eight trials. Solid arrows mark onset
of EPSPsw, hite arrows, onsetof IPSPs.
Numbers indicate latency from the pre-2.4 synaptic fiber volley in layer IV (not

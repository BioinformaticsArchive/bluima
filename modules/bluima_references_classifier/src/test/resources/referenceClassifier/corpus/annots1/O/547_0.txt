2 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 50 mM -glycerophosphate, and complete protease inhibitor
mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and following preclearing of the samples,
PAK1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation. In vitro kinase assays were performed at 30 °C in 25 mM HEPES, 20 mM MgCl , 20 mM -glycerophosphate,

20 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.26 MBq [ -32P]ATP, 20 M ATP, and 5 g of myelin basic protein as
substrate in a final volume of 30 l. The reactions were terminated after 20 min
(which pilot studies had demonstrated was within the linear range of PAK1
activity) by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating in a boiling
water bath, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were
stained with Coomassie Blue, and a radioactive signal was detected using Fujix
BAS1000 phosphorimaging with a BAS reader and TINA 2.07 software and by
autoradiography. A proportion of the reaction was also probed for immunoprecipitated PAK1 on immunoblots so as to demonstrate equal amounts of
kinase in the different transfections.
Immunofluorescence Studies and Neurite Length Measurements—
Neurons grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde
in Tris-HCl-buffered saline (TBS) for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.1%
(w/v) Triton X-100 in TBS for 10 min, blocked with 5% (v/v) goat
serum/0.2% (w/v) Tween 20 in TBS for 1 h, and then probed with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Primary antibodies were
then detected using goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Ig coupled to
AlexaFluor 350 or AlexaFluor 546 (Molecular Probes), and the samples
were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).
For analyses of the effects of ALS2 on neurite outgrowth, 2 DIV cortical neurons were co-transfected with plasmid pEGFPC.1 (Clontech)
expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) plus experimental
or control plasmids. GFP was used to determine cell shape because it has
been shown to distribute uniformly throughout neurons and has been
used as a marker for neuronal cell shape in numerous studies (e.g. Refs.
23 and 24). Experimental and control plasmids included ALS2,
ALS2 DH, dominant-negative N17Rac and N39Rab5, and vector
expressing pCIneoCAT, which was used to balance transfections so that
all cells received the same numbers and amounts of plasmid. All of the
GFP-expressing cells were immunostained for co-transfected protein to

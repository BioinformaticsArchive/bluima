Figure 3. Neurons Have Type-Specific Patterns of Dendritic Growth and Branching That Are Modulated Quantitatively, but Not Qualitatively, by
Presynaptic Input
(A) Reconstruction of a representative aCC dendritic arbor at 18 h AEL. Scale bar indicates 5 lm.
(B) Correlation analysis between dendritic tree length (x-axis, micrometres) and number of branches (y-axis) of aCC at 18 h AEL in different conditions:
control (red), Cha mutants (blue), and Cha::TNT-G (grey). R2 values are: controls (red), R2 = 0.75, F-value = 33, p < 0.05, n = 13; Cha mutants (blue), R2 =
0.64, F-value = 11, p < 0.05, n = 10; in Cha::TNT-G (yellow), R2 = 0.65, n = 10, F-value = 11, p < 0.05, n = 10. Dashed lines indicate the slopes of the
samples.
(C) Bar plots (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]) of the ratio between total tree length (in micrometres) and number of branch points in control
(red), Cha mutant (blue), and Cha::TNT-G animals (grey).
(D) Reconstruction of a representative RP1 arbor at 18 h AEL. Scale bar indicates 5 lm.
(E) Correlation analysis between dendritic tree length (x-axis, micrometres) and number of branches (y-axis) of aCC (red) and RP1 (green) at 18 h AEL.
Both neurons have a linear relationship between tree length and branch number, R2 = 0.93, F-value = 25, p < 0.05, n = 5. Dashed lines indicate the slope
of the samples.
(F) Ratios of tree length/branch number for aCC (red) and RP1 (green). The two differ significantly. Significance was assessed by unpaired, two-tailed t-test. Double asterisks (**) indicate p < 0.005, and NS indicates p > 0.05. Mean ± SEM.
In all reconstructions, dendrites are pseudocoloured yellow and the axon blue.

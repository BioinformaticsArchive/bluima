are highly likely to be present at synaptic sites because of
their clear and tight relationship to cholinergic terminals
(and to the postsynaptically located m2 receptors), it
is difficult to determine with immunofluorescence to
what extent the much more numerous small clusters
are associated with identifiable synapses. Pre-embedding
peroxidase-based immunohistochemistry, with silver
intensification, was therefore used to visualize Kv2.1-IR
and its relationship to morphologically identified synapses
on motoneurones.
The overall distribution of Kv2.1-IR was entirely
consistent with the light microscopic observations in
terms of its punctate nature and the size and separation
of individual patches of immunoreactivity, although

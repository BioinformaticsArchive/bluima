FIG. 4. Change in EPSP shape, coupling
coefficients, and “AC length constants” after
application of ZD7288. A: spontaneous EPSPs
are recorded under control conditions (top)
and with 50 μM ZD7288 (bottom) from the
cell shown in B. They are superimposed and
the presumed site of origin can be judged from
their amplitude attenuation. Both are presumably generated distal to electrode 3 (comparable to Fig. 2B). Notice the crossing over of the
falling phases of the EPSPs (4) under control
conditions, which disappears under ZD7288.
In addition, a substantial increase in EPSP
amplitude and area can be seen compared with
the control EPSPs. C and D: coupling coefficients determined as described in Fig. 3A for
spontaneous EPSPs traveling from distal to
proximal (C) and from proximal to distal (D)
under control conditions (E) and with ZD7288
(c). E: comparison of the different coupling
coefficients under control conditions (light
gray bars; n = 10 cells) and with ZD7288
(dark gray bars; n = 6 cells). F: the logarithm
(ln) of mean EPSP amplitude attenuation
(6SD) is plotted against the mean distance
between the electrodes (6SD) for the 6 coupling coefficients calculated. Direct comparison of peak voltage attenuation of spontaneous EPSPs for 5 experiments under control
conditions (E) and with ZD7288 (c). While
the EPSPs attenuates to 1/e at a distance of
249 μm under control, this value increases to
292 μm under ZD7288 for somatopetal
EPSPs. The corresponding values increase
from 472 to 695 μm for EPSPs traveling from
soma to dendrite (reflecting the AC correlate
of the DC current length constant).

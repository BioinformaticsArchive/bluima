USE parameters (0.1â€“0.95) were found using the TM model
(Tsodyks and Markram, 1997). The initial Pr values, however,
depend on several assumptions and can also not be incorporated
to account for the frequency dependence of the synaptic
response without further assuming that synaptic depression is
only mediated presynaptically. The USE parameter, on the other
hand, is a functional parameter that does not depend on
assumptions in order to accurately describe the use dependence.

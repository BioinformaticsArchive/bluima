Subcortical Cues Regulating Interneuron Migration Are
Unaffected
To determine the possible causes of early interneuron invasion
of the cortical primordium, we first tested whether loss of the
hem affects selected guidance cues in the developing striatum,
through which the interneurons migrate, or disrupts the
corticostriate boundary, or ``anti-hem'' (Assimacopoulos et al.
2003), which interneurons cross to enter the cortical
primordium. Because the cortical hem is a dorsal telencephalic
organizer, its loss could affect development throughout the
dorsoventral axis of the telencephalon, including the anti-hem
and ventral telencephalon. We found no obvious defects,
however, in the expression of major interneuron guidance
molecules in the ventral telencephalon (Corbin et al. 2001;
Tanaka et al. 2003). At E13.5, no differences were observed
between control and hem-ablated mice in the expression
patterns of genes encoding Semaphorin3a (Sema3a) and
Semaphorin3f (Sema3f) (Fig. 2A-D), which create an inhibitory
territory for migrating interneurons (Marin et al. 2001;
Tamamaki et al. 2003). Similarly, no differences were seen in

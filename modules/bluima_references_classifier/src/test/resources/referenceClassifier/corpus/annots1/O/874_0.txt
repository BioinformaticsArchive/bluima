stimulatedby currentpulsesjust abovethreshold,LS cellsfired
repetitively at constant rates (Fig. 6C) and did not adapt. In
responseto current pulsesat 2X threshold, LS cells showed
slight spike-frequencyadaptation(Fig. 6C). LS cells had wider
spikes,higher input resistancesa, nd morepositive restingmembrane potentialsthan thoseof FS cells; resting potentialswere
morenegativethanthoseofRSNPcells(Table1).
LS cells were multipolar (Figs. lC, 60) and had smallercell
bodies(Table 1). Their dendriteswere smoothanddistributedin
layer II/III or in layers I and II/III. The width of the dendritic
field was 100-200 pm, and the dendritesmadea symmetrical,
sphericalfield. The axons, originating from the somataand the
dendrites,immediatelybranchedand rebranchedfrequently, creating an entangledplexus. The axonal innervationswere mainly
inlayerII/III,but,insomecells,alsoextendedintolayerIor
layer V. The width of the axonal arbor was250-300 km, which
was twice as wide as that of the dendritic field. From these
morphologicalcharacteristics,theseLS cells are consideredto
be neurogliaformcells (Jones,1984).

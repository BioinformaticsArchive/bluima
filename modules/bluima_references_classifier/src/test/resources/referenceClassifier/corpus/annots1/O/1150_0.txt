Figure 3. CPN genes that selectively label callosal neurons of the superficial layers II/III and IV. A–F, Temporal profiles of gene expression from microarray analysis in CPN (gray) versus CSMN
(black) during embryonic (E18) and early postnatal (P3, P6, and P14) stages of development. Error bars indicate SEM. A –F , In situ hybridization in coronal sections of cortex showing preferential
CPN gene expression in the superficial layers. A –F , Magnification of selected areas from A –F . Ages are as indicated in A –F . Scale bars: A –F , 100 m.

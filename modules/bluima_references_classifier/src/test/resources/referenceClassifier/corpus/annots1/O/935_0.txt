Figure 7. Development of Axonal Complexity
(A) Tracings of a representative TC axon from P8 to P14.
(B) Tracings of a representative CR axon from P5 to P10.
(C) Location of branch additions with respect to tip of parent axon for 69 new TC branches and 34 new CR branches. The difference between TC and CR
axons was significant (p < 0.05).
(D) The rate of branch additions per millimeter of axon per day was greater in TC axons (n = 30) than in CR axons (n = 12). Error bars represent SEM. *
The difference was significant at P8–P11 (p < 0.05).
(E) Density of branch points versus postnatal age. The branch point density gradually increases for TC axons (n = 219) between P5–P6 and P14–P19 (p <
0.0001), whereas it decreases slightly for CR axons (n = 76) during the same time period (p = 0.4). The overall difference in these trends between TC and
CR axons was significant (p < 0.05). Error bars represent SEM. * The density of branch points for TC axons, which was lower than that of CR axons at P5–
P6 (p = 0.064) and at P7–P8 (p = 0.05), was later significantly higher at P11–P13 (p < 0.01) and at P14–P19 (p < 0.001).

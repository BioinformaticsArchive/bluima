where N is the total number of branches of an order, and i is the order number.
Theoretically, values of R may range from a minimum of 2 up to infinity.
In addition to stepwise bifurcation ratios, three different overall bifurcation
ratios were calculated for each branch in order to compare the different methods
for calculating the bifurcation ratio that have been used in past botanical studies.
First, a least-squares regression was performed on the logarithm of number of
branches versus order, in which the bifurcation ratio (Rbr) is equal to the
antilogarithm of the absolute value of the slope of the regression line (Tomlinson
1978). Secondly, a geometric mean bifurcation ratio was calculated by taking
(Rbg)
the (s- 1)th root of the number of first-order branches, where s is the highest-order
number (Holland 1969). Third, a bifurcation ratio (RbM) was calculated from
Motomura's formula (Whitney 1976), such that

RbM = (NT- Ns)/(NT- N),

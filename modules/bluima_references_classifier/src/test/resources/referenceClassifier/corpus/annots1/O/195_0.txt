The distinct activation properties of IAHP and IM explain the system through its SNIC bifurcation (notwithstanding saturation
different effects of these two forms of adaptation (see Fig. 6). As effects). This would terminate spiking were it not for the fact that
firing rate increases, so too will spike-dependent activation of activation of IAHP invariably wanes during the ISI, eventually
IAHP, which means IAHP will increase high enough to force the allowing another spike to occur, but not without influencing

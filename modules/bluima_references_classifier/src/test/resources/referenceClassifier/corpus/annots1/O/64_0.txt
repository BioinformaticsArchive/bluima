Iterative deconvolution deblurring

The Zeiss Axiovision turnkey iterative deconvolution program was
used off-line at its highest stringency using a theoretical point-spread
function, as described (Li et al., 2004). Regions of interest (ROIs) were
identified by eye from the sampled and neighbouring optical sections.

4.2.3 From single and multiple musclejber studies:
Early in the 1950s, I put together an apparatus-assembly for monitoring the loss of radioactively labeled Na+ and other isotopes from frog muscle while the muscle was being
continually washed (Ling and Schmolinski, 1956). The key component is a well-type
y-scintillation counter illustrated in Figure 8.5B in Appendix 1. In this simple setup, the
sensing element encloses the radioactively-labeled sample and thus allows radiation in
almost all directions to be recorded. As a result, more readings are recorded within a given
period of time than the older methods can register-in which the sensing element sits a
distance below the sample and "sees" only a much smaller portion of the emanating
radiation.
With a special adaptation of this new apparatus-assembly, I studied the Na+efflux from
a single isolated muscle cell and small bundles of a few muscle cell(s) isolated not from a
sartorius muscle but from the two-bodied cylindrical semitendinosus muscle (for reason, see

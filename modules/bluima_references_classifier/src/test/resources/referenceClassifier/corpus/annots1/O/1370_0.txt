Before and after imaging
We also compared spine lengths on individual live dendrites
before and after time-lapse imaging sessions (see Fig. 6). The
lengths of spines after a standard 3 hr imaging session (mean
spine length, 1.30 6 0.47 Î¼m; n = 95) were found to be not
statistically different (p = 0.598) from that at the beginning of the
imaging session. This supports the idea that the labeling and
time-lapse imaging procedures we used did not have detrimental
effects on dendrite structure in the live brain slices.

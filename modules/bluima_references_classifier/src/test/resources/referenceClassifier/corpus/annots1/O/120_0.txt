Image acquisition and analysis. Fluorescent images of labelled growth cones, axons and cell bodies were captured at 15-s
intervals using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 argon laser confocal system and 40 Neofluor water immersion lens. To minimize
photodynamic damage, the laser was operated under low power and light was attenuated to no greater than 1% using

release of caged compounds with 1–2-s flashes of ultraviolet light (340–380 nm) at different frequencies. Image sequences
were analysed with NIH Image software (W. Rasband, NIH). Rate of outgrowth was determined at 2–5-min intervals by
measuring axon length from the cell body to the leading margin of the growth cone, or by determining the movement of the
leading edge of the growth cone relative to several stationary landmarks using a coordinate-based macro (I. Hsieh, UCSD).

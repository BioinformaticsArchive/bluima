dimerent cortical volume, perhaps extending into dilltircnt co--tical layers. The basal and proximal obllquc dcndritcs may rcpresent a functionally distinct. and quantltativcl! highly Important. subdivision of the overall dendritic system.
In conclusion. it was possible to divide the sample ofncurons
into 3 classes using qualitati1.e features of their somadendritic
morphology. and this classification was supported by a range 01
quantitative measures. `The E/3 cells were all placed in a single
class and the L5 cells were divided mto 2 classes. This classilication of L5 cells appeared consistent with pre\ ious classilications based on their projection targets. The intrinsic elcctrophysiological properties of the cell classes established in this
paper will be described and compared in tbc following papc`~
(Mason and Larkman. 1990).

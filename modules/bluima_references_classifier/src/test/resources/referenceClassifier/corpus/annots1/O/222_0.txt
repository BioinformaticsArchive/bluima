of the contact system shown in A, with terminal boutons denoted by
solid circles and en passant boutons denoted by open circles. The
preterminal branching pattern from the parent axon in the dorsal
column to each contact is indicated. Distances are approximations and
are on different scales for the motoneuron and collaterals.

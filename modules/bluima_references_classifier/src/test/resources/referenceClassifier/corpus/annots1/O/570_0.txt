Sequencing of cDNA Clones
Cloned cDNAs were sequenced with the ABI Prism ready reaction
Dyedeoxy Terminalor Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc.. Foster
City. CA) in an ABI 373A automated sequencer. All clones were
sequenced bidirectionally using the T7 (S'dlTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGl3') forward and SP6 (S'd[GATITAGGTGACACTATAG]3')
reverse primers. Homology matching was performed by genomic
database searches using the National Center for Biotechnology Information software packages BlastN and BlastX. versions 2.0.X. via the
Worldwide Web.

lates GFAP, which causes depolymerization of GFAP (Kosako et al.,
1997). Thus, T1 can regulate GFAP assembly via the Rho signalling
pathway. Interestingly, all Trk family proteins can directly interact
with an intermediate filament, peripherin (MacDonald et al., 1999).
All together, neurotrophins may be involved in regulation of cell
morphology via cytoskeletal proteins such as intermediate filaments as
well as microfilaments and microtubules (Etienne-Manneville & Hall,
2002).

where S c1; c2 is the set of concepts that subsume both c1 and c2. A class that achieves the
maximum value in Equation 1 will be termed a most informative subsumer; most often there
is a unique most informative subsumer, although this need not be true in the general case.
Taking the maximum with respect to information content is analogous to taking the rst
intersection in semantic network marker-passing or the shortest path with respect to edge
distance cf. Quillian, 1968; Rada et al., 1989 ; a generalization from taking the maximum
to taking a weighted average is introduced in Section 3.4.
Notice that although similarity is computed by considering all upper bounds for the two
concepts, the information measure has the e ect of identifying minimal upper bounds, since
no class is less informative than its superordinates. For example, in Figure 1, coin, cash,
etc. are all members of S nickel; dime , but the concept that is structurally the minimal

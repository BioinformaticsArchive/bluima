quantification of axonal processes from bulk labeled populations of
neurons (P. J. Broser et al., submitted for publication). To quantify the
radial spread of axonal processes around the injection site we used
a polar measurement grid referred to from here on as a ``pinwheel.'' The
origin of the pinwheel was located on the center of the injection site,
and the zero degree or ``D-row axis'' was aligned to a straight line
connecting the center of the injection site and the center of the D3
barrel (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The location of the center of the D3
barrel was established from cytochrome oxidase-stained sections in
layer 4. As all our injections were made approximately in the center of
the D2 column, the orientation of the pinwheel was approximately
aligned to the D-row axis. Placement of the pinwheel on all supra- and
infragranular sections was achieved using radial blood vessels as fiducial
landmarks (see Supplementary Fig. S1B,C). The maximum radius of the
pinwheel was 1050 lm. Each element in the pinwheel was 50 lm wide
and subtended an angle of 15 , with the total length of axon in each
element of the grid being quantified. For initial analyses, the total length
of axon in each element was normalized to the area of the element to
yield a map of axonal density (Supplementary Fig. S1E). The total axonal
length within subregions of these density maps could then be further
compared by defining regions of interest comprising a user-defined
number of individual elements at any location of the map.

Sag
The input resistance showed an increasing
relationship as a function of distance from
the soma, which is different from L5 pyramidal neurons of the same age (Zhu,
2000). In L5 neurons, dendritic Ih has a
counterbalancing role for input resistance
(Berger et al., 2001) and leads to even more
pronounced sag in the distal tuft region
(Zhu, 2000; Williams and Stuart, 2000;
Berger et al., 2001). We were therefore in-terested to test for dendritic sag with direct
dendritic current injection. Although the
slight sag in L2/3 pyramidal neurons indicated that some Ih current is present, it is
far less pronounced than in L5 pyramidal
neurons (Zhu, 2000) and does not affect
the dendrite more than the cell body. Be-cause Ih can reduce the amplitude and time
window of summation of synaptic input
(Williams and Stuart, 2002; Berger et al.,
2003), the relative absence of Ih in L2/3
neurons suggests that the timing for association of top-down and bottom-up in-puts might be different. Although the op-timal separation of bAP and dendritic
input appeared to be slightly longer (5â€“10
ms) than in L5 pyramidal neurons (Larkum et al., 1999b), this question will re-quire a separate study.

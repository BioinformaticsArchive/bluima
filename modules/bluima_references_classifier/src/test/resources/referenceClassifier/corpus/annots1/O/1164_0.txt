Roughly speaking, the goal of the BioNLP shared task
is to extract biological events from literature, given their
raw text and protein annotations. The BioNLP shared
task defines “txt”, “a1” and “a2” formats for this event
extraction task. A “txt” format file contains raw text of a
biomedical paper, while the corresponding “a1” format
file includes protein named entity boundaries annotated
on that paper. Participants of the shared task were
required to submit “a2” format files, which define
extracted events and may refer to protein annotations in
the corresponding “a1” files. In the shared task evaluation, submitted “a2” files were compared with the gold
standard “a2” files which were manually annotated by
human curators.
Our services are interoperable with other UIMA/U-Compare services, which allow users to create customized
workflows easily. UIMA, Unstructured Information Management Architecture, is an interoperability framework for
unstructured information in general. UIMA is provided as
an Apache open source project and is widely used in the
NLP domain. A UIMA component can either be a local
service or a web service, and both types can be freely
mixed to create a UIMA workflow.
U-Compare provides a broad range of UIMA compliant
components including BioNLP components such as protein taggers and annotated corpus readers. Compatibility
of these components is guaranteed by sharing data type
definitions. U-Compare also provides a UIMA compliant
integrated NLP platform. The U-Compare platform provides direct access to the U-Compare components, where
local components are automatically downloaded and executed on demand. A local component has the advantage
of portability although users are required to install the original tool in case of a non-Java implementation. On the
other hand, a web service component can have limitations
in its computational capacities. The U-Compare platform
allows easy workflow creation from these components or
any third party UIMA components. Additionally, U-Compare provides a comparison and evaluation feature implemented in a UIMA compliant way [8]. U-Compare shows
the results of workflow runs both statistically and visually.
All of these features are available without any programming necessity.
We have integrated the bio-event meta-service, which
we describe in this paper, to the U-Compare platform.
This integration could accelerate developments of text
mining in the bioinformatics area. The most straightforward usage of our system would be to combine a few text
mining tools and run the resulting pipeline on any text
relevant to a specific biological use-case. Our system
makes such a usage dramatically easier compared with the
existing systems.
While our ready-to-use services themselves are very useful especially for the end users of text mining, comparison

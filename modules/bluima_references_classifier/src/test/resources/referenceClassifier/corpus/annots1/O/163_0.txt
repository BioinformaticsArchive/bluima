1998; Ruthazer et al., 1999). Similarly, the end of the most
sensitive part of the critical period, P60, corresponds with the age
at which transneuronal labeling reveals ocular dominance columns of mature appearance (Ruthazer et al., 1999). Together
with the transneuronal studies, the physiologically identified critical period defines the time course of ocular dominance column
development in the ferret.
The duration of deprivation had a profound effect on the extent
of cortical changes. While 7 d deprivations were sufficient to
induce a saturating shift in ocular dominance, 2 d deprivations
were ;70% as effective. The ferret cortex therefore changes more
slowly in response to monocular deprivation than does the cat
cortex, in which 2 d of deprivation produces a saturating ocular
dominance shift (Crair et al., 1997b). Although the factors un-derlying this interspecies difference are obscure, structural differences between cat and ferret V1 may account for it. In the ferret,
cortical cells are more monocular at the onset of the critical
period than are cells in cat V1. The normal critical period age
ferrets studied here had an average monocularity index slightly
larger than that of critical period kittens (0.56 6 0.04 critical
period ferrets, n = 3 hemispheres vs ;0.45 in 3- to 4-week-old
cats, estimated from Hubel and Wiesel, 1970, Crair et al., 1998).
Because the population of cells in ferret V1 is more monocular
than that in cat V1, competition between eyes may proceed more
slowly (Mustari and Cynader, 1981).
The larger average size of ferret ocular dominance columns
means there is less border length between opposite-eye columns
in a given area of ferret cortex than in cat cortex. If changes in
ocular dominance proceed along ocular dominance column borders, the smaller border length in the ferret may slow the overall
progress of ocular dominance changes. NMDA receptors, which
have been implicated in cortical plasticity associated with MD in
vivo (K leinschmidt et al., 1987; Bear et al., 1990; Roberts et al.,
1998), have been demonstrated to be organized into patches that
coalign with borders of ocular dominance columns in the cat
(Trepel et al., 1998, but see Catalano et al., 1997). The relative
paucity in ocular dominance borders, and therefore smaller
NMDA-receptor-rich areas, if they exist in the ferret, may ac-count for the slower progress of plasticity in the ferret.

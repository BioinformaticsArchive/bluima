The necessity and appropriateness of
studying parameters beyond copulatory be-havior, or lordosis, depends entirely on the
questions being asked. If sexual behavior is
used as a readout for the actions of hormones
or drugs on a particular neural substrate, then
lordosis is quite adequate. It is reliable, quantifiable, and replicable, and it lends itself to
reductionistic, mechanistic study. If, however,
the goal is to fully understand the complexities, idiosyncrasies, and/or evolution of hormonal regulation of feminine sexual behavior
in a particular species, then the study of lordosis in a vacuum is no more appropriate than the
study of jaw movements alone in an attempt
to understand the complexities of appetite and
body weight regulation. Finally, if the goal is
to provide a reliable, preclinical model for hu-man sexual behavior, then it is appropriate to
address the many issues that are considered
later in this review.

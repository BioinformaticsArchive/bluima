Action potentials have been shown to shunt synaptic charge to a degree that depends on their waveform. In this way, they participate in
synaptic integration, and thus in the probability of generating succeeding action potentials, in a shape-dependent way. Here we test
whether the different action potential waveforms produced during dynamical stimulation in a single cortical neuron carry information
about the conductance stimulus history. When pyramidal neurons in rat visual cortex were driven by a conductance stimulus that
resembles natural synaptic input, somatic action potential waveforms showed a large variability that reliably signaled the history of the
input for up to 50 ms before the spike. The correlation between stimulus history and action potential waveforms had low noise, resulting
in information rates that were three to four times larger than for the instantaneous spike rate. The reliable correlation between stimulus
history and spike waveforms then acts as a local encoding at the single-cell level. It also directly affects neuronal communication as
different waveforms influence the production of succeeding spikes via differential shunting of synaptic charge. Modeling was used to
show that slow conductances can implement memory of the stimulus history in cortical neurons, encoding this information in the spike
shape.

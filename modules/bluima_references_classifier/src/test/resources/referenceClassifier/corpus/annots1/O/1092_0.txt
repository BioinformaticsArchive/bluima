tions. With 75 mM (Fig. 6 B) and 140 mM external K+ (other experiments) the
relationship was almost linear. The solid lines in Fig. 6 B represent the fit of the
constant field current equation to these data (see Discussion). The fitted value for the
K+ premeability (PK) in 4 mM [K+]o in this experiment was 5 Ã— 10-s s/cm.

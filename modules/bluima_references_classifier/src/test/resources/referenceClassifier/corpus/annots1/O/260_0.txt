to an action on the underlying plateau potential.13,16,17,19,22,26,28 To reveal plateau potentials,
action potentials were blocked by 1 μM tetrodotoxin.
Figure 2B shows that the plateau potential, uncovered in absence of action potentials, was abolished by
bath application of 3 μM propofol (ii). The plateau
potential remained suppressed despite compensating
for the anaesthetic-induced hyperpolarization (iii)
and reappeared after washing out propofol (not
illustrated). The suppression of plateau potentials,
therefore, is a major component of the eVect of
non-volatile anaesthetics on the evoked response in
plateau-generating neurons. The block of synaptic
transmission by tetrodotoxin makes it unlikely that
the eVect of anaesthetics on plateau potentials was of
presynaptic origin.
Since plateau potentials were usually promoted by
serotonin, one could argue that suppression was due

bilateral musculature of different structures like the tongue and
soft palate over a large set of motor domains (W&h et al., 1995).
In rat, the direct coupling between the dendrites from both
sides probably contributes to the bilateral synchrony, bccausc
synchrony was also demonstrated between two areas, i.e., crus IIA
and lobule IXb, which receive their climbing fibers from olivary
neurons that are coupled by a series of dcndrodcndritic gap
junctions but do not receive common affcrcnts. By showing that
the bilateral synchrony is attributable partly IO a direct connection
in the neuropil of the left and right IO (Fig. 9), WCdcmon\trate to
what extent clcctrotonic couplin, (7 bctwccn olivary neurons can
play a role in their activity. The prcscnt findings imply that groups
of olivary neurons located distantly tram one another in diifcrent
olivary subdivisions have the ability to oscillate and fire in synchrony, provided that the groups of neurons arc connected
through some pathway in the olivary ncuropil (Llinds and Yarom,
1981a,b, 1986; Yarom, 1992). Whether the olivary neurons will
actually fire in synchrony depends on the state of elcctrotonic
coupling, which is regulated by the GABAcrgic input from the
ccrcbcllar and vcstibular nuclei (N&on ct al., 1984; Sotclo et al.,
19%; DC Zeeuw ct al., 1988, 1989; Angaut and Sotclo. 1989;
Llinhs and Sasaki, 19X9; Lang et al., 1989, 1990; Sasaki ct al., 1989;
Frcdette and Mugnaini, 1991; Lang ct al., in press). Thcsc findings
suggest that the concept that dificrcnt olivary subdivisions are
separate functional entities (Oscar\son, 1980) has to be modified
in that all possible intrinsic pathways within the ncuropil of the
entire IO should be taken into consideration and the olivary
compartments should be conqidercd as dynamic states and not as
purely anatomical structures (Llinlis and Sasaki, 1989). Thi\ new
insight may explain some rcccnt, uncxpcctcd cxperimcntal re-sults. For example, WC rcccntly dcmonstratcd that sonic Purkinjc cells in zones 2 and 4 of the rabbit flocculus can show
climbing-fiber modulation during vestibular stimulation in the
dark (De Zceuw et al., 199Sb), cvcn though thc\c climbing
fibers arc derived cxclusivcly from the dorsal cap of the IO,
which is known to receive visual signals from the nucleus of the
optic tract (Tan et al., lYY5). The vcstibular signals to the IO
are conveyed generally from the vcstibular nuclei to the
p-nucleus, but as far as is known presently, not directly to the
dorsal cap (Barmack et al., 1989; De Zceuw et al.. 1993).
Bccausc the p-nucleus is continuous with the dorsal cap (Fig.
lo), it is possible that the vestibular information is transmitted
to some extent from the fi-nucleus via coupled dendrites to the
dorsal cap. Similarly, Welsh et al. (1995) dcmonstratcd that
diffcrcnt domains of Purkinjc cells in crus IIA arc activated
synchronously, dcpcnding on the type of tongue movcmcnt that
is being generated. These domains arc dynamic in that they can
overlap partly for one type of movement but not tor another.
Moreover, for some types of movcmcnts, the synchronously
activated domains arc not restricted to a single climbing-fiber
zone, indicating that the synchronous activation of different
olivary subdivisions is apparcut not only after systemic administration of picrotoain but also under physiological
circumstances.
In sum, WC conclude that the activity of neurons located re-motely in diffcrcnt olivary subdivisions is coordinated in time and
that the neurons in these different olivary subdivisions. controlled
by their cerebellar GABAergic input, can function cohc~cntly.

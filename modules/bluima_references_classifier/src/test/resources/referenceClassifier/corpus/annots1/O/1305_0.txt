the molecular level, special importance has been attributed to
NMDA and GABA-A (α1 and α6 subunit-containing) receptors (D'Angelo et al., 1995; Cull-Candy et al., 1998; Farrant and
Nusser, 2005). These are highly sensitive to neurotransmitter
spillover and are suitable to set the appropriate time constants
for signal processing in the cerebellar glomerulus. Finally, neurotransmitter release probability at the mf-GrC synapse, which
can be tuned by long-term synaptic plasticity (D'Errico et al.,
2009), regulates the time course of EPSP temporal summation and
spike emission. Thus, these factors need to be taken into account
to appropriately simulate granular layer dynamics in the spatial,
temporal and frequency domains.
The computational reconstruction of the granular layer
reported in this work was based on biophysically realistic models of granule cells (GrCs: D'Angelo et al., 2001; Diwakar et al.,
2009) and Golgi cells (GoCs: Solinas et al., 2007a,b) and of their
synapses (Nieus et al., 2006; Mapelli et al., 2009). The network,
stimulated with patterns inspired to those observed in the mossy
fibers (mfs) in vivo, generated center-surround, time-windowing, high-pass filtering and theta-frequency oscillations regulated
by neurotransmitter release and NMDA and GABA-A synaptic
receptors. Interestingly, the center-surround structure was capable of fine-tuning the delay, number, and frequency of spikes
generated by GrCs suggesting that the cerebellum granular layer
behaves as a complex spatio-temporal filter, which can be adapted
through long-term synaptic plasticity and coordinated by coherent oscillations.

Figure 9. Bouton density profiles of VPM and POm projections reveal overlap
domains. (A) Vertical column profiles of VPM (red line) and POm (green line) bouton
fluorescence intensity (in relative units) measured in TC slices between pia and
SCWM. Boutons were labeled as described in Figure 8. (B) Separation and overlap of
VPM and POm projections in a column. Merged profiles of VPM (red) and POm bouton
(green) projections illustrate well separated and partially overlapping projection
domains (yellow) of VPM and POm boutons at different depths. Two afferent sparse
zones are also apparent. Total length between pia and SCWM is normalized to
``standard length'' 1840 lm VPM bouton in red and POm bouton profile in green.
Scale bar 0.5 mm. (C) VPM bouton profiles along vertical column axis (bright red) and
septum (dark red). (D) POm bouton profiles along vertical column axis (bright green)
and septum (dark green). (E) Horizontal profiles across column borders for VPM
boutons at 2 different depths from the pia as indicated in Figure 8. Individual
fluorescence peaks are clearly separated by darker septa at ~750 lm depth (bright
red; arrows). At 1200 lm depth, a weak laminar patterning is still present (dark red).
(F) As E for POm boutons. At ~750 lm depth septa are clearly delineated (bright
green, arrows). No clear separation between columns and septa is visible at 1200 lm
depth (dark green).

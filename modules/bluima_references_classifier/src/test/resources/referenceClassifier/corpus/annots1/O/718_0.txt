Figure 3. Digitized images showing DiI staining in Par1 cortex that did not contain an ectopia from a NZB male. (A) The pattern of diffusion from a small DiI crystal placed in layer I
just under the pial surface. The arrow marks the approximate location of the DiI crystal. DiI diffuses extensively into all layers but is more restricted in layer IV, producing a distinct
hourglass shape, which was consistently seen in normal Par1 cortex. (B) A more caudal section showing that in parts of the barrelfield fibers extend through layer IV in narrow fascicles
between the barrels. Labeled fibers are seen in layer IV in narrow columns between the barrels (arrow). (C) Contralateral connections to the homologous cortex to the DiI placement
seen in (A). The fibers branch in layers II/III and V, where retrogradely labeled cell bodies are seen (arrow). (D) Fibers from the internal capsule that pass through the reticular nucleus
(Rt) and are connected with Po (arrow). Bar = 200 Î¼m.

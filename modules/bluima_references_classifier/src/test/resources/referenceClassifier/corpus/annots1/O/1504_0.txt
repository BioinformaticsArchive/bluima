SUMMARY POINTS
1. Transcription factors regulate binary cell fate decisions and function in concert
with other transcription factors to specify neuronal typeâ€“specific dendritic branching
patterns.
2. A number of ligand/receptor pairs involved in axon guidance also regulate dendritic
routing, but axons and dendrites of a given neuron, and even different dendrites of a
given neuron, often respond differently to the same guidance cues.
3. Dendro-dendritic repulsion plays important roles in the establishment of dendritic
field boundaries and in the proper spacing of dendrites within an arbor, but the cellsurface molecules that mediate dendro-dendritic contacts are largely unknown.
4. Dendritic wiring patterns may be determined cell-intrinsically largely by transcription
factors, but the mechanisms that ensure proper synaptic target matching remain to
be identified.
5. Following establishment of dendritic fields, intrinsic and extrinsic signals are required
for maintenance of dendritic arbors. Mechanisms for maintenance of the dendritic
field are directly linked to those involved in the establishment of fields.
6. Extended time-lapse imaging of dendrites in vivo demonstrates that remodeling is
normally restricted to terminal dendritic branches. However, in insect systems, dendrites are extensively remodeled after development, and limited analysis of some
pathological states suggests that dendrites may maintain the capacity for large-scale
remodeling.

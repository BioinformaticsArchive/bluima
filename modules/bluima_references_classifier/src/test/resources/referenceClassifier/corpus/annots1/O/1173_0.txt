ambiguity for the tagged document sets before and after
the disambiguation step by LINNAEUS are shown in
Table 3. Ambiguity levels are calculated as the number
of ambiguous mentions divided by the total number of
mentions, where an ambiguous mention is counted
when a mention maps to several species. The disambiguation method “none” shows values prior to any disambiguation; “earlier” disambiguates by scanning for
explicit mentions earlier in the document and, for comparison, “whole” disambiguates by scanning for explicit
mentions in the whole document. “Strict” disambiguation does not consider the associated probabilities of
correct species mentions, whereas “approximate” represents the disambiguation of any mentions where a single
species has higher than 99% probability, or the sum of
all species probabilities is lower than 1%.
Scanning for explicit species mentions elsewhere in
the text leads to roughly a two-fold reduction in ambiguity for abstracts, but nearly a five-fold reduction for
full text. Approximate tagging based on probabilities of
correct species usage leads to roughly a two-fold reduction in levels of ambiguity, in both abstracts and full
text. Overall, less than 2.9% of mentions in full-text
documents remain ambiguous when explicit mentions
are sought elsewhere in the text and, combined with
approximate disambiguation based on probabilities of
correct species usage, levels of ambiguity drop to less
than 1.5%.

where f( V) is the Boltzmann function of Equation 2, s is the slope, and c
is the y-intercept of the linear function. Na reversal potential E was

calculated from the root of Equation 4 as E c/s. The peak Na
Na
conductance density g was calculated using a 30 ms test pulse to 10

mV preceded by a 50 ms prepulse to 120 mV to completely remove
steady-state inactivation (see Fig. 2C,D). g was extrapolated by dividNa
ing current traces with an exponential function fitted to the decay of the
current to account for the temporal overlap of activation and inactivation (supplemental Fig. 1 B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (Keynes and Rojas, 1976). g was then calculated as
Na
g ( V) I /(VA), where I is the corrected Na peak current am-Na Na,c Na,c
plitude, V is the test pulse potential, and A is the membrane surface area
of outside-out or nucleated patches, as appropriate. The axonal length
was estimated from the shortest distance between the tip of the axonal

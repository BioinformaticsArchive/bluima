K -acetate (2 M) and QX314 [N-(2,6-dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl)

distinguished by their responses to SP stimulation and the phase of peak
depolarization during fictive stepping (Burke, 1999). The duration of the
afterhyperpolarization (AHP) was measured in every cell, from the spike
onset to where the AHP crosses the baseline (Gustafsson and Pinter,
1984). Stimulation of peripheral nerves was given every 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 sec.
All responses were further studied during a period of 2 hr after intravenous clonidine injection ( -noradrenergic agonist; 500 g/kg; Sigma,
2

St. Louis, MO) and during episodes of fictive locomotion induced by
perineal stimulation. Up to two doses of clonidine were injected in an
experiment, and data were recorded for the following 2 hr. Once
clonidine was injected, there was no return to control conditions, and all
subsequent recordings were considered post-clonidine data.
A “trial” is the averaged response in one motoneuron evoked by the
stimulation (n 40) of a given pathway (a cutaneous afferent–motoneuron pair). Several pathways could be studied in a given motoneuron
corresponding to different cutaneous stimulation. The transmission of
cutaneous pathways was monitored by measuring the peak amplitude of
IPSP and EPSP in motoneurons. The amplitude of IPSPs (R2) was measured as the maximal negative deflection from the baseline in the intracellular trace in response to the stimulation, and the amplitude of EPSPs
(R1-R3) was measured as the maximal positive deflection from the baseline, as illustrated in Figure 2 (upward and downward arrows) and de-scribed in Results. Changes attributable to training, clonidine, or locomotion were determined by comparing the average amplitude obtained
in each of these three conditions.
Data collected during rest (silent ENGs) and during fictive stepping
were compared to study state-dependent changes in cutaneous transmission. During locomotor episodes, bursts of ENG activities were used to
divide the step cycle into flexion (corresponding to swing) and extension
(corresponding to stance) phases. The locomotor cycle, defined as the
period between the onsets of two successive bursts of ENG activity in
extensors, was normalized to the duration of the averaged cycle. PSPs
evoked during flexion and extension were separated and averaged to
study phase-dependent modulation.
Statistical analysis. Histograms in the figures are expressed as means
SEM. Statistical analysis was performed to disclose differences between
responses obtained (1) in sham-operated and trained groups (trainingdependent plasticity), (2) at rest and during fictive locomotion (statedependent changes), (3) during flexion and extension phases of locomotion (phase-dependent changes), and (4) before and after clonidine
injection. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov–Liliefors test was used to compare
the shape and location of the distribution of responses to a normal distribution, and the Levene median test was used for equal variance. If these
two tests confirmed that the sample variables did fit a normal distribution and were equally variant, a one-way ANOVA was performed; if not,
the Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks was used. The 2 with the
Yates correction factor or Fisher's exact test evaluating frequency distributions was used to further identify differences in the occurrence of type
of responses between groups. For all statistical tests, the significance level
was set to p 0.05. In histograms, significant difference is indicated as
follows: *p 0.05; **p 0.01; or ***p 0.001. When no significant
changes were found in data measured before and after clonidine injection, the data were merged together.

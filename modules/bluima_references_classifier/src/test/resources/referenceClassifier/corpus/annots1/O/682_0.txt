synapsin II (or of both I and II) apparently does not affect the
amount of transmitter released by individual action potentials, as
assessed by examining synaptic facilitation, but does accelerate
synaptic depression and increases post-tetanic potentiation (Ro-sahl et al., 1995). Finally, deletion of synapsin III decreases basal
transmission at inhibitory synapses but not excitatory synapses
(Feng et al., 2002).
Some of the uncertainty concerning synapsin functions is at-tributable to the fact that mammals possess multiple synapsin
genes. If only one or two of these three genes are deleted, the
remaining gene products may compensate for the missing synapsins and mask a more fundamental phenotype. To determine
whether this was the case, we examined synaptic transmission in
mice in which all three known synapsin genes were deleted. Furthermore, we used direct measurements of quantal content to
measure basal transmitter release at excitatory and inhibitory
synapses. We found that loss of all three synapsin genes was not
lethal but did cause substantial changes in behavior and synaptic
transmission. These defects differ for excitatory and inhibitory
synapses, indicating that synapsins have unique functions at different synapses.

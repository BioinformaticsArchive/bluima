role of medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex in negative and
positive emotional processing is further supported by consideration of cytoarchitectonical, connectional and functional
differences (Morecraft et al., 1992; Bates and Goldman-Rakic,
1993; Carmichael and Price, 1994, 1995a,b, 1996; Barbas, 1995;
Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1998). The medial orbitofrontal
cortex shows an agranular or dysgranular cytoarchitetconic; is
connected with hippocampal formation, ventrolateral parts of
the basal nucleus of the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(area 9 and rostral 46), dorsomedial parts of mediodorsal
thalamic nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex; and is functionally involved in negative emotional processing and affective
reactivity to alien stimuli (Morecraft et al., 1992; Baker et al.,
1997; Drevets and Raichle, 1998; Morecraft and Van Hoesen,
1998). In contrast, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex shows a granular cytoarchitetconic, and is connected with ento/perirhinal
cortex, ventromedial parts of the basal nucleus of amygdala,
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 45 and caudoventral 46),
ventromedial parts of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, premotor
and parietal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. One may
thus hypothesize that, functionally, the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex may be related to the formation of assocations between
emotions and thoughts (Morecraft et al., 1992; Bates and
Goldman-Rakic, 1993; Baker et al., 1997; Drevets and Raichle,
1998; Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1998). Consequently, negative
emotional stimulation may be processed in medial prefrontal
cortical areas, whereas positive emotional stimulation uses
lateral prefrontal cortical structures.
Such a functional dissociation between medial and lateral
prefrontal cortex with distinct temporal properties is further
supported by our analysis of structural connectivity in primate
prefrontal cortex showing a clear connectional differentiation
between medial and lateral prefrontal cortical pathways, which
would be in full accordance with the present fMRI/MEG data as
measured in humans.This distinction between medial and lateral
prefrontal cortical pathways may account for the process of
negative and positive signification of somatic and cognitive
events. According to Damasio (Damasio, 1994, 1995, 1997),
somatic and cognitive events become signified by emotions
either negatively or positively before they are transformed into
actions. The activation paradigm in the present study consisted
in concomitant emotional (negative and positive visual pictures)
and motor (finger extension with a mouse click after the
appearance of each picture) stimulation, thus requiring transformation of negative and positive emotional experience into
(motor) action, and therefore investigated the spatial and temporal course of emotionalâ€“motor activation from orbitofrontal to
premotor/motor cortex via the various prefrontal cortical
regions. Spatial and temporal differences between negative and
positive emotional processing may be interpreted as a support
for the assumption that the process of transformation of
negatively and positively signified events into actions may be
subserved by distinct prefrontal cortical networks.

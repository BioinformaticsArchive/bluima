pared with their scrambled oligonucleotide-treated controls.
In contrast, antisense oligonucleotides to both SRC-1 and
CBP, administered together into the VMH, decreased estradiolinduced PR expression, compared with the control-treated
contralateral VMH. The studies suggest that functional
interactions between the co-activators SRC-1 and CBP, and
ovarian steroid receptors could potentiate the hormonedependent effects on gene expression in the VMH (Molenda
et al., 2002; Tetel, 2000). Interestingly, while the antisense
oligonucleotides to SRC-1 and CBP decreased PR expression in the VMH, their effects on hormone-dependent
female reproductive behavior were very distinct. While the
overall intensity of progesterone-facilitated lordosis was
altered by the antisense oligonucleotides there was no difference in the lordosis frequency (represented by the lordosis
quotient) between the two treatment groups. Since co-activators
like SRC-1 are also targets for multiple signaling pathways, it
is plausible that they could play a role in ligand-independent
activation of PRs in brain and behavior.

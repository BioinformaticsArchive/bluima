~100 000–200 000 interneurons (and
hence a total of ~400 000–800 000
neurons) are required in a microcircuit for
each cell type to be represented in its
correct proportions. Therefore, neither a
minicolumn containing ~100–200 neurons
[8] nor a functional column containing
~10 000 neurons (rodents) [31] to ~60 000
neurons (primates) [32], can be strictly
stereotypical. Stereotypy of microcircuits
and functional columns becomes even
more unlikely when their precise intrinsic
and extrinsic connectivities are
considered. This suggests that there is, in
fact, no strict stereotypical microcircuit in
the neocortex of the same animal at the
level of resolution of measurable
structural and functional features. The
existence of a common microcircuit
template, from which multiple variations
are formed is, however, still possible.

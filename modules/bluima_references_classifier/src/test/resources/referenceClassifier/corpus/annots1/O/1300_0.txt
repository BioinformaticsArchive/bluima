FIGURE 4 | Emergent parameter distributions demonstrate the are shown with their ideal respective truncated Gaussian and Poisson
creation of variable and realistic virtual granule cells of the probability density functions. (B) Distribution emergent parameters for
dentate gyrus. (A) Probability distributions for several scalar real (dashed line) and 10,000 generated (solid line) neurons.
emergent parameters of 100,000 generated granule cells. Distributions (C) Sample reconstructed and generated dentate granule neurons,
for total dendritic length, number of bifurcations, and surface area visualized in NEURON.

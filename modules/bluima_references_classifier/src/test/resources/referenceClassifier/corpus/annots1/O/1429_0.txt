Morphological
The morphological appearance of interneurons is a source
of important information regarding their specific role in a
neuronal circuit. Indeed, their anatomy alone can provide
intuitive insights into cell-type-specific contributions in an
active network, by relating the somatodendritic location to
the layer specificity of synaptic input and the axonal
projections to the postsynaptic target domain. The earliest
studies, based on Golgi impregnations [1,7], distinguished
, 20 different types of interneuron in the hippocampus.
Specific types of cell were assigned a simple descriptive
term according to a striking feature of their axonal or
dendritic processes (e.g. basket cell, horizontal cell and
stellate cell). A significant improvement was the development of labeling techniques that allowed examination of
the entire dendritic and axonal processes of single cells [8].
To match the large number of interneuron types, an
equally rich terminology was adopted. Specific cellular
types were defined by a combination of classical terms
(e.g. basket cells) and new descriptive terms that emphasized different aspects of interneuron anatomy [9]. For
example, some terms highlighted the postsynaptic target
domain (e.g. `axo–axonic cells', which innervate the axon
initial segment of the postsynaptic cell [8]); others referred to
the two specific layers containing the soma and the axonal
processes (e.g. oriens–lacunosum moleculare, `O–LM cells'
[3]; pyramidale–lacunosum moleculare, `P–LM cells' [10];
oriens – oriens and radiatum, `O – bistratified cells' [11]). In
the case of long-projection interneurons, the origin and
target brain regions were embedded in the terminology
(e.g. hippocampo – septal neurons [12]). Different systems
emphasized the main axis of orientation of the interneuron
dendritic tree (e.g. stellate cells, and vertical and horizontal cells located in stratum oriens [13,14]) or, finally,
the specific afferents onto pyramidal cells that overlap
with the interneuron projections (e.g. Schaffer-collateralassociated interneurons [15,16]).
However, given the lack of a universally agreed
anatomical nomenclature, different investigators have
described the same type of interneuron using different
descriptive terminology (e.g. horizontal cells [14] and
O – LM cells [11,17]; vertical cells [14], and basket or
bistratified cells [8]), leading to a strong need for a
universally recognized interneuron vocabulary. Despite
the usefulness and potential descriptive power of accurate
morphological characterization, the role of an interneuron
in an active brain network is ultimately and crucially
shaped by its functional properties which, therefore, need
to be included in its definition.

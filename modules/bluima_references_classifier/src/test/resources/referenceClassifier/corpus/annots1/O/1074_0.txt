MEMBRANE POTENTIAL AND SODIUM CONDUCTANCE 501
were obtained by interpolating between records made with the test step alone.
The conditioning voltage clearly had a marked influence on the inward current
during the second step, for the amplitude of the sodium current varied between
1P3 mA./cm.2 with VJ = + 46 mV. and about 0-03 mA./cm.2 with V1 =-29 mV.
The quantitative relation between the sodium current during the test pulse
and the membrane potential during the conditioning period is given in Fig. 5.

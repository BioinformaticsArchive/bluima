Krogan et al. (2006) have described the use of tandem
affinity purification (TAP) tagging followed by two different mass spectrometry methods, namely MALDI-TOF and
LC-MS/MS, with the aim of assigning interacting partners
to each of the yeast proteins [19]. An impressive 72% coverage of the predicted yeast proteome was made possible
due to the increased sensitivity of tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. We have used this
study as the initiation point to determine the range of proteins that can interact with the ING family of proteins.
Here we attempt to elucidate human ING protein interactions based the recently published yeast interactome data
[19], hoping to identify real interactions in the long tail of
low probability noisy interactions detected.

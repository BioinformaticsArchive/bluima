Translation initiation is implicated in LTP and LTD
New evidence indicates that LTP and mGluR-LTD both regulate
cap-dependent translation initiation and in turn are affected by
manipulations of translation initiation machinery. NMDA treatment, E-LTP-inducing, and L-LTP-inducing protocols increase
phosphorylation of Mnk1, eIF4E, 4EBP, and p70 S6 kinase and
stimulate formation of the translation initiation (eIF4F) complex, all of which function to enhance translation initiation and
the global translation rate (Banko et al., 2004, 2005; Kelleher et
al., 2004a; Klann and Dever, 2004; Wells, 2006). Interestingly,
DHPG treatment, which leads to mGluR-LTD, also results in
phosphorylation of Mnk1, eIF4E, and 4EBP and stimulates eIF4F
complex formation (Banko et al., 2006). In both LTP and LTD
paradigms, Mnk1 and eIF4E phosphorylation depends on
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Banko et al., 2004,
2005; Kelleher et al., 2004a). During mGluR-LTD,
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3 kinase) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) stimulate phosphorylation of eIF4Ebinding protein (4EBP), which is thought to gate eIF4E phosphorylation by ERK (Banko et al., 2006). Consistent with these
biochemical findings, inhibition of PI3 kinase, mTOR, or ERK
prevents protein synthesis-dependent LTP and mGluR-LTD
(Tang et al., 2002; Gallagher et al., 2004; Hou and Klann, 2004;
Kelleher et al., 2004a) (Fig. 1).
Recent studies demonstrate that genetic deletion of two suppressors of translation initiation, 4EBP2 and an eIF2a kinase,
GCN2, similarly affect LTP and hippocampal-dependent memory (Banko et al., 2005; Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005). A single
tetanus, which elicits only E-LTP in wild-type (WT) mice, results
in a translation-dependent L-LTP in 4EBP2 and GCN2 knockout (KO) mice, suggesting that the threshold for L-LTP is re-duced. mGluR-LTD is also enhanced in the 4EBP2 knock-out
mice (Banko et al., 2006). Surprisingly, spaced trains of 100 Hz
stimulation, which elicit L-LTP in WT mice, cause little or no
potentiation in mutant mice. As a result, both of these KO mice
lines show a deficit in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks.
The reduced L-LTP in response to space trains could be attributable to the elevated level of eIF4F initiation complexes formed in
the absence of 4EBP and nonselective translation of mRNAs or
repressors of LTP (Banko et al., 2005; Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005).

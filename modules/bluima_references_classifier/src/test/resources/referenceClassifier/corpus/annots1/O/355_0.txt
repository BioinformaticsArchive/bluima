Figure 3. Steady-state inactivation of 14 pS channel. The records were
from the same patch shown in Figure2. The relationshipbsetween
holding potential and open probability (A) and mean open time (B) are
shown. The calcium channel was activated by depolarizing steps to 0
mV for 200msecevery4 sec.Theordinatein A is theopenprobability
(NPo) averaged from 64 sweeps of each holding potential. The ordinate
in B is mean open time for all openings from each holding potential.
C, Channel activity (NPo) of each sweep is plotted against recording
time. Numbers in this figure indicate holding potentials during each
period.

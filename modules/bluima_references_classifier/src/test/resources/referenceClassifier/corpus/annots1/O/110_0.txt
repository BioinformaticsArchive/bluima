FIGURE 3 | Specificity of experience-dependent plasticity during adultborn neuron development. (A) Intrinsic signal odor map in response to a
two-odor mixture (left panel), and the corresponding blood vessel map on the
surface of the olfactory bulb (right panel). Sensory-active domains are marked
by a black contour in the blood vessel map. Two regions of interest (ROIs),
containing the neurons shown in B, are indicated by dotted circles. ROI 1 is in
a sensory-non-active domain, while ROI 2 is within a sensory-active domain.
Scale bar: 1 mm. (B) Two adult-born periglomerular neurons expressing
PSD95-GFP as a proxy for synapses from the same experiment shown in A.
Left: a periglomerular neuron from a non-enriched domain (non-active, ROI 1),
Right: a periglomerular neuron from an enriched domain (active, ROI 2). Top,
maximum projection images of the original Z stacks. Bottom, two-dimensional
view of the reconstructed neurons at the top. Asterisks mark putative
synapses. Scale bar: 20 Î¼m. Sensory enrichment increased both the size of
the neurons' dendritic tree and the number of their putative synapses.

fan cues, 7 d after hormone or sham implantation rats were placed in the
startle cages and 5 min later presented with 30 noise bursts [30 s interstimulus interval (ISI)] intended to produce a stable startle baseline. This
was followed by 40 additional startle stimuli, of which 30 occurred 2.2 s
after the onset of the light, noise, fan, light/noise, light/fan, and fan/noise
stimuli (five of each cue or cue combination). Trial types were pseudorandomly arranged. Compound stimuli were presented simultaneously.
Training. Beginning 24 h after the pretest, rats were returned to the
startle chambers and 5 min later presented with the first of 10 noise
bursts, which served to habituate the startle response to a stable baseline.
Beginning 30 s later, rats received four training/test trials in one of two
orders: AX , BX , BX , AX (program A), or BX , AX , AX ,
BX (program B). The training trials were structured as follows: 2.2 s
after the onset of the 3.7 s compound cue, a 50 ms startle probe occurred
and startle was assessed; 3.2 s after the onset of the compound cue, a 500
ms shock occurred (on AX trials) or did not occur (on BX trials).
Thus, on AX trials, animals received both a startle stimulus and a
shock. The shock coterminated with the compound cue. Trials were
separated by three presentations of the startle probe in the absence of any
cue for the purpose of sampling baseline startle throughout the session.
The intertrial interval (ITI) was 30 s. Training sessions occurred daily,
with programs A and B used in alternating sessions for 6 d. On every third
day, training was interrupted, and a posttest session was run instead. The
session began with 30 startle probe presentations, which were followed
30 s later by 30 additional startle stimuli, of which 15 occurred 2.2 s after
the onset of A, B, or AB (i.e., five tests of each cue). The remaining 10
occurred in the absence of any cue for the purpose of sampling startle
baseline throughout the test session. The trial types were presented pseudorandomly, and the ITI was 30 s.

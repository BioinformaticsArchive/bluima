inactivated nor otherwise blocked state, determines the magnitude of a persistent inward current and affects the intrinsic activity of Purkinje neurons (Raman and Bean, 1999; Williams et al.,
2002). To confirm that the rate of spontaneous firing depends on
the availability of TTX-sensitive sodium channels, we tested the
effect of TTX on spontaneous spiking under quasi-stationary
conditions at low TTX dose ( 10 nM). A decrease in spontaneous
spike rate was observed with TTX concentrations as low as 0.5 nM
(23 9%, four cells) and reached 50% (55 10%, four cells;
p 0.02) at 6 nM TTX (Fig. 4). Control firing rate was restored to
95% within 60 min after removal of TTX from the external
solution.

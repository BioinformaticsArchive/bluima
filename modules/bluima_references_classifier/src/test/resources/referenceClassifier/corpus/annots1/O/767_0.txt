other medially. Bifurcations seem to be a feature typical of contralateral (callosal) axons, but less so of ipsilateral, subcortically
projecting fibres. Callosal cells localized dorsolaterally in the cortex
are more likely to bifurcate than dorsal and medial ones, but the
bifurcation rate decreases with age, being time-regulated during the
late embryonic and early postnatal period. In addition, our in vitro
experiments demonstrated that dissociated cortical cells also bifurcate
when cultured over the dorsolateral region of cortical slices, but not
over medial regions, or when intermediate targets (i.e. midline and / or
internal capsule) have been removed. We therefore conclude that
axonal bifurcation may be a strategy of some developing callosal
neurons seeking their targets, relying on environmental cues rather
than on intrinsic cell-autonomous determinants.

FIGURE 2. NMDA receptor activation induces four types of membrane behavior in spinal motoneurons in the presence of TTX. (A) Persistent depolarization. (B) Rhythmic oscillations of membrane
voltage. (C) Plateau potentials (in this example interspersed with low amplitude voltage oscillations).
(D) Long-lasting voltage shifts. (Adapted with permission from Hochman et al.,46 Hochman and

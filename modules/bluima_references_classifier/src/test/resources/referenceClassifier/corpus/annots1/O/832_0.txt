Figure 2. Some of the interneurons that have been filled with biocytin and reconstructed following intracellular recordings in layers 3 (A) and 4 (A, cell g; and B) of cat visual cortex
(largely V1) (Thomson et al., 2002). The most striking feature is probably the wide diversity of interneurons. Some clearly identifiable `types' are shown, e.g. the double bouquet cell
(A, cell a) and the Martinotti-like cell in layer 3 (A, cell c), those in both layers that resemble cells described previously as large basket cells (A, cell f; B, cell k, although only for cell k
was it possible to identify termination preferences as no filled postsynaptic pyramidal targets were identified for cell f in this study) and the very small neurogliaform cells (A, cell d;
and B, cell l). Note that the (dendrite-targeting) double bouquet cell was the only layer 3 interneuron filled that had a significant axonal arbour in layer 4. More typical of layers 2 and
3 are smaller local circuit cells (A, cells b and e), many with ascending axonal arbours and a few larger cells with tightly focused projections to layer 5 (cell f). Layer 4 also contained
cells whose projections were largely confined to layer 4 (B, cells h, j and l, although h also inhibited a layer 3 pyramid), but a significant proportion also innervated lower layer 3 (A,
cell g; B cells h, k and m) and layer 5 (B, cells i and m). Since these neurons were filled during triple recording experiments, connections with other neurons were identified for some
of them. These are indicated in the cartoons immediately above or below the drawing of the appropriate interneuron. Interneurons are depicted by circles, with the reconstructed
interneuron shaded more darkly than other interneurons in that small circuit. Pyramidal cells are depicted by triangles and spiny stellates by diamonds.

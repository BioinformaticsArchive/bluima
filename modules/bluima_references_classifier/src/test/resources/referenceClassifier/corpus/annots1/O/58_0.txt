Assumption V
Recovery from refractory depression is dependent on Cares in the
following manner. In the absence of Cares, recovery proceeds at
some minimal rate ko. After a stimulus, the rate is accelerated by
the interaction of a calcium-bound molecule CaXD with the
release site (Fig. 3A, right, and Eqs. 12, 13, and 14). CaXD
increases by a constant amount DD and decays exponentially to 0
with a time constant tD. We refer to this calcium-dependent
acceleration of recovery from refractory depression as CDR. This
treatment is based on our studies at the climbing fiber synapse
(Dittman and Regehr, 1998). As in the case of XF, we assume that
XD is not saturated during stimulus trains (see assumption III).

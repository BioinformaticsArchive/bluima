Figure 1. The laminar arrangement of cortical interneurons is altered in p35/ mice. Coronal sections of P12 somatosensory cortex, showing expression of GFP (under GAD67
promoter; A, B), and BrdU labeling. (C, F, I) Binned quantification of the distribution of GFP) and GFP)/BrdU) cells (mean percentage Â± SEM); bin1 closest to the lateral
ventricle. In both genotypes, GFP) cells are distributed throughout the cortex, but in p35/ mice, they are more dense in the upper cortex with increased accumulation in LI
compared with controls (A, B). The relative distribution of GFP) cells in the cortex is shown in (C). In p35)/) mice, early-born (E13.5) interneurons occupy the lower layers (D,
arrows), whereas they acquire mostly superficial positions, including LI, in p35/ mice (E, arrows). The relative distribution of GFP)/BrdU) (E13.5) cells in the cortex is shown in
(F). In p35)/) mice, late-born (E15.5) interneurons are confined to the upper cortical layers (G, arrows). In contrast, in p35/ mice, these cells are found mostly in lower aspect
of the cortex. Some cells accumulated superficially within and below LI (H, arrows). The relative distribution of GFP)/BrdU) (E15.5) cells in the cortex is shown in (I). Error bars
represent SEM. A significant difference in layer distribution of GFP) (P \ 0.005, v2 test) and GFP)/BrdU) (E13.5, P \ 0.001; E15.5, P \ 0.001; v2 test) cells in the cortex is
observed between p35)/) and p35/ mice. Bin comparison is done by Student's t-test (*P \ 0.05, **P \ 0.01, ***P \ 0.005). Roman numerals designate mature neocortical
layers. Scale bar, 100 lm (A, B, D, E, G, H).

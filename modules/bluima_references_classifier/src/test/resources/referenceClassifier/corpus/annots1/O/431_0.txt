testing for fear-potentiated startle because of a lost head cap.
Also, a supplementary analysis was performed on a separate
group of animals (the delayed test procedure described below;
n = 11). These placements are also shown in Figure 5. There was
no attrition from this group.
Light-enhanced startle
As indicated by a significant session type effect (F(1,22) = 11.1; p <
0.05), illumination increased startle amplitude. There was also an
overall effect of treatment (F(1,22) = 9.06; p < 0.05), indicating
that N BQX disrupted phase I to phase II increases (Fig. 6 A).
There was not, however, a significant session type Ã— treatment
interaction ( p > 0.1). Thus, N BQX attenuated the phase I to
phase II increase irrespective of whether that increase occurred
on dark 3 dark or on dark 3 light sessions. In fact, startle

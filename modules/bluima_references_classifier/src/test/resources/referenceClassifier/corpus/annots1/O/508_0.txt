The quest to understand the way in which neurons interconnect to form circuits
that function as a unit began when Ramon y Cajal concluded that axo-dendritic
apposition were too conspicuous to be incidental and proposed that two neurons
must be communicating through these points of contact „see Shepherd and
Erulkar, 1997, Trends Neurosci., 20, 385–392.... Lorente de Nó was probably the
first to predict that a defined group of vertically displaced neurons in the
neocortex could form functional units „Lorente de Nó, 1938, Physiology of the
Nervous System, 20, OUP: 291–330... for which Mountcastle found experimental
evidence „see Mountcastle, 1997, Brain, 120, 701–722... and which was ultimately
demonstrated by Hubel and Wiesel in their elegant discovery of the orientation
selective columns „Hubel and Wiesel, 1959, J. Physiol., 148, 574–591.... Until
today, however, it is still not clear what shapes functional columns. Anatomical
units, as in the barrel cortex, would make it easier to explain, but the neocortex is
largely a continuous slab of closely packed neurons from which multiple
modules emerge that can overlap partially or even completely on the same
anatomical space. Are the columns in fixed anatomical locations or are they
dynamically assigned and what anatomical and physiological properties are
operating to shape their dimensions? A recent study explores how the geometry
of single neurons places structural constraints on the dimensions of columns
in the visual cortex „Stepanyants et al., 2008, Cereb Cortex, 18, 13–24....

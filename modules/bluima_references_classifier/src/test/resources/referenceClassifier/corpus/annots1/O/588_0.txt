dissipation of the electrochemical gradient existing across the
mitochondrial inner membrane. The enzyme complex is composed of two major units: Fo, which is embedded within the
inner membrane; and F1, which lies in the matrix region. F.
is a hydrophobic complex and is believed to be a highly
selective pathway for directing protons across the inner membrane (for reviews, see Refs. l-5). F1 is composed of five
subunits ((u,p, y, 6, and c) at a stoichiometric ratio of 3:3:1:1:1,
respectively (6-9). Synthesis of ATP occurs on F1 and ATP
is released from a tight binding site on F1 at the expense of
the energy present in the electrochemical proton gradient.
Although known to be necessary for the formation of an active
complex, the role of the (Ysubunit in this catalytic mechanism
remains unclear. However, several functions ranging from a
purely regulatory role to a direct involvement in the catalytic
mechanisms have been proposed (l-5).
The o( subunit has a magnesium-independent, adeninespecific nucleotide-binding site (10-12) which in Escherichiu
coli binds ATP and ADP with Kd values of 0.1 and 0.9 PM,
respectively (10). Upon binding ATP, a significant conformational change in the (Ysubunit has been detected in experiments which show that the complex of the (Ysubunit and
ATP has a decreased sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis, an
increased sedimentation coefficient, an increased mobility on
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and changed behavior in
small-angle x-ray scattering (11, 13, 14). Nevertheless, the
role of this nucleotide-binding site remains unclear as studies
of the E. coli LYsubunit suggest that it is neither a hydrolytic
nor a regulatory site (2, 12, 15). In addition, it appears that
reconstitution of the (Y,& and y subunits into a functional
complex does not require the 01subunit-binding site to be
occupied (16).
In this study, the nucleotide and predicted amino acid
sequences and high-yield overexpression in E. coli of a cDNA
for the (Ysubunit of the rat liver ATP synthase are reported.
The rat liver (Ysubunit sequences are compared to the other
known mammalian mitochondrial (Y subunit sequences: the
bovine heart 01subunit sequence (17) and a partial sequence
of the bovine liver o( subunit (18). As expected, extensive
sequence homology exists between the mammalian a!subunits,
consistent with the identity existing between the mammalian
@subunits (17, 19, 20). The rat liver (Ysubunit overexpressed
in E. coli consists of almost the entire mature cy subunit,
lacking only the N-terminal 14 residues. This (Y subunit
protein is shown here to be expressed at an extremely high
level, to bind nucleotides, and to exhibit properties of solubility and interaction with Mg2+ ions that closely parallel those
of the (Ysubunit protein derived from rat liver.

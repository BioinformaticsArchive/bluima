DISCUSSION

We describe here the membrane and firing properties of a sample of elevator
motoneurones and as such have provided the preliminary evidence needed for an
assessment of their integrative properties. However, we have no formal evidence as
to the functional types of motoneurones included in our sample and so must admit
to some uncertainty as to the precise composition of our sample. Specifically we do
not know the relative proportions of different functional subtypes of a-motoneurones,
nor can we distinguish between a- and fusimotor motoneurones.
Fortunately the rat masseter muscle is composed almost entirely of type II
muscle fibres (Schiaffino, 1974; Rowlerson, Mascarello, Barker & Saed, 1988), with
type hIA fibres being by far the most predominant type (Schiaffino, 1974; Rowlerson
et al. 1988). Therefore the majority of the a-motoneurones in our sample would
presumably innervate type hIA muscle units and so would form an essentially
homogenous population. This could in turn account for the failure to find
relationships between the parameters plotted in Fig. 6 because the data from the
hindlimb motoneurones indicate that there are no systematic variations in
motoneurone electrical properties within a single functional subtype (Zengel et al.
1985). Mikhailov & Kuneev (rat: 1981) claimed to have identified a- and y-motoneurones on the basis of differences in resting membrane potentials and
antidromic latency. Presumed y-motoneurones had membrane potentials of
40-60 mV and a mean antidromic latency of 0-24 ms whereas the corresponding
values for ac-motoneurones were 65-90 mV and 0-16 ms. The argument is un-satisfactory on two counts. First the latency difference could simply be a consequence
of more pronounced damage inflicted at the soma by the electrode in the group with
lower membrane potentials. This would slow conduction from the axon to soma and
so increase antidromic latencies. Second the evidence in the cat is that conduction
velocity alone cannot be used to separate a- and y-motor fibres in the masseter
nerve (Appenteng, Morimoto & Taylor, 1980). However, the possibility that some
neurones both in their sample and ours were indeed y-motoneurones is one that
cannot be entirely dismissed if only because the criteria for doing so under the
conditions of these experiments remain to be determined.
One factor that would affect the absolute values of the membrane properties
reported would be the presence of an imperfect seal between the electrode and cell
(Jack, 1979). This would introduce a leak conductance at the soma and the effect of
such a passive conductance on Rn and T0 has been estimated by Gustafsson & Pinter
(1984 a) for a model neurone with an ideal membrane potential of -80 mV and a
uniform value of Rm throughout its dendritic tree. Their analysis showed that at a
membrane potential of -62 mV Rn would be underestimated by 30 % and r by 16 %
(Gustafsson & Pinter, 1984 a). The minimum membrane potential in our sample was
-60 mV and so roughly similar errors would be expected in our estimates of Rn and

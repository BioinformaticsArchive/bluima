E2-induced PI3K activation to up-regulate one specific gene,
Cox-2, leading to the production of the enzyme, secretion of
products of Cox-2 activation, and EC migration. This approach
can be used to identify programs of gene activation that result
from membrane-initiated steroid signaling (MISS)2 by E2.

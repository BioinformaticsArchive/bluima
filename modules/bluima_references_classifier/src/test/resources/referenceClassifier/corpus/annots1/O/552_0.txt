in vivo. Few genes have been reported that label neurons of the
upper cortical layers (Molyneaux et al., 2007). These include
Satb2, a nuclear matrix protein that induces the formation of
callosal connections by CPN during corticogenesis (Britanova et
al., 2005; Szemes et al., 2006), and Lmo4, a transcription factor
expressed in CPN of all layers (Arlotta et al., 2005). Other genes,
such as Cux1 and Cux2 (Nieto et al., 2004; Zimmer et al., 2004)
and Unc5d (Tarabykin et al., 2001; Zhong et al., 2004; Sasaki et al.,
2008), are expressed in the SVZ during the generation of upper
layer neurons and, postnatally, in neurons of the upper layers.
Finally, genes with broader patterns of expression have been re-ported to label neurons in the upper layers of cortex, including
Lhx2 (Bulchand et al., 2001, 2003), Gpr6 (Chenn et al., 2001),
Brn1 and Brn2 (McEvilly et al., 2002; Sugitani et al., 2002), Kitl,
and Dtx4 (Zhong et al., 2004). However, their patterns of expression are typically too broad to identify individual neuronal populations, and it is not known whether they label CPN among
other upper layer neuron types. Furthermore, there is a paucity of
genes that identify CPN of the deep layers.
Here we provide the first demonstration that distinct classes of
callosal neurons can be defined in vivo based on the expression of
different molecular markers, suggesting distinct molecular controls over their subtype-specific development, connectivity, and
function. Some of the CPN genes are expressed by most callosal
neurons, spanning layers II/III, V, and VI (e.g. Lpl and Hspb3),
suggesting that they may play broader roles during the development of all callosal neurons. In contrast, other genes are more
restricted to only callosal neurons of selected layers: for example,
Cpne4, Btg1, Inhba, Gm879, and Tmtc4 are expressed in layer
II/III, whereas PlexinD1, Gfra2, TcrB, and Dkk3 mark CPN of the
deep layers V and VI. Retrograde labeling experiments reveal that
the genes we identified have varying levels of restricted expression
to CPN. For example, Plexin-D1 clearly distinguishes the layer V
CPN population from CSMN, even at the interface of layer Va
and Vb, in which these two neuronal types are intermingled.
Additionally, the vast majority of Plexin-D1-expressing cells in
the cortex are CPN. In contrast, while still distinguishing CPN
from adjacent CSMN in deep layer V, Dkk3 is also expressed in
other neuronal populations of layer VI, likely corticothalamic
projection neurons. Together, these data reveal the presence of
callosal neuron subpopulations that were not previously recognized at the anatomical and histological levels, by demonstrating
that different subtypes of callosal projection neurons can be identified by combinations of molecular markers within subdivisions

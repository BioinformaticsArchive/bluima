8 A). The final two thirds of the rising phase could be fit well by
an exponential, with a time constant that declined from ;600
msec at 5 μM baclofen to ;250 msec at 100 μM baclofen (Fig.
8 A). In the collected results shown in Figure 8 B, it can be seen
that increasing the baclofen concentration from 100 μM to 1
mM produced little further acceleration of kinetics, suggesting
that the asymptotic value of 225 msec reflects a rate-limiting
step subsequent to binding of agonist to receptor. On removal
of baclofen, the decline of current was also sigmoidal. After an
initial delay, the decline of current could be fit well with a
single exponential (Fig. 8 A). The time constant of decay ranged
from ;450 msec to 2 sec among individual cells; the average
time constant was 1.1 6 0.1 sec (n = 38).
Figure 9 shows with higher resolution the sigmoidicity of activation and deactivation. The cell was moved between solutions
with a computer-driven solenoid. The time course of solution
change at the membrane of the cell was determined by the
relaxation of current when the cell was moved between two
solutions, both containing baclofen but having different K+ concentration (thin traces); solution exchange was complete in ;10
msec. On application of agonist, there was a lag of ;50 msec
before any significant activation of current (Fig. 9A). On removal

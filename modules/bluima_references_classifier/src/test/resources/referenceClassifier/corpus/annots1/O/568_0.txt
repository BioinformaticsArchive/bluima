Figure 2 OSCAR3 markup displaying recognised chemical entities (CM). A mouse-over action on an annotated term displays the associated
metadata, in this case for 2,5-dichlorobenzylamine, and displays an image representing the structure generated by the Chemistry Development
Kit (CDK) [35-37] (right). OSCAR3 concentrated on the identification and interpretation of chemical entities in text (named entity recognition,
NER). The primary purpose was to identify and extract the following types of object: chemicals (CM), ontology terms (ONT; looked-up from ChEBI
[38-40], FIX [41] and REX [42]etc.), reactions (RN; as identified by linguistic constructs, e.g. “methylated”), chemical adjectives (CJ) mainly formed
from chemical nouns), enzymes (ASE) and chemical prefixes (CPR), highlighted in different colours. These concepts are maintained in OSCAR4.

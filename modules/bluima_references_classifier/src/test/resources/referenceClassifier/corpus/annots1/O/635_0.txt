of its ability to bind to Rab11, is localized in recycling endosomes and regulates apical membrane trafficking by interacting with Rab11 in polarized epithelial cells. Recent studies
revealed that Gaf-1/Rip11 and several other proteins constitute
a family of Rab11-interacting proteins (22â€“27).
In the present study we extensively characterized the interactions of -SNAP with NSF and Gaf-1/Rip11. The results
suggest that -SNAP interacts with NSF via its extreme C-terminal region, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal re-gions are required for the interaction with Gaf-1/Rip11. In
addition, we showed a complex comprising -SNAP and Gaf-1/
Rip11 is disassembled in a process coupled to NSF-mediated
ATP hydrolysis.

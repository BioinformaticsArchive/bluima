A critical factor in classical Hebbian plasticity is the
frequency at which the inputs are recruited (see sect. IB).
High-frequency stimulation (“tetanization”) leads to LTP,
whereas low frequencies yield LTD (713). This frequency
dependence appears to be a widespread feature of longterm plasticity (231, 374, 717), although there are as al-ways exceptions to the rule. In striatum, high-frequency
stimulation in the presence of a physiological Mg2 concentration results in LTD in vitro (119). It is widely be-lieved that the frequency dependence of LTP and LTD is
at least in part due to the degree and time course of
postsynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2 influx (see
sect. IK). Brief high-frequency stimulation results in
strong postsynaptic depolarization and NMDA receptor
activation, whereas sustained low-frequency stimulation
evokes less NMDA receptor-dependent Ca2 influx (430,
713).
Apart from the theta-burst protocol of inducing LTP
(340, 569, 578, 589), few in vitro synaptic plasticity experimental paradigms are based on realistic firing patterns
(although see Refs. 101, 118, 231, 626). Importantly, one
study directly demonstrates that whereas prolonged stimulation at low frequency and with regularly spaced times
intervals robustly evokes neocortical LTD (372–376) (cf.
sect. IC), more realistic and relatively irregular low-frequency firing patterns actually fail to evoke any plasticity
(593). Conversely, some have argued that many LTP paradigms are simply pathological, because they involve ac-tivity patterns that are completely outside the physiological range of firing frequencies, which renders them not
only synapse strengthening but also epilepsy inducing
(507). These two points stress the importance of examining the impact of physiologically relevant in vivo firing
patterns in in vitro synaptic plasticity experiments.
Many have emphasized the role of high-frequency
bursts in information transfer and in plasticity (102, 380,
434, 598). Rate-dependent induction of cortical plasticity
has also served as a starting point for very influential
models of learning and development (70, 314, 426 – 429,
804). For example, Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (discussed in sect. ID) developed a rate-based model of plasticity that could account for the development of orientation tuning and ocular dominance in cat visual cortex
(70). Indeed, thalamic relay neurons are known to convey
information to the neocortex using both bursts and individual spikes (625), and several studies have found in vivo
burst firing in visual cortex during presentation of natural
visual scenes, especially in developing animals (129, 220,
826).

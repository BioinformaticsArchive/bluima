3. MODELLING NEST-SITE CHOICE IN HONEYBEES
Potential nest-sites are only visited and evaluated by a
sub-population of bees in the swarm, the scouts (Lindauer
1955, 1961). We shall assume that a decision has been
made by the colony as a whole when a consensus has been
reached by the scouts, and will therefore model scouts
only.
We adapt the model of Karmeshu & Pathria (1980).
Since bees do not dance constantly for a particular site,
but often take up dancing again for the same site they
previously advertised (Camazine et al. 1999; Seeley &
Buhrman 1999; Visscher & Camazine 1999a,b) we
included non-evangelical believers Z. We assumed that
they take up dancing again when stimulated to do so by
an evangelist (a dancer) Y, although they could do so
spontaneously without altering the results qualitatively.
The recruitment process is begun by dancers converting
neutrals. There is no evidence in individual bee time-lines

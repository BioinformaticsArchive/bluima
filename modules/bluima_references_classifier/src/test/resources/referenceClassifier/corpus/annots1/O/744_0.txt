PULSE DURATION (msec)

FIG. 6. Strength-duration curves for direct excitation of PT cells. Abscissa: duration of applied
current. Ordinate: current intensity expressed in
multiples of threshold current of 1-msec pulse
(I/IO). Values obtained from three different PT cells
indicated by different symbols.

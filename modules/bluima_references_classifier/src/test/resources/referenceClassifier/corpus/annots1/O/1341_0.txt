Cells were cultured from each of 4 developmental stages and grown in medium containing either 5 rnM (5K) or 25 rnM
(25K) potassium chloride. At regular intervals, cells were tested in Kreb's saline for the presence of action potentials
using current stimulation. The data are presented as the number of cells displaying action potentials/number of cells
examined. The number of cells examined in each group reflects the relative survivability under the specified conditions.
NS, no survival of Purkinje cells under these conditions.
a Stage I cells required several days in culture before excitability was present.

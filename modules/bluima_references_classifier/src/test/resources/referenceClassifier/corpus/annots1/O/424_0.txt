FIGURE 8. Insulin decreases PGC-1 association with the PDK4 promoter
in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to analyze
the binding of proteins to the PDK4 promoter. A model of the PDK4 promoter
and the location of the PCR primers are shown at the top of the figure. Rat
hepatocytes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde as described under
“Materials and Methods.” Cross-linked DNA was immunoprecipitated with
either rabbit IgG or an antibody to HNF4 (anti-HNF4) PGC-1 (anti-PGC-1 ), or
FoxO1 (anti-FoxO1). The bands in the gel are ethidium bromide-stained PCR
products. PCR conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” The
ChIP assays were repeated three times on independent hepatocytes
preparations.

(Figure 4C) is less pronounced than that of the dark green model trace
(Figure 4D). This is the reflection of the fact that the error value for
accommodation of the dark green model is smaller than that of the light
green model. On the other hand, in the light green model, more weight was
given to the spike rate feature. Indeed, the light green trace has 14 APs
(exactly corresponding to the experimental mean rate of seven spikes per
second) while the dark green has only 13 APs. Note that similar variability
as depicted in these two model-generated green traces may be found in
the experimental traces for the same cell and same depolarizing step. The
light green model trace is more reminiscent of the first experimental trace
of the accommodating cell (Figure 1A upper-left) whereas the dark green
trace is more similar to the second (Figure 1A upper-right).
Figure 5 portrays the spread of model parameter values at the end
of the fitting for both electrical classes (red – accommodating; blue –
fast-spiking). Each of the 300 parameter sets (each set composed of 12
parameters – the maximal conductance of the different ion channels)
at the final iteration of a fitting that passes a quality criterion is represented as a circle. The criterion in this case was an error of less than
2 SD in each feature. The circle is plotted at a point corresponding to
the value of the selected channel conductance normalized by the range
allowed for that conductance (see Methods). Since there are 12 parameters, it is difficult to visualize their location in the full 12-dimensional

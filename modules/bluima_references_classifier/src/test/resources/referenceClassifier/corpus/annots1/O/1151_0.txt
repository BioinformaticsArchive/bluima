2.3.5 Immediate Goals for the Digital Atlasing Task Force
Since we have defined a vision and recommended immediate steps that will aid in moving this field toward this vision,
we can focus our efforts on the longer-term infrastructure is-sues and begin to create more concrete standards and recommendations for which tools and resources to target for
specific components of this infrastructure.
Our immediate plans include:
• Develop a set of best-practices for ensuring particular
data types will be WHS-compatible and can more easily be
brought into this atlasing framework. The first data types
will include:
o MRI
o Nissl volumes
o Certain gene expression data, e.g., 2D image slices
• Identify and prioritize implementation components of the
longer-term infrastructure goals

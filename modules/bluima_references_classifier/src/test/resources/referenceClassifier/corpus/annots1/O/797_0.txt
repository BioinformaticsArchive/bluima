Low levels of reelin expression in the cortical
primordium
In both hem-ablated and control mice, a faint band of Reln
expression could be detected deep in the cortical primordium from
about E12.5 (Fig. 5G) to at least E18.5. At E13.5, Reln expression
appeared just beneath the pial surface. At E15.5 Reln expression
was distinguishable in the lower intermediate zone (IZ), and/or
subventricular zone (SVZ) (Fig. 6C). By E18.5 individual Relnexpressing cells could be resolved (Fig. 6D-F), and comparison
with layer-specific gene expression indicated that these cells
mostly overlapped expression of Rorb (the gene encoding ROR )
(Fig. 6D-F), which encodes a transcription factor found in cells of
developing layers IV and V (Hevner et al., 2003a). Perinatal
expression of Reln has been reported previously in layer V of the
mouse (Alcantara et al., 1998), as has faint expression at earlier
embryonic ages (Meyer et al., 2004; Meyer et al., 2002). We could
not detect reelin protein with immunohistochemistry in the CP or
IZ/SVZ, probably because of low protein levels, or reelin
diffusion. Indeed, the levels of Reln mRNA were so low at earlier
embryonic ages that they were not detected in every section
(compare Fig. 5G with 5H,J,K).

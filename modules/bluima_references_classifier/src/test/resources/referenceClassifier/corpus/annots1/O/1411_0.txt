Figure 5. Anatomical properties of connections from NBCs to PCs. (a) Three-dimensional reconstruction of a NBC (blue) innervating a pyramidal cell (green) in layers II/III. Nine
putative synapses (red asterisks) were formed in this connection (2 axo-somatic, 7 axo-dendritic). These putative axo-dendritic synapses were formed onto 3/4 dendritic trees
(innervated dendritic fraction, 0.75) and originated from 5/7 primary axonal collaterals (innervating PAC fraction, 0.71). (b) Histogram of dendritic (postsynaptic) innervation pattern.
Most of the putative synapses formed by NBCs were placed onto basal dendrites, particularly onto the second to fourth DBOs. Synapses impinging onto the apical dendrites were
preferentially formed onto apical trunks (P < 0.05). Inset diagram illustrates the branch orders of different dendritic compartments of the postsynaptic PC. (c) Histogram of axonal
(presynaptic) innervation pattern. Most synapses in connections from NBCs to PCs originate from fifth to tenth ABOs.

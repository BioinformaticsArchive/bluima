THE GENERATION OF OLIVARY WAVELETS In vivo DOES NOT DEPEND
ON THE PHASE OF SINUSOIDAL SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS
In vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from
neurons of the mouse IO. These recordings were collected under
two different anaesthetic conditions induced by either KX or
MMF to exclude anaesthesia-specific effects. Olivary neurons
that were recorded under KX and MMF conditions revealed
similar basic membrane properties (Table 1), and these properties were comparable to those obtained in previous ex vivo
measurements (Llinás and Yarom, 1981; Long et al., 2002; De
Zeeuw et al., 2003; Leznik and Llinas, 2005). However, the input
resistance was slightly, but not significantly, higher under MMF
conditions.
We have previously shown that in vivo olivary neurons can
exhibit two different types of subthreshold oscillations: typical
rhythmic 3–9 Hz SSTOs, or rhythmic 1–3 Hz LTOs (Khosrovani
et al., 2007). Spontaneous action potentials in olivary cells that
exhibited SSTOs depend on the peak phase of the oscillation
under both anaesthetic conditions (both r - 0.71, both p <
0.05), but the phase-frequency distribution of spikes under MMF
was slightly shifted compared to that under the KX condition (Figures 2A and 3A; KX: 98 ± 5◦, MMF: 119 ± 7◦; p <
0.05). To find out whether the phase of the subthreshold oscillations determines the number of wavelets in an olivary spike
in vivo, we counted the number of wavelets that were superimposed on the spike ADP (Figure 1B; see arrows) and examined
their dependency on the phase and amplitude of the subthreshold oscillation. On average, olivary spikes expressed 2.2 ± 0.1
wavelets (n - 155 spikes) under KX anaesthesia and 2.5 ± 0.2
wavelets (n - 73 spikes) under MMF anaesthesia. These values
were not significantly different (p - 0.08) and were comparable to those measured ex vivo (Mathy et al., 2009). The timing of the spike in relation to the phase of the SSTO did not

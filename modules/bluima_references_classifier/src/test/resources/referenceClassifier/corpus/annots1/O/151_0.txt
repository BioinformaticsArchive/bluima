to intermediate configurations (Fig. 6 B, inset, middle
configuration).
We ran several simulations using the model from Figure 2,
with initial Gsyn,i as in Figure 2 B, for various spatial potentiation
patterns with different spatial dispersion indices (SDj 0, 0.5, 1)
and with different numbers of synapses initially potentiated to
p 0 150% (np/N 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5). Figure 6, B and C, depicts
the residual potentiations after g-HSP for these simulations. The
residual potentiation under g-HSP was indeed larger with in-creased spatial dispersion (Fig. 6 B). At the same time, an increase
in np/N reduced the size of the residual potentiation. Thus, both
the number of potentiated synapses and their spatial distribution
throughout the entire dendritic tree will determine the size of the
residual potentiation after g-HSP. In Figure 6C, we plotted the
residual potentiation as a function of the number of potentiated
synapses for each spatial dispersion pattern and compared these
plots with the theoretical curve for the isopotential case (dotted
black line; reproduced from Fig. 1C, for the p 0 150% case). The
extremely peripheral potentiation patterns (SDj 1; cyan filled
circles) showed larger residual potentiations than the corresponding potentiations of the same number of synapses in an
isopotential neuron (black filled circles). The extremely somatocentric potentiation patterns (SDj 0, red filled circles) had
smaller residual potentiations than in the corresponding isopotential case. The intermediate potentiation patterns (SDj 0.5,
turquoise filled circles) resulted in residual potentiations that
were very similar to isopotential levels. We ran an additional set
of simulations for the somato-centric distribution (SDj 0) in
which AP generation was blocked (Fig. 6C, red open circles and
dotted line). This revealed the significant contribution that the
increased AP firing rate (attributable to the potentiation of proximal synapses) had to the weakening of the residual potentiations
in the control simulation (Fig. 6C, solid red line). However, even
in the absence of APs, the residual potentiation of the somatocentric potentiation patterns was still distinguishable from that of
the peripheral patterns (compare red open circles with cyan filled
circles). The lack of APs had no significant impact on the residual
potentiations for the intermediate (SDj 0.5) and peripheral
(SDj 1) configurations (data not shown).
We conclude that a g-HSP mechanism, based on activity at the
soma, will weaken synaptic potentiations according to their spatial distribution throughout the dendrites. np potentiated synapses spatially distributed in a somato-centric pattern will be
weakened more than an equal number of potentiated synapses in
the corresponding isopotential neuron. Indeed, in an electrically
distributed dendritic tree, the influence of proximal potentiated
synapses, relative to the other nonpoteniated ones, is greater than
in the corresponding isopotential case. For the same reasons, a
peripheral pattern of potentiated synapses will be weakened less
than in an isopotential neuron.
Under l-HSP, as we have seen (Figs. 4, 5A, middle, 5B, middle), the amount of weakening of potentiated synapses is mainly
determined at the level of the dendritic branch, according to the
degree of sparseness of the potentiated synapses on that branch.
As a first approximation for this branch-specific sparseness, we
chose the probability of potentiation, pLTPk, of synapses on
branch k. This measure is related to the ratio of the number of
potentiated synapses to the total number of synapses, np,k/Nk,
used to analytically predict the residual potentiation in the isopotential case (Fig. 1C). In dendritic trees, the pLTPk we applied also
reflects the spatial distribution of the potentiated synapses (e.g.,
with low pLTPk, the chances that the potentiated synapses will be
spatially segregated is high). In Figure 6 D, we plotted the average

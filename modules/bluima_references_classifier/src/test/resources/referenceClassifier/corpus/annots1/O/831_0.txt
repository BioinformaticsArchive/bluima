Comparison of intracellular recording results with previous work
From extracellular recordings we inferred that chromaffin cells have resistances of
5 GQ or more. Since the values previously published are at most 500 MC (Brandt
et al. 1976) we were reassured to find resistances in the range 5-10 GQ also with
intracellular recording. One possible source of the discrepancy may simply be cell size
differences, since workers using standard micro-electrodes certainly select large cells,
whereas we preferred small to medium size chromaffin cells (12-16 ,tm in diameter).
Indeed the average capacitance of the cells used by Brandt et al. (1976) was 20 pF,
to be compared with 5-10 pF in the present work. However, a difference in cell sizes
is probably not the only reason for the different cell resistance values. The data of
Brandt et al. indicate a cell time constant,fie tQJen eshrter than that found
with our technique. probably th-edifference in time constants is due to leakage around
conventional recording electrodes, introducing a shunt to ground. To account for the
fact that in spite of this shunt th~ resting potentials previously measured were similar
to those found here, we suggest that the leakage due to electrode penetration allows
some extracellular Ca2+ ions to enter the cell, thus inducing an increase in the
membrane K+ conductance (see Marty, 1981).

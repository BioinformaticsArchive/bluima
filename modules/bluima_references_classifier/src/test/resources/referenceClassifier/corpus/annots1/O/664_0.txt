interval between intrastriatal antisense (but not sense) oligonucleotide injection and amphetamine administration was 10
hr. No difference between antisense and sense oligonucleotide
injections was observed when the interval was 18 hr (data not
shown). When the interval was 24 hr, there appeared to be an
increase in Fos protein on the side of the antisense injection,
consistent with some type of rebound or sensitization phenomenon (data not shown). Suppression of Fos protein was not
observed after injection of either sense CREB or sense c-fos
oligonucleotides.
In all animals that received amphetamine (4 mg/kg; i.p.) 18
hr after CREB antisense injection (n = 4) Fos staining was
markedly reduced on the side of the antisense injection as compared to the sense control side (Figs. 8, 9; Table 1). Staining
with CREB antiserum showed a reduction of CREB-like im-munoreactivity on the side of the antisense oligonucleotide in-jection, but a complete suppression of CREB protein was not
seen in any of the cases (Fig. 9). This could be due to the stability
of preexisting CREB protein or the detection of other proteins
with which the antiserum cross-reacts. However, the apparently
partial reduction in CREB protein was enough to prevent am-phetamine induction of Fos at 2 mg/kg (n = 2) and 4 mg/kg (n
= 4). Interestingly, a higher concentration of amphetamine (6
mg/kg; n = 4) overcame some of the block of Fos induction,
consistent with the hypothesis that with a stronger stimulus there
is enough CREB protein remaining to produce a response (Table
1). The dose-response and the time course data demonstrate
that the injections have not rendered the tissue nonspecifically
unresponsive to stimulation. In addition, there was no difference
in cJun immunoreactivity between sides that received CREB
sense (Fig. lOa) or CREB antisense (Fig. lob) oligonucleotide.
Discussion
With the recognition that the long-term behavioral effects of
psychostimulant administration may be explained by changes
in intracellular signal transduction in dopamine-responsive systems, including activation of transcription factors, a substantial
body of research has been produced examining induction of
IEGs by amphetamine and cocaine (Robertson et al., 1989;
Graybiel et al., 1990; Young et al., 1991; Hope et al., 1992;
Moratalla et al., 1992; Nguyen et al., 1992). The purpose of the
present study was to investigate in vivo what may be the earliest
nuclear event in psychostimulant regulation of gene expression,
phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. In addition
to demonstrating that amphetamine produces CREB phosphorylation in striatum, and that this effect is dependent on Dl
receptors, we examined dopamine-regulated interactions of
CREB in striatal neurons with c-fos, one of its best characterized
targets (Sassone-Corsi et al., 1988; Sheng et al., 1990). Fos protein is markedly increased in striatum after amphetamine ad-ministration, but no change in CREB protein is observed im-munohistochemically. Small changes in CREB content per cell
may not be detected by this method, but there were also no
changes in the number of CREB-immunoreactive cells. These
results are consistent with studies in cell lines, in which CREB
is reported to be constitutively expressed and activated by phosphorylation on Ser133(Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989). CREB
binding to the CaRE regulatory element of the c-fos promoter
(and the palindromic ATF site) was demonstrated in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays using both striatal (brain) extracts
and extracts from primary striatal cultures. Consistent with our
immunohistochemical data, no quantitative change in the spe-

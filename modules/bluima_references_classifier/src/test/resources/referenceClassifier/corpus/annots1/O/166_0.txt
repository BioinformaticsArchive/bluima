Figure 9. Response of a thalamic reticular neuron to acetyl-b-methylcholine. The
thalamic reticular neuron was recorded in current clamp mode in 0.2 mM Ca2)/6 mM
Mg2) ACSF (to eliminate any possible presynaptic influences of the agonist). Bath
application of 250 lM of acetyl-b-methylcholine (gray horizontal line) hyperpolarized
the neuron.

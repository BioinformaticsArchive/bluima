Temporal versus rate coding
The random nature of stimulus-evoked action potential trains in
neocortical neurons in vivo does not result from noise within the
spike generation mechanism (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995; Holt et
al., 1996; Nowak et al., 1997; Stevens and Zador, 1998). Variability
must, therefore, arise from the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs
and the postsynaptic mechanisms used to integrate them. Neocortical neurons have been suggested to employ one of two methods of
synaptic integration, described as (1) coincidence detection, and
(2) random walk, that in simple and complex neuronal models are
capable of reproducing the irregular firing patterns observed in
vivo (for review, see Shadlen and Newsome, 1994; Softky, 1995;
Konig et al., 1996). Coincidence detection integrates temporally
correlated synaptic inputs over short time periods (<2 msec) to
produce irregular action potential trains, where the timing of each
action potential precisely reflects the temporal synchrony of specific synaptic inputs (Softky and Koch, 1993; Stevens and Zador,
1998; Harsch and Robinson, 2000). Random walk integration, on
the other hand, describes integration of excitatory and inhibitory
synaptic inputs over time scales defined by the membrane time
constant, where the timing of each action potential is determined
stochastically and information is represented as noisy average firing
rates that are typically measured over hundreds of milliseconds
(Shadlen and Newsome, 1994).
We have bypassed the integration of synaptic inputs in the
present investigation to explore if the precise timing of action
potentials has a specific dendritic signaling role. The observed
reliance of effective dendritic action potential backpropagation on
the timing and pattern of action potential initiation during physiological spike trains suggests that spike timing contains important
signaling information. Previous work has indicated that the irregularity of in vivo firing patterns may be reproduced in neocortical
neurons in vitro, if, and only if, neurons are driven with simulated
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that contain a significant
synchrony in their pattern of occurrence (Stevens and Zador, 1998;
Harsch and Robinson, 2000), as suggested from modeling studies
(Shadlen and Newsome, 1994; Softky, 1995). A consequence of
input synchrony is to produce periods of high-frequency action
potential firing that lend the spike train its variable frequency
content and so apparent randomness (Stevens and Z ador, 1998).
Our results indicate that this synchronous synaptic input is transduced into powerful dendritic electrogenesis in neocortical layer 5
pyramidal neurons, implying a causal relationship between input

ized antiserum against GABA (Hodgson et al., 1985). The steps were
carried out on droplets of Millipore-filtered solutions in humid petri
dishes, as follows: 2% periodic acid (H5IO6) for 10 min; wash by dipping
in several changes of double-distilled water; 2% sodium metaperiodate
(NaIO4, BDH) for 10 min; wash as before; three times 2 min in TBS (pH,
7.4); 30 min in 1% ovalbumin dissolved in TBS; three times 10 min in TBS
containing 1% NGS; 1â€“2 hr in a rabbit anti-GABA antiserum (Code
No.9, diluted 1:1000 in NGS/TBS); two times 10 min TBS; 10 min in 0.05
M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA) and 0.5% Tween 20; goat
anti-rabbit IgG-coated colloidal gold (15 nm, Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA) for 2 hr (diluted 1:20 in the same buffer); two times 5
min wash in double-distilled water; saturated uranyl acetate for 30 min;
wash in four changes of double-distilled water; staining with lead citrate;
wash in distilled water. Profiles showing a density of colloidal gold
particles at least five times of background level, in two to three adjacent
sections, were considered GABA-immunoreactive. Axon terminals forming asymmetrical synapses (presumed glutamatergic) were used to establish background density.
Controls. The specificity of the primary antisera have been tested extensively by the laboratories of origin (see references above). Controls of the
methods in the present experiments included replacement of the primary
antisera with normal rabbit serum (1:200). In these sections, no staining was
visible apart from a faint background limited to the surface of the sections.
In double-stained sections, the pattern of immunoreactivity for both antigens
was identical to that seen in single-stained material.
Replacement of the GABA antiserum with normal rabbit serum in the
postembedding immunogold reaction resulted in a loss of specific staining, that is, no signs of colloidal gold accumulation could be detected over
any profiles.

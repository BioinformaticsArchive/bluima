Figure 3. Rectification and pharmacology of responses to nicotinic receptor activation in neocortical interneurons. A, In voltage clamp, 100 μM DMPP
induced inward currents (inset) in an interneuron with a peak I–V relationship that showed inward rectification. B, The currents induced by 100 μM
DMPP in an interneuron were antagonized by 500 nM dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE). After washing out dihydro-β-erythroidine, the DMPP-induced
current partially recovered (Wash) and was almost abolished by 2 μM mecamylamine (MEC). The arrows indicate the beginning of the 1 sec pressure

The remaining current was almost completely abolished by 500 nM dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE). D, In current clamp, the application of 100 μM
acetylcholine (Ach) depolarized an interneuron and induced a discharge of action potentials. Action potentials are truncated because of the sampling
rate. E, In the same interneuron recorded in voltage clamp, acetylcholine induced an inward current (Control, bottom trace) that was blocked by 500 nM
dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE, top trace). All responses ( A–E) were recorded in the presence of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and muscarinic receptor
antagonists (see Results).

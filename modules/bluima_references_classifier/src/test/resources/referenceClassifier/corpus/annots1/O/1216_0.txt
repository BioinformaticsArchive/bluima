arguments and simulation (Sections A.2.2 and A.2.4 of the supplementary material available at Biostatistics
online).
Apart from modeling and point estimation, this paper also focuses on hypothesis testing in studies where an end point of interest is change in neural branching, such as neurodegenerative diseases
(Wearne and others, 2005), neurodevelopmental studies (Charych and others, 2006), and basic science
(Chen and others, 2005). We develop a general format for likelihood ratio testing for neuronal branching
data whereby primary level treatment effects are tested using a GLM, whereas higher-level effects are
tested using a likelihood ratio methodology (Section 2.3). This hybrid procedure allows comparisons to
be made at each branching order. The hybrid procedure is illustrated by application to a 2 factor designed

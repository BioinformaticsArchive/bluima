Nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) are implicated in a variety of
functions of the mammalian cerebral cortex, as for instance
memory formation (Granon et al. 1995) and regulation of
cerebral blood flow (Gitelman and Prohovnik 1992; Uchida et
al. 1997). Some of these functions might be compromised in
normal aging but also in Alzheimer's disease, which has been
associated, at least in part, with a decrease of the level of
nAChRs and a loss of cholinergic innervation (James and

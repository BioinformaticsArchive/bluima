beled corticostriatal neurons, and from the contralateral axons of
ipsilaterally labeled corticostriatal neurons. Corticostriatal neurons consistently (eight of eight experiments) formed excitatory
synaptic connections onto both corticospinal and corticostriatal
neurons, in approximately equal proportion ( p 0.95, signed
rank test) (Fig. 3 E, F ).

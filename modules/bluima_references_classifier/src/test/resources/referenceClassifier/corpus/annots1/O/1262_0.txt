Threshold and Gain of the f/I Relation Increase with
Distance of the Input Location from the Soma
Threshold for noisy current injection causing AP firing at the
soma increased with increasing distance of the injection site
from the soma (Fig. 1F, black dot, somatic current injection;
blue dots, proximal dendrite; red dots, distal dendrite). As
expected, threshold for noisy current was always lower than
for DC current injection at all locations (not shown). Current
injection at the soma resulted in APs (Fig. 1B) at a similar linear
frequency to current (f/I) relationship (Fig. 1C, black dots) to
that already reported for L5 pyramidal neurons (Oakley et al.,
2001), and produced attenuated back-propagated APs in the
dendrite as shown previously (Stuart et al., 1997).
The gain of the frequency to current relation was assessed by
a threshold-linear fit of the non-saturated part of the f/I curve,
typically up to 80% of the maximal frequency. This gain was
determined for each current injection site. For soma and proximal inputs, the mean gain was 0.046 ± 0.001 AP/s/pA (n = 26)
and 0.056 ± 0.013 AP/s/pA (n = 11) respectively (Fig. 1D, black
and blue dots). For distal current input, the mean gain was
significantly higher (0.082 ± 0.0345 AP/s/pA, n = 17, Fig. 1D,
red dot) than for the somatic and proximal compartments. The
gain appeared to begin to increase with current injection
around 400 μm from the soma and rose as a function of
distance from the soma (Fig. 1E). The average increase in gain
for distal dendritic current injection was 72%, and 22% for
proximal current injection. For the rest of the paper we focus
on the comparison between the distal compartment and the
soma.

Thalamocortical Targets
It has been suggested (White, 1986) that all cells that have
dendrites in layer 4, including layer 4 spiny stellate cells, layer 4
pyramidal cells, the apical dendrites of layer 5 and 6 neurons and
the basal dendrites of lower layer 3 neurons, receive thalamocortical input in layer 4. This with the possible exception of layer
6 pyramids in rodent barrel cortex, whose apical dendrites pass
through the walls of the barrels where there are no thalamic
axon terminals. That this innervation is, however, far from
indiscriminate is indicated by the selective targeting of primate
layer 4 subdivisions by different types of thalamic afferents (Fig.
1) and the sometimes sublayer specific arborization patterns of

Introduction
Cortical GABAergic interneurons can be segregated into distinct
subtypes based on their morphology, electrophysiology, synaptic
connectivity, and gene expression (Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002;
Markram et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2006). How these complex
phenotypes develop remains an open question. Given that
GABAergic interneuron subtypes support diverse cortical circuit
functions, such as mediating critical period plasticity (Hensch et
al., 1998; Di Cristo et al., 2007; Katagiri et al., 2007), entraining
network activity oscillations (Cobb et al., 1995; Bartos et al., 2002,
2007; Doischer et al., 2008), and maintaining the balance of ex-citation and inhibition (Treiman, 2001; Le Roux et al., 2008;
Wang and Kriegstein, 2008), progress toward understanding the
mechanisms that promote and maintain interneuron identity is
of broad importance.
Mounting evidence suggests that the location and time of
birth of prospective interneurons dictates their mature phenotype in part by initiating divergent transcriptional cascades
in the embryo (Xu et al., 2004; Butt et al., 2005, 2007; Cobos et

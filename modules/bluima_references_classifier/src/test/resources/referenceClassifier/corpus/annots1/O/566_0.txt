The results demonstrate that VTA.2 and SNC could be
distinguished with a 95% accuracy, while VTAl and SNC
can only be distinguished with a 87% accuracy; it confirms
the results of manual analyses showing the morphological
overlap ofVTA.1 's and SNC's dopaminergic neurons.
The results also confirm the positive impact of including
semi-automatically generated features.

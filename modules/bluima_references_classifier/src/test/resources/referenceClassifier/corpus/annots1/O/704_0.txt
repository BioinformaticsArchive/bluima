ER mRNAs (OS-1) and (OS-OG-1). As previously
mentioned, the new untranslated first exon(s) and promoter(s) might exist in the monkey ER gene. We examined the existence of the homologues of the untranslated
first exon OS of the rat liver [10] and the exon C of the
human liver [7] in the monkey ER gene by the RT-PCR with appropriate primers described in Fig. 6.

retrochiasmatic area and ventral preoptic region (e.g., see
Fig. 4D-K). Rostrally, this pathway enters the preoptic
region and ends at the level of the lamina terminalis.
Caudally, it can be followed adjacent to the ventral surface
of the brain into premammillary levels and may be the
source of fibers that end in the capsule of the mammillary
body. This pathway is used by all medial zone nuclei except
the dorsal premammillary nucleus. The medial preoptic
(Simerly and Swanson, 1988), ventromedial (Canteras et
al., 1994),and ventral premammillary (Canteras and Swanson, 1992) nuclei contribute most heavily, whereas the
dorsomedial and anterior hypothalamic (Risold et al., 1994)
nuclei both send moderate numbers of axons through this
route.
The lateral pathway is also used to varying degrees by all
medial zone nuclei, ranging from an occasional fiber from
the dorsal premammillary nucleus (Canteras and Swanson,
1992)toadensepathwayoriginatinginthemedialpreoptic
nucleus, especially its lateral part (Simerly and Swanson,
1988).This path is largely restricted to medial and ventromedial regions of the lateral hypothalamic area, and dorsally fibers appear to be concentrated immediately lateral
and dorsal to the fornix. This pathway runs along the
extent of the lateral hypothalamic area. Rostrally, it turns
laterally into the preoptic region where it joins the ventral
and periventricular paths. Caudally, it extends into t h e
ventral tegmental area, where, in the case of the medial
preoptic nucleus, it generates a dense terminal field (Si- merly and Swanson, 1988). i k o n s from other medial zone

The dorsal pathway lies in dorsal regions of the hypothalamus and ventral regions of the zona incerta. Rostrally, this
pathway appears to end at the level of the rostral zona
incerta, where the fibers either ascend to the thalamus or
descend to end in the anterior perifornical region and the
caudodorsal preoptic region. Caudally, this pathway ex-tends through the posterior hypothalamic nucleus where it
turns dorsally and then caudally to enter the brainstem.
This pathway is most extensively used by the dorsal
premammillary (Canteras and Swanson, 1992) and ventromedial (Canteras et al., 1994) nuclei, but also contains
moderate numbers of fibers from the anterior hypothalamic
nucleus (Risoldet al., 1994).
The medial pathway travels through the body of the
medial zone dorsal to the ventral pathway. The only two
hypothalamic nuclei utilizing extensively the medial pathway are the anterior hypothalamic and ventromedial nu-clei. Both lie rostrocaudally adjacent to one another and
share dense bidirectional connections. However, it is considered a separate pathway mainly because a vast majority of
the descending input to the hypothalamus from the amygdala travels through it. Most fibers in the stria terminalis
pass rostral to the anterior commissure, descend, and turn
caudally (Heimer and Nauta, 1969)to form a circumscribed
pathway through the medial preoptic, anterior hypothalamic, and ventromedial nuclei before ending massively in
the ventral premammillary nucleus. The DMH does not
receive an input from the amygdala (Canteras et al., 1992a,
1995).

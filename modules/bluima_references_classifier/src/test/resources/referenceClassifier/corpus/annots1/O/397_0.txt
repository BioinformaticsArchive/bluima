Figure 6. Colocalization of PV-, CCK-, and NPY-IR with extranuclear ER -IR. A, ER -immunoreactive puncta (red) did not colocalize with PV-immunoreactive structures (green). B,
Some ER -immunoreactive puncta (red) did colocalize (yellow) with CCK-immunoreactive
puncta (green). C, Some ER -immunoreactive puncta (red) also colocalized (yellow) with
NPY-IR (green). D, The majority ( 73%) of NPY-immunoreactive puncta (red) are colocalized
(yellow) with GAD-IR (green). E, Quantification of CCK- and NPY-IR with ER -IR. The entire
height of each bar represents the average total number of labeled puncta per 2 m stack of optical
sections (10,800 m 3 volume); the colored portion of each bar represents the average number and
percentage of puncta that were double labeled. Error bars indicate SEM. Scale bar, 1 m.

induction patterns at several time points after handled pups re-turned to the dam, focusing on regions contributing to neuronal
connections from sensory input to PVN (little consistent Fos
induction occurred elsewhere). These structures include PVT,
ACe, and BnST (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.
org as supplemental material), whose efferents influence hypothalamic CRH expression and/or release (Herman et al., 2003).
ACe is generally considered to facilitate activation of stressresponsive, CRH-expressing PVN neurons (Beaulieu et al., 1989;
Prewitt and Herman, 1994), and BnST subregions exert excitatory or inhibitory effects on PVN-mediated stress responses
(Herman et al., 1994). Fos expression in PVT, ACe, and BnST was
virtually nil in undisturbed or maternally deprived pups, but significant numbers of Fos-immunopositive neurons were present
in recurrently handled P9 rats. The time course of Fos expression,
peaking 30 â€“90 min and over by 120 min after the pups' return
to the cage, supports the notion that the burst of maternal stim-

Corticocortical cells
Although lamina V I cells that give rise to corticocortical connections have different morphologies, they nevertheless share basic
anatomical and electrophysiological similarities with the classic
pyramidal cell type. Normally oriented, inverted, or “modified”
pyramids and bipolar cells have spiny dendrites that extend differently in infragranular layers. They may thus receive different
sets of inputs, but their axonal projections, at least to the extent
that they were stained, do not permit classification of them into
different f unctional subclasses. Electrophysiological recordings in
vitro were also unable to establish a clear relationship between
cell morphology and intrinsic electrophysiological properties
among these cell types (van Brederode and Snyder, 1992). The
apparent diversity suggested by the orientation of the dendritic
trees may therefore reflect developmental changes rather than a
true differentiation into distinct cellular phenotypes.
In primary sensory cortical areas, lamina VI is not usually
considered a major source of corticocortical projections. It comes
as a surprise that 44% of lamina V I cells of the cortical barrel
field project to the second somatosensory area or to motor cortical regions. These corticocortical connections have been well
established in rats, but most were seen to arise from layers II, III,
and Va with a minor contribution from lamina V I (Donoghue
and Parham, 1983; Isseroff et al., 1984; Koralek et al., 1990;
Miyashita et al., 1994). The small number of corticocortical cells
found in lamina V I in these retrograde transport studies could
result from the fact that the injections sites did not span across the
whole thickness of the cortex and/or from the sparse arborization
of lamina VI afferents in these regions. A recent study using fast
blue as a retrograde tracer reported that a large number of cells
in lamina V Ib also project to other cortical regions, but that these
cells remained unlabeled after similar injections of wheat germ
peroxidase conjugate (Clancy and Cauller, 1996). This observation not only confirms that all tracers are not equally effective at
revealing neuronal connections (Trojanowski et al., 1982), but,
more f undamentally, it indicates that lamina V I, as a whole,
might be more implicated in corticocortical connections than what
was thought previously.

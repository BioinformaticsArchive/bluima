Dendritic Na current reduces synaptic threshold but does
not contribute to the NMDA spike once it is initiated
Although experiments using laser uncaging of glutamate in TTX
(Schiller et al., 2000) have established that NMDA spikes do not
depend on Na current, it remains possible that the Na channels that populate the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells
(Rhodes and Gray, 1994; Antic, 2003) could be involved in driving the event under control conditions. To test this possibility,
superthreshold paired-pulse stimulation was applied in control
conditions, and the response was compared with that after all
Na channels were turned off. The results indicated that dendritic Na current reduces the threshold stimulation level, which
is consistent with the behavior of this system in vitro (Schiller et
al., 2000). In simulations, a 20% threshold increase was typical,
remarkably similar to the 29% increase in threshold observed
in TTX in vitro by Schiller et al. (2000). This correspondence
indicates that the contribution of dendritic Na current to the
initiation of an NMDA spike in the simulation was close to
that observed physiologically and supports the plausibility of
the Na conductance density chosen for the basal dendrites in
the model cell.

Presynaptic effects of CTZ
In our experiments, we used CTZ to block desensitization of
postsynaptic AMPA receptors and to slow the decay of EPSCs.
However, it has been suggested that CTZ may act presynaptically
to enhance transmitter release (Barnes-Davies and Forsythe,
1995; Diamond and Jahr, 1995; Isaacson and Walmsley, 1996;
Bellingham and Walmsley, 1999). In a preceding paper, we have
shown that AMPA receptors desensitize strongly during synaptic
transmission in the absence of CTZ (Neher and Sakaba, 2001).
Therefore, the enhancement of the synaptic response seen in the
presence of CTZ is most likely caused by block of the desensitization of postsynaptic receptors rather than an increase in transmitter release.
To further explore this question, we also examined the effects
of C TZ on NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC s (NMDA EPSC s),
which have been used for testing the presynaptic effects of this
drug (Trussell et al., 1993; Diamond and Jahr, 1995; Bellingham
and Walmsley, 1999). The NMDA EPSC was isolated by application of 1 μM NBQX and 10 μM glycine, whereas the postsyn-

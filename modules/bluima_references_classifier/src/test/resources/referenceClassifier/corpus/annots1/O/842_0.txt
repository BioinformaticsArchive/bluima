range of morphological features inner vate layer 4 and lower
layer 3. However, no layer 4 interneuron whose axon extended
beyond layer 3 and into layer 2 was recovered.
The two layer 5 interneurons filled in the cat in this study
were a large bipolar cell with dendrites extending into deep
layer 6 and middle layer 4 and a medium sized multipolar
interneuron whose axon was confined to layer 5.
The interneurons filled in the rat cortex in this study did not
display such a wide range of sizes or morphological characteristics, although a range of morphologies similar to that obser ved
here in cat has been reported in rat (Kawaguchi and Kubota,
1997; Gupta et al., 2000), including several subclasses of basket
cells (Wang et al., 2002) and VIP immunoreactive bipolar cells
with vertically oriented axonal arbours (Rozov et al., 2001). Most
of the recovered cells in the present study were multipolar and
had axons and dendrites confined to the layer of origin (or to
layers 2 and 3). Four of the layer 3 interneurons recovered are
illustrated in Figure 5, with the connections recorded.
In both species the majority (âˆ¼80%) of identified inter-

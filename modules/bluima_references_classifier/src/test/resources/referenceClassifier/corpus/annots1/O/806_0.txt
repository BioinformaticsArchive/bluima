Figure 1. Synaptic coupling parameters in LI interneurons. A, Bidirectional electrical and chemical coupling between a pair of
LI interneurons. The top traces show membrane potential recorded in the presynaptic cell under current clamp, and the bottom
traces show membrane current recorded in the postsynaptic cell recorded under voltage clamp. The identities of the presynaptic
and postsynaptic cells are indicated by the diagrams between the voltage and current traces. Left, Responses when the postsynaptic cell was held near the reversal potential for Cl (V 70 mV); right, responses recorded with the postsynaptic cell held
Post
at 30 mV. The resting potential of the cell 1 was 71.4 mV, and the resting potential of the cell 2 was 69.0 mV. The traces are
the averages of 10 –15 trials each. Before averaging, the traces were aligned on the time axis to the peaks of the first action
potential in the presynaptic cell. This distorted the responses to the subsequent action potentials in the averages, which is
particularly evident in the traces in which cell 2 was the presynaptic cell. B, sIPSCs recorded from an LI interneuron under
whole-cell voltage clamp. Left, Ten seconds of continuous data recorded at a holding potential of 60 mV. IPSCs are inward
because the cell is Cl loaded. Right, The distribution of 10 –90% rise times (top) and 63% decay times (bottom) for the same cell
based on 10 min of recorded data. C, Modulation of sIPSCs by isoflurane (Iso). The averaged, normalized sIPSCs from three different
cells treated with 0.1 mM isoflurane (left), 0.2 mM isoflurane (middle), and 0.4 mM isoflurane (right) are shown. Weighted decay
time constants were as follows: left: Ctrl, 7.3 ms; Iso, 9.9 ms; wash, 8.2; middle: Ctrl, 9.5 ms; Iso, 21.4 ms; wash, not recorded; right:
Ctrl, 5.0 ms; Iso, 19.3 ms; wash, 5.9 ms. Ctrl, Control.

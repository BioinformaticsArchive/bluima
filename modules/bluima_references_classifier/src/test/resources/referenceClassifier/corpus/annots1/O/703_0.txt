bushes of thalamocortical fibres. Further knowledge of the
clusters has come from quantitative studies on the neocortex
of rodents, cats and primates (Peters and Sethares, 1991,
1996; Peters and Yilmaz, 1993). Each dendritic cluster is the
centre of a module of pyramidal cells like those of Fig. 16.
These modules are ~30 μm in diameter, and occur with
centre-to-centre spacing that varies from 20 to 80 μm; the
wider spacings occur in the larger brains of the macaque
monkey and man. Dendrite clusters appear early in ontogenesis as the cortical plate is forming, and before it receives
any afferent axons. The clusters have been described in a
wide range of mammalian brains and in every cortical area
examined in detail. Dendrites within a cluster are frequently
separated by an intercellular cleft. Gap junctions occur
between them during cortical ontogenesis, but linkages of
this sort are rare in the mature cortex.
The dendritic clusters of pyramidal cells appear to represent
one aspect of the mature development of the ontogenetic
units of the developing cortex; they fit the observed sizes of
minicolumns. Such a minicolumn may not itself be a uniform
processor, for it contains pathways that differ in their patterns
of synaptic input and in the targets of projecting axons. This
assumes that cortical outputs to such diverse targets as the
contralateral hemisphere or the thalamus differ in some
quality. However, I know of no direct experimental evidence
for this assumption.
The transverse diameter of cortical minicolumns has been
measured in 15 studies in mice, rats, rabbits, cats and
monkeys, with a variety of methods. The overall mean
transverse diameter of minicolumns from these studies (mean
of means 6 SEM) is 56 6 4 μm.

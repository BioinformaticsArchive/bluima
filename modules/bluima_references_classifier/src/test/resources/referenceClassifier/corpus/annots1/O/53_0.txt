between these possibilities. Some postsynaptic profiles, mostly
dendrites and somata, also contained a low density of particles
within the profile, which may represent receptors in internal
membrane, but this could not be differentiated from background
labelling. Particles were ver y rarely associated with dendritic
and somatic plasma membranes or glial membranes. These
particles may represent receptor labelling, but due to the
inconsistency of the signal we could not clarify this. The
immunoperoxidase reaction product for mGluR7a was mainly

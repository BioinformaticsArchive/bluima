This would be consistent with previous reports on the modulation of HSP70 binding by ATP binding and hydrolysis (20, 22,
23, 35).
The complex of PR with HSP40 and HSP70 then assembles
with HOP and HSP90 (step 3) to form what has generally been
referred to as the intermediate complex (13, 51). Through two
separate domains, HOP can bind to both HSP70 and HSP90
simultaneously and is believed to act as an adaptor to promote
the binding of HSP90 to pre-existing early complexes (52–54).
Indeed, binding of HOP to HSP70 and HSP90 occurs directly
with pure proteins and without the need for nucleotide (55).
However, HOP has been shown to favor HSP70 in its ADPbound conformation over that bound to ATP (55). Even though
HSP90 is a part of this complex, the receptor is still unable to
bind hormone, as this occurs when the intermediate complex is
converted to a mature complex.
The intermediate complex containing HSP70, HOP, and
HSP90 is then converted to a mature complex containing
HSP90 and p23 (step 4). The mechanism for this transition is
unknown, but involves the binding of ATP to HSP90, perhaps
facilitated by interaction of HSP90 with PR. p23 binds selectively to HSP90 in an ATP-bound state through interactions
with the N-terminal and middle regions of dimeric HSP90 (56).
This interaction stabilizes the HSP90 receptor complex so as to
maintain the ligand-binding domain of the receptor in a conformation capable of binding hormone (25, 57, 58).
The model outlined in Fig. 9 agrees with previous models
while adding more detail to the initiation of the pathway. We
established that the early complex (HSP40 PR) is a functional
unit in steroid receptor chaperoning, and it could be isolated as
the first step in the HSP90 chaperoning pathway for PR. It is
important to emphasize that the steps after the early complex
is formed have not been demonstrated to be isolated events,
and this model may imply a greater separation of events than
actually occurs in a living cell. It has been shown that HSP40
is a component of the HSP90 HOP HSP70 foldosome complex
isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate with antibody against
HOP (17). It has thus been proposed that the proteins studied
here constitute a “foldosome” (11) that is highly dynamic and
that may vary in composition according to what step in the
chaperoning process it is involved in at any particular time.
Unlike the stable complex between HSP40 and PR, HSP70
and HSP90 are known to interact very dynamically with PR.
Both proteins have been shown to dissociate from PR complexes with half-times of 5 min or less (9, 13). Thus, it has been
proposed that the complex dissociates after step 4 and recycles
to step 1. The persistent binding of HSP40 observed in this
study could promote recycling without the need for step 1. In
other systems, HSP70 has been shown to bind substrates iteratively, where the binding and release are governed by ATP
hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. This would make step 2 a
reversible interaction. The possibility that HSP70 (and perhaps HSP90) binds iteratively in this pathway remains undetermined, but such binding of HSP70 has been proposed for
chaperoning the glucocorticoid receptor (12).
This study shows that with PR, HSP40 binding is of high
affinity and that this interaction is sustained, thus promoting
a tight association of the receptor with the HSP90 pathway.
One clear difference between previous models and the one
proposed in this system is that not only is HSP40 the first
protein to bind to PR, but also that it remains bound to PR
throughout the pathway. It is interesting to consider an unexpected result from in vivo studies in yeast in which several
mutations in Ydj1 caused an enhanced activity of steroid re-ceptors in the absence of the hormone inducer (8). This has not
been observed after mutation of other proteins in the HSP90

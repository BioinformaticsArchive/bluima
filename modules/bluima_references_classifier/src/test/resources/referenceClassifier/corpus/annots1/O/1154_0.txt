with peptidyl whether they modify other sequence words or
not. The concept transgenic (SO:0000781) was not used at
all, instead annotating all transgene mentions, modifying or
not, with the corresponding independent entity transgene
(SO:0000902).
If not modifying sequences or biological entities containing sequences, textual mentions annotated with wild_type
(SO:0000817) are also annotated with independent_continuant (see annotation with GO MF, above) to indicate that
this refers to some unmentioned type of entity with some
specified wild-type sequence. For example, for “as seen in
the wild-type”, where “wild-type” refers to organisms with
some specified wild-type sequence, “wild-type” would also
be annotated with independent_continuant. Similarly,
where “transgenic” indicates unmentioned organisms, it is
annotated with both transgene and independent_continuant; the same applies to sequence_alteration where, e.g.,
unmentioned mutant organisms are being referenced.
However, users may want to ignore these independent_continuant annotations and not attempt to distinguish these
cases, as this is a tricky ontological issue.
This version of the SO contains basic types of sequence
variations and their corresponding processes (e.g., substitution (SO:1000002) and substitute (SO:0000048)) that are
often challenging to differentiate as nominalizations in text.
We have decided to annotate such a nominalization as the
former except where it is reasonably clear that it is referring
to the process, particularly when the nominalization is not
preceded by an article, e.g., “by substitution”. Finally, the
concepts of the sequence_variant_effect (SO:1000132) and
chromosome_variation (SO:0000240) subgraphs of the SO
were not used, as their representation and definition were
problematic, which hindered their use toward annotation.
However, we have begun collaborative work with the developers of the SO toward an improved representation of se-quence variation [78], along with other representational
refinements [79].

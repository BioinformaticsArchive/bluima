reelin and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex
The observation that reelin is expressed in most laminated forebrain regions is consistent with the notion that Reelin is essential
for ordered neuronal migration and the normal arrangement of
neurons in layers (D'Arcangelo et al., 1995; Ogawa et al., 1995).
The present study shows that at E11–E18 reelin is expressed
exclusively by CR cells in layer I, whereas at later stages prominent expression also occurs in middle cortical layers, especially in
layers V and VI. The time of reelin expression in these layers (E18
on) is coincident with the period of neuronal migration for layers
IV and II–III (Angevine and Sidman, 1961; Caviness, 1982;
Fair ́en et al., 1986; Bayer and Altman, 1991), indicating that this
second site of Reelin production may also contribute to the
generation of the reeler phenotype.
CR cells have been implicated in the regulation of the radial
glia phenotype (Soriano et al., 1997). However, Reelin is not the
essential factor regulating the radial glia phenotype (Pinto-Lord
et al., 1982; Hunter and Hatten, 1995; Hunter-Schaedle, 1997;
Soriano et al., 1997). The migratory deficits in the reeler cerebral
cortex are quite different from those in other migration abnormalities, such as lissencephaly (Reiner et al., 1995; Ecksloglu et
al., 1996; des Portes et al., 1998; Gleeson et al., 1998). In fact, in

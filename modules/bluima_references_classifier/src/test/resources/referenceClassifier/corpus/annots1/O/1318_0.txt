An opportunity for the study of regional differentiation of axons is provided by the neurogenic electrocytes of certain sternarchid fish. I n the Sternarchidae, the electric organs are neurogenic, i.e., derived from peripheral
axons, in contrast to the electric organs of most other gymnotids, which
arederivedfrommuscle(Bennett,1970,1971a).Theelectrocyteaxonsend
blindly within the electric organ. Comparative arguments suggest that an
electric organ derived from muscle was originally present but was lost in
the course of evolution. As would be expected from its neurogenic rather
than myogenic origin, the discharge, which is of high frequency (700-1500
per second), is not affected by curare (Bennett, 1966, 1970). The fibers
run from the spinal cord to the electric organ, where they run a hairpin
course, initially running anteriorly for several spinal segments, then turning
sharply to run posteriorly for several segments, finally tapering and ending
blindly in a connective tissue filament. Light microscopic examination re-veals differences in morphology a t different regions along the axon (Bennett,
1971a: Waxman et al., 1972). Where the fibers enter the electric organ
and where they turn around, they are about 20 pm in diameter. Anteriorly
and posteriorly running parts of the axon dilate to a diameter of approximately 100 pm. Where the fibers enter the electric organ and where they
turn around, nodes appear normal and extend approximately 1 pm along the
fiber. I n proximal parts of the anteriorly a n d posteriorly running segments,
the nodes also appear small. In the distal part of the anteriorly running
segment, the nodes are much larger, extending for 50 pm or more along the
axis of the fiber (Fig. 2 ) . T h e changes in nodal morphology have been confirmed by light microscopy of intact fibers isolated from the electric organ
and by light and electron microscopy of sectioned fibers (Waxman et al.,
1972).
Electron microscopy reveals that the nodes of Ranvier fall into two
classes. Where the fibers enter the electric organ and where they turn
around, and in proximal parts of the anteriorly and posteriorly running segments, the nodal morphology is similar to that of typical peripheral nodes
of Ranvier (cf. Robertson, 1959; Elfvin, 1961) ; the nodal gap extends less

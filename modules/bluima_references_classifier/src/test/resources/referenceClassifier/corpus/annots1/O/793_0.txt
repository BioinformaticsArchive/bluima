Figure 5. Competing forces of excitation and inhibition across minicolumns. The cellular relationships postulated to occur in cortical minicolumns [66], and minicolumn
pathology that is reported in postmortem cortical tissue harvested from individuals with autism [53], are shown. (a) A normal complement of minicolumns is illustrated.
Each minicolumn serves as a discrete functional unit, with key excitatory (green) and inhibitory (red) elements receiving thalamic input (dark blue) and integrating information within and across minicolumns. Superficially located GABAergic neurons (red), identified as double bouquet cells in primate cortex, have descending projections
that are postulated to contribute to the size and regularity of the minicolumn. Lateral inhibition may modulate the precision of information processing by regulating excitatory drive provided by thalamic input and cross-minicolumn excitatory afferents (broken dark green lines). (b) Minicolumn size is hypothesized to be disrupted by altering
the number or activity of GABAergic neurons (pale red cells) or their processes (broken red lines). This would effectively modify the quantitative or qualitative precision of
excitatory drive (unbroken pale green arrows) across minicolumns. Minicolumn size in the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor null (uPAR 2/2 ) mouse, which has a
50% loss of GABAergic neurons, appears to be reduced (P. Levitt et al., unpublished) in a manner similar to that observed in autism.

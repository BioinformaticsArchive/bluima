with n different time constants zk. The actual measurement, however, is also affected by the response properties
of the measurement system. These are the speed at
which the temperature jump can be induced to perturb
the equilibrium as well as the response time of the
amplifier and detection system. Let us denote by T(t) the
time course of the temperature jump and by D(t) the
impulse response of the detection system. Then, it is well
known that the response function, F(t), of the measurement apparatus is given by the convolution product

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
To quantify the mRNA expression of CRF and UI, the above
cDNA products were amplified using the ABI Prism 7000
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems; Foster City,
USA). Each reaction contained 10·μl of SYBR green PCR
master mix (part# 4309155; Applied Biosystems), 5·μl cDNA
template, and 2.5·μl each of forward and reverse primers
(0.4·μmol·l–1). Default cycling conditions were used: 10·min at
95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15·s at 95°C and 1·min at 60°C.
This protocol was followed by a melting curve analysis to
verify the specificity of the PCR products. To account for
differences in amplification efficiency between the different

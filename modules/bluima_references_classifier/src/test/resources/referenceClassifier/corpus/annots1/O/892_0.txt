Figure 14. T wo somatostatin cells and a
CCK cell affected by NA or F N E application. The somata and dendrites are shown in
black and the axons in gray. A, A somatostatin cell with ascending axonal arbors. This
neuron was depolarized by FNE (10 μM)
application in a solution containing TTX. B,
A somatostatin cell with wide axonal arbors.
This neuron was depolarized with spike discharges by F N E (30 μM) application in a
solution containing C NQX /APV. C, A large
CCK cell with axonal arbors making multiple boutons on other cell bodies. This neuron was hyperpolarized and then demonstrated depolarization with spike discharges
on F N E (10 μM) application in a solution
containing C NQX /APV.

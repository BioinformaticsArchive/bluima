telencephalic neuroepithelial cells [58â€“60], resulting in
their lower anterior but higher posterior expression. The
development of frontal and sensory subdivision is dependent on the graded action of FGF8 [61,59] and FGF17 [62].
Studies by Cholfin and Rubenstein [63,64] provide an
example of how one cerebral lobe or area such as the frontal
cortex can expand differentially and independently of the
growth rate of the other areas.
It is important to remember that although transcription
factor families are often the downstream targets of
secreted signalers they are also responsible for the precise
localization of the source of such diffusible ligands at the
patterning centers. For example, the homeobox transcription factors Hex and Hex1 have been implicated in the
initiation of FGF8 expression; however, the genes responsible for the temporal induction of FGF8 are not yet known
[65]. Maintenance of FGF8 expression is coordinated by
the action of the zinc-finger protein Sp8 [66], FGF8 autoinduction [67,68] and sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling
mechanisms [69]. Spatial restriction of FGF8 is thought
to be mediated by transcriptional suppression of Sp8 [66]
by Emx2 and by the antagonistic action of Wnts and BMPs
from the hem region [69,70]. More broadly, interactions
between FGF, BMP and Shh signaling can be dynamically
balanced and mediated by intermediary molecules such as
low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein (LRP2;
also known as megalin) [69,71]. In LRP2/ embryos, for
example, BMP signaling is increased owing to a decrease in
the clearance of BMPs. The absence of LRP2 causes an
increase of BMP in the dorsal telencephalon and a decrease
of Shh in the ventral telencephalon, resulting in extensive
defects in both the dorsal and ventral telencephalon.
Spatiotemporal and dynamic regulation is also observed
in experiments targeting other area-specific transcription
factors. The transcription factor Emx2, which is expressed
in a high posteromedial to low anterolateral gradient, has
been implicated in the spatial delineation of posterior
functional areas [72]. Manipulation of Emx2 expression
in mice by genetic knockout causes an expansion of frontal
and lateral regions (i.e. S1 and M1) at the expense of the
visual cortex [72,73]. Furthermore, viral overexpression of
Emx2 causes ectopic thalamocortical axon (TCA) projection from the lateral geniculate nucleus to areas outside
the area normally conforming to V1 [74]. COUP-TFI, a
high-posterolateral-to-low-anteromedial factor, functions
to specify both somatosensory and visual areas and to
suppress the expansion of anterior frontal and motor
domains [59]. Interestingly, the expression of COUP-TFI
seems to require FGF15, a ventral factor that emanates
from the Shh-dependent rostral patterning center [75].
Taken together, this evidence directly supports the establishment of a proper cortical protomap to instruct the
correct spatial expression of attractive cues necessary for
TCA path finding.
These patterning mechanisms are not unique to neocortical development because regions ventral to the telencephalon also undergo extensive patterning by Shh and
transcription factors such as forebrain embryonic zincfinger (FEZF1), FEZ-like (FEZF2), iroquois homeobox 1
(Irx1) and glioma-associated oncogene homologs 1 and 2
(Gli1 and Gli2). It is in this manner that thalamic, pre-

internode tortuosity (ratio of the internode interval to the direct
distance); (viii) terminal branch length (length of dendritic segment
between the tip point and the node just prior to it): the tip point is an
authentic ending within the slice, not an ending due to the slice
preparation; (ix) branching aperture (the angle between daughter
branch vectors, Fig. 4) (Karube et al, 2004); and (v) branching tilt
(the angle between the parent branch vector and the vector midway
between daughter branch vectors).
Dendritic surface protrusions were investigated at both the LM and
EM level. At the LM level, protrusions during Neurolucida reconstruction were regarded as spines, from which the spine density and
interspine interval (interval between dendritic roots of successive
spines) were obtained. To see the relationship of the internode
tortuosity with internode spine or axonal bouton density, we used the
dendritic or axonal branches with at least one spine or bouton.
At the EM level, processes >300 nm from the dendritic shaft were
tentatively called protrusions including spines (EM). From reconstructions of serial ultrathin sections, we measured the interspine interval,
direction change of successive spine roots and spine length. To measure
the width and thickness of spine heads and the spine neck circumference, we selected spines reconstructed well.
Frequency histograms were fitted by the Gaussian, exponential or
gamma distribution. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution
determines the curve pattern including the skew symmetry.

8.3.3. Predicting Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Activity
within Neural Ensembles
Most sensory stimuli are dynamic in nature. The resulting activity patterns within
the nervous system should exhibit both spatial and temporal characteristics. Our previous work indicates that different stimulus directions will evoke different steady state
spatial patterns of activity within the ensemble of sensory neurons. An oscillating air
current that moves back and forth across the animal's body should, therefore, evoke a
spatial pattern of activity that changes with the direction of the stimulus. Since the
population of sensory neurons contains cells with different frequency tuning characteristics, the spatio-temporal pattern may also change as a function of the frequency of the
oscillation (31). Different sensory neurons have very different peak response amplitudes, depending on the lengths and movement axes of their associated hairs. Different
neurons with the same directional sensitivities may be activated as much as 180° out of
phase with one another, depending on the lengths of their associated hairs. As a corollary phenomenon, we predict that there will be frequencies at which sensory neurons of
opposite directional sensitivity will be firing synchronously.
In collaboration with John Miller and Sharon Crook, we are developing a computational tool called the DynamicAtlas, which is a combined query–computational–visualization tool for studying the dynamic response properties of cell ensembles (32–34).
The DynamicAtlas is part of the suite of computational tools in NeuroSys. It uses the

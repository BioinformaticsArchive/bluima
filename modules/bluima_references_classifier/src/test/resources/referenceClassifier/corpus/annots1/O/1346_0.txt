1 INTRODUCTION
The main point of this paper is to show that large back-propagation BP networks can be applied to real image-recognition problems without a large, complex
preprocessing stage requiring detailed engineering. Unlike most previous work on
the subject Denker et al., 1989 , the learning network is directly fed with images,
rather than feature vectors, thus demonstrating the ability of BP networks to deal
with large amounts of low level information.
Previous work performed on simple digit images Le Cun, 1989 showed that the
architecture of the network strongly in uences the network's generalization ability.
Good generalization can only be obtained by designing a network architecture that
contains a certain amount of a priori knowledge about the problem. The basic de-sign principle is to minimize the number of free parameters that must be determined
by the learning algorithm, without overly reducing the computational power of the
network. This principle increases the probability of correct generalization because

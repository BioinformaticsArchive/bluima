Figure 10. Determining the time course of excitatory synaptic conductances in neocortical pyramidal neurons using the voltage jump method. All traces
taken from a somatic whole-cell recording of a layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neuron at 35°C; the internal solution contained 1 mM QX-314 and 0.5 mM
ZD 7288. A, The neuron was held at 80 mV, and a series of voltage jumps (from 95 to 65 mV in 5 mV steps) was given to test for membrane
linearity, bracketing the voltage range used for determining the charge recovery. The resulting currents are shown below the voltage commands (average
of 5 traces each; the series resistance of 6.0 M was compensated by 90%). B, The currents were scaled by the command voltage and superimposed to
demonstrate linearity. An EPSC was evoked by stimulation of afferent fibers near the apical dendrite and is shown at two different holding potentials
in C (averages of 25 traces). D, The traces in C have been scaled by their peak amplitudes and superimposed. The 20 – 80% rise times of the currents
were 1.15 and 1.13 msec at 70 and 90 mV, respectively, and the decay time constants were 6.2 and 6.1 msec, respectively. E, Charge recovery curve
obtained for this EPSC with jumps from 70 to 90 mV. Each point represents the average of 21–26 separate trials. The values of the best fit using the
analytical function (thick line) were v 3.36 msec; rise 0.54 msec; and dec 1.47 msec. Fitting the decay of the charge recovery with a single
exponential f unction gave dec 1.59 msec.

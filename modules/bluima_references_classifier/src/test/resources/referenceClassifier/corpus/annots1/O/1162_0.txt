types, but rather between the gene names themselves.
There are numerous examples of species ambiguity
among gene names, i.e. two or more species sharing the
same gene name. For example, cdc2l5 is used as a gene
symbol for cell division cycle 2-like 5 in both human [EntrezGene:8621] and in mouse [EntrezGene:69562]. There
are also examples of gene name ambiguity found in a single species, i.e. two different genes sharing the same name
or symbol. The human gene corneal endothelial dystrophy 1
[EntrezGene:8197] has official symbol CHED1, and alias
symbol CHED, while human cell division cycle 2-like 5 [EntrezGene:8621] also has CHED as an alias symbol.

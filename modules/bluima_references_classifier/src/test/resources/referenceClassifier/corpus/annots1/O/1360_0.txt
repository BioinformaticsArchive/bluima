Figure 1. Outgrowth of the pioneer P, cell in the periphery at different stages. A, Drawing of three adjacent segmental ganglia and of two P,
cells at approximately EIO. Each P, neuron sends a major axon through the dorsal posterior (DP) nerve of its own ganglion to dorsal skin, where
it branches profusely, and two minor axons to the periphery of the adjacent segments through neighboring ganglia. The mirror-image branching
pattern of the contralateral homolog is not shown, but was used as a control for several of the experiments described here. LM, lateral midline;
DM, dorsal midline. Anterior is up in all panels. B, P, cell at E8. The major projection, presumably pioneering the DP nerve, reaches the edge of
the dorsal germinal plate. Dotted fines depict the outline of the ganglia and the connective nerve. The two minor projections reach the corresponding
position in adjacent segments via the connective nerves that link neighboring ganglia. C, P,, cell at E9. The major projection forms six primary
branches at this time, while the minor projections are devoid of branches. D, P, cell at El 1. Dotted lines with arrowheads represent the segmental
borders. The arrowheads on right margin indicate the borders of the five annuli of the central segment. The major axon has arborized extensively
within each annulus, covering seven to nine annuli. Scale bar (in B), 100 p,m for B-D.

varying directions. Figure 5 shows one such case, in which three
VB neurons with widely varying directional selectivities (range =
135°) were shown to provide input to an S1 SIN that lacked any
directional preference.
Remarkable divergence from single VB neurons to multiple
SINs of a barrel was also demonstrated (Swadlow and Gusev,
2002). One VB neuron (dubbed `Hercules' because of potent
functional contacts with many SINs) was shown to make a
functional contact with each of nine SINs that were studied over
a 4 day period in the aligned S1 barrel. The VB–SIN pairs shown
in Figure 4 show two of the contacts made by Hercules on one of
these days.
Such a high degree of divergence/convergence is suggestive
of the `complete transmission line' between successive nodes of
a network that was described by Griffith (Griffith, 1963) [also
(Abeles, 1991)]. These networks are characterized by very
reliable transmission between the input and output nodes, but
the cost of this reliability is a sacrifice in `complexity of task'
(Griffith, 1963). This description is very consistent with the
response properties of S1 SINs. As described above, these
neurons are exquisitely sensitive to ver y low amplitude peripheral stimulation and they respond faithfully to high stimulus
frequencies. Enhanced sensitivity is an expected consequence of
a high degree of convergence because spikes in a large number
of input neurons each have an opportunity to elicit a response in
the target neuron. SINs have sacrificed `complexity of task',
however, in that they lack the directional selectivity that is seen
in most of their thalamocortical inputs. In this view, SINs obtain
their multidirectional receptive fields by pooling the input from
a large number of thalamocortical neurons with widely differing
directional preferences.

Fig. 1. Dose-response to E2 in the 293/hERα, 293/hERβ, and 293/ERE2ALP reporter vector clone mix. The different genetically engineered
clones and clone mix were exposed to the indicated concentrations of E2
for 72 hr before assay for the amount of ALP reporter protein expressed
as described in the text (5 × 10-12 M indicates no added E2; solvent only).
Values are the mean from triplicate determinations for each concentration of E2, with error bars (standard deviation) indicated for each value.
For some concentrations, error bars are not visible because they were
smaller than the symbol.

dendrites and spines of hippocampal neurons in vivo (Lin et al.,
2005). Conversely, interruption of synaptic input in vivo destabilizes the cytoskeleton in NL dendrites (Deitch and Rubel, 1989).
Perhaps stimulation induces activity-dependent stabilization of
the cytoskeleton in stimulated dorsal dendrites of NL neurons,
which helps sustain existing dendritic branches. When we compared the percentage of TDBL either added through growth or
lost through retraction (data not shown), we found that the stimulated dendrites lost significantly less length than control dendrites. The retraction of unstimulated dendrites perhaps can also
be attributed to cytoskeletal changes induced by the relative lack
of activation. Another explanation for the differential changes
observed in stimulated and unstimulated dendrites is that balanced activation of the two sets of dendrites may be required to
maintain their relative TDBLs (discussed later). In the future, it
will be important to assess the effect that different stimulation
paradigms have on NL dendrites to determine which mechanism
is more likely.

Dendrite Maintenance Is Linked to
Field Formation
In the Drosophila PNS, dendritic arbors of
class IV neurons maintain the tiling of the
body wall throughout larval development af-ter dendritic territories are initially established by like-repels-like dendritic repulsion.
Laser ablation of larval class IV neurons af-ter dendritic fields are established results in
only limited invasion of the unoccupied space
by terminal dendrites of neighboring class IV
neurons (Grueber et al. 2003b, Sugimura et al.
2003). Thus additional mechanisms likely en-sure that the complete, nonredundant coverage of the receptive field by class IV dendrites
is maintained.
In addition to Trc, which is required for
establishment of dendritic tiling, Drosophila
has one other NDR family kinase, the tumor
suppressor Warts (Wts). Loss of Wts function causes a progressive defect in the maintenance of dendritic tiling, resulting in large
gaps in the receptive field (Emoto et al. 2006)
(Figure 4c). Time-lapse studies suggest that
the primary defect is in terminal dendrites,
so Wts may normally function to stabilize
these dendrites. Wts kinase activity is likely
important for dendrite maintenance because
reducing the function of the adaptor protein
Salvador (Sav), which is required for Wts ki-nase activity, causes similar defects in dendrite maintenance. In the Drosophila retina,
Wts regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis
by phosphorylating the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Huang et al. 2005). Although
Yorkie does not function in dendrite maintenance, we have found that wts genetically
interacts with specific transcription factors
that also function cell-autonomously to regulate dendrite maintenance in class IV neurons
( J. Parrish, K. Emoto, L.Y. Jan and Y.N. Jan,
unpublished data).
How are establishment and maintenance
of dendritic fields coordinated? In Drosophila
class IV neurons, the Ste-20-related tumor
suppressor kinase Hippo (Hpo) can directly
phosphorylate and regulate both Trc, which

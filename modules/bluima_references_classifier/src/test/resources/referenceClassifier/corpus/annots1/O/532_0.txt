regions which subserve reproductive behavior, such as neurons
of the adult avian song system (DeVoogd and Nottebohm, 198 1;
DeVoogd et al., 1985) and the mammalian spinal cord (Breedlove and Arnold, 198 1; Kurz et al., 1986) and hypothalamus
(Carrer and Aoki, 1982; Bloch and Gorski, 1988). Since the
morphologic characteristics of neurons have been shown to in-fluence the functional characteristics of neurons (Enoka and
Stuart, 1984; Purves, 1988), it is likely that these hormoneinduced structural changes contribute significantly to the activation of neural circuits necessary for certain behaviors.
The mammalian hippocampal formation has been shown to
be involved in a number of important functions including cognitive processes (Olton, 1983; Squire, 1983) gonadotropin re-lease (Carrillo, 198 I), and puberty intitiation (Willoughby and
Martin, 1978). An understanding of the chemical factors which
are required for the normal function of this neural region will
shed light on the physiological and anatomical substrates un-derlying these processes. Neurons of the adult hippocampal formation appear to be particularly sensitive to gonadal steroids
as alterations in levels of female sex hormones dramatically
change hippocampal physiology (Woolley and Timiras, 1962;
Terasawa and Timiras, 1968; Kawakami et al., 1970; Teyler et
al., 1980). It is not known, however, if manipulations in ovarian
steroid levels also influence the structure of adult hippocampal
neurons.
In an effort to determine whether the morphologic characteristics of hippocampal neurons are also affected by changes in
the circulating levels of female sex hormones, we examined the
effect of manipulations in ovarian steroids on the density of
dendritic spines from 2 portions of the dendritic tree of 3 different neuronal populations of the hippocampal formation: py-ramidal cells from the CA1 region, pyramidal cells from the
CA3 region, and granule cells from the dentate gyrus.

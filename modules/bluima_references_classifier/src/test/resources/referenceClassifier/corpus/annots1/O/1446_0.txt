FIG. 3. Developmental changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of layer V neurons projecting to the
contralateral hemisphere through corpus callosum (CC
neurons) or to the superior colliculus (SC neurons). A and
B: action potential discharges and subthreshold membrane
properties of a P5 CC neurons (A1), a P5 SC neuron (A2),
a P25 CC neuron (B1), and a P27 SC neuron (B2). C:
comparison of the input resistance of CC cells (left histogram) and SC cells (right histogram) at P5–7 (gray bars)
and at P21–30 (black bars) (*P 0.02; **P 0.002;
***P 0.0001). D: comparison of the amplitude of the
voltage sag resulting from the activation of the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) measured between the initial peak of hyperpolarizing responses to 105 5 mV
and the plateau at the end of the response for CC and SC
cells at the 2 developmental stages (**P 0.005; ***P
0.0005).

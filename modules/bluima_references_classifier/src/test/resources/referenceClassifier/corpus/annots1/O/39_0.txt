Prior activity induces bidirectional
switching of synaptic NMDAR subunit
components and sliding of the LTP/LTD
threshold
Recently, it was reported that the LTPproducing pairing protocol could induce
shortening of NMDAR-mediated synaptic
responses. This observation was demonstrated by the simultaneous increase in
synaptic NR2A and decrease of NR2B
components in postsynaptic sites, which
was reversed by depotentiation of LTP.
Therefore, the NMDAR component could
be rapidly and bidirectionally regulated by
different induction protocols (Bellone and
Nicoll, 2007). In the present study, we
found that PSs at different frequencies
could also bidirectionally change NR2
components represented by the NR2A/
NR2B ratio examined 20 min later, on
which subsequent LTP/LTD induction
was conducted. LPS of 600 pulses at 1 or 5
Hz decreased the subsequent NR2A/NR2B
ratio. Conversely, 600-pulse 50 or 100 Hz
HPS increased the resulting NR2A/NR2B
ratio. Thus, it is likely that LPS (1 and 5
Hz) and HPS (50 and 100 Hz) could
mimic the effects exerted by light deprivation and reexposure in the visual system,
respectively (Quinlan et al., 1999a,b; Philpot et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2008). In ad-dition, the changes caused by 1 Hz LPS in
both the NR2A/NR2B ratio and LTP/LTD
could be reversed by subsequent 100 Hz
HPS delivered later, and vice versa (Fig. 5).
The opposing actions exerted by 100 and 1
Hz PSs were probably caused by distinct
underlying molecular mechanisms. Highfrequency stimulation at 100 Hz, which is
usually used to induce LTP, could activate
CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II), which is critical for LTP
production (Malinow et al., 1988; Silva et
al., 1992). In contrast, 1 Hz low-frequency
stimulation was observed to erase LTP
through an NMDAR-mediated activation
of protein phosphatases (O'Dell and Kandel, 1994). Thus, sequential prior activities
at different frequencies could bidirectionally regulate subsequent plasticity.

Figure 5. Motoneuron and synaptic properties in neonatally transected rats are affected by training and vary with success of the training. Graphs display cumulative sum histograms of
motoneuron and synaptic properties from intact, neonatal-transected nontrained (Non-Tr), trained good-stepper (Tr-good), and trained poor-stepper (Tr-poor) groups. Histograms are from all
individual cells in each group (as described in Fig. 3), and symbols used for plots are shared with Figure 3. AHPd is increased by injury and is returned toward normal with successful training. sEPSP
is reduced in groups that did not step well, whereas successful training increased the sEPSP above values in intact preparations. The monosynaptic component of the VLF EPSP (cEPSP-mono) was
reduced in all groups (although to differing degrees), but successful training increased the polysynaptic component (cEPSP-poly) compared with nontrained animals.

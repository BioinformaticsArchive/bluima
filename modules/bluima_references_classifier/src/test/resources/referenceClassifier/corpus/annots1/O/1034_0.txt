72.71 pA; Cluster 2, 170.63 66.37 pA, Mann–Whitney test). To
determine whether rheobase could be used as a basis to define physiological subtypes of ChCs, we analyzed the ranges of rheobase values across the two PCA clusters, finding almost identical ranges for
Clusters 1 and 2 (cluster 1, 75– 470 pA; Cluster 2, 60 – 400 pA).
Therefore, cluster membership could not be determined based on
rheobase, as the majority of rheobase values are included in the range
of both clusters. Finally, we applied silhouette analysis, which also
did not support the two clusters being distinct ChC groups. While
the first cluster had predominantly positive silhouette values, the
second cluster had predominately negative silhouette values, and the
silhouette width was not significantly different from random (Fig.
1 I; Table 3).
Overall, the electrophysiological database did not reveal clear
differences among potential subtypes of ChCs. While some cluster structure was present in the two-cluster divisions of both
correlation filter and PCA, these clusters were inconsistent
among themselves, were not based on clearly defined differences
in any electrophysiological variables, and had weak silhouette
widths. Finally, even though neither clustering by morphology
nor clustering by physiology variables produced meaningful subtypes of ChC, it is possible that a multiparameter analysis is
needed to define ChC subtypes. Accordingly, we performed cluster analysis based on the combined morphology and electrophysiology variables, using the 23 neurons for which we had both
reconstructions and patch-clamp recordings. None of the three
statistical tests found a significant level of clustering in either
results using FSS or PCA (data not shown). Therefore, the simplest interpretation of our morphological and physiological analysis is that the population of neocortical ChC cells that we
sampled is homogeneous.

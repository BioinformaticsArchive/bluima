Figure 2. Five days of training increases synaptic responses and spine size and partially occludes LTP. a, For 5 d, adult rats were trained to reach with a single forepaw through a small aperture
in a box and grasp food pellets. Performance improved over the first 3– 4 d of training, reaching a plateau by day 5. b, Extracellular FPs were recorded simultaneously in the forelimb area of both
hemispheres of coronal brain slices. FP amplitudes were larger in the trained hemisphere across stimulation intensities as revealed by input– output relationships. c, LTP was induced repeatedly
(multiple arrows) until responses were saturated in both hemispheres. LTP was reduced in layer 1 of the trained (E) compared with the untrained hemisphere (F; t test, *p 0.016; n 5). Inset,
Individual traces before and after LTP saturation. d, After recording, slices were fixed, labeled with DiI, and spines in layer 1 imaged with confocal microscopy. n 6 rats. Scale bar, 10 m. e, Analysis
of morphology showed spines had a greater spine head width in the trained hemisphere (Kruskal–Wallis, *p 0.02). Note that the whiskers do not represent SD or SEM. f, The trained distribution
( ) is shifted to the right of the untrained distribution (f); untrained spines predominate in smaller bins, whereas trained spines prevail in larger bins. Gray bars below represent the percentage
of trained and percentage of untrained spines for each bin.

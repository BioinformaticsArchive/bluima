In addition to serving an inhibitory function in more mature
cells, GABA -receptor activation may play a maturational
A

role. Many of the developmental effects of GABA are thought
to occur during the embryonic and early postnatal periods
when GABA -receptor activation produces membrane depo- A

larization (Berninger et al. 1995; Cherubini et al. 1991). In
proliferative cells in the VZ, activation of GABA receptors
A

has been shown to downregulate DNA synthesis measured by
thymidine or 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays
(LoTurco et al. 1995). The GABA effect on DNA synthesis
was abolished by furosemide, which negatively shifted E- ,
Cl
suggesting that GABA-induced depolarization is the signal that
influences DNA synthesis. Likewise, activation of GABA
A

receptors inhibits the proliferative effects of basic fibroblast
growth factor in cortical progenitor cells in culture (Antonopoulos et al. 1997). GABA -receptor activation also has been
A

shown to influence the morphology and motility of young
hippocampal and neocortical neurons in cell culture (Barbin et
al. 1993; Behar et al. 1996, 1998; Marty et al. 1996). Additionally, activation of GABA receptors has effects on cell
A

survival (Ikeda et al. 1997) and gene expression (Marty et al.
1997). The depolarizing action of GABA -receptor activation
A

has been shown to increase [Ca2+] through activation of
i

voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LoTurco et al. 1995; Yuste and
Katz 1991), suggesting Ca2+-dependent second-messenger
pathways may mediate the developmental effects of GABA.

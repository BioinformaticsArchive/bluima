Figure 1. The stellate cell properties in juvenile and adult rats vary along the dorsoventral axis of the mEC. A, A diagram of brain slicing and typical responses of ventral and dorsal cells to a current
pulse of 400 pA and to a rheobase pulse. Bâ€“F, Input resistance (B), membrane time constant (C), rheobase (D), SAG-Tau (E), and mAHP duration (F ) plotted as a function of cell position and rat
age (left) and as mean values for dorsal and ventral cells (right). In all panels, the dashed line represents a linear regression for juvenile cells, and the solid line represents a linear regression for adult
cells; r is the correlation coefficient. All data were obtained using patch-clamp recordings. Error bars indicate SEM. *p 0.05; **p 0.01; ***p 0.001; n.s., not significant.

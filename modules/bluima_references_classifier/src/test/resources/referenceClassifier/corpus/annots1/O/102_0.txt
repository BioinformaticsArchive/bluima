Segregation of V1-to-V2 projections. (A) Single CO-stained section from layer 4 in V2, showing the
stripe pattern (brackets, thick stripes; arrows, thin stripes). One of the thin stripes splits to form a “Y”; such
stripe bifurcations occasionally interrupt the regular stripe sequence. Blue arrowheads indicate the
location of a CTB-Au injection in a pale stripe (left) and a WGA-HRP injection in a thin stripe (right).
(B) A section more superficial to the one shown in (A), processed for both tracers. Black box is the area
where cells are plotted and shown at higher power below. (C) Cells counted in box are superimposed onto
the CO pattern from an adjacent section. Neurons projecting to the thin stripe (green, n = 703) were
located in CO patches, whereas those projecting to the pale stripe (red, n = 2058) were situated in the
interpatches. Of the 2761 cells in this single section, 3 were double-labeled (blue, arrows), demonstrating
the high degree of segregation between these two pathways. Adapted from Horton & Sincich (2004).

Axon regeneration
Axonal regeneration in the mammalian CNS is a characteristic
of immature neurons which is lost during development (Schwab
and Bartholdi, 1996; Dusart et al., 2005). Rodent Purkinje cells
progressively lose their ability to regenerate their axons during the
first postnatal week: axotomy in the early postnatal period is followed by axonal regeneration, but this capacity for regeneration is

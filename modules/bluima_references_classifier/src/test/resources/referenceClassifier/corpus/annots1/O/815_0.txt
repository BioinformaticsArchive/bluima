Figure 1. Tonic and synaptic GABAergic currents in rat cortical neurons. (A) BMI
(10 lM) abolished mIPSCs and induced an outward shift of the holding current (Ihold).
The dashed line depicts the Ihold in the absence of BMI. (B) SR95531 (0.5 lM) also
abolished mIPSCs but had no significant effect on Ihold. (C) Dose-response relationships for the outward shift of Ihold induced by GABAA receptor antagonists, BMI (h,
n = 5) and SR95534 (;, n = 4-6). Note the apparent lower affinity of SR95534 (the
half maximal inhibitory concentration [Ic50] = 11.2 lM) compared with BMI (IC50 =
4.7 lM) against the tonic GABAA receptor. Bars represent standard error of the mean.
Control (100 lM) Ihold values of SR95534 and BMI were 10.9 ± 3.3 pA and 11.9 ±
1.1 pA, respectively. (D) Blocking GABA uptake with NO711 resulted in an inward shift
in Ihold without changing peak mIPSCs amplitude and frequency. mIPSCs indicated by
a and b are shown in expanded time scale in the right panels. (E) The bar graph
illustrates the changes in Ihold during the application of BMI, SR95531, and NO711.

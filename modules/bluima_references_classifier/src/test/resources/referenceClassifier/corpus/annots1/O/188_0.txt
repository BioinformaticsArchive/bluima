ach et al., 1993; Weliky et al., 1995; Bosking et al., 1997). Because these animals
have orientation maps, a majority of local
connections ( 300 m) are thought to be
among cells with similar orientation preferences (Fig. 4 A). However, at map singularities called pinwheel centers, where
neighboring neurons do not necessarily
share similar orientation preferences,
studies have shown that local ( 300 m)
connections are not selective (Das and
Gilbert, 1999; Schummers et al., 2002;
Marino et al., 2005). It could be the case
that connectivity at pinwheel centers is an
exception to a general rule of local
orientation-selective connectivity. Alternatively, neurons might unselectively target their near neighbors as a general rule.
Under this second view, any local
orientation-selective connectivity is
merely a coincidence because of the structure of the orientation map. Squirrels do
not have orientation maps and neighboring neurons have different orientation
preferences, so local neurons cannot si-multaneously contact neighboring cells
and cells with similar orientation prefer- Figure 2. No evidence of periodic and patchy connections in quantitative analysis of anatomical connections in layer 2/3 of

DISCUSSION
The BNST may be a primary receptor site for CRH
given intracerebroventricularly
The present studies strongly suggest that the BNST might be a
primary receptor site for the excitatory effect of intracerebroventricular CRH on the acoustic startle reflex. NMDA lesions of the
BNST blocked CRH-enhanced startle. Intra-BNST inf usions of
CRH significantly increased startle amplitude, and a CRH antagonist, α-hCRH , dose-dependently blocked CRH-enhanced
9 – 41
startle.
The role of the hippocampus in CRH-enhanced startle is
unclear. Because our ventral hippocampal lesions aimed to damage the anterior part of the ventral hippocampal /subiculum area,
which projects directly into the BNST (Cullinan et al., 1993), the
posterior aspect of this area was consistently spared. Therefore, it
is clear that the effects of whole hippocampal or complete ventral
hippocampal lesions need to be examined. At the present time,
neither lesions of the dorsal hippocampus (Lee and Davis, 1997)
nor those of the ventral hippocampus (present study) blocked
CRH-enhanced startle. However, a subset of the ventral
hippocampus-lesioned animals showed almost complete blockade
of CRH-enhanced startle, whereas animals with seemingly more
severe damage showed robust CRH-enhanced startle. Although
we have replicated this effect, we have no further information to
explain the differences between these two subgroups. Lesion
studies accompanied by various counterstaining methods for different neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA and acetylcholine) are
clearly needed. Because intraventral hippocampal inf usions of
CRH did not enhance startle, we predict that the hippocampus
may play a modulatory role for CRH-enhanced startle rather than
being a primary receptor site.
The finding that large electrolytic lesions of the amygdala
blocked CRH-enhanced startle (Liang et al., 1992) is still not
resolved by the present data. Our suspicion is that the electrolytic
lesions destroyed fibers projecting from the BNST to the startle
pathway. Further studies using electrolytic lesions in combination
with retrograde or anterograde tracing techniques will be re-quired to address this issue.

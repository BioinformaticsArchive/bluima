that pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex of New World
marmoset monkeys have a relatively simple structure, being less
than six times more spinous than those in V1 (cf. Elston et al.,
1999b, 2001). [Note that in both New World and Old World
primates studied to date, estimates of the number of spines
found in the basal dendritic arbours of layer III pyramidal cells
in V1 are remarkably similar (597–773).] The relative simplicity
of their structure, however, does not reflect a basic characteristic of pyramidal cells in their brain. Pyramidal cells in
marmoset visual cortex, for example, are characterized by the
same progressive increase in structural complexity with
anterior progression through occipitotemporal (OT) areas as
seen in humans and macaque monkeys (Fig. 7). Indeed, cells in
marmoset anterior IT (ITr, the homologue of macaque TE) are
seven times more spinous than those in V1 (Fig. 7). The study of
pyramidal cell structure in another New World monkey, Aotus,
reveals a similar trend: pyramidal cells in PFC are ∼2.6 times
more spinous than those in V1, whereas those in ITr are ∼4.8
times more spinous than cells in the primary visual area (Fig. 7).
[Although these data were sampled from an aged animal and
may have been influenced by age-related spine loss, the relative
trends in OT and prefrontal cortex are noteworthy.] In absolute
terms, our estimates reveal that human prefrontal pyramidal
cells have, on average, 15 138 spines in their basal arbours
(Brodmann's area 10), 72% more than those in macaque (8766,
Preuss and Goldman-Rakic's area 10), 3.8 times more than those
in marmoset (3983, Brodmann's area 10) and 7.5 times more
than those in Aotus (2031, dorsolateral granular PFC).
Given the differences in the structural complexity of the
pyramidal cell in the granular PFC, we might expect that the
degree of interconnectivity between neurons (both intrinsic
and extrinsic) varies between different primate species. For
example, according to the mathematical laws of convolution, if
there is an increase in the number of inputs sampled by pyramidal cells, there must be an increase in the number of inputs
to them. Unfortunately, there are few comparative studies on
patterns of connectivity in the PFC of different primates. None
the less, studies in the New World squirrel monkey and the
galago reveal that the extent and density of prefrontal connections is less than that in macaque monkeys (Bugbee and
Goldman-Rakic, 1983; Preuss and Goldman-Rakic, 1991b).
These differences in the patterns of axon projections and the
number of putative excitatory inputs sampled by individual
pyramidal cells are then likely to result in different cellular/
circuit function in PFC of different primate species (see

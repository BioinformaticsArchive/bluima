Figure 4. Electrophysiological and molecular diversity of NBCs. (a) Electrophysiological classification according to discharge responses to sustained somatic current injections.
Non-accommodating (NAC) cells display virtually no change in inter-spike intervals (ISIs); accommodating (AC) cells show gradual increase in ISIs and stuttering (STUT) cells display
abrupt jumps in ISIs. Further subclassification according to presence of a transient delay (d), burst (b) or absence of either delay/burst (classical, c). Inset scale bar: 20 mV, 200 ms.
(b) Example of one of 29 anatomically 3-D reconstructed, electrophysiologically and molecularly characterized NBCs. This cell, a layer II/III c-NAC (see inset, bottom right), is one
molecular subtype of NBC coexpressing mRNAs for SOM and CCK and lacking detectable levels of any calcium binding proteins. Soma and dendrites in red; axon in blue. Scale bar,
100 Î¼m. MW, molecular weight marker.

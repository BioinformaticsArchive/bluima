Fig. 1. CIS-induced facilitation of anxiety persists after recovery. (A) Effects of recovery (21 days) after CIS (CIS recovery), relative to age-matched
controls, on percentage open arm entries (left), percentage time spent in open arm (center), and entries in enclosed arm (right) on the elevated
plus-maze. The ordinate depicts the percentage mean values ( S.E.M.) of the three measured parameters, for both experimental groups, normalized
to the mean values for the respective controls. ** P 0.01, Student's t-test; control animals, n 27, CIS recovery animals, n 31. (B) Cumulative
frequency plots illustrating the leftward shift (i.e. decrease) across the entire database of values for percentage open arm entries (left) and percentage
time spent in open arms (right) for CIS recovery relative to control. The 50% mark (dashed line) for the total “n” in each plot represents the median
value for the parameter measured. For clarity, the median values are marked with vertical lines (control: black; CIS recovery: gray).

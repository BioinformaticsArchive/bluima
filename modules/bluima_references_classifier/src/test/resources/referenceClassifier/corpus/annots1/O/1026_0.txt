of the electrical coupling (Caputi et al. 2009). In addition,
electron-microscopic studies showed the gap junctions formed
between PV-positive and PV-negative dendrites in the
neocortex of the adult rat (Fukuda and Kosaka 2003) and cat
(Fukuda et al. 2006). Thus, Cx36 expression in all the 4
GABAergic subgroups and the relative abundance of CR/VIP/
CCK/ChAT- and a-actinin2-ir neurons in L1-L3 (Supplementary
Table 1; Kubota et al. 2011) may support the frequent
occurrence of heterologous electrical coupling among L1 and
L2/3 interneurons, which may have a different role from
homologous electrical coupling in cortical circuitry.

successive turns of the lamellae and for the sheaths to have blebs
protruding from them. Moreover the splits in the sheaths
sometimes contain a dark, vacuolated cytoplasm, so that it would
appear that the sheaths are breaking down.
The other obvious change is in the astrocytes. In the older
animals the astrocytic cell bodies usually contain inclusions, and
their processes in the neuropil are more frequent and
prominent, and more of them contain bundles of filaments (As in
Fig. 3). This proliferation of astrocytic processes is especially
evident in the glial limiting membrane, which is much thicker in
the older monkeys and consists of many more layers of astrocytic
processes (Fig. 4). In addition, the outer face of the glial limiting
membrane is more irregular in older monkeys, since protrusions
stick out into the space below the pia mater (Peters, 1991), and
thick strands of astrocytic processes extend down into the
underlying neuropil. Furthermore, microglial cells containing
inclusions are often associated with, and are sometimes
embedded within, the thickened glial limiting membrane.
A number of the neuronal cell bodies encountered in layer 1
appear to be affected by age. The cytoplasm of some of the
neurons contains vacuoles (Fig. 5), and other neurons even
appear to be dying, since their cytoplasm and nucleoplasm is
much darker than normal and the cells are shrunken. Such a
neuron is shown in Figure 6. Its nucleoplasm is dark and
granular, the nuclear envelope is swollen, while in the dark
cytoplasm there are vacuoles and the cisternae of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum are swollen.

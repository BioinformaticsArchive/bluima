complexity, there are also conserved
mechanisms that allow dendrites to
pattern a region in a manner that
ensures appropriate coverage. In
particular, molecular mechanisms that
allow the dendrites of a single neuron
to recognize and avoid each other
(`self-avoidance'), or that allow the
dendrites of a class of neurons to avoid
overlapping with each other (`tiling')
have been a topic of much research
[1,2]. Two recent papers [3,4] published
in Neuron have shed new light on the
issue of dendritic self-avoidance and
tiling by uncovering novel mechanisms
that determine whether dendrites will
come into contact with each other in
the first place.
The dendritic arborization (da)
neurons of the Drosophila peripheral
sensory system provide a useful system
in which to study dendritic development
as they consist of several different types
of cells that have distinct branching
patterns [5]. In particular, the dendrites
of the highly branched class IV da
neurons exhibit both self-avoidance,
which allows for maximal coverage of
the body wall, as well as tiling, which
avoids redundancy and ambiguous
sampling of the sensory environment
(Figure 1A). Class IV dendrites readily
overlap with the dendrites of other
classes of da neurons, illustrating the
specificity of avoidance to dendrites
of neurons of the same class [5].
The cellular mechanisms of
dendritic self-avoidance have been
thought to occur primarily through
contact-mediated self-repulsion. In
Drosophila, alternative splicing of the
gene encoding the transmembrane
immunoglobin protein Down syndrome
cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) can
result in over 38,000 possible isoforms,
with the specific isoform expressed by
any given neuron being determined
stochastically [6]. Homophillic
repulsive interactions between
identical isoforms expressed by the
dendrites of a single cell underlie
dendritic self-avoidance [7]. The
mechanisms regulating tiling are less
well-understood, but a molecular
pathway involving the Ste20 family
kinase Hippo [8], a NDR family kinase
Tricornered (Trc) and a Trc activator
Furry (Fry) [9], as well as components
of the target of rapamycin complex 2
(TORC2) that activate Trc [10], has been
shown to be involved in both tiling and
self-avoidance.
All the previous studies in da
neurons have assumed that the

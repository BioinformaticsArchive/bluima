(a) Nonlinear dynamics of the stable oscillation
The most fundamental assumption for the application
of the PRC theory is the existence of one or more
endogenous oscillators because the PRC measures
the phase response of an ongoing oscillation to perturbations at different time points during the natural
period. If an ongoing oscillation does not exist, then
the PRC theory is not applicable. The oscillator
assumption is valid for at least up to 10 per cent variability in the inter-spike interval of the oscillation
(Galan et al. 2005). Neurons and networks of neurons
are dynamical systems meaning that they have state
variables that continuously evolve in time with a
rate dependent on the state of the system and therefore
can be described with differential equations. The
assumption of a stable oscillation is equivalent to the
assumption of the existence of a limit cycle, a term
from the study of nonlinear differential equations. A
limit cycle is a periodic solution to a system of differential equations that is stable to small perturbations,
meaning that transient changes to the original form
of the oscillation quickly decay away leaving the original oscillatory activity intact. However (and
importantly), the oscillator returns with a phase shift
relative to the unperturbed cycle. Many physiological
oscillations in nature have this quality such as the beating of a heart, the respiratory rhythm and the
oscillations of the nervous system (Winfree 2001).
The existence of a limit cycle requires that the
system of differential equations be nonlinear (a
requirement for the limit cycle to be stable) and have
at least two variables (second-order differential
equation) to create the interplay between variables
that can give rise to an oscillation, generally a positive
action followed by delayed negative feedback. A system
of two differential equations can be written in the
general form:

dx dy
=f(X,Y,a) and =g(X,Y,a),
dt dt
where X and Y are the state variables evolving in time
with rates of change defined by the functions f and g
and a is a parameter or set of parameters that remain
fixed. In a typical conductance-based neural model,
state variables include membrane potential and ionchannel gating variables; parameters include maximal
conductances and half-activation voltages of voltagegated conductances. It should be stressed here that
when we observe an oscillatory behaviour in nature
that is stable to small perturbations, it is not an

Participants and Setting
Participants were 25 undergraduate college
students who were enrolled in a small private
university and had completed no more than two
college-level psychology courses. The mean age
of participants was 20.2 years, and each had
completed a mean of 3 years of college-level
course work. Forty-eight percent of participants
were female. Prior to the experimental session,
participants were asked to sign an informed
consent form (approved by the university
institutional review board) in a room near the
experimental session room. Participants were
told that contingent on their consent, they
would participate in a discussion to assess
college students' understanding of the factors
contributing to juvenile delinquency. Two
confederates also completed the informed
consent process. Next, participants were re-minded that the discussion would be videotaped
(also included in the informed consent form).

(30 – 60 Hz) power and coherence, relative to the EC3 reference
site, and a phase reversal of both theta and gamma rhythms be-tween EC1 and EC2 (Fig. 7A–D). Both theta and gamma LFP
were in-phase in EC2–EC5 and highly coherent within EC3. The
phase of gamma waves reversed at nearly the same depth as the
phase reversal of theta oscillations (Fig. 7 B, C).
In addition to theta and gamma rhythms, the whitened power
spectrum also showed a broad “peak” above 100 Hz (Cunningham
et al., 2004; Canolty et al., 2006; Sirota et al., 2008; Colgin et al.,
2009). The absolute power of this high-frequency band was only
a small fraction of the theta and gamma power and had a relatively uniform power distribution between 150 Hz and 3 kHz.
The depth distribution of the high-frequency power was associated with the presence of unit spiking, with very low power
in EC1 and highest power at sites with strong unit activity
(Cunningham et al., 2004). This high-frequency activity was spatially confined as was evidenced by the fast decrease of coherence
values with distance (Fig. 7D), independent of the chosen reference site. The spatial extent of the coherence in the highfrequency band corresponded to the span of the extracellularly
recordable action potentials from the same neurons (Henze et al.,
2000). These findings suggest that the high-frequency pattern primarily reflects spectral properties of action potentials, most likely
summed spike afterpotentials rather than genuine oscillations.
CSD analysis of theta oscillations revealed a strong sink in the
deeper part of EC1 (Fig. 7B, S1) and weaker sinks in the superficial and deeper parts of EC3 (Fig. 7B, S2, S3). The strongest sink

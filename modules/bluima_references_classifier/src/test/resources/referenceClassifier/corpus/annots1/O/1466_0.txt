attempts have been made to quantify the structure and
connectivity of spatially complex neural networks in 3D.
In the normal brain, global patterns of network connectivity and the resulting columnar and microcolumnar
structures (Mountcastle, 1978, 1997; Braitenberg and
Braitenberg, 1979; Rockland and Ichinohe, 2004) are
central elements in the functional organization of cortex,
yet to date our understanding of these structures has

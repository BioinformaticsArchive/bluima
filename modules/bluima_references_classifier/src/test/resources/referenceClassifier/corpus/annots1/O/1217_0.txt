Fig. 3. Estimated splitting probabilities by branching order for different treatment groups. (a) Probabilities of bifurcation. (b) Probabilities of trifurcation. The y-axis is spaced on a log-scale: straight lines suggest probabilities decrease
according to an exponential law as a function of branching order.

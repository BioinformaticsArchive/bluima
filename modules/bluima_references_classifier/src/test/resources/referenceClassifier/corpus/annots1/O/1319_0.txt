Box 3. Questions for future research

† Can some of the behavioural experiments that have strongly
supported the forward-model hypothesis for vertebrates be used as
paradigms for invertebrate investigations?
† Can more examples of direct motor output to sensory areas be
found, so that neural circuitry of these mechanisms can be understood?
† Are the mushroom bodies, or some other brain structure in insects,
carrying out a non-trivial and learned prediction process?
† What are the implications for understanding cognitive processes in
insects [42]?

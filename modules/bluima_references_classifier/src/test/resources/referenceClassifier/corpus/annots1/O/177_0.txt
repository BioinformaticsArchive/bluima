cells). The GABAergic PSCs recorded at
glutamate reversal potential (0 mV) oc-curred with a frequency of 0.7 0.4 Hz
and showed a mean amplitude of 18.2
1.9 pA (n 4 cells). They were characterized by slow kinetics and their decay was
best fitted with a biexponential function
( 1, 10.7 3.6 ms; 2, 101 42 ms; n 4
cells). A remarkable feature of both glutamatergic and GABAergic PSCs was their
grouped occurrence in bursts, which generally coincided with field spindle bursts
recorded nearby by an extracellular electrode (Fig. 1 Fii,G). A relatively high de-gree of correlation between synaptic currents and network bursts, revealed by the
cross-correlation coefficients (0.5 0.2
for glutamatergic PSCs versus bursts, n
6 cells; 0.5 0.1 for GABAergic PSCs versus bursts, n 4 cells), supports the in-volvement of glutamatergic and GABAergic connections and synapses in the
generation of V1 spindle bursts in P5–P6
pups.
Investigation of the spatiotemporal
pattern of spindle bursts was performed
using an eight-electrode array (separation
distance between the electrodes 0.5–1
mm) placed on both hemispheres (Fig.
2 Ai). In all recordings (n 14 P5–P6
pups), the majority of spindle bursts were
either spatially confined to a single recording site or highly synchronized within one
hemisphere (Fig. 2 Aii,B). In contrast, only
27.1 8% of bursts showed a high degree
of correlation in both hemispheres (Fig.
Aii, 2 B).

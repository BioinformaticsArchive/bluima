Figure 2. Connectivity between Pyramidal Neurons in L2/L3 of Rat Visual
Cortex
(A–D) Images representing the average structures of axons (A and B) and
dendrites (C and D) of pyramidal neurons originating from L2 (A and C) and
L3 (B and D). Yellow dots depict cell somata. Ellipsoids capture the spatial
extent of the synaptic clouds identified from these images. The dimensions{`∥li , `?li } and the displacement r0li of each cloud were measured
TT T
as illustrated in Figure 1B. The images were created using dendritic and
axonal arborization drawings based on data representations in [22] by
kind permission of B. Hellwig.
(E–H) Average number of contacts between pre- and postsynaptic
neurons as a function of the distance between them. The type of axonal–
dendritic connection is shown on each plot. Empirical curves [22] are
plotted in black. Fitted theoretical curves are plotted in blue and
predicted curves are plotted in red. Dots show stochastic variations in the
theoretical number of contacts.

Fig. 8. Graph showing the mean cumulative percentage of total
spines against distance from the soma for layer 3 cells. Error bars are
standard deviations. The cumulative percentage increases steeply and
approximately linearly at first, then shows a reduction in slope from
some160pnfromthesoma(dottedline).Notethatover80%ofall
spines are located proximal to this point.

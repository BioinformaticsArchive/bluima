Functional implications
The absence of an orientation map in the highly visual gray squirrel begs the question of what functional role the map plays in
animals that do possess it. Some models of V1 posit that orientation selectivity and selectivity that is invariant to stimulus contrast arise from local synaptic connections, with neurons receiving a large excitatory input from nearby cells with similar
orientation preferences and broadly tuned inhibition (BenYishai et al., 1995; Somers et al., 1995). However, rodents and
lagomorphs do show robust orientation tuning in V1 (Murphy
and Berman, 1979; Girman et al., 1999), despite lacking an orientation map, and we have shown that orientation tuning in
squirrels is contrast invariant. In addition, V1 is essential for the
perception of orientation in squirrels, because V1 lesions in
ground squirrels impair orientation discrimination (Kicliter et
al., 1977). Thus, it is likely that orientation maps are not important or necessary for orientation tuning or contrast invariance of
orientation tuning. It is still possible, however, that orientation
maps do enable some richer computations in animals that have
them; for example, modulation by the receptive field surround
may be different in squirrel than in tree shrew, cat, and monkey.
In a recent intracellular study, Schummers et al. (2002) found
that subthreshold inputs to cat V1 neurons varied as a function of

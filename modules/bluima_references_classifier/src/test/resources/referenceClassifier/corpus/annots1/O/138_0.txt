The map shown in Fig. 4 serves to orient the following
descriptions of place and modality as columnar defining
characteristics. Cortical maps of the body surface are not
continuous representations, but collections of regions, each
of which is devoted to an afferent inflow from some body
part. While the map traces out the general sequence of body
parts, some adjacent cortical regions map widely separated
body parts, and some adjacent body parts are mapped to
separated cortical zones.

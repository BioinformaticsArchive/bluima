Fig. 3. HeLa cells transfected
with pEGFP-TPPP/p25 and
their filamentous networks.
(A-C) Cells were transfected
and incubated for 20 hours,
fixed with cold ethanol for
immunocytochemistry to
detect the alignment of
TPPP/p25 (green) with
tubulin (A), actin (B) and
vimentin (C) (all red).
(A) The microtubular
network is not affected in the
transfected cell, however,
accumulation of fluorescent
material started at the
perinuclear position. Virtually
complete colocalization with
microtubules is observed.
(B) Actin filaments show
complete dislocation with the
green EGFP-TPPP/p25
signal. Red and green images
were taken at different
positions on the z-axis to get
focused signals.
(C) Intermediate filaments
(vimentin) do not show
colocalization with EGFPTPPP/p25. Bars, 10 Î¼m.

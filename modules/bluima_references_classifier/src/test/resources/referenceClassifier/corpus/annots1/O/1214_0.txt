Figure 4. Precision of spike timing varies among MT cells. A, Spike rasters and instantaneous
firing rates (mean SEM, black over gray shading), as well as preodor instantaneous firing rate
(green), for two MT cells. Blue dots in spike rasters highlight the first spike after each sniff with
an instantaneous firing rate that exceeds the mean preodor firing rate by one SD; the time of this
first spike was the response “onset time” after each sniff. Horizontal blue bar indicates the
mean SD of onset time across trials. Onset precision was defined as the SD of the onset time.
In this example, the mean onset times for the two cells were similar, but one cell (top) had an SD
of 7 ms, while the other had an SD of 29 ms. B, Distribution of precision times for 35 MT cells.
Precision values ranged from 2 to 44 ms (median, 15 ms). C, There was no relationship between
onset precision and baseline firing rate. Precision (SD of onset time) is plotted against mean
baseline interspike interval for 35 MT cells. The two cells in A are highlighted in red; both had
similar baseline firing rates ( 10 Hz).

Animal and tissue processing. Forty-three young adult Sprague Dawley
rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA), weighing ;250 gm, were maintained in a temperature- and light-controlled environment with a light (14
hr)/dark (10 hr) cycle (lights on at 0500 hr). Animals were treated in
accordance with the principles and procedures of the National Institutes
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all
surgeries were performed under Metofane anesthesia. Sixteen rats were
used in the immunocytochemical analysis. All 16 rats were ovariectomized for 1 week, at which time 10 rats received SILASTIC capsules
containing 180 μg of 17-β estradiol/sesame oil, and the remaining 6 were
sham operated. Two days later at 1000 hr, five of the estradiol-treated
animals were injected subcutaneously with progesterone (1 mg in 0.3 ml
oil/rat), and all remaining animals were injected with oil. This procedure
resulted in the following groups of ovariectomized rats: six sham plus oil
(OVX), five estradiol plus oil (OVX+E), and five estradiol plus progesterone (OVX+E+P). Five hours after progesterone or oil injection (1500
hr), the animals were deeply anesthetized with Metophane and transcardially perfused with cold 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS followed by
cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were removed, post-fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde, and sectioned at 40 μm on a vibratome (OTS
3000, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). The sections
were stored in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide at 48C.
Twenty-seven rats were used for the in situ hybridization study. All rats
were ovariectomized for 1 week and then adrenalectomized. Eighteen
rats were then treated with SILASTIC capsules containing 180 μg of 17-β
estradiol/sesame oil, whereas the other nine were sham operated. Two
days later at 1000 hr, the animals were either injected subcutaneously
with progesterone (1 mg. in 0.3 ml oil/rat) or oil, resulting in the following
groups of ovariectomized rats: nine sham plus oil (OVX), nine estradiol
plus oil (OVX+E), and nine estradiol plus progesterone (OVX+E+P).
The animals were killed by decapitation 5 hr after progesterone or oil
injection (1500 hr), and the brains were removed, frozen on dry ice, and
stored at -708C.
In situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed using previously published sequences of oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville,
OR) complementary to rat cDNA encoding subunit residues between
putative transmembrane domains I and II, encoding amino acids 566 –
580, and recognizing all published splice variants (Monyer et al., 1992). A
search of the GenBank database indicated that there is no significant
homology among any of these sequences and known mammalian gene
sequences. Oligonucleotides were 3' end-labeled with terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) using a 2:1 molar ratio
of [α-35S] dATP:cDNA (1200 –1400 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear,
Boston, MA). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using NucTrap
push columns (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization
was performed as described previously, (Orchinik et al., 1994). Briefly,
sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated, hybridized with
saturating concentrations of labeled oligonucleotides overnight at 428C,
washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC (1× = 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015
M sodium citrate) at 558C for 1 hr, dehydrated, and exposed to Hyperfilm-βmax (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) for 24 hr.
Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis. The films were analyzed by
measuring the optical density of specific regions of the hippocampus
using an automated paint function that covered the region of interest
(Imaging Research, St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada). Bilateral measurements were taken from four sections per animal, nine animals per group
in the principal cell layer of CA1, CA3, and the suprapyramidal layer of
the dentate gyrus. Background was measured from the corpus callosum
and subtracted from the total optical density.
Immunocytochemistry. Three nonadjacent sections from the rostral
hippocampus of each rat were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to
both the NMDAR1 subunit (54.1) (Siegel et al., 1994) and microtubule-

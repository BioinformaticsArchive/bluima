of age at the beginning of monocular deprivation for each cortical layer.
The laminar changes in monocularity index that occur during the critical
period are analogous to the changes seen in ocular dominance; layer V I
is the most affected and layer IV the least. After P70, MD produces large
shifts to monocularity in layers II / III, IV, and V I, but little shift in layer
V. The dip in monocularity index at P60 seen in the 2 d MD series ( C)
and in layers II-V in the 7 d MD series suggests that the strabismus-like
effect of late MD is independent of the plasticity observed in the critical
period.

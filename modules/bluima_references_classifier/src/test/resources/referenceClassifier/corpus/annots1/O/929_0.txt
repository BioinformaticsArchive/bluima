FIG. 1. Identification of 2 layer V pyramidal cell populations by retrograde labeling. A: scheme of the retrograde labeling
procedure. Two black and white insets represent line drawings of injection sites in the
contralateral cortex (top inset) and in the
superior colliculus (bottom inset). B and C:
photomontage (including the picture shown
in D) illustrating the extent of the retrogradely labeled contralateral cortex (CC,
red) and superior colliculus (SC, green) cells
in the parietal associative and visual cortical
areas. Note that SC cells were restricted to
layer V, whereas CC cells were found in all
layers except layer I. D: retrogradely transported fluorescent beads visualized in layer
V of the visual cortex identifying pyramidal
cells projecting to the contralateral cortex
(CC cells, red beads) and to the superior
colliculus (SC cells, green beads). Note the
absence of double labeling and the preferential localization of SC cells in the lower part
of layer V.

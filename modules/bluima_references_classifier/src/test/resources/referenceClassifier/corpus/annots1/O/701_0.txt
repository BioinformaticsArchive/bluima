molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 to the cell culture medium
of LPS-treated cells. The addition of the two Abs together
prevented nearly completely the adhesion of leukocytes to
endothelial cells induced by LPS (not shown), indicating that
VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are responsible for LPS-induced ad-hesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells in this setting.

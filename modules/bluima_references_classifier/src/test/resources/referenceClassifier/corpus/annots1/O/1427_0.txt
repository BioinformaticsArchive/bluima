Relation Between Anatomical and Functional
Topographic Maps
How can the overlapping maps of dendritic and axon length
density be related to functional maps constructed from receptive
fields mapped by EPSPs and/or A Ps that define the dynamic subor suprathreshold electrical representation (`excitation map') of
a whisker def lection? On the cortical surface subthreshold

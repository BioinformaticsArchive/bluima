suppression.'' We will use ``inhibition'' to refer to one possible
candidate for this suppression, namely, GABAergic intracortical
inhibition arising from postsynaptic activation of GABAA
receptor- or GABAB receptor-gated channels. By ``synaptic
depression,'' we refer to a reduction in synaptic drive.
Mechanisms mediating synaptic depression include postsynaptic receptor desensitization, presynaptic depletion of releasable
vesicles, or other presynaptic mechanisms depressing vesicle
release (Bellingham and Walmsley 1999). The fact that the
second response of 2 stimuli given in short succession is
strongly suppressed has been denoted as ``short-term de-pression,'' a special form of short-term plasticity, to describe
changes of neural behavior resulting from prior activity
(Zucker and Regehr 2002).

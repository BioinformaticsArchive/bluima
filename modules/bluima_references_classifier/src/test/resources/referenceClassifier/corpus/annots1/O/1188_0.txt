Figure 9. Spike-triggered averages of Vmd, synaptic currents, and channel currents. Spike-triggered averages were constructed for three sets of ISIs from 7 sec
of simulation with 30 Hz gc and 1 Hz sc input. The ISI distribution for this level of input is shown in Figure 7C. Set 1 included 74 ISIs of 10 –13 msec, set 2 included
32 ISIs of 16 –20 msec, and set 3 included 39 ISIs of 30 –50 msec. An upper and lower 95% confidence limit (1.7 SEs) is shown for each spike-triggered average
as a pair of dashed traces. Vertical dashed lines denote the timing of dendritic traces with respect to the peak depolarization in the soma with each spike. Traces
on the left are aligned to the initial spike in each ISI, and traces on the right are aligned to the terminating spike. A, Spike-triggered average of Vmd. B,
Spike-triggered average of synaptic conductances summed for all gc inputs (G gc) and all sc inputs (G sc) in Siemens × 10e-9. Note that the total sc conductance
is more than twice the amplitude of the gc conductance. C, Spike-triggered average of summed gc and sc currents (I syn). Note that the peak in synaptic current
with each somatic spike is not a result of synaptic input but of the change in driving forces for gc and sc conductances with spike-related dendritic depolarization.
D, Spike-triggered average of summed Ca and K currents (I chan). The inward peak of current after each somatic spike is a result of the activation of CaP
conductance with spike-related dendritic depolarization.

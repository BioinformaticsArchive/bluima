structure in auto-correlations — this will also be degraded by
pooling. Third, since the origin of each spike is lost, crosscorrelations (and any information they might convey) no longer
exist. Since these three mechanisms correspond to separate
terms of the series expansion, we were able to consider the
effect of pooling on correlation-dependent information. Previous work on labeled line and pooled decoding schemes (Reich
et al., 2001) considered mainly the first mechanism. Results are
shown, averaged across all pairs of cells, in Figure 4. For cell
pairs within the same column, the information loss due to
pooling was nearly entirely attributable to the individual spike
component of the code. The results were similar for pairs located
in different columns: for D1–D2 pairs individual spikes
accounted for 92 ± 9% of total pooling loss; for D1–D3 pairs the
result was 83 ± 12%. These results are consistent with our
previous report that the fundamental coding unit in this system
is the individual spike (Panzeri et al., 2001; Petersen et al.,
2001).
The total amount of individual spike information lost due to
pooling depended on the relative locations of the neurons. At 40
ms post-stimulus, the loss was 0.03 ± 0.01 bits for D2-D2 pairs,
0.08 ± 0.02 bits for D1–D2 pairs and 0.13 ± 0.03 bits for D1–D3
pairs. This finding can be explained by the fact that neurons in
different columns differ more in their PSTH profiles across
stimuli than do neurons within the same column. Hence pooling
destroys more PSTH structure for cross-column neuron pairs
than for within-column neuron pairs.
Although small compared to the role of individual spikes, a
significant (15%) contribution to the information conveyed by
barrel cortex populations about stimulus location comes from
within-cell spike patterns, provided that neuronal `labels' are
conser ved (Petersen et al., 2001). This effect is due to a negative
dip in the auto-correlation, perhaps ref lecting refractoriness or
inhibitory feedback (Berry and Meister, 1998) (Petersen et al.
give a detailed examination (Petersen et al., 2001)]. Figure 4
shows that for D2–D2 pairs part of this within-cell pattern
information is lost by pooling. This type of information loss was
smaller than that due to pooling independent spikes in all cases.
Cross-columnar pooling led to a greater loss of within-cell spike

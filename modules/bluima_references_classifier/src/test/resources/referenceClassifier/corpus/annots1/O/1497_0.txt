same question, claims a statistically
significant research finding is easy to
estimate. For n independent studies of
equal power, the 2 × 2 table is shown in
Table 3: PPV = R(1 - βn)/(R + 1 - [1 -α]n - Rβn) (not considering bias). With
increasing number of independent
studies, PPV tends to decrease, unless
1 - β < α, i.e., typically 1 - β < 0.05.
This is shown for different levels of
power and for different pre-study odds
in Figure 2. For n studies of different
power, the term βn is replaced by the
product of the terms β for i = 1 to n,
i

but inferences are similar.

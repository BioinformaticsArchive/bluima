(and chandelier) cells are multipolar interneurones with dendrites radiating
in all directions from the soma. They typically have partially myelinated
axons that bear large boutons.
Typically, PV-basket cells receive fast, depressing EPSPs from and
deliver fast, proximal IPSPs to pyramidal cells (Ali et al., 2007). Fast spiking
cells in barrel cortex receive fast, short latency EPSPs in response to
principal whisker movement in vivo. The fast inhibition they activate across
columns and layers, their subthreshold membrane potential oscillations
and rhythmic firing at gamma frequencies, entrained by the very fast IPSPs
they receive from other interneurones, also suggest their involvement in
these rhythms (Whittington et al., 2000).
Other proximally targeting cells include basket cells immunoreactive
for CCK. These typically display broader APs than PV-baskets and an adapting and accommodating firing pattern. They receive slower, depressing
EPSPs from and deliver slower IPSPs to neighboring pyramids. CCKcontaining cells are quite distinct from PV-cells, being a primary recipient
of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synapses, unique in expressing 5-HT3 and
nicotinic ( 7) receptors (Blatow et al., 2005) and with calbindin (Cb)-interneurones, unique in bearing presynaptic CB1 (cannabinoid type 1)

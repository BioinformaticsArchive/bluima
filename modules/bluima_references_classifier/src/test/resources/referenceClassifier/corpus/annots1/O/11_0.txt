In this paper we show that human CaV2.1 channels in
either the fast or slow gating mode (Luvisetto et al.,
2004) can reversibly switch (in the time scale of seconds) to a noninactivating mode of gating, which we
have called b mode. A channel in the b gating mode
shows a bell-shaped voltage dependence of the open
probability, with a characteristic low open probability at
high positive voltages, decreasing with increasing voltage. Single CaV2.1 channels can then display four different modes of gating: fast-b, slow-b, fast-nb, and slownb (where nb refers to a mode in which the channel
shows the usual voltage dependence of the open probability). At low voltages close to the threshold of channel
activation, the mean open and closed times and the
open probability of the channel in b gating modes
(fast-b and slow-b) are similar to those of the channel
in nb gating modes (fast-nb and slow-nb, respectively).
At high voltages where the open probability of the
channel in nb gating modes approaches its maximum
value (V 40 mV with 90 mM Ba2 as charge carrier), the channel in b gating modes has a much lower
open probability and shorter mean open time. One can
estimate that in physiological solutions, this would oc-cur at V 10 mV, taking into account the change in
surface potential caused by the high divalent ion concentration necessary to be able to resolve the very small
unitary currents (Tottene et al., 2002). Therefore, Ca2
influx in response to an action potential is expected to
be different for CaV2.1 channels in b and nb gating
modes (Sabatini and Regehr, 1999).
Perhaps the most striking feature of the CaV.2.1 channel in b gating modes (fast-b and slow-b) is the lack of
inactivation during long pulses at high positive voltages, where the channel in nb gating modes (fast-nb
and slow-nb) inactivates relatively rapidly. Moreover,
the availability to open in response to a depolarization
appears to be much larger for a CaV.2.1 channel in b

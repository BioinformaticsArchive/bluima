OGB-1 (light gray trace) as expected, and
the obtained curve (dark gray trace)
matches the in vivo data (black trace) over
the full range of [Ca 2 ]. The maximum
fluorescence change is thus identical under
both conditions. However, because the
calibration was done using OGB-1 in vitro,
effects of the cellular environment on the
KD of OGB-1 may be hidden (see
Discussion).
From the data described so far, the KD
value and the Hill coefficient of the different GECIs were calculated (supplemental
Fig. 1 B, C, available at www.jneurosci.org
as supplemental material; Table 1). For all
GECIs that we measured under both conditions, the KD was significantly decreased
in vivo (supplemental Fig. 1 B, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Moreover, the differences in the KD
values of the individual GECIs were less
pronounced in vivo. Thus, as a rule of
thumb, the in vivo KD of GECIs appears to
be shifted toward higher affinity compared
with our in vitro calibration [with YC2.60
and GC2 being the only exception, because Figure 4. In vivo versus in vitro: quantitative comparison of fractional fluorescence changes of GECIs and OGB-1 at steady state.

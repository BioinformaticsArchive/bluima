coding to discover what statistics of the inputs are encoded in the
outputs. In macaque retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, we find
that the single neuron responses to naturalistic stimuli are well
described with only first and second order moments constrained.
Thus, the vast majority of the information encoded in the spiking
of these cells is related only to the first and second order statistics of
the inputs.
To begin, consider a system which at each moment in time
receives a D-dimensional input x(t)~(x1(t),...,xD(t)) from a
known distribution P(x), such as a neuron receiving a sensory
stimulus or post-synaptic potentials. The system then performs
some computation to determine the output y(t) according to its
response function P(yDx). The complete input/output correlation
structure, i.e. all moments involving y and x, can be calculated
from this function through√ê the joint distribution
P(y,x)~P(yDx)P(x), e.g. SyxiT~ P(y,x)yxidydx. Alternatively, the full list of such moments contains the same information
about the computation as the response function itself, although
such a list is infinite and experimentally impossible to obtain.
However, a partial list is usually obtainable, and as a first step we
can force the input/output correlations from the model to match
those which are known from the data. The problem is then
choosing from the infinite number of models that agree with those
constraints. Following the argument of Jaynes [9,10], we seek the

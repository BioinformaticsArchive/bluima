the maximum of the deep VPM band 1 was 1264, 1277, and
1300 lm, respectively (Fig. 5C shows measurements only for
columns in arc 2 and 3).
The cross-sectional area of the maximal density VPM
projection was determined in tangential sections (Fig. 5B).
The average area varied slightly with the topographic location
at the column in the barrel field (Fig. 5D). For D2 columns, the
average cross-sectional area is ~12 1000 lm2 (n = 20, Fig. 5D).
Cross-sectional areas shown in Figure 5D are not significantly
different between columns (ANOVA, P = 0.35). Mean distances
between centers of VPM cross-sections around the D2 column
vary between 403 and 517 lm (Fig. 5E).

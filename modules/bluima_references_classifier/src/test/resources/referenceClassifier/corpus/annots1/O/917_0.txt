It is interesting to speculate that other conditions may
synchronize super¢cial inhibitory networks which in turn
could give rise to large-amplitude network activity. Such
activity could in fact be recorded on electroencephalogram (EEG). Further, such activity, given its super¢cial
localization, would be preferentially recorded. Perhaps,
some of the `spike-like' patterns of discharge seen on
EEG recordings under some conditions are the result
of rhythmic synchronous discharge from GABAergic
rather than excitatory networks. Given this inhibitory
origin it is unclear whether this network activity should
be rightfully referred to as `epileptiform'.
In super¢cial slices blockade of GABAA receptor
responses by PTX greatly reduced the frequency of spontaneous discharges and their amplitude and duration
(Fig. 6). Interestingly, disinhibiting these slices apparently did not boost excitatory function, but rendered these
slices even less `excitable', indicating that GABAA receptor mechanisms play a key role in mediating the previously recorded discharge pattern. Alternatively, the
failure of GABAA receptor antagonism to enhance excitation may re£ect a low density of excitatory connections
in super¢cial slices. But this is unlikely to be the case,

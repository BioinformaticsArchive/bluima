(Demyanenko et al., 1999). Similarly, mice lacking the cell
adhesion molecule, contactin, show decreased dendritic growth
of granule and Golgi cells, but not Purkinje cells, in the developing cerebellum (Berglund et al., 1999). A lthough these
studies are intriguing, because of the transgenic approach, it
is difficult to determine whether cell adhesion molecules act
directly on dendritic growth or whether they inf luence dendritic
growth indirectly by directly inf luencing axon guidance. Future
experiments using single cell knockouts in a normal tissue
background may clarify these issues.

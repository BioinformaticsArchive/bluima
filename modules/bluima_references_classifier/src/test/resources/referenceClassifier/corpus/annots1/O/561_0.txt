FIG. 3. Total binding of 3H-CGP 39653 (51.3 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM TrisHCl (circles) and 5 mM Tris-HCl (triangles) in coronal slices of brain
through the region of rostra1 hippocampus. Binding was greater in 50
mM Tris-HCl, and saturation occurred by 2 h and remained elevated
for at least 3 h (data for 3-h time point not shown).

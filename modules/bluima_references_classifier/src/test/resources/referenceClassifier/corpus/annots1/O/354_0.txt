We consider voluntary movement tasks, implying that the control signal is initiated from the motor cortex.

Moreover, we consider simple trained tasks, motivating the assumption that the control signal is

reproducible to a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that it is optimized for the task. Additionally, we

assume well-trained tasks, which do not require the hand to achieve high accuracy or to retain stability

against significant perturbations. This implies that the brain does not use significant co-activation of

antagonist muscles in order to increase the hand's impedance (Hogan, 1984; Hogan, 1989; Osu et al., 2004).

fluorescence ratio within the range 0.5 to 0.7 which
was stable throughout the measuring period (up to
30 min).
In these neurons, 100 mM K+ evoked a rapid
increase in [Ca2+] in all neurons tested (n = 180). The

subsequent applications of high K+ did not (or little)
alter the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+] response

(as shown in Fig. 6). However, the successive
applications of 100–500 nM Aga-IVa, 1 μM GVIA
and 250 nM nitrendipine inhibited, respectively,
30&11%, 43&14% and 15&11% of the increase in
[Ca2+] induced by depolarizations (n=58) (Fig. 5).

These results confirm the functionality of a P-type
Aga-IVa-sensitive, a N-type GVIA-sensitive and a
L-type nitrendipine-sensitive voltage-activated ICa,
previously characterized using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. When 1 μM
GVIA was applied before Aga-IVa and nitrendipine,
the percentage of the toxin-sensitive influx was not
diVerent (respectively, 47&10%, 29&8%; n=32)
(Fig. 5B). We concluded that, here again, there was

During normal development, the number of putative input synapses decreased
significantly between the stages W2 and
P0 (data not shown), corresponding to
the physiological findings in this study
and earlier findings on synapse elimination in Manduca during late larval life
(Streichert and Weeks, 1995; Gray and
Weeks, 2003). The anatomical observation of more putative input synapses on
the surface of the dendrites of the stimulated MN5 compared with the internal
control corresponded to physiological
measurements from the same neurons.
Cumulative probability plots of individual postsynaptic potentials showed that
there was an increase in larger amplitude
potentials in the stimulated compared
with the control MN5 (Fig. 6 H).

approximated the time course of activation of the recombinant
channels using single exponential fits, to allow comparison with
previous studies. In these fits, mHC N1 channels activate with a time
constant of 125 6 12.6 msec (n = 8), whereas mHC N2 channels
activate with a time constant of 1194 6 276 msec (n = 3).

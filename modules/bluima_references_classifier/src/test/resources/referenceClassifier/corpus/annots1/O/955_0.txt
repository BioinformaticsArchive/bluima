Figure 2. Midazolam caused an increase in the tonic current. (A) Ihold shifted to
inward with the application of midazolam (20 nM and 1 lM) to layer V pyramidal cells.
(B) The concentration-dependent increase in the amplitude of the tonic current caused
by midazolam. Each data point represents the averaged values Â± standard error of the
mean (n = 4-5). (C) Midazolam failed to induce tonic current in the presence of BMI
(10 lM), but did induce tonic current in the presence of SR95531 (1 lM). The
midazolam-induced tonic currents in the presence of BMI (n = 3) or SR95531 (n = 5)
are summarized in the bar graph. *P \ 0.01.

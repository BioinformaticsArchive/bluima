3.8 0.51; total apical length: 516.34 69.19). However,
quantitative analyses of numerous measures of dendritic
morphology of apical as well as basal dendrites did not
reveal any significant differences (independent samples
t-test; all P 0.05). We further examined the distribution
and morphology of SC and IC dendrites with Sholl analysis, which reveals the spatial location of dendrites and their
branching patterns relative to the soma. As shown in Fig.
5B Sholl analyses revealed no differences between groups
for measures of dendritic intersections and dendritic
length. These data suggest that both SC and IC neurons
share largely similar morphologies despite residing in different lamina. Furthermore, our results are similar to previous analyses of IC neurons in rats (Le Be et al., 2007).

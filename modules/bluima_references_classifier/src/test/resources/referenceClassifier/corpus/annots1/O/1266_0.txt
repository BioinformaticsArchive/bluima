Although the flowchart representation
may not be the most appropriate and comprehensive way to describe what neurons are do-ing, it can nevertheless be very instructive to
define and explore the computational building
blocks (i.e., the boxes on the flowchart) that
neurons can perform. During the past decade
a rapidly increasing number of studies in-vestigating signaling mechanisms in dendrites
have appeared, and several recent reviews have
discussed these findings in depth (Euler &
Denk 2001, Ha Ìˆusser et al. 2000, Koch &
Segev 2000, Magee 2000, Segev & London
2000, Williams & Stuart 2003). Rather than
listing all the known facts about dendritic signaling, in this section we focus on identifying the unique dendritic mechanisms that can
act as computational building blocks. We start
with a brief discussion of how passive dendrites transform their inputs and implement
nonlinear interactions between synaptic in-puts. Then we review the role of dendritic
voltage-dependent channels and conclude by
evaluating the possible role of dendrites in
chemical computation.

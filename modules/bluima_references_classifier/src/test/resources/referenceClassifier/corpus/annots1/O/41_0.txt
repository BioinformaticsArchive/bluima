functions as an activator for PKCγ , which plays a crucial
role in motor coordination and synapse elimination in
PCs (Chen et al. 1995; Kano et al. 1995). CB1R is
accumulated at the perisynaptic region of PF terminals
and inhibitory presynaptic terminals (Kawamura et al.
2006; Yoshida et al. 2006). In striatal MS neurons, mGluR5
and DAGLα are widely expressed on the extrasynaptic
somatodendritic surface, and their densities are highest in
spines (Uchigashima et al. 2007). In contrast to mGluR5,
the M1 receptor is sparse in spines and shows widespread
somatodendritic distribution (Narushima et al. 2007).
CB1R is expressed at high levels on inhibitory presynaptic
terminals of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and MS
neurons and at low levels on excitatory corticostriatal
afferents (Uchigashima et al. 2007).
These anatomical data are largely consistent with our
electrophysiological data. As a whole, a set of receptors
and enzymes required for RER are closely localized so
that the glutamatergic (and/or cholinergic) activity can
trigger 2-AG production effectively (Fig. 3). 2-AG is
then released and travels some distance to presynaptic
terminals expressing CB1R. The density of CB1R is high at
inhibitory and low at excitatory terminals, as if the spatial
disadvantage of inhibitory terminals, which are located
far from the 2-AG production site, is compensated by
increasing the sensitivity to 2-AG (Fig. 3).

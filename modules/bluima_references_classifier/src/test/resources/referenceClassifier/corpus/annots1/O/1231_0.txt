Figure 3. Stimulus-dependence of long-range synchronization in the visual cortex.
Data are from an experiment in which neuronal responses were recorded from two
sites separated by 7 mm in the primary visual cortex of an anaesthetized cat. (A, C)
Schematic plots of the receptive fields. At both recording sites the cells preferred
vertical orientations. The colinear arrangement of the fields allowed the comparison of
different stimulus paradigms. The neurons were activated with either a long continuous
light bar moving across both fields (A) or two light bars moving in opposite directions
(C). (B, D) The respective cross-correlograms obtained with each stimulus paradigm.
Using the long light bar, the two responses were synchronized as indicated by the
strong modulation of the correlogram (B). Synchrony disappeared with the two
incoherently moving stimuli (D); n.s., not significant. The graph superimposed on the
correlogram in (B) represents a damped cosine function that was fitted to the data to
assess the strength of the modulation. (Modified from Engel et al., 1992.)

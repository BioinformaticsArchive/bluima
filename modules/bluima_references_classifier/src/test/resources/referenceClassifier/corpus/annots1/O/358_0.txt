2.2.3. Summary
The above results indicate that chronic dorsal root
injuries cause cortical functional changes that are accompanied by functional changes of a similar nature at
thalamic, brainstem, and spinal levels (Fig. 2b). It seems
clear that functional changes occur in tandem with major
structural alterations which begin with relatively rapid
degeneration of central axons and terminations of peripheral sensory neurons, and that continue trans-synaptically up
the somatosensory core in the form of structural atrophy
and degeneration of substrates at spinal, brainstem,
thalamic and, likely, cortical levels. Neurochemical / mo-lecular changes that cause or are associated with functional
and structural alterations have been little studied, but
include decreases in spinal (trigeminal) and thalamic
2+
GABA inhibition, and changes in Ca binding proteins at
brainstem, spinal, and thalamic levels. Although much of
the existing work pertains to changes after postinjury
periods of many years, early manifestations of chronic
changes are apparent within the first days, weeks, and
months (and see Section 3.2).

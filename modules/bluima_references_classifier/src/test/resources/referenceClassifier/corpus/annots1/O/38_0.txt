developmental process (Liu et al., 2004; Nase et al., 1999), and the
profound increase in the NR2A/NR2B ratio during development
is mainly attributed to upregulation of NR2A subunits (Liu et al.,
2004; Nase et al., 1999; Yashiro and Philpot, 2008). Therefore, in
young animals where plastic changes of synapses are constantly
taking place, activation of NR2B is thought to be critical to allow
calcium influx into synapses in order to modify their efficacy.
Likewise, activation of mGluR5 is essential in some forms of LTP
(Lu et al., 1997; Rodrigues et al., 2002). Interestingly, both NR2B
and mGluR5 are also known to be extrasynaptic receptor subunits

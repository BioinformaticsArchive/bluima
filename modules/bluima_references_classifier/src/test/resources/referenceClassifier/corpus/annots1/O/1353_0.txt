Estimation of branching and terminating probabilities
The probabilities of branching or terminating per unit length,
Pbrand P,,,, respectively, wereestimateddirectly from observed
morphological data. The original data were obtained by measuring motoneuronal dendrites as successionsof cylindrical
“segments,” each with a constant diameter and a measured
length (Cullheim et al., 1987a).Any given “branch” (delimited
on either end by soma, branch points, or termination) in the
original datasetwasrepresentedasasequenceof oneor (usually)
more segmentsm, ost of them with lengths1200 Wm.The 1974
branchesinthesampleincludedmorethan4000suchsegments.
The relations betweend, and L,, shown in Figure 1 suggested
that Pbrand P,,, might be functions of local branch diameter,
d, (i.e., the diameter of the ith segment).We initially assumed
that these probabilities were independent of branch position
within the growing dendritic tree (i.e., branch order, length, or
distancefrom the somatic origin). Accordingly, we assembled
all of the segmentdata in groupsaccordingto segmentdiameter
bins, d, with bin widths that dependedon the local density of
data points (Fig. 1; bin widths: 0.25 pm ford, ~2.0 pm, 0.5 pm
for 2.0 > d, I 4.0 pm, and 1.0 pm ford, > 4.0 Fm).
Figure 2A showsa plot of the number of parent segments,
N,,,(d), the number of terminating segments,N,,,(d), and the
total length of all segmentsin diameter bin d, U(d), on log-log
coordinates(in order to display more clearly the important re-lationsatsmalllocaldiameters).Brancheswithdbetween0.75
and 2.25 pm (denotedthe “overlap region”) either branchedor
terminated, and N,,(d) and N,,,(d) exhibited reciprocal changes
while Zl(d) remained relatively constant.
The probabilities of branching or terminating per unit length
for segmentswithin a given bin d wereestimatedfrom the ratios
of the number of branching or terminating segmentsin eachbin
divided by the total length of segmentsin the bins:

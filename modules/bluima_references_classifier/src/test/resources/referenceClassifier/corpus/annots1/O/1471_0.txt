Figure 7. The patches of `direction selective' cells in layer 4B of V1 projecting to area V5 seen in a section cut parallel to the
cortical surface of V1 (a) and one perpendicular to it (b). This pattern is revealed when V5 is injected with the anatomical label
horseradish peroxidase (in black on the tracing above). The label is transported retrogradely to V1, where it is seen within the
projecting cells. (From Zeki 1993a.)

Fig. 6. Fully digitized and reconstructed CA3 pyramidal neuron in cylindrical (A) and ball-and-stick (B) formats. The soma is represented as a red ball
in B. (C) Zoomed view of apical dendritic tree in tapered cylindrical format. The close-up is shown as a wireframe to indicate the individual nodes and
associated diameters, represented as spheres centered on each node. (D) The same zoomed view as in (C), in ball-and-stick format. (For
interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

DEVELOPMENT OF NORMAL BRAIN RHYTHMS TO
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY

In this section, I shall first focus on intrinsic cell properties
and network operations underlying the major rhythm that characterizes sleep, the slow oscillation at 0.5–1 Hz that is present
throughout all (light and deep) stages of natural slow-wave
sleep in animals (Steriade and Amzica 1998) and humans
(Achermann and Borbe ́ly 1997; Amzica and Steriade 1997).
Although spontaneously occurring brain rhythms are sometimes regarded as bearing little or no functional significance,
the spontaneous electrical activity is information-rich, provides
signals that influence neighboring cells, and accounts for
changes in evoked responses (Arieli et al. 1996; Bullock 1997).
It was proposed that the rhythmic spike bursts or spike trains
fired by thalamic and neocortical neurons during sleep oscillations lead to reorganization of neocortical networks and
consolidation of memory traces formed during the waking state
(Steriade et al. 1993b,d). This hypothesis was tested and will
lead me to discuss the synaptic changes, related to plasticity,
during sleep oscillations. Finally, I will elaborate on the de-velopment from normal sleep oscillations into paroxysmal
events mimicking some types of clinical seizures associated
with loss of consciousness.
Fast brain rhythms (20 – 60 Hz), which occur mainly, but not
exclusively, during states of brain alertness (Herculano-Houzel
et al. 1999; Llina ́s and Pare ́ 1991; Llina ́s and Ribary 1993;
Murthy and Fetz 1997; Rougeul-Buser 1994; Singer 1993;
Steriade et al. 1996a,b), and their relation with discrete conscious events, are discussed elsewhere (Steriade 2000, 2001).

ribosylation site which is only 10 residues distant is located

shielded in the F-actin structure frommodification by the
toxin (Aktories et al., 1986a, 198613) suggests that the amino
acids around residue 177 may be close to or involved in the
actin-bindingsite.Cross-linkingexperiments(Sutoh, 1984;
Elzinga and Phelan, 1984) between two adjacent protomers
haveidentified region 191-215 a s being involved in actinactin interaction. This isapproximately 10-20 residues away
from the ADP-ribosylation site and also therefore probably
too far distant to assume thaAt rg'77is a site of close contact
between actinprotomersunlessit is topographicallypositioned closer to that site than can be concludedfrom the
location of the linear sequence. Various binding and contact
sites of actin have been determined. For instance, DNase I,
which forms a tight complex with G-actin(Lazaridesand
Lindberg,1974), interacts with actin at amino acids 50-69
(Sutoh, 1984). From thislocalization, it is not surprising that

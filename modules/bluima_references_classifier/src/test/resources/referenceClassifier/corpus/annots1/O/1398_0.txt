Are there gene regulation programs that control
dendrite morphogenesis?

It is not yet clear how factors such as CPG15 or neurotrophins regulate dendrite morphogenesis, whether they
act directly on the cytoskeletal elements or whether
they act at the level of gene regulation by turning on cell
intrinsic programs for dendrite morphogenesis. It is not
even known whether the neurons have gene regulation
programs designed to control dendrite morphogenesis.
Studies with forward genetics in Drosophila suggest that
such a program exists.
One of the genes that was identified in a mutant
screen for dendrite patterning defect is sequoia (Gao et
al. 1999). In sequoia loss-of-function mutants, the axon
and dendrite morphology of most—possibly all—neurons are abnormal, but many other aspects of neuronal
differentiation appear to be normal. Sequoia encodes a
Zn finger protein expressed in all neurons and is likely to
function as a transcriptional regulator. Thus, Sequoia ap-pears to be a pan-neural regulator that functions to carry
out a subroutine for controlling dendrite and axon morphogenesis in fly (J. Brenman, F.B. Gao, L.Y. Jan, and
Y.N. Jan, in prep.). Genes of this type have the potential
of providing a nodal point in which different signals
regulating neuronal morphgenesis converge.

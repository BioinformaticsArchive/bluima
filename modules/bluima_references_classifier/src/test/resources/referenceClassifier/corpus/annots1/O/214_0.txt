FIGURE 9 | Properties of the connectome. Node degree distributions for
the whole connectome (A) and one side of the connectome (B) show that
only the network on one side shows a distribution similar to the power law,
and is therefore scale-free. (C) The cumulative function from (B) (blue) and
a linear approximation (red) plotted on a log scale. (D) The overall
distribution of connection distances for synapses between neurons on a
single side of the tadpole connectome.

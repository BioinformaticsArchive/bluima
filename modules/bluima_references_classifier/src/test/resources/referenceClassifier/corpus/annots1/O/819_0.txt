Functional implications
The overwhelming majority (90 –95%) of neurons in layer I are
GABAergic (Gabbott and Somogyi, 1986; Winer and Larue, 1989;
Li and Schwark, 1994; Prieto et al., 1994). Lambolez et al. (1996)
found that the AMPA receptors in layer I neurons have a
GluR1– 4 subunit composition that is characteristic of layers II–VI
nonpyramidal neurons (Geiger et al., 1995). Moreover, the re-sponse to rapid application of glutamate in layer I neurons (Lambolez et al., 1996) is similar to that of other nonpyramidal neurons
(Hestrin, 1993; Jonas et al., 1994). Thus, most layer I neurons can
be classified, morphologically as well as physiologically, as being
similar to inhibitory neurons found elsewhere in the cortex.
We found that layer I neurons receive both excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic inputs. The excitatory input may be derived
from collaterals of local pyramidal neurons and/or extracortical
projection, including thalamic fibers. The source of inhibition is
probably other neurons in layer I, but axons of inhibitory neurons
from the lower layers may also contribute.
The predominant postsynaptic elements within layer I are the
distal portions of apical dendrites from pyramidal neurons in
layers II–V. Cortical inputs that selectively target layer I may
undergo significant electrotonic attenuation (Cauller and Connors, 1994). Pyramidal cell dendrites, however, may generate
sodium and/or calcium spikes that could boost synaptic inputs
(Huguenard et al., 1989; Pockberger, 1991; Amitai et al., 1993;
Kim and Connors, 1993; Magee et al., 1995; Schwindt and Crill,
1995; Stuart and Sakmann, 1995). Under these conditions, the
distal dendrites could generate responses that are independent of
more proximal cellular regions (Cauller and Connors, 1994).
Inhibitory inputs originating from layer I neurons could selectively
target distal dendrites and therefore may play an important role in
local integration. Both apical dendrites and axon collaterals from
pyramidal neurons reach layer I. Thus, it is possible that layer I
neurons serve in a feedback inhibitory circuit. The dense but
confined axonal projection of neurogliaform cells is particularly
intriguing in that regard, suggesting that these cells function as
local inhibitory neurons within specific local domains in layer I. In

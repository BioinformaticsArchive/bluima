perspective, we have considered synaptic recruitment mechanisms for only two of the hundreds of postsynaptic
molecules. All these molecules undergo turnover, and many
experience regulated movement similar to that in the switches
we have analysed. We suggest that there are many forms of
self-recruitment, coordinated self-assembly, and other potentially switch-like processes that contribute to the maintenance
of different constituents and states of the synapse.

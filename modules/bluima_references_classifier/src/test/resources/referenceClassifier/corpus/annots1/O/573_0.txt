Figure 4. Granule cells contain 33 M calbindin-D . Quantitative analysis of 26 experi-28k
ments as shown in Figure 3. Dentate granule cells were loaded with 0 M (n 3), 10 M
(n 6), 25 M (n 7), 33 M (n 7), or 66 M (n 3) calbindin-D . The immunofluo-28k
rescence of the recorded cell was normalized on the mean fluorescence of all neighboring
granule cells, averaged for each concentration, and then plotted versus the concentration. Data
points were fitted by a line (superimposed). From this line, the calbindin-D concentration
28k
that lets the recorded cells appear equifluorescent to surrounding granule cells (normalized
fluorescence equals 1; arrow) can be obtained: 32.5 M (denoted by the arrowhead). The
dashed lines originating from the ordinate illustrate translations of immunofluorescence of
granule cells (as determined in Fig. 1) into calbindin-D concentrations.

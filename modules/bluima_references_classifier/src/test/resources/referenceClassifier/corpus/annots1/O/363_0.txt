FIG. 3. A-photograph of a cross section (40 pm) through the MG muscle. After an HRP
immersion of a PMNB and a 48-h survival period, the remaining MC nerve branches were
electrically stimulated to deplete the muscle of stored glycogen. All regions of the muscle, excluding that innervated by the branch previously immersed in HRP, appeared pale (periodic acidSchiff reaction). B-high-power magnification of the outlined area showing a compartment
boundary between glycogen-depleted (pale) and nondepleted (dark) regions. Notice glycogenpoor fibers (a) in both A and B. The arrow shows a neurovascular region enclosed by connective
tissue; this was not a tendon.

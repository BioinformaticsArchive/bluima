“prove” for gold); we would not expect humans an-notators to provide such misleading information. In-stead, we hypothesize that in practice there may be a
limited set of features with high enough information
content for humans to feel confident labeling, after
which they switch their attention to labeling instance
queries instead. This is additional evidence that the
user-guided flexibility of annotation in DUALIST is
an appropriate design choice.

Figure 6. Impaired activity-dependent downregulation of mIPSCs and GAD65 in Gad1 / neurons. a, Representative traces
showing that chronic application of TTX in WT cultures reduced mIPSC amplitude and frequency. Gad1 deletion attenuated the
TTX-induced downregulation of mIPSC amplitude and prevented the change in frequency. b, Summary of all data (n 6). c,
Representative images (low and high magnifications) showing the regulation of GAD65 expression by TTX in WT and Gad1 /
cultures. The intensity level of GAD65 in Gad1 / was similar to that of WT ( p 0.08). While TTX reduced GAD65 levels in WT
cultures, this downregulation was attenuated in Gad1 / neurons. In contrast, TTX-induced downregulation of GAD65 density is

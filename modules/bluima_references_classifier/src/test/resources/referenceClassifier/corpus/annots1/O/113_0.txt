stimulation of nVPM can activate both
the somatodendritic region of the nVPMto-nRT relay neurons and the axonal endings of the corticothalamic fibers that
have already invaded the nVPM during
the first postnatal week (Jacobs et al.,
2007). Recordings were first performed
during a restricted period of development
(P7–P9) to investigate the possibility to
discriminate nVPM-to-nRT and L6Cxto-nRT EPSCs at 70 mV.
The minimal nVPM stimulation (Fig.
2 D2) evoked fast AMPAR-mediated
EPSCs with a wide range of amplitude
(range, 20 –1400 pA; mean SEM,
430.0 55.2 pA; n 46). They had a
short latency (1.96 0.08 ms; n 46)
with a single Gaussian distribution, as ex- pected for monosynaptic responses (Fig.
1 B3). The EPSCs recorded at 70 mV
had a rapid 10 –90% RT (0.55 0.04 ms;
n 46) and a short t1/2 (1.69 0.12 ms;
n 46). Their linear I–V curve with a
reversal potential at 0.93 2.05 mV (n
6) was isolated in the presence of 50 M
NMDAR antagonist D-AP-5 (Fig. 1C),
and they were blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX (10 M).
In control, a slow NMDAR-mediated
component with a typical NMDAR I–V
curve and a reversal potential at 0.67
0.85 mV (n 6) was also recorded. It persisted in the presence of 10 M NBQX
(Fig. 1 D), and it was blocked by 50 M
D-AP-5. In few experiments (4 of 32), the

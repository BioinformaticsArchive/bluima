The table shows results for our five experiments (gray); for other participants, only their respective best result is mentioned. Each row starts with a
team number plus a key (“run4”) to further identify the experiment, cf. overview paper [15]. o indicates an online run, f offline. Results are
macroaveraged, in percent, sorted by F-score in raw results.

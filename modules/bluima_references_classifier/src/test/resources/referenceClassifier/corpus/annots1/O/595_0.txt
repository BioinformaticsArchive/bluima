apses. Alternatively, the new spines may be simple, nonfunctional
extrusions from the dendrites, having no presynaptic terminals
attached to them. To examine these possibilities, we stained
control and estradiol-treated cultures with SF antibodies. Analysis
of bouton staining in 25 and 27 random fields taken from control
and estradiol-treated cultures, respectively, revealed no difference
in the size of the terminals (32.1 6 0.3 and 32.9 6 0.3 pixels, where
each pixel is 0.125 μm × 0.125 μm, corresponding to an approximate area of 0.6 μm2). There was, however, a significant difference in the staining intensity per terminal: the controls were 76.5
6 0.78 intensity units, compared with 102.7 6 0.82 units in the
estradiol-treated cultures (p < 0.001) (Fig. 7). This may indicate
an increased density of SF protein, suggesting that the new spines
may represent an enhanced density of synaptic connections. It is
still unclear whether all of the newly formed spines contain
functional synapses, or whether the SF-immunoreactive boutons

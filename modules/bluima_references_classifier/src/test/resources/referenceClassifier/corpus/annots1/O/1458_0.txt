From these experiments we concluded that all
large-amplitude, fast rising and narrow half-width spikes
were Na+-mediated in both juvenile and mature cells.
We further concluded that the smaller amplitude, slower
rising and broader half-width spikes associated with
the early transient burst of Na+ spikes in juvenile
cells, or that terminated repetitive bursts of Na+
spikes in more mature cells, were Ca2+-mediated, as
supported by previous work (Llinas & Sugimori, 1980a,b;
Liljelund et al. 2000). We thus used these marked
differences in spike characteristics to distinguish Na+ from
Ca2+ spikes in subsequent experiments in the absence
of pharmacological manipulations. Further, it proves
impractical to study Na+- and Ca2+-mediated events in
isolation of one another. For instance, the Na+-spike waveform and the frequency of Na+-spike output are partially
determined by Ca2+-activated K+ channels (Raman &

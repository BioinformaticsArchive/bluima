Materials and Methods
Animal care. All experiments were performed in accordance with Inserm
and National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care of animals in
research and were approved by the local review committee. Postnatal day
0 (P0) was the day of birth, and 90% of the rats opened their eyes between
P13 and P14. The majority of experiments were performed with Wistar
rats for correspondence with previous experiments. Albinism is associated with a reduction in visual acuity (Prusky et al., 2002) and an in-creased crossing of retinal ganglion cell axons (Lund, 1965). In light of
this, we recorded from the monocular region of visual cortex and limited
our analysis to the earliest visual development. Cortical activity in nine
Long–Evans rats examined at the critical P9 –P11 time point could not be
differentiated from that of Wistar rats. These rats were used for the ex-periments reported in Figures 4 D and 5C. Recording techniques have
been extensively presented (Hanganu et al., 2006; Minlebaev et al., 2007,
2009). In brief, head-fixed rat pups were prepared for extracellular re-cording under isoflurane anesthesia (2–3% depending on age and verified by toe pinch). Xylocaine analgesia was applied to all cut surfaces and
buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg, i.p.) was given to manage pain. Recordings
were made 1 h after recovery from anesthesia. Pups were kept restrained
for 5 h and were closely monitored for signs of stress and to ensure that
they spent a normal proportion of their time sleeping. Body temperature
was maintained between 35 and 36°C. The animals were kept in low-light
conditions throughout all experiments. For enucleation experiments,
the animals were reanesthetized with 2–3% isoflurane in the recording setup, and the eye was removed. Local anesthetic (2% xylocaine)
was applied to the wound, and 10 min was allowed before removal of
anesthesia. For eye injection, the eyelid was opened during the initial
surgery. Before injection, xylocaine (1%) in PBS was applied to the
eyeball every 20 min. A puncture was made at the ciliary margin, a
Hamilton syringe needle (30 gauge) was inserted into the vitreous,
and solution was injected (5–10 l).
Electrophysiological recordings and analysis. Recordings were made
either with pulled glass microelectrodes (1–2 M ) coupled to a directcurrent amplifier (Molecular Devices) or multisite linear array “Michigan probes” (NeuroNexus Technologies) coupled to a custom-built
alternating current amplifier (1000 ; bandpass, 1 Hz to 5 kHz). V1
recordings were localized at 2.8 –3.2 mm lateral to midline and 0.0 – 0.5
mm rostral to lambda. Electrode location was verified postmortem via
tissue damage (glass electrodes) or dye localization (silicon probes). In
animals older than P8, the electrode was further confirmed to be in V1 via
monitoring of the response to 100 ms light flashes (M.T.C., unpublished
data). Frequencies below 1–2 Hz were poorly transmitted by the Michigan probes and our amplifier; therefore, all multielectrode recordings
were high-pass filtered at 2 Hz. All recordings were amplified 1000 ,
recorded in Axoscope, and analyzed with Clampfit (Molecular Devices)
and Matlab (MathWorks).
Layer identification was accomplished via multiple criteria. Anatomical sections show layer 4 to be located 300 –500 m below the pial surface.
As shown here and by others, current sinks to thalamic input are maximal at the layer 3– 4 border at these ages (Molna ́ r et al., 2003). In almost
all animals older than P8, we observed large units with a high rate of tonic
spontaneous activity between 500 and 600 m depth, previously identified as layer 5a (Le Bon-Jego and Yuste, 2007). For purposes of this study,
single electrodes were placed in layer 4 by locating the maximal fieldpotential deflection for the fast oscillations 300 –500 m below the pial
surface. For multielectrode recordings, the electrode was lowered until
the topmost contact just touched the cortical surface. Layer 4 was defined
as the electrode 300 –500 m deep that was also 100 –200 m above

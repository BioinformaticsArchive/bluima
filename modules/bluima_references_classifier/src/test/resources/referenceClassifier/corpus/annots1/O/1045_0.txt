namics of filopodia, which often extend
from presynaptic boutons, sample local
targets, and form transient contacts during axon development (Niell et al., 2004;
Wierenga et al., 2008), and a subset be-comes stabilized and mature into axon the
branch (Hua et al., 2005). To assess the
effect of blocking GABA release on axon
growth, we labeled basket cell axons with
PG67-GFP or PG67-GFP/ PG67-Cre and ex-amined filopodia dynamics at EP19 (Fig.
7a– c). Time-lapse Z-stack images were
taken every 10 min for 3 h. We defined
filopodia as processes of 0.3–1.5 m in
length that protrude from presynaptic
boutons. These boutons and filopodia
were frequently located and dynamic
around pyramidal cell soma, the site of
perisomatic synapses (data not shown). In
GABA block cells, filopodium density was
significantly higher compared with control (Fig. 7d; 0.09 0.01 and 0.08
0.01/ m vs 0.05 0.01/ m; mean SD;
one-way ANOVA, post hoc Dunn's test,
p 0.05). This result suggests that without transmission, basket cell axons extend
more filopodia to search for postsynaptic
targets, which might, in part, be the result
of the increased number and stability of
boutons labeled by Syn-GFP puncta (Fig.
4i). The likelihood of a filopodium to protrude from a bouton (defined by [number
of filopodium]/[number of bouton]) was
higher in GABA block cells than in controls
(Fig. 7e; p 0.05; n 5 cells for each genotype). In addition, more boutons were
added in the GABA block cells than in the
control cells (Fig. 7f; one-way ANOVA, post
hoc Dunn's test, p 0.05; n 5 cells for each
genotype) over the 3 h imaging session,
which may contribute to the increased bouton density in the GABA block axons (Fig. 1).

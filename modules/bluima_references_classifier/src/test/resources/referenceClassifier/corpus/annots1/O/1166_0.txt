1 Introduction and Motivation
This paper introduces Open Information Extraction (OIE)â€”
a novel extraction paradigm that facilitates domainindependent discovery of relations extracted from text and
readily scales to the diversity and size of the Web corpus.
The sole input to an OIE system is a corpus, and its output
is a set of extracted relations. An OIE system makes a single
pass over its corpus guaranteeing scalability with the size of
the corpus.

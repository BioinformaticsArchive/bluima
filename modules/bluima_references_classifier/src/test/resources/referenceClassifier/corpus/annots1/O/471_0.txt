MATERIALS AND METHODS~
Enzymes, Isotopes,and Reagents-Restriction enzymes, radioinert
nucleotides, ultrapure reagents, and NACS 37 columns were obtained
from Bethesda Research Laboratories. SP6 RNA polymerase and
placental ribonuclease inhibitor were obtained from Promega Biotech
(Madison, WI). Standard laboratory reagents were obtained from
Sigma unless otherwise noted. All radioisotopes were purchased from
Amersham Corp. and were used without further purification. Organic
solvents were purchased from Fisher unless otherwise noted.
Experimental Animals-Laboratory-bred male X. laevis were ob-tained from Nasco (Ft. Atkinson, WI) and kept inPlexiglas aquaria
at 25 "Cwith a 12-h light-dark cycle. They were fed frog brittle twice
a week. Injections of 1mg of estradiol in 0.2 ml of 5% (v/v) dimethyl
sulfoxide in propylene glycol wereadministered into thedorsal lymph
sac. Animals were anesthetized by adding tricaine metbanesulfonate
(Finquel, Ayerst Laboratories, New York) to the aquaria water. The
livers were perfused with 0.9% (w/v) sterile salineto remove as much
blood as possible, and thetissue was used immediately for the preparation of nuclei or total RNA.
Measurement of Cellular m R N A Levels-The preparation of total
cellular RNA and theassays used t o measure vitellogenin mRNA are
described in the Miniprint. @-GlobinmRNA in the totalRNA sample
was measured by hybridization to the@-globincDNA clone pXG8D2
which wasradiolabeled by nick translation in the presence of [a-''P]
dATP toa specific activity of greater than 10' cpm/pg. The washing
of the filters and determination of radioactivity are described in the
Miniprint.
Isolation ofNuclei-Animals were anesthetized with tricaine methanesulfonate, and thelivers were perfused with approximately 20 ml
of ice-cold saline. The livers were excised and washed with 0.25 M
sucrose in buffer A (15 mM HEPES? pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM
NaCl, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2.0 mM
EDTA, 2.0 mM dithiothreitol). The livers were then homogenized in
3 volumes of 1.0 M sucrose in buffer A..The homogenate was filtered
through nylon mesh and diluted with 2 volumes of 1.0 M sucrose in
buffer A. The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation through a 2.0 M
sucrose cushion in buffer B (15 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mM KC1,
0.15mMspermine,0.5mMspermidine,0.1mMEGTA,0.1mMEDTA,
2.0 mM dithiothreitol) at 100,000 X g, for 60 min at 4 "C. Nuclei
were resuspended in 1.25 M sucrose in buffer A, and Brij 58 (polyoxyethylene 20-cetyl ether) was added to a final concentrationof 0.1%.
After a final centrifugation through a cushion of 1.5 M sucrose in
bufferAat3600Xg, for10minat4"C,thenucleiwereresuspended
in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, 75 mM
NaC1, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.85 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.125 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were stored under theseconditions at
-70 "C for up to 5 days. The concentration of nuclei was determined
by diluting a portion in 0.4%(w/v) trypan blue and counting the
number of nuclei with a hemocytometer. Using this isolation procedure, approximately 30% of the expected number of nuclei was
obtained based on 1.3 X 10' hepatocytes/g of liver (17).

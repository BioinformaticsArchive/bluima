Figure 4. Cycle structure in tied and split-belt stepping with matched treadmill speeds. The
average step cycle, stance, and swing phase durations for infants (n 12) with exactly
matched speeds in tied-belt and split-belt conditions are shown for steps exhibiting 1:1 coordination (means SEM). Black bars were measured from two separate trials during tied-belt
stepping (i.e., fast and slow speeds). Gray bars were measured from split-belt stepping with one
belt at the fast and one at the slow speed. A, The step cycle duration during tied-belt stepping is
very different for the fast compared with the slow speed (i.e., height of black bars). When
stepping under split-belt conditions, the step cycle on the two sides become similar (i.e., height
of gray bars). The cycle duration changes more for the leg on the slow belt compared with that
on the fast belt during split-belt stepping (difference greater between black and gray bars on
the left compared with the right). Aâ€“C, During split-belt stepping, shortening of the step cycle
on the slow belt (A, left) comes from shortening of the stance phase (B, left) and the swing
phase (C, left). The slight lengthening of the step cycle in the leg on the fast belt (A, right) comes
mostly from lengthening of the swing phase (C, right). The asterisk indicates statistical significance (paired t tests). Error bars represent SEM.

et al., 1993; Major et al.,1994). This predicts that the
dendritic trees of layer I neurons are within 0.1 A of the
somata. If dendrites have higher R,,,s (Pongracz et al.,

effective receptive fields. Layer I neurons may therefore
effectivelytransform inputs from relativelyrestricted receptive fields into outputs to much larger areas.
Axonal ramifications. Cajal had difficulties in distinguishing axon from dendrites and described multi-axon
layer I neurons on several occasions in his early publications (DeFelipe and Jones, 1988). Marin-Padilla (1984)
once reported that there are small layer I neurons with
indistinguishable axonal and dendritic processes. In the
present study, we found that, in well-filled layer I neurons
in PN13-21 rats, axon initial segments and axon collaterals
were reliably distinguished from dendrites on the basis of
their smaller uniform caliber and smooth appearance.
The elaborate axonal arbors, extending up to 1,600 pm in
layer I, were the most prominent feature of layer I neurons.
The extent of the axonal arbors revealed in this present
study was larger than previous estimates from Golgi (SousaPinto et al., 1975; Bradford et al., 1978; Marin-Padilla,
1984) and intracellular Lucifer Yellow labeling studies
(Anderson et al., 1992). The dimensions of the axonal
arbors of our layer I neurons were comparable to those of
basket and clutch cells revealed by intracellular staining in
vivo in cat visual cortex (Somogyiet al., 1983;Kisvarday et
al., 1985, 1987). Consistent with our findings, an electron
microscopic study has shown that axonal elements comprise almost half of layer I volume (Vaughan and Peters,
19731,even though it remains to be established how much
of these axonal elements originate from intrinsic layer I
neurons. Our results are also consistent with the report by
Beaulieu et al. (1994) that a single layer I GABAergic
neuron makes the largest number of synapses among the
cortical layers in rat visual cortex.

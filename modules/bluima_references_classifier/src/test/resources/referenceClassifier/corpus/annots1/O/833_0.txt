Calcium imaging and electrogenesis in basal dendrites
Previous work in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons
indicates that single backpropagating APs evoke only small or
negligible increases in intracellular calcium at distal locations,
whereas high-frequency bursts lead to substantial distal calcium
signals (Larkum et al., 1999). Similarly, in the basal dendrites of
layer 5 pyramidal neurons, we found that the calcium signal as-sociated with single backpropagating APs is small at distal sites,
whereas the response to AP bursts increases supralinearly with distance of the recording site from the soma (Fig. 1). The observed
supralinear increases in calcium are unlikely to be a consequence of

Figure I I. Optimal fits of all four cells. First two models include most likely pipette (20 pF, 10 MQ), via which current is injected and response
is recorded. Real cells' grand average target responses to short current pulses are dashed lines; optimal model responses to same current are dotted
lines. Lines superimpose so well that they appear to be one dot-dashed line. Note different voltage axes. Optimal electrical parameters are listed in
each panel.

PYRAMIDAL CELLS. It has been revealed that the dendritic
morphology of pyramidal cells in visual cortex varies ac-cording to their projection differences (Hallman et al. 1988;
Hiibener and Bolz 1988; Katz 1987). Pyramidal cells in
layer V of rat agranular cortex send axons mainly to other
cortical areas ipsi- and contralaterally, as well as to the striaturn and into the pyramidal tract. Corticostriatal cells not
projecting to the pyramidal tract are medium-sized pyramidal cells whose apical dendrites emit oblique branches in
layer II/III and horizontal branches in layer I (200-400
pm). Their basilar dendritic field is densely branched, ex-tending -400-500 pm (Wilson 1987). Pyramidal tract
cells have apical dendrites that emit oblique branches in
layers II/ III and have a profuse arborization, 350-550 pm
in extent in layer I. The total extent of their basal dendritic
field varies between 250 and 350 pm (Landry et al. 1984).
Both types of cells seem to correspond to the LR pyramidal
cells of the present paper. Projection sites of HR cells do not
seem to have been identified yet.
Various afferents to the neocortex tend to be segregated
by layers (Jones 1986). In rat frontal cortex, commissural
fibers arising from layer II/III cells in the contralateral cortex terminate preferentially in layers II/III, those from
layer V end also preferentially in layer V (Gerfen 1989).
Because oblique branches from apical dendrites at layer II/
III were only observed in LR cells, the two types of pyramidal cells may receive inputs in layer II/III in different ways.
In addition to layer-specific terminations of afferents, co-lumnar segregation of inputs also occurs in neocortex
(Jones 1986). Corticocortical fibers terminate in columnar
fashion in rat frontal cortex, and the horizontal width of
this termination is 250-750 pm (Isseroff et al. 1984). On
this basis, dendritic fields of LR cells may lie within single
columns and receive inputs from a single column of afferent terminations, but those of HR cells may cross one afferent fiber column into another and receive inputs also from
adjacent columns.
Higher input resistance makes HR cells fire spikes by
weaker synaptic currents. Because the membrane time constant is longer in HR cells, they can accumulate more synaptic potentials. By these physiological properties and the
horizontal extension of their dendrites across more than
one column, HR cells should integrate inputs to layer V
over wider temporal and spatial extents. On the other hand,

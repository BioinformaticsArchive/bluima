has been proposed to be another important
player in connecting metabolism to circadian
gene expression. This transcriptional coactivator associates with nuclear receptors of the
ROR family and thereby modulates the transcription of the clock genes Bmal1 and Reverb . Finally, the NAD+-dependent protein
deacetylase sirtuin 1 influences the stability
and activity of the core clock components
PER2 and BMAL1, respectively (7, 8).
Why are metabolic processes under tight
circadian control? A simple explanation
arises from the necessity to separate incompatible enzymatic processes within the same
cell. Because complete spatial separation of
anabolic and catabolic processes is frequently
impossible, these have to be gated to different time windows. This necessity is well illustrated by the temporal sequestration of oxidative and reductive phases in yeast by an ultradian respiratory clock. For example, DNA is
replicated exclusively in the reductive phase,
when the concentration of genotoxic reactive
oxygen species generated by mitochondrial
respiration is minimal (9). In a yeast mutant
in which the reductive phase is too short to
allow for the completion of DNA synthesis,
the mutation rate increases dramatically (10).
In mammals, the master pacemaker in the
SCN is phase-entrained primarily by light-

determine the steady-state amounts of these nonmuscle actin
gene transcripts in a variety of mouse tissues. Total RNA
was isolated from five nonmuscle tissues (brain, liver, kidney, lung, and testis), one smooth muscle (stomach), and
two striated muscles (skeletal muscle and heart). A 2-,ug
portion of total RNA from each tissue was electrophoresed
through agarose-formaldehyde gels, blot transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized to either the 1-actin-specific (,B-3'UT-HF) or y-actin-specific (-y-3'UT-FNU) DNA probe
(15). Autoradiographic exposures of these filters are shown
in Fig. 1.
Inspection of the autoradiograms clearly reveals the presence of ,B-actin mRNA in all tissues, both muscle and
nonmuscle (Fig. 1). In contrast, -y-actin mRNA is just
detectable in heart and skeletal muscle and undetected in
liver. It was necessary to increase exposure times a further
5- to 10-fold to observe clear autoradiographic signals from
the -y-actin mRNA in striated muscles and liver (not shown).
Thus, we conclude that, whereas 13- and -y-actin mRNAs are
present in all eight tissues, their relative expression shows
considerable variation among these tissues. As expected, the
smooth and striated muscles express quite low levels of 1B-and -y-actin mRNA because they also express muscle actins
as their major actin isoforms (55-57), but this does not
account for the variation seen in the nonmuscle tissues. To
quantitate this variation, the autoradiograms were subject to
densitometry (Table 1).
We measured the levels of 1- and -y-actin mRNA per
microgram of RNA in all tissues. Table 1 shows that,
between the nonmuscle tissues, ,B-actin mRNA levels per
microgram of RNA vary eightfold between liver and lung. If
we calculate the ,B-actin mRNA per microgram of DNA, this
variation is substantially reduced, with the most extreme
difference being twofold between brain and kidney (Table 1).
In contrast, the level of y-actin mRNA per microgram of
RNA shows a 200-fold difference between liver and testis.
This is due to the extraordinary low expression of y-actin
mRNA in liver (Table 1). If we eliminate liver from consideration, the levels of y-actin mRNA per microgram of RNA
are more similar to each other in nonmuscle tissues than
when calculated per microgram of DNA. Thus, we conclude
that, whereas ,B-actin mRNA tends to accumulate at similar
levels per microgram of DNA and that of y-actin mRNA
does so per microgram of RNA, there is substantial variation
between some mouse nonmuscle tissues.
Calculation of the ratio of 1-/y-actin mRNA levels in
mouse tissues demonstrates that their relative expression

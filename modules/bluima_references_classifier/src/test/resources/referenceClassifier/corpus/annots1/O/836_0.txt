manner to oscillations of the membrane potential of the neuron
(Fig. 5C). The neuronal trace in this panel was reconstructed
from the original trace (see METHODS) and is depicted to outline
the inverse relation of the capacitance with the neuronal activity. The average neuronal capacitance was 170 pF (range from
100 to 800 pF). The amplitude of the capacitance variation
during slow oscillations was proportional to the amplitude of
the slow oscillation and ranged from 50 to 150 pF.
The glial capacitance, measured as in the case of neurons,
during periods with slow oscillations, expressed a periodic
variation of ;1–2 Hz (n = 53; Fig. 6). The main time constant
(t ) was 0.148 6 0.02 ms and had a coefficient k = 134.81 6
11
25.57 (fitting error 3.67 6 0.6%). The second time constant
(t ) was 2.14 6 0.24 ms with k = 25.12 6 3.57 and the fitting
22
error of 13.57 6 3.2%. Both time constants oscillated at
roughly the same frequency (see autocorrelograms in Fig. 6D).
The average of the glial capacitance during slow oscillations
was 13.45 pF (range 10 –25 pF) and its variation (amplitude of
0.5–3 pF) was independent of synaptic activities and the slow
(<1 Hz) oscillation of the network (Fig. 6A). Figure 6C also
presents a comparison between the capacitance evolution de-rived from fitting the charging curves with a double exponential (top) and a single exponential (bottom). Although both
traces show basically the same oscillation, as proven by their
cross-correlation (CROSS in Fig. 6D), some differences were
evident: the average conductance value was higher (;30%)

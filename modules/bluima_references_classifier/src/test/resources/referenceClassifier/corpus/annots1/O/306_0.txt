MACROSCOPIC STRUCTURE

The shape of a neurone, in terms of the number and position of its dendritic
branches, determines both the inputs it receives as well as its postsynaptic targets.
The 'function' of a neurone is dictated by its connectivity to other ones and thus is
tightly linked to its structure at this macroscopic level. Many types of neurones have
dendrites that project to distinct regions of the nervous system and can receive different synaptic inputs specific for each dendrite. An excellent example of this type of
neurone is found in the cricket cereal afferent system. Anatomical studies reviewed
by Murphey, Walthall & Jacobs in this volume describe how the dendrites of windsensitive interneurones overlap with different classes of sensory afferents. Each class
of sensory afferent responds optimally to a different wind direction (Palka, Levine &
Schubiger, 1977) and occupies a distinct region of neuropile (Bacon & Murphey,
1984). These studies suggest that the receptive fields of the wind-sensitive interneurones are determined by the position of their dendrites with respect to the different
classes of sensory afferents. In this section we summarize experiments which test thia

stimulated network. Thereby, the afterdischarges display
different phases which are dependent on the stimulation
intensity. In an initial phase a “fast run” of spiking activity at
10 –20 Hz is seen (compare Timofeev et al., 1998, Fig. 3).
In our study we reduced the stimulation intensity to prevent
this post-stimulus spiking. Following the fast run a lowfrequency, high amplitude subthreshold activity can be
seen in cortical cells in vivo (Timofeev et al., 1998) as well
as in vitro (this study). In contrast to spike-wave activity,
afterdischarges are localized events as they can be in-duced in cortical slices and isolated cortical slab preparations in vivo. In addition, afterdischarges are not visible in
the electroencephalogram of neighboring areas (Timofeev
et al., 1998). Based on frequency range and underlying
mechanisms, the ETNO activity described in this study
resembles afterdischarge activity more than any form of
neocortical oscillatory activity.

Y-maze
The Y-maze apparatus consisted of three Plexiglas chambers of
equal size (5 cm × 15 cm × 15 cm) with interchangeable floors
providing different visual and tactile olfactory cues as conditioned
stimuli. Each apparatus was equipped with photocell beams
allowing automatic recording of the animal's position and horizontal
activity (Imetronic, Bordeaux, France). To evaluate the exploratory
activity and habituation to novelty, mice were provided initially freeaccess to two arms of the apparatus. After a 30 min habituation
period they were given free access to the third arm for 10 min. The
locomotor activity and time spent in each compartment during both
phases of the test were recorded automatically.

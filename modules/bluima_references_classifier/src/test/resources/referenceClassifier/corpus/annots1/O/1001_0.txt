(Donchin et al. 1989), predicted the success of Israeli Air Force
flight school cadets in learning flight control (Gopher et al.
1994). However, others have found that 20-plus hours of action
video game practice provided no specific benefits for novice
video gamers across a wide battery of cognitive tasks, even
though expert gamers outperformed the novices on many of
the same tasks (Boot et al. 2008). These contrasting findings
raised the possibility that other factors contribute to the
differences in performance between expert video gamers and
nongamers, including self-selection effects originating from
preexisting individual differences (Boot et al. 2008).
If preexisting individual differences contribute to a selfselection effect, they might also predict variability in learning
rates. In the experiments reported here, we reasoned that
such preexisting differences might include differences in brain
structures important for procedural learning and cognitive
flexibility, and that it might therefore be possible to predict
learning rates on complex tasks such as video games by
analyzing preexisting differences in brain structures. We
focused on the striatum, a key node in procedural learning
circuits (Doyon et al. 2003; Graybiel 2005, 2008; Yin and
Knowlton 2006; Balleine et al. 2009). The caudate nucleus and
putamen, which together make up the dorsal striatum, have
been convincingly implicated in procedural and habit learning
and in the execution of learned behaviors. These regions are
also activated while performing tasks that require cognitive
flexibility such as task-switching and transfer to untrained tasks
(Ragozzino et al. 2002; Cools et al. 2004; Meiran et al. 2004;
Dahlin et al. 2008; Kimchi and Laubach 2009). The nucleus
accumbens, in the ventral striatum, is part of the limbic circuitry
related to reinforcement and motivation (Belin and Everitt
2008; Graybiel 2008; De Martino et al. 2009), and evidence
suggests that the nucleus accumbens is recruited during the
early stages of learning (Hernandez et al. 2002; O'Doherty et al.
2004; Atallah et al. 2007). Positron emission tomography studies
in humans have shown that dopamine release and binding
are increased in both of these striatal regions when subjects
play a video game, and that greater dopamine binding is
associated with better performance (Koepp et al. 1998).
To test directly whether the differential size of these striatal
regions could be used to predict learning on an unfamiliar
video game, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based
brain volumetry to measure striatal volumes of subjects with
little previous video game experience before they received
training on the classic Space Fortress video game. As a control
brain structure, we analyzed the volume of the hippocampus,
implicated in declarative memory formation (Squire et al.
2004). We used 2 different training strategies, one version

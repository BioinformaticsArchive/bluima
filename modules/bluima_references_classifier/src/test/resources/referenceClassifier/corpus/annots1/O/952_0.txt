Comparing across different age groups and different temperatures.
When the results of whole-cell and sharp electrode experiments are
compared or combined, several additional factors need to be taken into
account. The ease with which good whole-cell recordings can be obtained
drops significantly with the age of the animal. Myelination reduces the resolution of the optics and increases the difficulty of maintaining a ``clean''
electrode tip required for a good seal prior to ``going whole-cell''. The
majority of dual recording experiments with this technique, therefore, use
young animals (P10–P22). A major advantage of sharp electrode studies
is the facility with which adult neurones can be studied. Many cell classes
can be distinguished at all these ages and the basic wiring rules, the
direction of synaptic dynamics and many inherent cell properties appear
to be similar to those found in the adult. However, all cellular and synaptic
properties are slower at earlier developmental stages.
In a recent comparison of paired recordings in juvenile and adult rat
slices (Ali et al., 2007), it was concluded that between 14–16 and 18–22
days postnatal there is a halving of the duration of synaptic potentials
(comparing for example, Beierlein et al., 2003; Reyes et al., 1998), paralleled by a halving of the membrane time constant (comparing Wang et
al., 2002, 2004) and the duration of APs, with some additional decrease
between 3 and 6–7 weeks of age. Temperature also played a significant role with a 10 ◦C increase resulting in an approximately three-fold
decrease in the time course of these parameters. What was encouraging,
however, was the finding that these parameters increased in parallel and
that the strong correlations between inherent cell characteristics, such
as AP width at half amplitude and membrane time constant and synaptic
potential duration were similar for all age groups. The slower the cell's own
inherent characteristics, the slower are the synaptic potentials it receives
(Ali et al., 2007). Interestingly, there was also a strong correlation between
the properties of the presynaptic interneurone and the duration of the IPSPs
it elicited in pyramidal cells; interneurones with narrow spikes elicit fast
GABAA receptor mediated IPSPs, interneurones with broad spikes elicit
broad GABAA receptor mediated IPSPs.

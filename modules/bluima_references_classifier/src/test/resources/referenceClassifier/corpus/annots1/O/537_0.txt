Fig. 5. (Aâ€“D) Effects of cytokine receptor gene disruption on the
number of MHC2 cells, 14 days after facial nerve cut. Deletion of
IFN receptor subunit type 1 (IFN R1, B) is associated with a strong
increase, that of TNFR2 (D) with a decrease in the number of MHC2
cells in the axotomized facial motor nucleus. Deletion of IL1R1 (A) or
TNFR1 (C) had no effect. Filled bars: axotomized; empty bars: contralateral side; / : homozygously deficient mice, / wild type
controls. Mean S.E.M., n 8 / and n 7 / mice in A (8/7), and
n 7/7 in B, C and D. * P 0.05 between / and / animals in
unpaired Student's t-test.

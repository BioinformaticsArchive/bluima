the family of cullin proteins, which function as E3 ubiquitin ligases by forming
complexes with other proteins (Ou et al.,
2002; Chiba and Tanaka, 2004). In the fly
genome, there are six different cullin
genes: Cul1 (also called lin19), Cul2, Cul3,
Cul4, Cul5, and CG11261, which is close to
Cul1 and Cul2 (Ou et al., 2002). The Cul3
gene consists of 11 exons and encodes a
protein of 773 amino acids. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the l(2L)MB397
chromosome has a point mutation at the
splice acceptor site of the intron between
exon 6 and exon 7 of Cul3 (Fig. 6 B). This
splicing defect may lead to truncation
and/or open reading frame shift of Cul3
after amino acid 516, which may eliminate
several C-terminal conserved domains, in-cluding Roc1 binding site, Nedd8 modification site (also see below), and Cullin
motif (Wada et al., 1999; Mistry et al.,
2004). To confirm that all l(2L)MB397 MB
phenotypes resulted from loss of Cul3
function, we created clones of MB neurons
that are homozygous for Cul32 and ob-served similar axon terminal morphogenetic defects as in l(2L)MB397 mutant
clones (Fig. 6C). Moreover, l(2L)MB397
MB phenotypes were fully rescued in the
presence of an autonomously expressed
wild-type Cul3 cDNA (Fig. 6 D). Thus,
l(2L)MB397 is a novel Cul3 mutation
(Cul38).

Figure 4. A comparison of activity decreases during the performance of goal directed tasks (a) in the default network [77] and coherent activity within the same network in
the resting state derived from spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI BOLD signal (see Ref. [73] for further details). Performance of a wide variety of tasks has called attention
to a group of brain areas (a) that decrease their activity during task performance (data adapted from Ref. [78]). This particular group of brain areas has come to be known as
the `default network' and serves as an exemplar of all areas of the cerebral cortex that exhibit a systems level organization in the resting (default) state [73]. If the
spontaneous fMRI BOLD signal activity in these areas is recorded [arrows in part (a)] in the resting state, what emerges is a remarkable correlation in the spontaneous
fluctuations of the fMRI BOLD signals obtained from the two areas (b). Using these fluctuations to analyze the network as a whole [73] reveals a level of functional
organization (c) that parallels that seen in the task-related activity decreases (a). These data provide a dramatic demonstration of the intrinsic organization of the human
brain, which is likely to provide a crucial context for all human behavior in health and disease. These data were adapted from our earlier published work [79].

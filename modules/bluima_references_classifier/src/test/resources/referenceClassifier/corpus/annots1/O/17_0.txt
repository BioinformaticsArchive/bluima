Figure 2. Currentâ€“voltage relationships in +/+ and tg la/tg la Purkinje cells. A, Representative current traces are shown for +/+ and tg la/tg la Purkinje
cells. Currents were elicited by voltage steps from -80 to +30 mV (200 msec) delivered at 8 sec intervals with Vh = -60 mV. Voltage protocol is shown
at top. B, Currents were divided by cell capacitance and reported as current densities (pA /pF). Current density 6 SE was plotted versus test voltage.
There are statistically significant differences ( p < 0.002) in current densities between +/+ (n = 15 cells, 10 mice, 8 litters) and tg la/tg la (n = 16 cells,
8 mice, 7 litters) Purkinje cells from -30 to +30 mV. Inset, The scaled activation curve for tg la/tg la cells is superimposed on the +/+ activation curve.
C, Representative current traces are shown for +/+ and tg la/tg la Purkinje cells. Currents were elicited by voltage ramps from -80 to +30 mV (400 msec)
with Vh = -60 mV. Voltage protocol is shown at top. D, Currents were divided by cell capacitance and reported as current densities (pA/pF). Current
densities were averaged and plotted versus membrane voltage. SEs are shown at peak current densities.

spiny stellates (ss). Their somata were located at depths
between 600 and 700 lm, 500 and 1000 lm, and 550 and 900
lm, respectively. L4py displayed a narrow apical tuft terminating in L1. In contrast, L4sp extended no further than L2 and
lacked an apical tuft. The L4ss lacked an apical dendrite
altogether.
Infragranular L5 contained 2 types of pyramidal neurons,
slender (st)- and thick-tufted (tt) pyramids (Wise and Jones
1977). The apical tuft dendrites of L5tt pyramids extended
beyond the tangential column borders, while those of L5st
pyramids did not. The somata of these 2 types intermingled
(1000-1300 lm and 1100-1400 lm), apart from ~100-lm thick
regions directly underneath L4 and above L6, which were
exclusively populated by L5st and L5tt pyramids, respectively.
Finally, the clustering identified 2 types of excitatory
neurons in L6. The 2 cell types differed in their soma locations
and dendrite morphology. Neurons of the first cell type were
located at depths between 1400 and 1600 lm and displayed
a short apical dendrite that lacked a tuft and terminated at the
border between L4 and 5. In contrast, neurons of the second
cell type extended apical dendrites into L4 that displayed
narrow tufts. In our sample, they were located deeper within
L6 at depths between 1550 and 1800 lm (with the exception
of one cell that was located within L5 [~1200-lm depth] but
otherwise showed the characteristic morphological features of
this cell type). The dendrite morphologies of the 2 cell types
resembled those of neurons which have previously been
classified by characteristic axon projection patterns into L6
corticocortical (cc) and corticothalmic (ct) pyramids (Kumar
and Ohana 2008). This naming convention was thus adopted
for the present study.

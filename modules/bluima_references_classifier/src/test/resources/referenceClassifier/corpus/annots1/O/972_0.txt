Identification of Barrels and Neurons
Slices were placed in the recording chamber and inspected with
a 2.53/0.075 numerical aperture (NA) Plan objective using bright-field
illumination. Barrels were identified as evenly spaced, light ``hollows''
separated by narrow dark stripes (Agmon and Connors 1991; Feldmeyer
et al. 1999) and photographed using a frame-grabber for later analysis.
Interneurons were searched in layer 2/3 above barrels of 250 Â± 70 lm
width (n = 64) using a water immersion objective 403/0.80 NA and
infrared differential interference contrast microscopy (Dodt and
Zieglgansberger 1990; Stuart et al. 1993). Somata of neurons in layer
2/3 were selected for recording if a single apical dendrite was not
visible. This was the sole criterion for the a priori selection of
interneurons. After recording, the pipettes were positioned above the
slice at the position of the recorded cells, and the barrel pattern was
again photographed using bright-field illumination.

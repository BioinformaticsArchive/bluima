MATERIALS AND METHODS
Wistar albino female rats were maintained in 12:
12-hr dark:light cycle and had free access to chow and
water. Manipulation of the animals was performed following the European Union Normative (86/609/EEC), and
special care was taken to minimize animal suffering and
to set the number of animals to the minimum required.
Fifty-five animals distributed in 11 experimental groups
were used for this study. To reduce circulating estrogen
levels, all animals were bilaterally ovariectomized under
2,2,2, tribromoethanol anaesthesia (0.2 g/Kg b.w., Fluka
Chemika AG, Buchs, Switzerland) when they were 4
weeks old. One month after ovariectomy, the rats were
anaesthetised with tribromoethanol, and an osmotic
minipump (Alzet 2002, Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA; flow
rate 0.5 Î¼l/hr) was subcutaneously implanted between the
scapulae. Before implantation, the pumps were filled with

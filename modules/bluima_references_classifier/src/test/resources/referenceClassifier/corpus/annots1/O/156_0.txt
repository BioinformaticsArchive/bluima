0.2; n 7), suggesting that the recorded spine [Ca 2 ]i transients
did not change significantly during the pairing period (Fig. 10 D).
Finally, blocking IP3-dependent release of Ca 2 from internal
stores by intracellular application of heparin (400 U/ml) through
the patch pipette had no effect on LTD (0.68 0.12; p 0.05; n
9) (Fig. 10C). The resulting pharmacological signature for LTD
(Fig. 10 F) suggests retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, mediated by G-coupled mGluR and PLC activation.

partments (Muller and Connor, 1991; Yuste and Denk, 1995), the
extent to which they compartmentalize electrical signals is un-known. Here, we address this gap in knowledge through the use
of voltage-sensitive dye imaging from dendritic spines on basal
dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. This technique enables
us to measure electrical signals in neuronal structures that are
inaccessible to direct electrophysiological recordings. We show
that bAPs invade dendritic spines without voltage loss. During
synaptic input, we find that while there was evidence for electrical
compartmentalization in some spines (Denk et al., 1995), the
synaptic voltage response in the majority of dendritic spines is
small. Furthermore, based on changes in the amplitude of synaptic responses in dendritic spines during membrane hyperpolarization, we conclude that these responses are not significantly
amplified by voltage-activated channels. Simulation of our ex-perimental findings in morphologically realistic models indicates
that spine neck resistance ranges up to 500 M , in agreement
with previous estimates from electron microscopy (Harris and
Stevens, 1989), diffusion measurements (Svoboda et al., 1996;
Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005), and recent modeling based on
calcium imaging data (Grunditz et al., 2008). Spine neck resistances of this magnitude reduce the amplitude of somatic EPSPs
by 15%, indicating that spine neck is unlikely to act as a physical
device to modulate synaptic strength.

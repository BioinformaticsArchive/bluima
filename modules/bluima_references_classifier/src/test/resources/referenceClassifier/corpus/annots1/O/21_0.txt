Fig. 3 Kinetics of BAPTA. For the T-jump measurements, the
samples contained 50 pM BAPTA; 20 mM H-EDTA and 1 X-4.0
mM CaCI, were used to define [CaZ+]. We used the absorbance
change of BAPTA (at 254 nm) upon calcium binding to follow the
relaxation process. (A) shows absorbance spectra of 75 pM
BAPTA at different free calcium concentrations (set by EGTA) as
indicated in the figure. Clearly, calcium binding to BAPTA can
reduce its absorbance by a factor of 6. (B) is a typical relaxation
trace at [Ca*+] = 631 nM. The monoexponential fit gives a rate of
330 s-l. (C) summarizes the data on BAPTA by plotting the
average relaxation rates over [Ca'+]. A linear fit according to
Equation 6 gives k,‚Äù = 4.5 x lo8 M-l.s-l and k, = 79 s-l.

induces a conformational change in ERα that further stabilizes HDAC4 through an interaction

with the AF-2 domain. While direct interaction with the A/B domain occurs independent of

ligand, we and others have observed that recruitment of HDAC4 to an ER-responsive promoter

by full length ERα occurs only in the presence of estrogen or tamoxifen, suggesting that

differential recruitment of HDAC4 to the N- and C-termini may occur. Additional experiments

are required to determine whether multiple HDAC4 proteins interact with ERα. We propose that

N-terminal-bound HDAC4 associates with corepressor complexes that are recruited to the AF-2

in a ligand-dependent manner. A similar cooperative interaction of SRC-1 between the AF-1

and AF-2 has already been demonstrated to mediate synergism between the two transcriptional

activation function domains (42). In the case of SERMs such as tamoxifen, association of the

recruited NCoR/SMRT complex with N-terminal-bound HDAC4 may enhance transcriptional

repression activity. Alternatively, tamoxifen may induce the indirect recruitment of HDAC4

already associated with the NCoR/SMRT complex. In such a model, the regulation of SERM

behavior would likely involve a coordination of both N- and C-terminal HDAC4 activities. In

either case, whether HDAC4 is selectively recruited to the N-terminus or both the N- and C-termini, overall HDAC4 activity is likely influenced by additional factors that are associated with

ERα.

Further studies are required to define the relative contribution of HDAC4 activity and

that of recruited coregulators in determining ERα response to SERMs. For example, HDAC4

activity may have little influence in cells expressing high levels of the AF-1-specific RTA

corepressor, which inhibits the agonist activity of tamoxifen in an HDAC-independent manner

(18). The expression of such coregulators may explain the discrepancies we observed between

the effects of HDAC4 overexpression and knockdown on liganded ERα activity in COS-7 and

in agreement with the pattern of field potentials during spindle
oscillations) (Steriade et al., 1990). Consistent with the analysis of
Figure 1C1, this pattern of field potentials was generated by the
limited discharge in PY cells, which fired approximately one spike
per oscillation cycle.
When GABAA receptors were suppressed in thalamic cells in
this model, with cortical inhibition intact, spindle oscillations
were transformed into slower oscillation patterns at 3â€“5 Hz (Fig.
4C). In this case there was an increase in synchrony, as indicated
by the TC cells that fired at every cycle of the oscillation. RE cells
generated prolonged burst discharges, leading to GABABmediated I PSPs in TC cells and, consequently, to a slow oscillation frequency. The field potentials consisted of successive negative deflections (Fig. 4C, bottom) similar to that of spindles. This
pattern of field potentials was generated by PY cells that discharged approximately single spikes at each cycle of the oscillation (similar to Fig. 1C1). This simulation therefore suggests that
removing intrathalamic GABAA-mediated inhibition affects the
oscillation frequency but does not generate SW, because pyramidal cells are still under the strict control of cortical fast inhibition.
This is in agreement with in vivo injections of bicuculline into the
thalamus, which reported slow oscillations with increased thalamic synchrony, but no SW patterns in the field potentials (Ralston and Ajmone-Marsan, 1956; Steriade and Contreras, 1998).

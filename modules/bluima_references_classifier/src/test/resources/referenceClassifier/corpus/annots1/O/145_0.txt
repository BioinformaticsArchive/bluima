Developmental Data and Simulations
The next three sections summarize how the model simulates
data about the development of long-range horizontal connections in area V1. After development self-stabilizes, the
resultant network can, without further change, simulate adult
neurophysiological and psychophysical data. As in the brain, the
model undergoes two stages of development (Fig. 2). One occurs
prior to eye opening, when endogenous random geniculate and
cortical activity determine the initial specificity of horizontal
connections (Ruthazer and Stryker, 1996). The other occurs
after eye opening, when patterned visual inputs can strengthen
and refine these connections (Galuske and Singer, 1996).
Several anatomical studies have investigated how horizontal
projections develop in the superficial layers of visual cortex into
adult connections that connect columns of similar orientation
preference (Callaway and Katz, 1990; Durack and Katz, 1996;
Galuske and Singer, 1996). Callaway and Katz used neuronal
tracing and intracellular staining to investigate the development
of clustered horizontal connections in cat striate cortex
(Callaway and Katz, 1990). They found an even, unclustered
distribution up to 2 mm from the injection site during the first

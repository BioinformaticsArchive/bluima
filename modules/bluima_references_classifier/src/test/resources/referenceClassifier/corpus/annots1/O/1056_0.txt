Bitufted interneurons in layers 2-5 were sparsely located and
their somata were usually oval and gave rise to 3-5 vertically
orientated primary beaded dendrites from opposite poles
(Figs 1Aa and 4Ac,Da). The primary dendrites then branched
further, and the larger portion of the dendritic axis was
directed down toward deeper layers. Although majority of
these dendrites were smooth, 2 bitufted cells included in this

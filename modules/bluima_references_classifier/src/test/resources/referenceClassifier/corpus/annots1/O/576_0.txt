5 EXPERIMENTS
We have tested our system on a corpus of 145,316 documents (445 MB) from the CNN Web site.7 We have used the
KIM domain ontology and KB [20], publicly available as
part of the KIM Platform, developed by Ontotext Lab,8 with
minor extensions and adjustments to conform to our toplevel metamodel described in Section 3. We have also
manually added classes and instances in areas where the
KIM KB fell short (such as the Sports domain), in order to
support a larger testbed for experimentation. Only one
classification taxonomy is used, based on the categories of
the CNN archive (such as Business, Politics, Sports, etc., and
subcategories thereof), with which all documents and
domain classes are classified, as explained in Section 3.1.
Our current implementation is compatible with both RDF
and OWL. The complete KB includes 281 classes, 138 properties, 35,689 instances, and 465,848 sentences, taking a total
of 71 MB in RDF text format. For efficiency, the KB has been
stored on a MySQL backend using Jena 2.2. Based on the
concept-keyword mapping available in the KIM KB, over
3  106 annotations (i.e., over 25 per document on average)

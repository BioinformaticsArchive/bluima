channel function (Davare and Hell, 2003; Kobayashi et al., 2007;
Norris et al., 2008). Furthermore, the fact that E2, but not aging,
affected mRNA expression suggests that aging and E2 modulate
this channel via different mechanisms. Nonetheless, our results
suggest that Cav1.2 is a likely target of E2 action in the brain and
that E2's mechanism of action may involve, at least in part, a
suppression of LTCC mRNA expression.

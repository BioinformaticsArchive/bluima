Figure 5. Retzius cells and Cajal cells in the cat. (A) Retzius cells are present prenatally
(cat fetus, E55) as well as during the first postnatal days. They are strongly reelinimmunoreactive. (B,C) Cajal cells in a kitten at P20, when Retzius cells are no longer
present. Cajal cells are characterized by their smaller size, superficial location and reelin
expression. Arrows point to the descending processes. Bar: 50 Î¼m.

excitation in the group II range could also be contrasted by a prevalence of inhibition in the group
III range (or vice versa), sometimes even with stimulation of the same nerve (see cell no. 20 in
Fig. 5). These examples merely emphasize the rather high variability of single-cell responses
compared with the general trends.

Dynamic p.b.s.t. cells. For these cells (Fig. 6), unambiguous group III effects (two
or more symbols in Fig. 6B), i.e. effects which do not include the group II-dominated
effects (one symbol in B, see also Methods), were considerably less frequent than
unambiguous group II effects (Fig. 6A); the latter comprised all group II-influenced
actions, including the group III-dominated effects (one symbol in A; see also
Methods). Excitatory actions (triangles) clearly prevailed over inhibitory effects
(circles), not only in the group II but also in the group III range. It is noteworthy,
however, that for individual cells the balance between excitation and inhibition was
not necessarily the same in the group II and group III range. Thus, group II
excitation could be accompanied by group III inhibition or vice versa, even with tests
from one and the same nerve (see Fig. 6, cells no. 73, 28 and 74).
Dynamic GS cells. Similar findings were obtained for these cells (Fig. 7), apart from
the virtually even balance between excitation (triangles) and inhibition (circles) in
both the group II range (Fig. 7A) and the group III range (Fig. 7B). Thus,
unambiguous group III effects were less frequent than established group II effects
(forty-nine observations in Fig. 7B, as opposed to seventy-two in Fig. 7A). Moreover,
inversion of reflex effects (group II responses compared with group III responses) were
also found, even with tests from the same muscle nerve. Thus group II excitation
could be contrasted by group III inhibition (see cells 32, 12, 33, and 124) or vice versa
(cells 61 and 70).

It should be noted that also for dynamic cells the number of negative observations (black squares)
were probably underestimated (see Methods: Establishment of lack of effects). This is particularly
prominent in Fig. 6 (dynamic p.b.s.t. y-cells). In Fig. 6A there would have been two more black
squares and in Fig. 6B fifteen more, if every 'pure' group III effect had been matched by a black
square in the group II part of the diagram and if every 'pure' group II effect had corresponded
to a 'lack of effect' in the group III part of the diagram. Obviously this would further crystallize
the differences between group II and group III effects on dynamic and static y-cells.
Other populations of y-cells. In the populations of p.b.s.t. and g.s. y-motoneurones which were not
further classified as dynamic or static, some of the general features found in the samples of classified
cells were re-encountered. Thus, excitatory as well as inhibitory responses were found on
stimulation of group III muscle fibres, group III effects were elicited from all hind-limb muscle
nerves and the cells tended to be rather specific recipients of either excitation or inhibition. As with
muscle group I, muscle group II, skin and joint fibre stimulation (muscle group I: see Appelberg
et al. 1983a, Figs. 3 and 5), the static a.b.s.m. y-motoneurones received inhibition preferentially
from muscle nerves stimulated within the group III range of intensities. The only conspicuous
feature among the small samples of d.p. and tibial neurones was, that the two tibial y-cells (1 D,
S) were massively excited from all muscle nerve group III inputs and from skin and joint nerves
as well.

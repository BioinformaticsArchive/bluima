Mammalian skeletal muscles are highly responsive
to chronic changes in neuromuscular activity levels,
such as changes in activation or mechanical loading
levels and patterns.14,15,37,41 For example, a chronic
increase in both the activation and loading levels
induced by the functional overloading of a muscle
via synergist removal results in an increase in muscle
fiber size, a shift toward “slower” physiological properties, and an enhancement of oxidative-related en-

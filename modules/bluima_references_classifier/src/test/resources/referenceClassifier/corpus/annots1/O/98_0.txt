finding that depressing synapses in the neocortex are actually
“tuned” to encode information at the spontaneous rates indicates that old notions of what is “noise” in brain activity may
have to be revised. Namely, that important information processing takes place during the spontaneous activity of cortical
networks (Arieli et al. 1996). However, the resolution of this
issue may have to wait for in vivo studies of synaptic transmission. As the optimal frequency for information encoding
via depressing synapses was found to be inversely proportional
to the time constant of recovery from depression, finding
similar time constants in vivo and in vitro would confirm our
suggestion. In contrast, finding significantly shorter time constants in vivo would imply higher optimal frequency and would
thus weaken our conjecture regarding the importance of the
spontaneous activity.
As a complementary issue, we also analyzed the dependence
of the encoded information on synaptic parameters for a fixed
presynaptic frequency. Important differences between the ef-fects of these parameters emerged. For the U parameter,

representing the probability of neurotransmitter release, we
found that optimal encoding always occurs at the highest
possible value, i.e., at U 1. On the other hand, for the time

constant underlying recovery from depression , intermedirec
ate values were found to maximize the information content.
The range of optimal values for , calculated for low prerec
synaptic frequency, was found to be in broad agreement with
experimental data. These results indicate that the exact value of
the usage parameter for a given synaptic connection is not
tuned to maximize the information coding. Rather, plasticity of
this parameter was found to occur on the basis of temporal
relationship between the activity of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in a Hebbian manner (Markram and Tsodyks 1996;
Markram et al. 1997b; Stevens and Wang 1994). On the other
hand, the recovery time constant may well be tuned to optimize
the information coding in a non-Hebbian manner, according to
the typical frequency of presynaptic neurons. We found an
inverse relationship between the optimal value of recovery
time constant and the usage parameter. This prediction could
be tested experimentally.
Finally, we analyzed the dependence of the information
coding on the number of synaptic release sites. As a general
rule, we found that increasing the number of release sites
always improves the information efficacy of the synapse by
reducing the trial-to-trial fluctuations of the responses. Indeed,
synaptic connections between pyramidal neurons usually have
several contacts, with nonuniform distribution of the number of
contacts that is biased toward higher values (Larkman et al.
1997; Markram et al. 1997a). We therefore suggest that not
only is the dynamic time constant adapted to optimize coding
of temporal information, but even the morphological properties
of synaptic connections may be determined according to principle of optimizing the information content of postsynaptic
responses.
Several interesting differences between depressing and fa-cilitating synapses have emerged from our analysis. In particular, facilitating synapses are tuned to significantly higher
frequencies, more reminiscent of the evoked activity of pyramidal cells. Facilitating synapses were also shown to code
information about longer spike patterns. Mathematically, both
of these properties of facilitating synapses result from the low
values of U parameter, i.e., low initial probability of release.

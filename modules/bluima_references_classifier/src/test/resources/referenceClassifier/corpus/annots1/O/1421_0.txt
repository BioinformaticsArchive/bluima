cells â€“ not PV-containing cells, because these do not
express CB1 receptors [38].
(4) GABAB receptors are synthesized in large numbers
in the somata of CCK-containing cells, but not in
PV-containing cells [45]. These receptors are likely to be
transported down to the axon terminals in a similar way to
CB1 receptors because presynaptic GABAB-mediated
inhibition of GABA release has been extensively documented [46]. However, its existence in CCK-positive cells
and absence in PV-positive cells has not been demonstrated yet by direct electrophysiological methods.

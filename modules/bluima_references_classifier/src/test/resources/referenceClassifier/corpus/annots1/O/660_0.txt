NO mediates NE stimulation of cGMP formation
in HYP–POA
Next, we investigated the role of NO in α1-adrenoceptor activation of cGMP synthesis. We hypothesize that, in EB plus
P-exposed slices, α1-adrenoceptor activation increases intracellular calcium via both the IP3 pathway and influx of extracellular
calcium. NO synthase is thus activated to enhance the production
of cGMP by soluble guanylyl cyclase. Two NO synthase inhibitors
were used to test this hypothesis: NAME and NOARG. Both
NAME and NOARG blocked NE-induced cGMP production
(Fig. 4) (F(3, 21) = 6.23; p < 0.05; n = 8). Furthermore, the two
drugs markedly reduced the basal content of cGM P. In fact, the
cGM P levels in some drug-treated slices were under the detection
limit of the assay.

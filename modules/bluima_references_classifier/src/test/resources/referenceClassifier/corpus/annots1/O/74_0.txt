Ca2 uncaging and imaging. A fast flash lamp
(Rapp Optoelectronic) was used to uncage
Ca 2 from DM-nitrophen (Schneggenburger
and Neher, 2000). The flash light intensity was
controlled by inserting neutral density filters
into the light path producing different postflash
amplitudes of [Ca 2 ] . Intracellular Ca 2 con- i

centration was measured using the ratiometric
Ca 2 indicator dye fura-2FF excited at 350 and
380 nm with a monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics), as previously described (Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000; Schneggenburger,
2005). Time series images were analyzed offline using TILLvision software with the background fluorescence of a small area next to the
calyx subtracted to obtain the backgroundcorrected fluorescence ratio (Grynkiewicz et al.,
1985). [Ca 2 ] was calculated on the basis of

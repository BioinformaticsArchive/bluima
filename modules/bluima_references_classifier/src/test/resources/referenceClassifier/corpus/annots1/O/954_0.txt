Materials and Methods
Generation of ChAT-EGFP transgenic mice. A transgene was constructed
by homologous recombination of a bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) containing the ChAT gene and used for pronucleus injection into
mouse zygotes for generating transgenic lines.
The CITB mouse BAC library (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was
screened for the ChAT gene by hybridization with an exon 14 –16-derived 275 bp probe generated by PCR with the following primers:
5 -primer (GGTCGGGTGGACAACATCAGA) and 3 -primer (CCTGGCTGGTGGAGAGAATA). Hybridizing BACs were further analyzed for
size after NotI digestion and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
(CHEF-DR III; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and for the extent of the 5 -flanking and 3 -flanking regions of the ChAT gene by Southern blots of
PFGE-resolved SacII-digested BAC DNA with suitable PCR-generated
probes (5 -primer CATAGGCTGATCTGTTCAGCCTGTCGCCTG and
3 -primer CTAAGTGCCTGTGGCCTTTACAACTGGAAA). Of the isolated BAC clones, clone 585J12 with an approximate size of 150 kb,
containing 50 kb upstream and 64 kb downstream of the ChAT gene,
was chosen for transgene construction. A targeting vector was constructed to introduce a cassette of the EGFP coding sequence fused to the
bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal into the ChAT gene on
BAC 585J12 such that the initiator methionine codon became the initiator codon for EGFP. The cassette was flanked by recombinogenic arms
(RAs) spanning 921 bp 5 and 472 bp 3 of the initiator codon, and
generated by PCR with primers 5 -primer1 (GGCTCTCGAGGGCTAATAAAG), 3 -primer1 (CTAGCGATTCTTAATCCAGAG), 5 -primer2
(ATGCCTATCCTGGAAAAGGT), and 3 -primer1 (TATCCTGATTGTTCCTCTAAA). The EGFP coding cassette and RAs were assembled
by standard cloning techniques, and the correct sequence assembly was
cloned into the SalI site of the pSV1recA shuttle vector. For homologous
recombination of the targeting cassette into BAC clone 585J12, cointegrates were generated by transforming 585J12-containing DH10B cells
with pSV1.RecA-5 3 RA-EGFP DNA. Cointegration and resolution
steps were as described previously (Yang et al., 1997). The modified BAC
DNA separated from bacterial genomic DNA by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation was released from the vector by NotI digestion
and isolated by Sepharose column chromatography with column fractions analyzed by PFGE.
Purified, linearized BAC DNA (0.7 g/ml) was microinjected into
B6D2F2 mouse zygotes. Tail DNA of founders served to test the presence
of the EGFP cDNA and integrity of the integrated BAC DNA using the
following primers: 5 -primer1 (TAACTATGCGGCATCAGAGC), 3 -primer1 (GCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAG), 5 -primer2 (GTGTCACCTAAATAGCTTGGCG), and 5 -primer2 (GGGGTTCGCGTTGGCCGATTC). Copy numbers of the integrated transgene were determined
via Southern blot after HindIII digestion of genomic DNA and hybridization with a 5 recombinogenic arm probe. Of four founders with the
integrated BAC containing both vector arms, a line with multiple copy
integration was selected for additional analysis. Breeding transgenic with
C57BL/6 mice produced wild-type and transgenic mice at Mendelian
ratios. The EGFP expression pattern was analyzed in transgenic mice,
starting with the F2 generation.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on 30 –100 m free-floating sections obtained from perfused
brains of postnatal day 25 (P25) to P35 mice [4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA)/PBS, pH 7.4]. For colocalization studies of ChAT and EGFP im-munohistochemistry in the cortex, 250- m-thick transverse slices were

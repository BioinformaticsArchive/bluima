and dendritic arbors and rarely send apical dendrites higher than
the bottom of layer 3 (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979; Lund et al., 1979;
Ferrer et al., 1986a,b; Katz, 1987; Lund, 1988; Usrey and Fitzpatrick,
1996; Wiser and Callaway, 1996; Zhang and Deschenes, 1997; Hirsch
et al., 1998; Prieto and Winer, 1999; Bannister et al., 2002; Brumberg
et al., 2003; Douglas and Martin, 2004; Zarrinpar and Callaway,
2006). This projection pattern is established early in development
(Callaway and Lieber, 1996). Tall and/or horizontally projecting
pyramidal neurons often have apical dendrites extending up to
layer 1, but usually restrict the majority of apical dendritic branches
to layer 5. Often tall pyramidal neurons also display long laterally projecting axons that terminate in layers 6 or 5, giving rise
to the name `horizontal' or `lateral' cells (Lund et al., 1979; Ferrer
et al., 1986a,b; Katz, 1987; Lund, 1988; Usrey and Fitzpatrick, 1996;
Wiser and Callaway, 1996; Zhang and Deschenes, 1997; Hirsch et al.,
1998; Prieto and Winer, 1999; Bannister et al., 2002; Douglas and
Martin, 2004; Zarrinpar and Callaway, 2006). Within these two
pyramidal cell classes there are often a number of distinct variations (Lund, 1988; Wiser and Callaway, 1996; Zhang and Deschenes,
1997; Prieto and Winer, 1999; Brumberg et al., 2003; Zarrinpar
and Callaway, 2006). In primate primary visual cortex, for example, there are at least 8 different types of pyramidal neuron (5 cell
types display short pyramidal morphology and 3 cell types display

Introduction
The expression of ligand-gated ion channels on axons near presynaptic sites of release provides a direct signaling pathway to
locally modulate the strength of synaptic transmission between
neurons independent of the somatodendritic compartment
(MacDermott et al., 1999; Engelman and MacDermott, 2004).
The regulatory action of presynaptic receptor signaling often af-fects Ca 2 influx at the site of release (Zucker and Regehr, 2002).
Of particular interest, then, are axonal receptors that are Ca 2
permeable, such as NMDA receptors (NMDARs), because their
influence on neurotransmitter release could be independent of
any secondary or indirect signaling mechanism (Corlew et al.,
2008). In fact, NMDAR activation alters transmitter release in
a number of neuron types arguing for an axonal localization
(Corlew et al., 2008). Yet, a search for direct NMDAR-mediated
Ca 2 entry in cerebellar stellate cell axons failed to reveal functional channels (Christie and Jahr, 2008) despite NMDARdependent facilitation of release (Glitsch and Marty, 1999;
Duguid and Smart, 2004; Glitsch 2008). Instead, dendritic
NMDARs were found to depolarize the axon and allow Ca 2
influx through voltage-sensitive Ca 2 channels (VSCCs), consistent with an emerging view that somatodendritic electrical signaling alters axonal release (Alle and Geiger, 2006; Shu et al., 2006;
Kole et al., 2007). Whether NMDARs can be directly detected in
axons of other cell types has not been explored.

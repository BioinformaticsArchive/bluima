density and aspreviously reported (Woolley et al., 1990),apical
dendritic spinedensity on Golgi-impregnated CA1 pyramidal
cells decreasedby approximately 23% between the proestrus
and the estrusphasesof the cycle (T = 3.412, p < 0.02; Table
2). In eachof the three experiments, virtually all identified synapsesthat appearedto be on dendritic spineswereasymmetric,
while virtually all thoseobservedon dendritic shaftswereeither
clearly symmetric or not easily classifiedas belongingto either
class.This relationship did not appearto bealtered by estradiol
treatment or during the estrouscycle.

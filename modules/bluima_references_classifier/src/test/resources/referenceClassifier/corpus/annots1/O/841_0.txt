Figure 2. Synaptic potentiation induced by repetitive presynaptic stimulation with “positively correlated postsynaptic spiking.” A, Results ob-tained from a pair of glutamatergic neurons in hippocampal culture. Data
points depict the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSC s induced by test
stimuli (0.03 Hz, Vc = -70 mV) before and after repetitive stimulation of
the presynaptic neuron (60 pulses at 1 Hz, marked by the thick arrow),
with both neurons held in current clamp. Traces of EPSC s (average of
5–10 consecutive events) 5 min before (lef t) and 20 min after (right) the
repetitive stimulation are shown above, with the 5 min trace (dashed line)
superimposed onto the latter. Arrowheads mark the EPSC s being studied.
* indicates a polysynaptic EPSC. The EPSP (with its onset time marked
by the thin arrow) and the spike recorded during one cycle of the
repetitive stimulation are depicted by the middle trace above. Note that

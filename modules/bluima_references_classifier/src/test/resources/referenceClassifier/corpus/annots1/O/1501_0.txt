AFixgounrse, d5endrites and synapse probabilities
Axons, dendrites and synapse probabilities. (a) Histograms summarise dorso-ventral distribution of cell bodies, dendrites and
axons of different neuron types in 10% bins where 0% is ventral and 100% dorsal edge of spinal cord. Distributions are
expressed as the probability that a neuron will have a soma or dendrite in a particular dorso-ventral position. Axon distributions are expressed as the probability that a 50 Î¼m segment of the axon from each type of neuron will lie in a particular dorsoventral position. (b) Plot of synapse probability from recordings versus contact probability from anatomy for cases in bold in
Table 2. Highest point (RB-dlc) was omitted in calculating regression.

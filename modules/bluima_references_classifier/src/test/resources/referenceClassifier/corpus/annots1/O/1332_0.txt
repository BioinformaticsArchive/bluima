Figure 3. Antidromically activated FPP-like potentials. A, Low intensity antidromic stimulation (arrow) produced a small, fast, all-or-none potential, while slightly higher intensity
stimulation produced a full action potential. B, Antidromic stimulation (arrow) produced a
FPP-like depolarization, which was blocked by a preceding orthodromically propagating
action potential elicited by an intracellular current pulse.A 10mV x 5 mseccalibration pulse
is shown at the beginning of each voltage trace. The lower traces monitor the current
injected, a 5 n4 x 3 msecdepolarizingpulseis shownin B. In eachrecording, a 0.5-nA current

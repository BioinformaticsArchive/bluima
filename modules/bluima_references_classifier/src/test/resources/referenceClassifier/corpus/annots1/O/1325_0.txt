Influence of grid deformations on the concentration profile
Modifications of the Delaunay mesh have dramatic effects on the dual
graph that we use to numerically solve diffusion. Thus we needed to
incorporate a mechanism to automatically redistribute the different
quantities of substances after each operation on the triangulation
(physical object displacement, duplication or removal). The two
major requirements are to preserve the concentration profiles, and to
ensure mass conservation. Consider the case where the Delaunay vertex at position x moves. If we didn't update the quantity of substance
i

located inside the surrounding volume, moving the point would
result in substance transport. Our update mechanism consists of two
phases: first we interpolate the concentration u′ of the chemical at
i

the new location x′ of the moving vertex, and modify the quantity in
i

the newly formed volume V ′to obtain this desired concentration, i.e.
i

define new Q′ so that Q′/V ′ = u′. Then we compensate for total mass
i iii
conservation by multiplying the concentrations and the quantities
in the surrounding volumes by the ratio between the total quantities
before and after the displacement. Similar update mechanisms are
used for vertex insertion or removal.
The procedure is tested in our bench test by moving three inner
vertices 100 times (Figure 3F). The displacement is a random 3D
vector of less than 5 μm, with a re-centering mechanism to ensure
that the points stay inside the convex hull of all other points. This
minimally disruptive procedure allows for gradient ascent even in the
extreme case where all physical objects are moving (Figure 3G).

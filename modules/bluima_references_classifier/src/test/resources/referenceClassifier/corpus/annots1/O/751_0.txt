Figure 5. Rapid and efective activation of
C a 2 currents during AP waveforms. A, An
AP waveform applied as a voltage-clamp
command (top trace) instead of a rectangular
voltage pulse evoked a transient C a 2 in-ward current in an M FB (bottom trace). The
orthodromically propagated AP was previously recorded from a diferent M FB. B, For
a 5 msec prepulse period the command voltage was digitally set to 40 mV, which
evoked a slightly larger C a 2 peak current
(continuous line) as compared with control
(dashed line). C, An AP recorded from an
M FB (dashed line) and a much slower so-matic AP waveform (continuous line) evoked
C a 2 currents with diferent amplitudes and
time courses (bottom traces). Both somatic
and M FB AP were evoked by direct current
injection. D, The amplitude and halfduration of currents evoked by diferent AP
waveforms are shown. The peak current was
normalized to the maximal current amplitude of the I–V relationship (at 0 mV) in the
same boutons (corresponding to 100%). The
bar graph summarizes data from M FB AP
experiments (n 24), prepulse experiments
(2–5 msec; n 9), and soma AP experiments
(n 5); in all cases the waveforms were
applied to MFBs.

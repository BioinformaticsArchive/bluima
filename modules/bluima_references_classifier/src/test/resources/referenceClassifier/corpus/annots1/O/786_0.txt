differentiation of cortical progenitors in vitro have suggested
that these cells generate interneurons in culture and in numbers
that bear a close resemblance to the percentage of interneurons
seen in vivo (Gotz et al., 1995). However, an analysis of the
phenotypes of lacZ chimeric mice has suggested that neocortical
progenitors produce primarily or exclusively projection neurons
in vivo (Tan et al., 1998). We attempted to resolve this issue by
making focal injections of [3H]thymidine into the cortical
proliferative zone of neonates and assessing the fates of labeled
neurons in the mature cortex 6 weeks later. As expected from
previous birthdating studies (McConnell, 1988; Jackson et al.,
1989), cells labeled by these injections migrated primarily into
layers II and II. Roughly two-thirds of the [3H]thymidine-labeled
cells could be immunostained with antibodies that recognize
GluR2/3 or CaMKII, markers of cortical projection neurons.
In contrast, ver y few (<5%) of these cells labeled with the
interneuron markers GABA or GAD67. Our control experiments
showed that ∼20% of the neurons generated on P1 from all spatial
origins differentiate into GABAergic neurons; thus, the production of interneurons in the cortex accounts at best for only a
small fraction of the interneurons present at maturity.
Due to high levels of background staining of the tissue with
the GABA antibodies, it was difficult to determine whether our
results indicate that no cortical interneurons derive from the
cortical PZ, or whether a small population in fact does. We
believe that the former possibility is more likely, for several
reasons. First, experiments in which background staining
was low gave rise to ver y small numbers of cortically derived
neurons that co-labeled as interneurons. For example, only 4/782
[3H]thymidine-labeled cells were immunolabeled for GA D67 in
the rostral cortex injection (Table 1). Second, recent evidence
suggests that most cortical pyramidal neurons also express low
levels of GA BA (Hill et al., 2001), thus raising the possibility that
weak GABA labeling detected in some cortically derived cells in
this study may be corroborating this result. Third, although a
subpopulation of GE-derived cortical neurons labeled with the
interneuron markers parvalbumin, calbindin, or somatostatin
(23, 17 and 6%, respectively; Table 1), virtually none of these
markers labeled cortical neurons derived from either the rostral
or cortical injections. However, since putative cortically derived
interneurons may comprise a set of subtypes distinct from those
from the GE and since the rodent cortical neuroepithelium
has the potential to generate GA BAergic cells in vitro (Gotz
et al., 1995; He et al., 2001), the question of whether a small
population of cortical interneurons is cortically derived remains
unsettled. In addition, this study covers only a limited period of
neurogenesis, thus leaving open the possibility that cortically
derived cortical interneurons may be generated at a different time.
Two recent studies using mouse strains that permit fate
mapping from distinct progenitor regions also support the
notion that few cortical interneurons derive from the cortical PZ.
The first of these studies used mice expressing the cre recombinase under control of the cortex-specific Emx1 promoter
(Gulisano et al., 1996; Iwasato et al, 2000), which were crossed
with reporter mice carrying an inactive, `floxed' form of the
lacZ gene (Iwasato et al., 2000). In these animals, the βgalactosidase-labeled cells expressed the expected markers of
pyramidal neurons, but did not express GABA. Similar results
have been obtained with another Emx1-Cre mouse line
(K. Jones, personal communication). The second study utilized
mice harboring a transgene containing an enhancer from the
Dlx5/6 locus driving expression of β-galactosidase (Stuhmer et
al., 2002), which results in β-galactosidase expression by most
GA BAergic neurons of the forebrain, including embr yonic and

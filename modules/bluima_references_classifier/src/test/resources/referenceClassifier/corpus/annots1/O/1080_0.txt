Figure 3. Sequence of antidromic action-potential
(AP) invasion of initial segment (IS) and soma. Dualrecording electrode positions are as in Figure 1. Waveforms are individual sweeps. Antidromic (1st), Left
column shows response to a single antidromic AP.
Antidromic (2nd), Right column is the response to the
second of a pair of antidromic APs. Soma Vm, Membrane potential recorded through the somatic wholecell electrode. Soma dVm/dt, Time derivative of the
somatic membrane potential. IS patch, Cell-attached
patch recording in the IS. The current recorded is
primarily capacitive and, thus, is proportional to the
time derivative of the transmembrane potential of the
patch. IS patch (failures), Cell-attached recordings in
the IS, in which the second antidromic action potential
failed to invade the soma. P1 corresponds to the peak
in the response attributable to charging of the patch by
channels in the IS. P2 corresponds to the charging of
the patch by somatic Na+ channels, which does not
occur when the second somatic AP fails. See text for
details. RMP, -63 mV. Cell c95066a.

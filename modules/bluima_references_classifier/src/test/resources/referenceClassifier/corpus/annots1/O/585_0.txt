Multiple Upstream ORFs in the Human and Mouse Estrogen
Receptor 5 -UTRsâ€”In the following text, ER mRNA variants are designated by their capital letter, and the uAUGs and
uORFs are designated by their distal position from the 5 -end
of the mRNA. The 5 -UTRs of major human and mouse ER
mRNA variants used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1. The
lengths of the 5 -UTR variants are between 189 (human C) and
327 nucleotides (human F). Sequence analysis revealed the
presence of AUGs and associated ORFs upstream of the main
ORF translation start site in all variants. The numbers of
uAUGs are: one in human A and E and mouse C, two in human
C, four in human F, five in mouse F, and six in human T. The
mouse F uAUG-4 has the most favorable Kozak context for
translation initiation ((A/G)CCAUGG, Ref. 24) having an A at
position 3 and G at position 4. The other uAUGs are in a
similar or a less favorable translation initiation context compared with the two initiation AUGs of the main ORF. The
length of the associated uORFs varies from a single codon
(human E, F4, and T1) to 111 codons (human T4). The human
C2, T4, T5, and T6 uORFs extend beyond the initiation AUG
into the ER ORF.
The human A 5 -UTR (the most GC-rich 5 -UTR, 72% GC)
has the most stable secondary structure, as predicted by Mfold
version 3.12 (28), with a Gibbs free energy G 114.98
kcal/mol and the most stable individual hairpin with a G of
only 17.7 kcal/mol. The most stable hairpin was identified in
the human F 5 -UTR with G 20.6 kcal/mol. Secondary

4 cells converging on each layer 3 target, while each layer 4 spiny
cell is calculated to contact and to be contacted by 200 other layer 4
spiny neurones. The relatively sparse projection from layer 4 to layer 6
appears to originate more with pyramidal cells than with spiny stellate cells
(unpublished).

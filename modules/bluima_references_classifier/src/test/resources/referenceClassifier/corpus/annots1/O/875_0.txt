The molecular analysis of the mRNAs contained in single
cells was specific to the AMPA receptor since the sizes of the
amplified fragments corresponded to those predicted for
GluR14 flip or flop cDNAs, the restriction digest generated
fragments of the predicted size, and all of these fragments
were labeled by their corresponding GluR14-specific probe.
Comparisons between glial cells and Purkinje cells show
that the analysis of the mRNAs detected in single cells is celltype specific. Purkinje cells, responsive to quisqualate and
kainate, were found to express AMPA receptor mRNAs but
not the GFAP encoding mRNA that is glial specific. In glial
cells, which indeed were found to express the GFAP mRNA,
the absence of quisqualate and kainate responses was correlated with the absence of detectable GluRl-4 mRNAs.
Therefore, the amplified product is not derived from genomic
DNA and no contamination by exogenous GluR1-4 mRNA
or cDNA occurred during single-cell analysis.
The detection of a given GluR14-amplified fragment
thus implies the presence of its corresponding mRNA in the
single cell analyzed. Conversely, the absence of a given
GluR14 fragment in the amplification product was related
to the cell specificity of the AMPA receptor subunit composition rather than to a failure of the amplification reaction.
Indeed, whereas the subset of subunits detected in Purkinje
cells was rather constant, a completely different subunit composition was found for the AMPA receptor of granule cells
(Lambolez et al., 1992).

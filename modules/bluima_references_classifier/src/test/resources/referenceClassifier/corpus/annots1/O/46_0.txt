Figure 4. Prediction of the allosteric kinetics of NMDARs. A, Schematic (top) and detailed mechanism (bottom) of the allosteric kinetics of NMDARs. and were the time constants of

Ca 2 CaM binding to glutamate (Glu)-unbound and Glu-bound NMDARs, respectively, where Ca 2 CaM concentration is 1 M. Ca 2 CaM bound and Ca 2 CaM unbound NMDARs, which
bind to Glu, show the low and high open probability, respectively (Ehlers et al., 1996; Rycroft and Gibb, 2002, 2004b). C , C , C , C , C CaM, C CaM, C CaM, and C CaM are the concentrations
01230 1 2 3
of closed-state NMDARs, and O and O CaM are those of open-state NMDARs (bottom). CaM represents 2 Ca 2 CaM or 3 Ca 2 CaM, and the numerals on arrows are rate constants in
M 1s 1 or s 1, which were set on the basis of the experimental observation (bottom). The complete description of the allosteric kinetics of NMDARs is provided on-line (available at

allosteric model. One hundred pairings of the prespiking and postspiking with 1 Hz were given. E, Spike timing-dependent synaptic conductance in the allosteric model at 2 min (Obs 1) and 60 min
(Obs 2) after the onset of stimulation (left). The apparent time constants for LTP and LTD at 2 min were 36.1 and 53.0 ms, respectively. The synaptic conductance with 100 prespikes and postspikes
alone at 2 min (black) and 60 min (gray) after the onset of stimulation is also plotted (right, bars). F, Integrated PKA activity (normalized by 3.06) and final CaMKII activity. G, Integrated PP1 activity
(normalized by 0.34) and integrated CaN activity (normalized by 1.53).

Cell Type- and Location-Specific Thalamocortical
Connectivity in a Barrel Column
In the neocortex, synapses of excitatory neurons are associated
with en passant or terminaux boutons (De Paola et al. 2006).
Thus, for the present study, axonal length and bouton
measurements were regarded as predictive of thalamocortical
connectivity (Peters 1979). Using a recently reported tool

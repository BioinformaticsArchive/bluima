potentials initiated during the critical time window after synaptic
activation but before the dissociation of glutamate from the
NMDA channel will lead to the opening of the channel (by
removing the Mg 2+ block) and a localized surge of cytoplasmic
Ca2+ (Connor et al., 1994). This NMDA receptor-mediated
Ca2+ influx may also act cooperatively with Ca2+ influx through
the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to induce synaptic potentiation (Eilers et al., 1995; Yuste and Denk, 1995; Magee and
Johnston, 1997). The finding of a reduced extent of synaptic
potentiation in the presence of L-type Ca2+ channel blocker is
consistent with the latter findings. Although the off-rate of glutamate from the NMDA receptor is much longer than 20 msec,
the requirement of multiple Ca2+ binding in the activation of
downstream effector molecules (e.g., calmodulin) could potentially sharpen the time window of synaptic modification. Alternatively, the dendritically expressed transient A-type K + channels
that can be inactivated by subthreshold EPSPs may also play a
role by limiting the back-propagation of dendritic action potentials initiated outside the potentiation window (Hoffman et al.,
1997). In the case of negatively correlated spiking, spike-induced
C a 2+ elevation attributable to opening of C a 2+ channels before
synaptic activation followed by a low-level Ca2+ elevation attributable to subthreshold synaptic activation may be responsible for
the induction of synaptic depression. Indeed, blocking L-type
Ca2+ channels abolished the induction of LTD (Fig. 8). Interestingly, binding of glutamate to NMDA receptors is also required
for the induction of LTD, although the membrane potential
remained at a relatively negative level after the spike. Taken
together, our results are consistent with the notion that spatial –
temporal patterns of postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation are critical for
the induction of synaptic changes (Lisman, 1989; Malenka et al.,
1992; Neveu and Zucker, 1996). Finally, we noted that there was
a conspicuous absence of short-term potentiation or depression in
the present study. This can be accounted for by our use of
low-frequency stimulation, because short-term potentiation or
depression is known to result from changes in the presynaptic
transmitter supply after high-frequency stimulation (Zucker et
al., 1991).
The dependence of synaptic modifications on postsynaptic cell
type has been observed in the Schaffer collateral (McMahon and
Kauer, 1997) and the mossy fiber pathways (Maccaferri et al.,
1998) in hippocampal slices. In both studies, the standard protocol of high-frequency stimulation that normally induces LTP at
synapses onto pyramidal cells either had no effect or resulted in
persistent depression of synapses onto interneurons. Our results
showed that not only the induction of LTP is target-cell specific;
similar target specificity also exists for the induction of LTD. The
target specificity could result from differences in the postsynaptic
molecular machinery underlying synaptic modifications. For ex-ample, both the α isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II α) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) appear to be absent in the
postsynaptic densities of glutamatergic inputs onto GABAergic
neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Stevens et al.,
1994; Liu and Jones, 1996, 1997; S ́ık et al., 1998). Interestingly, in
parallel fiber synapses in the cerebellum-like electrosensory lobe
of the mormyrid electric fish, where postsynaptic targets are
GABAergic Purkinje-like cells, synaptic modifications can still be
induced. However, the dependence on the temporal order of
correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes is opposite to that
reported here (Bell et al., 1997).
The general notion that correlated presynaptic and postsynap-

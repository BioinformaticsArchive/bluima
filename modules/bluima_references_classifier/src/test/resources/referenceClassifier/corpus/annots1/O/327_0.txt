silico synaptic response properties recorded at the soma
of the modelled neurons against in vitro measurements
reported in Markram et al. (1997) as the biological
benchmark (see Methods). To assess the impact of the
anatomical and physiological factors determining the
efficacy of model synaptic connections, we investigated the
sensitivity of synaptic response properties to perturbations
in a range of parameters, including axonal conduction
delays, location and conductance of synaptic contacts, and
the morphological diversity of TTL5 neurons.

ment. Amplification of β-actin in the pooled samples showed no change
in the amount of PCR product.
The primers (forward and backward primers, respectively) used for
PCR for the β-actin mRNA were 5'-ccttcctgggcatggagtcctg-3' and 5'-ggagcaatgatcttgatcttc-3' (Colotta et al., 1992); for the NGF mRNA, they
were 5'-ggcaagtcagcctcttcttgcagcc-3' and 5'-gtaatgtccatgttgttctacactctg-3'; and for the NT-3 mRNA, they were 5'-gcagagcataagagtcaccg-3' and
5'-ccgatttttcttgacaaggc-3' (Maisonpierre et al., 1991). Several technical
factors can affect the amplification result by PCR. In the preliminary
studies, we found that the optimal conditions for PCR amplification were
10 pmol of primers, 2– 6 mM Mg 2+ in the reaction solution, and an
annealing temperature of 55°C. In addition, we found that the PCR
product from the 3 μl cDNA sample increased linearly with increasing
numbers of cycles from 18 to 32. We used 24 cycles for the β-actin and
28 cycles for NTG amplification. For quantitative purposes, one of the
primers was 5' end-labeled with [g-32P]ATP, and PCR amplification was
performed for 18 cycles. Finally, the PCR products of the β-actin, NGF,
and NT-3 genes were gel-purified, and their sequences were determined
diagnostically. We found that each PCR product contained its target
sequence. Moreover, the primers specifically amplified the target cDNA,
even in the presence of other cDNA that may share partial homology to
the target gene under the PCR conditions we used.
For PCR, the 39 μl reaction mixture containing 3 μl of cDNA and 20
pmol of primers was heated at 95°C for 5 min and then cooled to 65°C.
An 11 μl mixture that contained dNTPs, buffer, and 1.5 U of Taq
polymerase was added to the reaction, which was in a thermocycler block
at 65°C (Perkin-Elmer, Emeryville, CA). Amplification was performed
for no more than 30 cycles at 94°C for 45 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C
for 1 min and 30 sec. The reaction was terminated by a 10 min extension
at 70°C. Ten microliters of each amplification reaction were resolved on
a 2% agarose gel or a 6% PAGE.

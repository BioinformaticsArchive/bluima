Discussion
An important question in the study of neuron differentiation is how much of a given cell's shape and function
is determined genetically or is “context-independent”
and how much is determined by interactions with the
cellular environment or is “context-dependent.” The
classification scheme proposed here relies heavily on the
number and distribution of initial processes around the
perikaryon to distinguish bitufted cells from multipolar
or pyramidal neurons. These features, the number and
arrangement of processes about the cell body, are likely
to be context-independent properties of cell morphology
that can be preserved during in vitro development. Even
in neuroblastoma cell cultures where cell shape is highly
variable, the morphologies of mitotically related cells are
strikingly similar in neurite number, position, length,
and branching pattern (Solomon, 1981). Observations of
cortical pyramidal neurons in situ support the suggestion

hyperpolarize large cells in layers II/III, whose axonal
arbors are horizontally wide, do not enter layer I, and
do not make basket terminals (Fig. 5D). Following sufficient depolarization by muscarine in the solution containing tetorodotoxin, somatostatin Martinotti cells in
layers II/III start slow rhythmic depolarizations, each
of which further consists of 3 to 7 Hz periodical depolarizations (Fig. 6B) (Beierlein et al., 2000). These are considered to correspond to the cholinergic slow rhythm
of IPSCs.

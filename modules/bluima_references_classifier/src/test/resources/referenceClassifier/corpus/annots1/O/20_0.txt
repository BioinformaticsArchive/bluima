two populations of synapses (Fig. 1 B, C). The total charge integral of Ca 2 current evoked by either waveform was not different
between the two age groups (APM, 193 24 vs 230 41 pA ms;
API, 549 18 vs 555 52 pA ms for P8 –P12 and P16 –P18
group, respectively) (Fig. 1 D). Surprisingly, P8 –P12 calyces usually failed to release glutamate in response to APM (no detectable
EPSCs in 13 of 15 calyces) (Fig. 1 B, right), whereas P16 –P18
calyces (eight of eight calyces) released consistently with either
voltage paradigm, of which API produced greater EPSC than
APM, as expected (Fig. 1C). These observations raised the possibility that the coupling of VGCCs to vesicular release is fundamentally different in the two age groups of synapses.

stimulation elicits paired-pulse facilitation that is knocked out
in the presence of iGluR antagonists. A slow and sustained
response is induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation.
Note that this stimulation elicits a hyperpolarizing response
(Fig. 4G-I). Bath application of ACPD also leads to a long
sustained hyperpolarizing response (Fig. 4J). Switching to high-2+ 2+
Mg /low-Ca ACSF and iGluR antagonists, the neuron continues to respond with hyperpolarization in the presence ACPD
(Fig. 4K). With the addition of MCCG, a Group II mGluR
antagonist, to the bath, the cell no longer responds to ACPD
(Fig. 4L). Although this approach does not absolutely guarantee
that the mGluRs evoked with electrical stimulation are the
same as evoked with ACPD when synaptic transmission is
blocked, it strongly supports that conclusion (Lee and Sherman
2009a, 2009b).
The population data revealed that both Class 1B and Class 2
responses were activated in a graded fashion, meaning that the
evoked EPSP amplitude exhibited a positive monotonic re-lationship with the amount of current used for stimulation (Fig.
5A). To assess if there was a difference in EPSP amplitude

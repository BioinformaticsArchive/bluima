sal root) and motor axon collaterals (ventral root) could initiate
local onset epileptiform bursting episodes that would have otherwise begun at more distant foci (Fig. 3D). This suggests that
afferents and motor axon collaterals converge onto common ex-citatory pathways. Thus, in the absence of spinal inhibition, re-current motor axon collaterals can feedback onto excitatory
pathways across multiple spinal segments, but this pathway ap-pears to be commonly inaccessible in our preparation. Indeed, in
two of three experiments in which bursting was entrained by
ventral root stimulation, the ability to entrain activity was lost
over time, suggesting a transient access or fatigable circuitry. Be-cause spontaneous bursting could be entrained by dorsal root
stimuli in 6 of 10 experiments in which ventral root stimuli could
not entrain bursts, the ventral root excitatory pathway is clearly
not necessary for spontaneous bursting to occur (cf. Bracci et al.,
1997). Importantly, in some cases, ventral root stimulation could
not entrain spontaneous bursting yet evoked ventral root re-flexes (n 3), demonstrating that access to at least some of the
interneuronal circuitries involved in spontaneous bursting
can be independent of those producing recurrent excitation.

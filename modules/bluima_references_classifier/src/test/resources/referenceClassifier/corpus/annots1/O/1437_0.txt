Figure 4. Slit–Robo guidance systems in other Drosophila neurons. Slit is provided by midline cells. Neurons use Robo and Robo3 (Slit receptors) to position their axons
and dendrites within the CNS. (a–c) Robo3 is required to position the axon terminals from PNS neurons in the CNS neuropil [23]. In wild-type flies, the dorsal bipolar dendritic (dbd, yellow) and chordotonal (ch, pink) mechanosensory neurons target their axon terminals to different positions within the CNS neuropil (a). The neuropil partially
overlaps with the dendrites of motoneurons [gray neuron in (a)]. Only the ch neuron normally expresses a detectable amount of Robo3 [23]. When robo3 is disrupted, the
ch axon shifts its axon terminal towards the midline (b). This phenotype can be reverted to wild type when wild-type robo3 is re-supplied to sensory neurons [23]; when the
robo3 transgene is overexpressed in the dbd neuron, the axon shifts (arrow) its terminal laterally (c). (d–f) Robo overexpression cell-autonomously causes axonal and dendritic misguidance in adult CNS neurons [22]. In wild-type flies, a direct monosynaptic connection is formed between the giant fiber (GF) interneuron (purple) and the tergotrochantral motoneuron (TTMn; orange) on each side of the CNS midline (d). Stimulation in the brain, where the GF cell body resides, results in a consistent excitatory
postsynaptic potential in the muscle that the TTMn motoneuron innervates. When the wild-type robo transgene is overexpressed in the TTMn, its dendrite shifts away from
the midline (arrow, e). The GF-to-TTMn synaptic transmission is weakened. When the robo transgene is overexpressed in both the GF interneuron and TTMn, the synaptic
transmission partially recovers and the GF axon shifts laterally (arrow, f). All four neurons shown in this figure are bilaterally paired.

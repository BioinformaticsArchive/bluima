spot found after phosphatase treatment is the IC74-2B
polypeptide. Therefore, the phospho-intermediate chain
isoforms are resolved in the remaining spots from the
samples that were not treated with phosphatase. Quantitation of the relative spot intensities of dynein intermediate
chain isoforms from the various dynein samples provides
an accurate analysis of the extent of change in dynein
intermediate chain isoform upon growth factor treatment
(Fig. 6). Phosphatase treatment of dynein from control
cells, grown in the absence of NGF, showed that ;20% of
the intermediate chain was the IC74-2B variant, and that
;80% of the intermediate chain was the IC74-2C
polypeptide, and that ;35% of the IC74-2C was phosphorylated. After the addition of NGF to the cultures,
there was a major shift in the expression of the intermediate chain polypeptides. Greater than 80% of the intermediate chain was the IC74-2B polypeptide and almost
two-thirds of the IC74-2C was phosphorylated. SDSPAGE analysis of the in vivo phosphorylation of dynein
intermediate chains from cells grown with NGF, demonstrates that phospho-isoforms are found in the three slowest migrating bands (not shown). Comparison of the in-termediate chain isoform patterns observed in the two gel
systems indicates that the slowest migrating band observed
in SDS-PAGE corresponds to the diffuse spot or “tail”
seen on two dimensional gels and is the result of hyperphosphorylation of one of the intermediate chain polypeptides.
To analyze the expression of intermediate chain
mRNA in control and differentiated PC12 cells, RT-PCR was used (Fig. 7). In control cells grown without
growth factor, the major mRNA was IC74-2C; the ubiquitous isoform. There was also a small amount of IC74-2B. After cells were grown for 4 days with NGF however,
the major mRNA was IC74-2B. A small amount of
IC74-2C mRNA was also detected, although it did not
reproduce well in the figure. In addition, after 4 days of
NGF treatment, a neuron specific mRNA, IC74-1A, was
detected. After 7 days of growth factor treatment IC74-2B, -2C, -1A and 1B mRNAs were observed. This progression of mRNA transcription, from IC74-2C to
IC74-2B and adding IC74-1A and -1B, parallels the progression observed during rat brain development (Pfister et
al., 1996a).

Thalamocortical Inputs
The afferent input to neocortex that has probably been the most
thoroughly studied to date is that from the thalamus; this is partly
because many studies have focused on primary sensory regions
of neocortex. Although this review does not attempt to describe
the many afferent systems, the complexity of the arrangement of
thalamocortical inputs, particularly in species such as primates,
where the sublaminae are clearly identifiable, indicates that the
postsynaptic targets for each of these parallel ascending systems,
carrying separate, but correlated information streams, may be
different. One way in which the primate thalamus can be
envisaged, which solves a number of previous apparent inconsistencies, is as a continuous matrix of calbindin-containing
neurons within which regions or cores rich in parvalbumincontaining cells can be found, particularly in sensory and motor
nuclei [for a review, see Jones (Jones, 2001)]. Nuclei rich in
parvalbumin-containing `cores' are the so-called `specific'
thalamic nuclei, relaying precise sensory information about one
sensory modality to a specific region of neocortex and preser ving, for example, retinotopic or somatotopic segregation.
Nuclei with few or no parvalbumin-containing neurons are often
termed `non-specific' nuclei receiving more diffuse inputs
and whose cortical projections do not respect areal boundaries.
For example, while dorsal LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus)
parvalbumin-containing `core' cells project only to V1, the
calbindin-containing `matrix' cells of the LGN project to V1, V2
and beyond. Parvalbumin-containing cells project to the middle
layers (layers 3 and 4) and to layer 6, while the calbindincontaining cells project primarily to layer 1 and to a lesser degree
to layer 3. In the LGN, par valbumin-containing cells are concentrated in the six principal par vocellular and magnocellular
layers, while calbindin cells are concentrated in the s laminae
and interlaminar plexuses and project to layer 1 (especially from
layer K1) and to layer 3 in cytochrome oxidase rich blobs
(especially from layer K3) (Ding and Casagrande, 1997). In the
ventral posterior complex of the thalamus, only the VPM and

FIG . 5. Simulation of a similar experiment as depicted
in Fig. 2. MN used for simulation is illustrated in the inset
of Fig. 5C . The following passive membrane properties
apply: Rm  17 kVcm2 , Ri  150 Vcm, Cm  1.0 mF /
cm2 . At each compartment an a-synapse was simulated
and the resulting EPSP amplitude and time to peak ( ttp )
measured simultaneously at the soma and at a dendritic
location, situated 126 mm from the soma. The ttp ( t ) of
synaptic conductance change was 0.3 ms. Five different
peak conductance changes ( 1 – 5 nS ) were applied at each
location. Synaptic reversal potential was 0.0 mV. A : am-plitudes of EPSPs measured at the soma plotted against
the amplitudes measured at the dendritic location. EPSPs
arising from the different somato-dendritic compartments
are color coded and match the colors of the different
dendrites of the MN illustrated in inset . Axon is black
and labeled. The 3 populations were fitted with a regression line and the corresponding attenuation factors calculated. The blue data points are from synapses located on
the dendritic segment placed between the recording electrodes. In principle, depending on the exact location and
peak conductance ( 0 – 5 nS ) , the points could lie anywhere on the gray-shaded area. B : ttp of EPSPs elicited
in green dendritic domain plotted against amplitude ratio
of EPSPs recorded at the soma and dendrite to demonstrate the dependence of the attenuation from the rise time
of EPSPs. C : ttp of the EPSPs elicited in red dendritic
domain plotted against amplitude ratio of EPSPs recorded
at the dendrite and soma to demonstrate the strong dependence of the attenuation from the rise time of the EPSPs.

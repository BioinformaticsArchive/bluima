for plotting data of Figure 3. For most experiments, F 0 (that means

complete depletion of fast-releasing vesicle pool at t ). In the experiment
1

of 12 mM EGTA/6 mM Ca 2 condition, it was usually difficult to deplete
the pool completely (Sakaba and Neher, 2001c). In that case, we estimated F (remaining fraction of the fast pool after a first stimulus) ap- 1

proximately by extrapolating the exponential fit of the recovery time
course to time 0 or by simulating the recovery time course with Equation
7 and the recorded [Ca 2 ] signal in each cell pair. F typically ranged
i1
between 0 and 0.2. We also calculated for each pulse pair the F value at the

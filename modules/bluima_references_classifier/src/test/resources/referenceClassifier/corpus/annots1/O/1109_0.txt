Figure 1: Example sentence from the GENIA corpus. (a) Two of the top 50 constituency parses from the MCCC-I
parser; the first had a total probability mass of 0.43 and the second 0.25 after renormalization. Nodes that differ
between parses are shaded and outlined. (b) The dependency posteriors (labels omitted due to space) after
conversion of 50-best parses. Solid lines indicate edges with posterior > 0.95; edges with posterior < 0.05 were
omitted. Most of the ambiguity is in the attachment of “elicited”.

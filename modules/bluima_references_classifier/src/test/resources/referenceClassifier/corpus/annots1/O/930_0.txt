Figure 5. Hyperpolarizing responses to transient mAChR stimulation result from the activation of an SK-type calcium-activated potassium conductance. A, Responses of a pyramidal neuron to transient carbachol application when patched with normal internal pipette solution (top
trace) and after being patched a second time with a pipette containing the calcium-chelating
agent BAPTA (10 mM; bottom trace). B, Summary graph showing effectiveness of internal
BAPTA in blocking cholinergic responses. The left two bars show a comparison of responses to
1-s-long applications of carbachol or ACh in control conditions (n 51) and in cells patched a
single time with BAPTA (10 M) in the pipette (n 6). Right two bars compare responses to
carbachol (1 s) in control conditions and after repatching with a BAPTA-containing pipette (10

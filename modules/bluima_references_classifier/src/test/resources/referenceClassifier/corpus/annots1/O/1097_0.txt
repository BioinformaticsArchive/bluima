typically formed axo-somatic autapses (unpublished observations), which is also characteristic of BCs (Tamas et al., 1997b).
Finally, EM of randomly selected boutons verified a high fraction
of axo-somatic synapses formed by NBCs. These interneurons
are therefore BCs, but because of their distinctive axonal and
dendritic features and molecular expression patterns, they
constitute a separate subclass of BCs.

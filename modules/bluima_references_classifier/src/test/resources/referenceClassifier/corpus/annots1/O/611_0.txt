rates) are plotted as a function of the contrast of the surround. For
neuron I-38 (Fig. 5A), the briefly presented CRF natural image patch
without surround (0% surround contrast) elicited reliable discharges.
When the CRF was surrounded by the scrambled image, the responses
to the CRF stimulation were constant regardless of the contrast of the
surround (posthoc test, P > 0.05). When the CRF was surrounded by
the original natural image, however, the responses to the same CRF
stimulation gradually decreased with the increasing contrast of the
surround (surround contrast F5,132 = 5.42, P < 0.0001; surround
category F1,132 = 34.53, P < 0.0001). Comparing with the CRF
stimulation alone, the firing rate was reduced by 53% with the full
contrast (100%) of the original natural image surround (posthoc test,
P < 0.05). Hence, the centre–surround interaction of this neuron was
sensitive to the higher-order structures of the natural image surround.
Some neurons, however, were only sensitive to the contrast change
of the surround presented outside their CRFs. When the contrast of the
surround was increased, the response of neuron I-57 to the CRF
natural image stimulation was gradually decreased (up to 49.2%;
Fig. 5B). No significant difference was observed between the natural
and scrambled image surrounds (surround contrast F5,119 = 5.87,
P < 0.0001; surround category F1,119 = 1.22, P = 0.27). Neuron A-9
(Fig. 5C), on the other hand, showed enhanced responses with the
increasing contrast of the surround regardless of the categories of the
surround images (surround contrast F5,119 = 13.47, P < 0.0001;
surround category F1,119 = 0.4, P = 0.53). Its response was increased
by nearly 800% when the contrast of the surround was changed from
0% to 100%.
Population analysis revealed that the centre–surround interaction for
the majority of V1 neurons is sensitive to the higher-order structures of
natural images. The neuronal response to the CRF stimulation alone
was treated as 100%. Out of 67 neurons showing centre–surround
interaction to natural images, 47 showed suppressed responses to the
CRF stimulation by the copresented natural image surround, when
compared to the scrambled surround (surround contrast P < 0.05;
surround category P < 0.05; Fig. 6A). On average, the response to the
CRF natural image patch was decreased from 100% to 41.13% ± 5.42
when the contrast of the natural image surround was increased from
0% to 100% (posthoc test, P < 0.05). The variation of the contrast of
the scrambled image surround did not have any evident effect on the
neuronal response to the CRF stimulation (posthoc test, P > 0.05).
Fifteen other neurons showed statistically indistinguishable suppressed responses with the increasing contrast of the natural and
scrambled image surrounds (Fig. 6B). The mean response to the CRF
natural image patch was decreased from 100% to 40.36% ± 14.02 and
45.78% ± 9.34 when the contrast of the natural and scrambled image
surround was increased from 0% to 100% (surround contrast
P < 0.05; surround category P > 0.05). Only five neurons showed
indistinguishable facilitated responses to the natural and scrambled
image surrounds (Fig. 6C). The mean response to the CRF natural
image patch was increased from 100% to 530.38% ± 129 and
531.3% ± 113.42 when the contrast of the natural and scrambled
image surrounds was increased from 0% to 100% (surround contrast
P < 0.05; surround category P > 0.05). For the majority of neurons
(47 out of 67), then, the suppressed centre–surround interaction for
natural images was dependent on the higher-order structures of natural
images. For the remaining 44 neurons that did not show significant
surround modulation to the natural image surrounds, the scrambled
image surrounds with various contrasts also did not have significant
modulatory effect on these neurons (Fig. 6D). Their responses to the
CRF natural image patch copresented with the natural and scrambled
image surrounds of different contrast were indistinguishable (surround
contrast P > 0.05; surround category P > 0.05).

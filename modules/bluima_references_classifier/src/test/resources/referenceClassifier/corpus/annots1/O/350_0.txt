Consequences of Motor Axon Sprouting on Force Gradation by Firing Rate Modulation. During voluntary contractions of healthy muscles, motor units are recruited
at 6 â€“12 Hz.137,175 Recruitment rates of motor units are
sometimes increased in PPS and ALS but are reduced
or similar to usual after SCI.22,102,138,151,184,209,216 This
variability, both within and across conditions, suggests
that the rates at which motor units are recruited does
not relate to the disorder specifically or to weakness of
the muscle itself.
The few motor unit recordings made during submaximal or maximal voluntary contractions of muscles influenced by PPS62,151 show firing rates that are
similar to those seen in healthy muscles during isometric contractions ( 25 Hz except in soleus13,51).
However, unit rate modulation during walking can
be more pronounced in tibialis anterior muscles
moderately weakened by polio, or less than usual
when the paralysis is severe.24 In ALS, maximal unit
firing rates are similar, increased, or reduced compared to those seen in healthy muscles, but the firing
pattern is usually more variable.141 After SCI, the
magnitude of motor unit rate modulation seems to
be muscle-dependent. Maximal motor unit firing
rates in triceps brachii are often higher or similar to
those seen in healthy muscles.185 In contrast, during
voluntary contractions of thenar muscles influenced
by cervical SCI, unusually low maximal motor unit
firing rates were recorded. However, during involuntary contractions (spasms), normal firing rates were
recorded, which suggest that the motoneurons were
capable of firing at high frequencies. It was the
voluntary input to thenar muscles that was im-paired.216

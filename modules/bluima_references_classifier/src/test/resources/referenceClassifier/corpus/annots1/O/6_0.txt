Intermediate channels recover faster
from desensitization
It has been proposed that the entry into, and recovery from,
desensitization may proceed via different paths (Patneau and
Mayer, 1991; Jonas, 1993; Raman and Trussell, 1995). To test
whether the inclusion of the mutant subunit in receptor assemblies also altered the rate of recovery from desensitization, we
compared the speed of recovery of the intermediate and fast
components. For these experiments, we used patches from cells
transfected with mutant and wild-type cDNAs at a ratio of 1:3,
which showed substantial fast and intermediate components in
their decays. Patches were conditioned with an application of
glutamate (0.5 mM for 100 msec), and then a second application
was delivered at varying times after the conditioning pulse.
A typical example of the results obtained in these experiments
is shown in Figure 7A. The decays of the currents evoked by the
conditioning and test pulses were each fitted with three exponential components. The amplitudes of the fast and intermediate
components in the decay of the current evoked by the test pulse
were then expressed as a proportion of the amplitude of the
corresponding component in the decay of the current evoked by
the conditioning pulse. Figure 7B shows a plot of the relative
amplitudes of the fast and intermediate components as a f unction
of recovery time, where each point is the mean value obtained
from five patches. Single exponential fits to each set of results
gave recovery time constants (trec) of 154 msec for the fast current
and 51 msec for the intermediate current. The apparent offset
(see Materials and Methods) was similar for both sets of data (19
and 21 msec). Because the intermediate component of decay
appears to arise from channels that contain two mutant subunits,
the data from the two-pulse experiments suggest that these channels also recover from desensitization faster than wild-type
channels.
At high agonist concentrations, recovery from desensitization
could occur directly to non-desensitized states or it might proceed
initially via unbinding transitions, with exit from desensitization
only occurring after agonist has dissociated from one or more
subunits. Thus the somewhat faster recovery of the intermediate
component could either reflect modest destabilization of desensitized channel states (increase in g4) (Fig. 6 D) or a decreased
affinity of glutamate binding to these states (increase in k-2). To
distinguish between these two possibilities, we determined the
apparent affinity of glutamate for desensitized channel states. As
reported by others (Trussell and Fischbach, 1989; Colquhoun et
al., 1992; Raman and Trussell, 1992), preincubation of wild-type
channels with low concentrations of glutamate (which do not
cause detectable channel activation) produces significant desensitization, as assessed by depression of the currents evoked by
subsequent glutamate applications. The data in Figure 7C gave an
IC50 value of 0.89 μM for glutamate depression of glutamateevoked currents through wild-type GluR1flip channels (n = 4
patches). The corresponding value measured for the intermediate
component of decay was 4.3 μM (n = 5 patches). An example of

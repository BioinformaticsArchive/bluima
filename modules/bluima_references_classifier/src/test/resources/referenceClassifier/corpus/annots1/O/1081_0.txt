Figure 2. Voltage imaging of AP backpropagation in basal dendrites. A, A three AP burst
(200 Hz) recorded at the soma during filling (black traces) and after a 2 h incubation and
recovery period (red trace). B, Image of proximal dendrite (average of 30 trials). Rectangle
indicates ROI. C, A three AP burst recorded at the soma (black) and imaged in proximal dendrite
(red) shown in B. Distance from soma was 30 m. All data in C have been filtered at 500 Hz. D,
Fluorescence changes in distal (green; 230 m) and proximal (gray; 100 m) basal dendrites
during a three AP burst (200 Hz). Bottom traces show simultaneously recorded somatic voltage.
Traces from different distances were recorded separately. Bottom, Pooled peak F/F for each
AP in a three AP burst at proximal ( 130 m; n 6) and distal ( 130 m; n 12) basal
dendritic sites. The peak of the third AP was significantly larger in distal dendrites. p 0.005. E,
A three AP burst as in D in control (gray) and cadmium (200 M; blue) recorded 200 m from
soma. Bottom, Average ratio of the third to the first AP peak in control (n 6), cadmium (n
6), and after washout (n 3). p 0.047.

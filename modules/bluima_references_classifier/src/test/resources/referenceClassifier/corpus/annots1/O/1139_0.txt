For classification, we use the support vector ma-chine as implemented in SVMlight (for the un-typed undirected task) and SVMmulticlass (for the
typed directed task) by Joachims (1999). All
experiments are performed using ten-fold crossvalidation. Examples are divided into ten sets on
the basis of articles, avoiding the information leak
between training and testing described by SÃ¦tre et
al. (2007). For each of the ten folds, the classifier
is trained on the union of eight of the sets. One
set is used for a grid search for the optimal SVM
regularization parameter C and the remaining set
is the test set, separating parameter selection from
testing.

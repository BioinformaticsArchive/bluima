Androgen receptor (AR) functions as a transcriptional factor
for genes involved in proliferation and differentiation of normal
and cancerous prostate cells. Coactivators that bind to AR are
required for maximal androgen action. Here we report that
increasing the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in a prostate cancer cell line by as little as
1.8-fold enhances transcriptional activity of AR (but not the
transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptor or estrogen
receptor ) in a ligand-dependent manner and results in an
increased expression of prostate-specific antigen. Small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of GAPDH significantly
attenuated ligand-activated AR transactivation. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the presence of an endogenous protein
complex containing GAPDH and AR in both the cytoplasm and
nucleus. Addition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to GAPDH
(GAPDH-NLS) completely abolished the ability of GAPDH to
transactivate AR. Neither wild-type GAPDH nor GAPDH-NLS
enhanced transcriptional activity of mutant AR (AR C-Nuc) that
is a constitutively active form of AR in the nucleus, even though
GAPDH-NLS formed a complex with wild-type AR or AR C-Nuc.
AR transactivation was enhanced by a mutant GAPDH lacking
dehydrogenase activity. GAPDH enhanced the transcriptional
activity of AR(T875A) activated by an antagonist such as hydroxyflutamide or cyproterone acetate. These results indicate that
GAPDH functions as a coactivator with high selectivity for AR and
enhances AR transactivation independent of its glycolytic activity.
Further, these data suggest that formation of a GAPDH AR complex in the cytoplasm rather than nucleus is essential for GAPDH to
enhance AR transactivation.

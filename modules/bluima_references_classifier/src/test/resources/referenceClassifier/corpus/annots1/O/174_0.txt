mechanism for increasing SAT length in
humans (Vanhatalo and Kaila, 2006).
Consistent with the hypothesis that the
duration and macro-patterning of SATlike activity (infra-slow waves and alpha–
beta oscillations) is determined by cortical
input, long-duration alpha– beta oscillations observed in rat barrel cortex (Yang et
al., 2009) (supplemental Fig S1, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), have different duration and incidence
than V1 SATs, and require repetitive stimulations to evoke them, suggesting a different
driver (somatic vs retinal).

Brain position
The simplest single-element placement problem is where the
human brain is the only locatable component. It is a basic fact
of body layout of vertebrates and most actively motile invertebrates that they tend to “lead with their head,” to concentrate
sensors at this anterior pole; here we treat locations of all sensors
and effecters connected to the brain just as prior “edge-constraints” fixed by natural selection. Vertebrate, and most motile
invertebrate, bodies have a strongly distinct longitudinal axis.
Hence the component placement task here is further simplified,
because it approximates a one-axis linear array problem. One
issue concerns how connection costs should be assessed. For
instance, should the measure be total volume of nerve tract
tissue, or total length of individual nerve fibers? Since human
nerve fibers range in diameter from below 0.2 pm for olfactory
fibers to over 10 pm for some types of spinal motor fibers
(Chemiak, 1990b), the answer significantly affects cost estimates. We begin with the hypothesis that the cost being minimized is individual connection lengths-that is, total fiber
length-rather than just volume of tissue. We also start from
the assumption that, if connections in themselves count, then
sensory and motor connections qualitatively have equal value.
The basic observation concerning component location is that
the brain, or predominant portion of most nondiffuse invertebrate nervous systems, is positioned as far forward as is physically possible on the longitudinal axis of the body. Such a
placement minimizes total sensory/motor connection costs only
if there are more connections to and from the front than the
rear. Table 1 gives fiber counts for all cranial nerves and the
spinal cord of adult Homo sapiens: the anteroposterior connection ratio for our brain exceeds 5. Despite the flexures of the
human CNS, one can therefore see that any placement of the
brain other than as far forward as possible will increase total
length of required external connections. Some sense ofjust how
strong the selective pressure to “save wire” might be is conveyed
when one contemplates how poor a choice in other important
respects putting the brain in the head is. Locating the brain
instead inside the thorax would greatly improve mechanical
protection of this most delicate of tissues, and also save significantly on arteriovenous connection costs to the heart of this
most metabolically active of organs.

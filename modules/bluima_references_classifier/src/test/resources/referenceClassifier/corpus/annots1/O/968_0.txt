Identification of cell migration genes and
genes that modulate neurite outgrowth in
cortical interneurons
Many of the genes found to be upregulated in the cortical interneurons have previously been shown to play a role
in cell migration, either directly or indirectly, by regulating
specific events that are essential for this process, such as
neurite outgrowth and branching. We performed in situ

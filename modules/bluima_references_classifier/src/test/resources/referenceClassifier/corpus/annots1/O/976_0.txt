Analysis of spike synchronization. To investigate synchronization, joint
peristimulus time histograms (JPSTHs) (Palm et al., 1988; Aertsen et al.,
1989) were constructed for FS interneuron pairs receiving alternating
up-state/down-state input. The periods were considered to be triggered
by the start of the up states. The JPSTH reveals changes in the synchronization during the duration of an up state, with points on the diagonal
corresponding to synchronous spikes for the neuron pair. To study
quantitatively the effect of gap junctions on the synchronization, crosscorrelograms were generated for each directly coupled neuron pair in the
10-cell network, and then averaged over the network. The same simulations were rerun without gap junctions as a reference.
The effect of gap junctions on the spike pattern was classified into three
cases; removal of spikes due to shunting, spikes triggered by neighboring
spikes and spikes appearing spontaneously. The comparison is between
an FS population with and without gap junctions. For each spike in the
reference network devoid of gap junctions, if no spike is within t in the
trace from the network with gap junctions, the spike is considered re-moved. Conversely, for each spike in the network with gap junctions, if
there is no spike within t in the reference network, the spike is considered added. To further evaluate the added spike, the traces from neurons
connected with gap junctions were analyzed. If there were no spikes in
those coupled neurons when they were uncoupled (i.e., in the reference
network) at least t before the spike, then the spike was considered to be
spontaneous, otherwise it was spike triggered. This analysis accounts for
all spike changes; summing them together resulted in the measured re-duction in total number of spikes. Analyses were repeated for t between
5 and 20 ms.

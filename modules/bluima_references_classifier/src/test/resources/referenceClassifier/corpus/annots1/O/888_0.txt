Fig. 14 Top. Columnar modules of region TE (anterior
inferotemporal cortex) of the temporal neocortex of the macaque
monkey. Neurons in each of the modules responded to the critical
stimulus features indicated. The modules measure ~400 Î¼m in the
horizontal dimension. Bottom The neurons in adjacent modules of
area TE respond to different but related stimulus features, and on
this basis two or three may be linked into larger modules in the
manner indicated in the drawing. (From Tanaka, 1996, with

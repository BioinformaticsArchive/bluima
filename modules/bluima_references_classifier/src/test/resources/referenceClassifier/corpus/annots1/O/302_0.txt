(Grillner & Walle ́n, 2002). Central spinal mechanisms for coupling
motoneuron pool activity can be readily studied in preparations
showing `fictive locomotion' upon pharmacological treatment (e.g.
Walle ́n & Williams, 1984; Pierotti et al., 1989; Roy et al., 1991). What
is the neural basis for phase differences in the activation of
motoneuron pools in the spinal cord? We aim to address this issue
in the lamprey spinal network for swimming, because it represents a
very simple example for this problem. In the generation of the
swimming motor programme the actions of only a few sets of muscles
have to be coordinated on each side of the animal and within each
spinal hemisegment (Tretjakoff, 1909; Birnberger & Rovainen, 1971).
In the caudal region, the location of the dorsal fins, in each segment
the activity of the fin muscles has to be coordinated with that of the
myotomal muscles (Rovainen, 1967a,b; Rovainen & Birnberger,
1971; Shupliakov et al., 1992; El Manira et al., 1996). In N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced fictive swimming, fin motoneurons have
been reported to exhibit a basic antiphasic depolarization pattern
compared with the ipsilateral myotomal motoneurons (Shupliakov
et al., 1992). At present it is not known: (1) which activity fin muscles
generate during swimming in vivo; (2) how this activity compares with
the activity pattern of fin motoneurons generated in vitro; and (3) what
the mechanisms are that coordinate the activity of fin motoneurons and
myotomal motoneurons. In the present investigation we present an
analysis of fin muscle and fin motoneuron activity during the
generation of swimming activity in vivo and in vitro. We also
investigate the role of intrasegmental contralateral inputs to the fin
motoneurons for establishing their activity pattern by performing
specific lesion experiments in the spinal cord.

the excitatory input onto PV cells relative to the inhibitory input
is smaller in stratum lacunosum-moleculare than in other layers.
The relative contribution of perforant path and/or reuniens thalami fibers is highest on CR cells, but it is still only about a third
of the Schaffer collateral input.
We examined the proportion of inhibitory terminals on the
soma, as well as on dendrites of different thickness, at different
distances form the soma and in different layers (Fig. 10). Our first
finding was that the ratio of inhibitory terminals is always higher
on the somata than on the dendrites, irrespective of the laminar
location (Fig. 10 A). The second observation along the same lines
was that, for CB and CR cells, inhibitory synapses on thick
dendrites were always larger in number than on the medium
diameter and thin dendrites (Fig. 10 B, Table 4). If data were
summed for all layers, the ratio of inhibitory terminals correlated
with the dendritic diameter. For PV cells, inhibitory contacts were
of similar density on thin dendrites than on thick dendrites.
Dendrite thickness does not necessarily correlate with the distance from the soma, because for a PV or CR cell, a stratum
lacunosum-moleculare medium dendrite is further away from the
soma than a stratum radiatum thin dendrite (the diameter of
dendrite subclasses was defined separately within each layer).
Therefore, we calculated the proportion of inhibitory synapses on
proximal, medium distal, and distal dendrites as well. The distribution matched the findings for the simple dendrite thickness
calculations. Namely, proximal dendrites of CB and CR cells
received relatively larger amounts of inhibitory terminals than the
distal segments. For PV cells, the proportion of inhibitory synapses on dendrites did not correlate with the distance either.
The analysis of proportion of inhibition in different layers
revealed that the ratio of inhibitory terminals differs among layers
for each cell population (Table 4, Fig. 6C). In the case of CB and
CR cells the variation is relatively small, but PV cells receive
considerably more inhibition onto their dendrites in stratum
lacunosum-moleculare (;18%) than in other layers (;5%). This
suggests that, for PV cells, the inputs from the perforant pathway
and /or the nucleus reuniens thalami are under a stronger inhibitory control than the synapses formed by Schaffer collaterals in
strata radiatum and oriens.
Analysis of the relative distribution of inhibitory synapses
among different domains (Fig. 11) revealed that relative to its
size, the soma receives a disproportionately high ratio of the total
inhibitory inputs. PV cell somata possess the largest share of
inhibitory terminals (16.9% of all GABAergic boutons), and
those of CB cells possess the lowest (11.7%). The contribution of
terminals on the axon initial segments is negligible, at least
regarding their number.

3.2 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
The Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (also called the
aspect model) [11] is a generative statistical model for
analyzing co-occurrence of data (originally for document
and word analysis) which associates a latent variable z
with an observation (i.e., each occurrence of the word w

acoustic spectrum extracted by the LIN is encoded not
uniformly, but rather at discrete points (samples) near the
extrema of the wavelet transform. This, in turn, is directly
responsible for the suppression and enhancement effects which
endow the auditory representations V, with superior robustness in noise (Appendix B). Such waveform compression, as
a way of suppressing interference, has long been used in
amplifier design [40]. Note, however, that the auditory system is able to employ compression only because it preserves
the wavelet transform from its analysis filters through the
phase-locked activity on the auditory nerve.

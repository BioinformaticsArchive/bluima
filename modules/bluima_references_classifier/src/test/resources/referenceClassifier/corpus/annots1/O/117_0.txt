2006). Pharmacological or genetic manipulations associated
with a loss of function of NMDA type of glutamate receptors
(NMDA-Rs) result in malformations of barrel cortex development and functional deficits (Schlaggar et al. 1993; Fox et al.
1996; Iwasato et al. 2000; Fox 2002; Dagnew et al. 2003; Lee
et al. 2005a, 2005b). During the critical period, thalamocortical
synapses display an enhanced NMDA-R contribution, and
increased NMDA-R-dependent synaptic plasticity including the
conversion of ``silent'' pure NMDA-R based synapses to fully
functional mixed alpha-aminopropionate (AMPA)/NMDA-R synapses, as well as a switch to fast AMPA receptor mediated
synaptic transmission from slow kainate mediated transmission
(LoTurco et al. 1991; Carmignoto and Vicini 1992; Hestrin 1992;
Monyer et al. 1994; Crair and Malenka 1995; Isaac et al. 1995b;
Isaac et al. 1997; Feldman et al. 1998; Feldman et al. 1999; Barth
and Malenka 2001; Bannister et al. 2005; Daw et al. 2006).
Despite the important developmental role for NMDA-Rs in the
formation of thalamocortical synapses, little is known on the
physiological in vivo network activity patterns associated with
activation of NMDA-Rs.
Almost all neuronal activity in barrel cortex during the
critical developmental period occurs as part of a 200- to 600-ms
oscillatory burst known as a ``spindle burst,'' which is composed
of a rapid oscillation in the alpha-beta (8-25 Hz) frequency
range nested in an envelope of delta wave (1-4 Hz) (Khazipov
et al. 2004; Minlebaev et al. 2007). Spindle bursts are
homologous to an electrographic pattern of delta-brushes in
the human premature neonates (Anderson et al. 1985; StockardPope et al. 1992; Lamblin et al. 1999; Vanhatalo et al. 2002;
Vanhatalo et al. 2005; Khazipov and Luhmann 2006; Scher
2006; Milh et al. 2007). The spindle burst is an endogenous
pattern of activity, which is reliably triggered by peripheral
stimulation but persists after deafferentation (Khazipov et al.
2004; Hanganu et al. 2006). In the intact animals, somatosensory spindle bursts are driven by satisfy feedback resulting from
spontaneous myoclonic twitches (Khazipov et al. 2004; Milh
et al. 2007), a characteristic pattern of motor activity during
early development (de Vries et al. 1982; Cioni and Prechtl 1990;
Blumberg and Lucas 1994; O'Donovan 1999; Petersson et al.
2003). Our previous studies of spindle bursts have focused on
the rapid oscillatory component and showed them to be
mediated by glutamatergic synapses, primarily through AMPA
receptors (Khazipov et al. 2004; Hanganu et al. 2006; Minlebaev
et al. 2007). However, in these previous studies only
frequencies above 1-3 Hz were evaluated, which likely
compromised the slow delta component of spindle bursts as
well as contributions of slow NMDA-R mediated currents.
Therefore, the nature of delta waves and NMDA-Rs contributions to spindle bursts remain largely under explored.

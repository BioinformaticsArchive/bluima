4. DISCUSSION
The degree of boldness in our model species, rainbow
trout, was consistent over time when fishes were left
isolated and unmanipulated in our control tests, yet our
dual context paradigm demonstrated that previous
experience had a significant impact upon boldness that
differed according to the specific context. Observing other
individuals has had a measurable effect upon animal
behaviour and physiology in other studies (McGregor et al.
2001; Oliveira et al. 2001). Here, bold fishes observing
bold demonstrators remained bold in their responsiveness
to novel stimuli, whereas bold individuals observing shy
became more cautious in their reaction to novelty. This
provides further evidence that social learning occurs in
rainbow trout with decisions being based upon conspecifics' behaviour. If such effects operate in natural
populations, this plasticity seen in bold individuals may
allow them to adjust their behaviour, such that they show
an adaptive response when local conditions change;
however, this will depend upon how others respond to
such change. In contrast, shy individuals observing bold
demonstrators showed no change in their sensitivity to
novelty and remained cautious. The shyer nature of these
individuals may mean that they continue to behave in a
timid manner or that they may perceive the bold
demonstrator as a much better competitor and as such
do not increase their boldness against an individual they
are unlikely to outcompete. This is confirmed by the fact
that shy subjects who observed shy became bolder by
decreasing their latency to approach a novel object. In this
case, the shy observer may perceive their competitive
ability as being similar; therefore, if they decrease the time
they take to approach stimuli, they may outcompete shy
conspecifics by simply getting there first. Theories
regarding intraspecific competition do predict that an
animal's strategic decision should be based upon their
relative competitive ability compared with that of an
opponent (Maynard Smith & Parker 1976). Thus, in the
context of observing individuals with opposing `personality' traits, bold individuals appear to be more flexible
adjusting their behaviour according to how their shy
demonstrators behave whereas shy fishes do not show this
plasticity and do not become more bold perhaps showing
that the shy `personality' is more `fixed' and less
dependent upon conspecific behaviour. In the context of
observing others, bold individuals are more plastic in their
responsiveness than shy individuals and thus they may
be more adaptable to changing conditions and fitter in
natural populations. These results are in contrast to many
other studies which demonstrate that bold or proactive
individuals are relatively `fixed' in their behaviour
compared with shy or reactive individuals which display
greater flexibility (Benus et al. 1991; Koolhaas et al. 1999;
Sih et al. 2004).

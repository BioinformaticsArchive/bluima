The case of membrane nonuniformity that will gain the main focus of
the present work is the slope case, in which Gm(x) linearly increases with
the distance from the “soma” (x = 0), namely, Gm(x) = ax + b. This case
has received some recent experimental support (Hoffman et al., 1997).
All quantities are labeled, in this case, with the superscript “s.” In the
case of cylinder of length ,, the constraint of a fixed total conductance,
Equation 2, implies that:

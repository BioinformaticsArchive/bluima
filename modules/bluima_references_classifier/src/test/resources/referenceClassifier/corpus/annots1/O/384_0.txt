Neuropathic pain may arise following peripheral nerve injury though the molecular mechanisms
associated with this are unclear. We used proteomic profiling to examine changes in protein
expression associated with the formation of hyper-excitable neuromas derived from rodent
saphenous nerves. A two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) profiling strategy
was employed to examine protein expression changes between developing neuromas and normal
nerves in whole tissue lysates. We found around 200 proteins which displayed a >1.75-fold change
in expression between neuroma and normal nerve and identified 55 of these proteins using mass
spectrometry. We also used immunoblotting to examine the expression of low-abundance ion
channels Nav1.3, Nav1.8 and calcium channel α2δ-1 subunit in this model, since they have
previously been implicated in neuronal hyperexcitability associated with neuropathic pain. Finally,
S35methionine in vitro labelling of neuroma and control samples was used to demonstrate local
protein synthesis of neuron-specific genes. A number of cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes and
proteins associated with oxidative stress were up-regulated in neuromas, whilst overall levels of
voltage-gated ion channel proteins were unaffected. We conclude that altered mRNA levels
reported in the somata of damaged DRG neurons do not necessarily reflect levels of altered
proteins in hyper-excitable damaged nerve endings. An altered repertoire of protein expression,
local protein synthesis and topological re-arrangements of ion channels may all play important roles
in neuroma hyper-excitability.

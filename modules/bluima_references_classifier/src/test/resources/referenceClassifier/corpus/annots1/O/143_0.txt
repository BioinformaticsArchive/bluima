as gap crossing, in which the animal must identify the location of a
target platform with its whiskers alone (Jenkinson & Glickstein, 2000).
In the brain stem, the S1 axons cross to the contralateral hemisphere
forming extensive arborizations in the principal trigeminal nucleus and
spinal trigeminal nuclei, with prominent labelling of caudalis (SP5c)
and interpolaris (SP5i) subdivisions (Fig. 8E and F; Jacquin et al.,
1990). The corticospinal projection from S1 to spinal trigeminal nuclei
forms an interesting pathway by which primary somatosensory cortex
can influence very early sensory processing in brain stem neurons,

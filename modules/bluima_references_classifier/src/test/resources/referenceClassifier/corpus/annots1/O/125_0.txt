transient (Rubin et al., 2005) or that the stochastic opening of the NMDA receptor
(Shouval and Kalantzis, 2005) can account
for the differential induction of LTP and
LTD.
Our results show clearly that induction
protocols that increase volume-averaged
[Ca 2 ]i to similar levels can induce either
LTP or LTD. We conclude that the
volume-averaged peak [Ca 2 ]i amplitude
is not the only determinant for the direction of modification in synaptic efficacy.
Thus the Ca 2 dependence of STDP in-duction protocols does not conform to a
Ca 2 control hypothesis (Bear et al., 1987;
Artola and Singer, 1993). However, we
confirmed that both the inductions of LTD
and LTP require the rise of [Ca 2 ]i above a
threshold, which is approximately twofold
higher for the induction of LTP than for
LTD. The large Ca 2 influx during coincident activation of NMDARs by glutamate
and depolarization by backpropagating
APs resulted in LTP. In contrast, the in-duction of LTD required a transient in-crease in [Ca 2 ]i through VDCCs and the
coactivation of mGluRs. In accordance
with these results it was suggested that a
second coincidence detector, triggering
only LTD induction, could resolve the
problem of bidirectional plasticity (Karmarkar and Buonomano, 2002; Bender et
al., 2006). mGluRs are a component in several signaling cascades resulting in changes
of synaptic strength (Anwyl, 1999, 2006;
Bortolotto et al., 1999). Block of mGluRs
did not modulate the postsynaptic [Ca 2 ]i
transients (Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005),
excluding a contribution of Ca 2 release
from internal stores (Emptage et al., 2003).
In agreement, blocking Ca 2 release from
internal stores had no effect on burstpairing-induced LTD in contrast to other
forms of LTD (Otani et al., 2002; Bender et
al., 2006). We suggest that mGluR activation can be regarded as a postsynaptic
switch, which sets the sign for the direction
of the change in synaptic strength. Activation of this switch results in the induction
of LTD, independent of the [Ca 2 ]i levels

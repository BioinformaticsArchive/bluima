Concluding Remarks
As dendrites are the sites of most synapses on a neuron, dendritic
growth and arborization are clearly crucial for proper development of the nervous system. As discussed above, dendritic
growth is potently regulated by environmental signals, including
synaptic activity. Research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dendrite growth is just beginning to reveal clues
as to how local, afferent synaptic stimulation might inf luence
dendritic growth, branching and spine formation. In light of the
rapid rate of advances in this field, it is reasonable to predict that
our understanding of the signals that regulate dendritic growth
will advance quickly over the next few years.
Currently, the most compelling hypothesis of dendritic
growth is the synaptotropic theory described by Vaughn (Vaughn,
1989). This hypothesis predicts that dendritic branches are
stabilized and stimulated to grow by synaptic contacts. The
overwhelming evidence that afferent innervation is necessary
for proper formation of dendrites is consistent with this theory.
Furthermore, direct support for the synaptotropic theory comes
from real-time 2-photon imaging of local extension of dendritic
filopodia in response to local synaptic stimulation (MaleticSavatic et al., 1999). This exciting result suggests that levels of
activity at individual synapses can locally modify the structure of
the postsynaptic neuron. However, it is crucial to follow the fate
of these locally induced filopodia over time to see if larger-scale
dendritic growth, such as branch formation, is induced by local
synaptic activation, as proposed in the synaptotropic theory.
The common message from the majority of papers in the field
of dendrite development is that dendritic growth is dynamic
and closely inf luenced by synapse formation and function. In
fact, most of the extra- and intracellular signals that inf luence
dendritic growth also alter synapse formation and axon guidance. In light of this intimate relationship between dendritic
growth and synaptogenesis, it seems obvious that the molecules
involved in one process will necessarily inf luence the other.
However, historically and for practical reasons, scientists have
artificially separated the signals that regulate axon growth from
those that regulate dendritic elaboration and synapse formation.
The fact that these processes are interconnected might help
to explain why the number of molecular signals that inf luence
dendritic arborization is so large (and is sure to grow much larger
in the near future). Activity-dependent dendritic growth implies
that dendritic arborization is not only determined by the intracellular components of the dendrite but is also inf luenced by

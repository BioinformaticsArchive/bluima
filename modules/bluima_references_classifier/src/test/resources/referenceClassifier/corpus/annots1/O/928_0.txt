Figure 1. Single-channel analysis of inwardly rectifying K channel(s) and channel distribution along the dendrites. A, Single inwardly rectifying K channel(s) recorded at 200 m
from the soma. Inset, An expanded stretch of record showing an idealized trace (smooth line;
generated with HMMs in TAC software) overlaying with the original trace. Calibration: 1 pA, 20
ms. B, Current–voltage plot under control (Ctrl) condition ( 33 pS) in the presence of GTP S
( 33 pS) or the presence of baclofen ( 31 pS). Some error bars are smaller than the
symbols. Single-channel conductance was determined as the slope of the best-fitted line in the
linear I–V range. C, Open probability plotted against membrane potential. D, The level of constitutive channel activity (measured at resting potential) was plotted against distance from the
soma. The amount of channel activity was significantly larger in the dendrites compared with
the soma. Recordings were binned for every 50 m. Soma, NP 0.0038 0.0012 (n 5);

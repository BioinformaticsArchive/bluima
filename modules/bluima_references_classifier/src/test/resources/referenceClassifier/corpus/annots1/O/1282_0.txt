value implies that on average, only NCA1 × prAPICA1mean [HD(P1 , P2 )]/2 - 3290 - 5640/2 - 470 out of 3290
CA1 CA1
spiking neurons spike in both of two randomly selected CA1
patterns. Note also that the mean Hamming distance 5640
is much closer to its maximal value 2 × 3290 - 6580, which
corresponds to the case when there is no overlap between two
patterns, than to the minimal Hamming distance, which is equal
to zero and corresponds to the case when the two patterns are
identical.
Similar analysis holds for spiking activity patterns in
CA3 and EC. Hamming distances between pairs of random CA3 activity patterns with the probability of CA3
spiking equal to 0.055 are binomially distributed with the
parameters NCA3 - 28,009 and prHDCA3 - 2 × 0.055 × (1 -0.055) - 0.10. The distribution has the mean 2910 and standard deviation 51. In the case of EC input patterns, the
binomial distribution has the parameters NEC - 45,073 and
prHDEC - 2 × 0.0685 × (1 - 0.0685) - 0.13. It has the mean
5750 and standard deviation 71.

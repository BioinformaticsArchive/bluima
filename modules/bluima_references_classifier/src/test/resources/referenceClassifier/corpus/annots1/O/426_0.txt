mean spine density between cells from OVX+O and OVX+E
animals, no significant difference in mean input resistance in
cells from OVX+O and OVX+E animals was observed. This
finding is consistent with the previous observations of others
(Wong and Moss, 1992). In contrast to input resistance, no
other intrinsic electrophysiological parameter measured (resting membrane potential, time constant, mV to threshold, ac-tion potential amplitude or duration, spike afterhyperpolarization amplitude or duration) was significantly associated with
dendritic spine density (Fig. 3, Table 1). However, in cells with
increased dendritic spine density, there were statistical trends
toward more hyperpolarized resting potential, increased action
potential amplitude, and decreased action potential duration
(Table 1). Given these trends, we repeated some measurements
with cells held at approximately the same membrane potential

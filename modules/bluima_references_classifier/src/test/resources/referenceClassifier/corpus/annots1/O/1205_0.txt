Figure 3. C amera lucida reconstruction of a synaptically connected
BC â€“BC pair. Soma and dendrites of
the presynaptic BC are drawn in green.
Axonal arborization of the presynaptic BC is drawn in red. Soma and dendrites of the postsynaptic BC are
drawn in black. Axonal arborization of
the postsynaptic BC is drawn in blue.
Only the portions of the axons that
could be unequivocally traced back to
the soma are depicted. Synaptic contacts (confirmed by subsequent electron microscopy; see Fig. 4) are indicated by arrowheads. Additionally, the
postsynaptic BC showed three autaptic
contacts (confirmed by electron mi-croscopy; data not shown). Note that
the axonal arborization of both BC s
was largely confined to the granule cell
layer, identif ying them as BC s. ml,
Molecular layer; gcl, granule cell layer.

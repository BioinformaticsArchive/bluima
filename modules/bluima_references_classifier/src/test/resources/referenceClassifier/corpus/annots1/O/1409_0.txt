and lower paired pulse facilitation. The other difference, that the
parent dendrites of spines contacted by ascending axons were
thinner than those for parallel fibers, was interpreted as showing
that ascending axon synapses are made preferentially on the
termini of spiny branchlets. This might be expected to lead to
greater filtering of EPSCs from the more distal ascending axon
synapses. In fact, the modeling of Roth and Hausser (2001)
suggests that only very subtle differences in EPSC kinetics are to
be expected because synapse position is varied along a spiny
branchlet, so this suggestion does not give rise to a prediction that
can be tested with our electrical recordings.
Although we could not identif y granule cells making ascending
axon connections, any such cells are likely to have been among
those contributing to the high connection probability near the
Purkinje cell dendritic plane. How do the synaptic properties of
this population of granule cells “enriched” in ascending axon
connections compare with those for pure parallel fiber synapses?
Figure 10 shows plots of connection properties expected to differ
between ascending axons and parallel fibers as a function of
distance from the dendritic plane. If the two strong connections
were excluded, the amplitudes of the remaining proximal granule
cell connections showed no trend toward greater values at the
dendritic plane. Plots of estimated release probability and paired
pulse facilitation against distance from the dendritic plane show a
similar lack of any detectable trend (Fig. 10), and the average
values were very close to those for more distal granule cells. Thus
most proximal granule cell connections appear to be indistin-

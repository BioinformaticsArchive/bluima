three cats) and from animals in which the medial gastrocnemius
and/or lateral gastrocnemius–soleus muscle nerves were cut 1
week (n = 6 axotomized cells and 4 nonaxotomized cells from
three cats) or 4 – 6 weeks (n = 8 axotomized cells and 2 nonaxotomized cells from five cats) previously. Based on initial experiments in which one motor neuron was injected per spinal cord
and the compact nature of the resulting clusters of dye-labeled
cells (see below), the minimum distance between injection sites
was 2 mm. Medial and lateral gastrocnemius– soleus motor neurons were identified by the presence of an antidromic action
potential after stimulation of those muscle nerves proximal to the
cut site. Nonaxotomized motor neurons innervating the tibialis
anterior, plantaris, or peroneus muscles were similarly identified.
After waiting a minimum of 2 hr to allow dye to diffuse from one
cell to another, spinal cords were fixed, sectioned, and stained
with either HRP- or fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin and
processed accordingly. Sections were then examined with light or
confocal epifluorescence microscopy, and the number and the
spatial distribution of dye-labeled motor neurons were
determined.
In normal cat lumbar spinal cord, each of six identified gastrocnemius–soleus motor neurons injected with Neurobiotin resulted
in a single robustly labeled motor neuron after histochemical
processing. Injected cells showed strong Neurobiotin labeling in
the cell body and throughout their extensive dendritic arbor (Fig.
1 E). The diameter of injected cells was 42–55 μm, consistent with
the diameter of cat triceps surae α motor neurons reported
previously (cf. Burke et al., 1982; Ulfhake and Kellerth, 1982). In
three of these cells, a Neurobiotin-labeled axon that exited a

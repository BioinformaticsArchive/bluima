Because the COOH terminus only partially determines
the difference in the basal voltage dependence of gating between HCN1 and HCN2, we constructed four ad-ditional chimeras to study the role of the NH2 terminus
and the transmembrane domain (Fig. 4 and Table I).
Exchange of the NH2 terminus between HCN1 and
HCN2 has little or no effect on cAMP modulation or
basal gating (Fig. 4; 2.5-mV shift). In contrast, ex-change of the core transmembrane domain does significantly alter basal voltage dependence (Fig. 4). Thus,
replacing the transmembrane region of HCN2 with
that of HCN1, yielding the chimera HCN212, shifts the
V1/2 by 10 mV to more positive potentials (relative to
HCN2). Conversely, replacing the transmembrane do-main of HCN1 with that of HCN2, yielding the chimera
HCN121, shifts the V1/2 by 6 mV to more negative po-tentials (relative to HCN1). In contrast to its effect on
basal gating, exchange of the transmembrane domain
has little effect on the response to cAMP ( 2.5-mV
change). Thus, the difference in basal gating between
HCN1 and HCN2 depends on sequence differences lo-

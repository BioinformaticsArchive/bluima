mosaics form if cells move to minimize their dendritic
overlap [43]. Developing dendrites are highly dynamic
and can be remodelled by cellular interactions [44â€“48].
In particular, neurons can limit the extension of the
dendritic trees of neighbouring homotypic cells. The
dendrites of homologous multiple dendritic neurons in
Drosophila tile over separate territories divided by the
dorsal midline. They invade the territory beyond the
midline if the contralateral homologous cell is ablated
[49]. Similarly, each major subclass of retinal ganglion
cell (RGC) tiles the retina with little dendritic overlap
between neighbouring homotypic neurons [10,50,51];
yet, if some RGCs are ablated, dendrites from
neighbouring like-cells invade the freed territory [52].
Dendritic contacts between developing neighbouring
RGCs are cell-type specific [51] and are always of

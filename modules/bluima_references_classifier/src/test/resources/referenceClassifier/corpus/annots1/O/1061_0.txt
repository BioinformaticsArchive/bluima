DISCUSSION

The identity of the HCN channel subunits underlying Ih in
SA node cells, photoreceptors and DRG neurons has not yet
been elucidated. As a first step into this important issue we
used ISH to determine the expression profile of HCN1–4
in these cells. Our results show that each individual HCN
channel is expressed in a strictly tissue- and cell typespecific manner. Moreover, heterologous expression of
HCN1–4 demonstrated that the regional specificity of HCN
channel expression is paralleled by unique activation
kinetics intrinsic to the four channels types.
In SA node cells, the most highly expressed HCN
channel is undoubtedly HCN4, followed by HCN2. HCN4
is strongly enriched in these primary pacemaker cells,
whereas HCN2 is found at one order lower levels equally
distributed in nodal and atrial myocytes. To our knowledge,
HCN4 represents the first ion channel that within the heart
is specifically expressed in pacemaker cells. Our ISH
results are in keeping with recent Northern blot [18] and
RNAse protection assay [26] data showing a high
expression of this channel type in RNA preparations from
the SA node region. However, these methods did not allow
determination of expression at the cellular level. The very
low concentration of HCN1 transcripts in SA node cells
indicates that this channel type most probably does not
make an important contribution to murine sinoatrial Ih.
The electrophysiological comparison of the four
channels demonstrated that HCN1–4 exhibit very similar
half maximal activation potentials. In contrast, the channels
displayed considerable differences in their activation rates
in the order HCN1 . HCN2 . HCN3 . HCN4. Our data
indicate that HCN4, the most slowly activating channel
type, may confer the major component of Ih in the SA node.
Moreover, the presence of transcripts encoding the much
faster activating HCN2 channel in primary pacemaker cells
suggests that HCN2 may also, although presumably to a
lesser degree, contribute to native Ih. Taken together, these
findings suggest that sinaotrial Ih is composed of a slow
(HCN4) and a fast (HCN2) component. This hypothesis is
in line with reports describing two kinetic components
(slow and fast) of Ih from SA node cells [27–29].
Our finding that HCN2 and HCN4 are expressed in atrial
and ventricular myocytes outside the conduction sytem is
consistent with reports describing Ih in such cells [30–34].
The function of Ih in primarily nonpacemaking myocytes
remains to be elucidated.
Photoreceptors express solely HCN1; HCN2–4 were not
found in these cells. The dense labelling of the photoreceptor layer suggests that HCN1 is highly expressed in
rods, which in murine retina make up < 97% of all
photoreceptors [35]. The uniform, uninterrupted labelling
pattern indicates that HCN1 may be also expressed in
cones. Native Ih channels in photoreceptors gate several
times faster than those in cardiac cells with activation
time constants in the range of tens to hundreds of
milliseconds [10,11]. Our finding that the heterologously
expressed HCN1 activates with the fastest time course of
all HCN channels is in excellent agreement with these
reports.

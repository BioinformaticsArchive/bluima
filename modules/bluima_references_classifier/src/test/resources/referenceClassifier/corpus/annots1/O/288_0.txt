ated by the TTX-sensitive sodium PIC. The firing became very
erratic and failed on the downward current ramp in low-dose
TTX, even when the spike was unaffected. Long irregular
firing intervals were seen on the upward ramp, but with a very
different interspike trajectory, without the ramp&accelerate
shape (Fig. 8, C and D). Instead, long intervals occurred on the
upward ramp simply because a spike failed to be produced by
the end of the AHP and then was only produced as the cell was
further depolarized by the increasing current. Furthermore, it
appears that this sodium PIC is critical in enabling the cell to
generate rhythmic firing at all because when this current was
disrupted, firing became irregular (Fig. 8, C and D) as has been
previously reported (Lee and Heckman 2001).

2001b). The long-lasting hyperpolarizations are obliterated on
natural awakening in behaving animals (Fig. 15), and they
appear as distinct events from the very onset of slow-wave
sleep.
All major types of neocortical neurons (RS, IB, FRB, and
FS; see Neocortex: changing firing patterns during different
functional states) behave similarly during the slow oscillation.
Namely, they discharge during the depolarizing phase associated with depth-negative field potentials and are silent during
the hyperpolarizing phase associated with depth-positive field
potentials. The depolarizations are due to a combination of a
persistent Na+ current and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- as
well as non-NMDA-mediated EPSPs, but they also include
IPSPs (Steriade et al. 1993e). The fact that no cellular type,
including FS neurons, some of them formally identified as
short-axoned basket-type neurons (Contreras and Steriade

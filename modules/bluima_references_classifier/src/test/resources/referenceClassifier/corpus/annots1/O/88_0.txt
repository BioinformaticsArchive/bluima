complex features of these probes to monitor vesicle reuse. In the
case of styryl dyes, postfusional retention of slowly departitioning
FM dyes could report reuse of dye-containing vesicles (Klingauf
et al., 1998; Pyle et al., 2000; Aravanis et al., 2003; Richards et al.,
2005). For experiments with synaptophluorin, the postendocytic
trafficking of synaptobrevin/VAMP has been used as a read out
for the kinetics of vesicle trafficking after fusion (Li and Murthy,
2001; Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001; Li et al., 2005). These
experiments, using optical tools, consistently support the
premise that synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are
tightly coupled processes. However, in most cases, their ability to
monitor synaptic vesicle reuse and reavailability of vesicles for
consequent rounds of fusion after endocytosis have relied on the
somewhat difficult comparison of presynaptic optical signals to
postsynaptic electrical recordings. This comparison is complicated by the distinct physical nature, origin, and complex kinetic
correspondence of the two signals (Betz and Bewick, 1992, 1993;
Sara et al., 2002; Li et al., 2005; Virmani et al., 2006).
In this study, we used an electrophysiological approach that
took advantage of the neurotransmitter refilling process into vesicles. Using blockers of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), as well as
small pH buffers that can be loaded into endocytosing vesicles, we
impaired synaptic vesicle reacidification and neurotransmitter
refilling and then tested the dependence of short-term synaptic
depression on synaptic vesicle reuse. Electrophysiological detection of neurotransmission in such a setting has several advantages
such as its millisecond time resolution, direct monitoring of the
kinetics of neurotransmission, and its applicability to complex
tissues and neural circuitry from which optical signals are harder
to detect over long periods. Under these conditions, we found
that there was a use-dependent increase in the rate of synaptic
depression in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. This effect

For some applications, e.g. detecting the presence of a
statement about protein-protein interaction, having output from a GM system, i.e. knowing that a gene mention
is present, may be sufficient. The usefulness of GM system
output, however, will not be realized to its utmost until
the output can be reliably grounded to an external
resource, such as a database. The task of gene normalization (GN) addresses this issue by linking a gene name
mentioned in text to a specific gene identifier in a database. For example, using our sample text from the GM
task: p53 induces monocytic diffierentiation...
[PubMed:17309603], the output of a GN system should
provide a link from [EntrezGene:7157] (assuming the text
is discussing the Homo sapiens p53 gene) to the entire text
string, or preferably to the text p53 itself. Approaches to
the GN task have varied. Some work directly on the input
text itself, while others use GM systems to identify potential genes and then try to normalize the gene mentions
that were found. The latter approach has the advantage of
being able to know where exactly in the text a particular
gene is being discussed. This knowledge aids in further
extraction tasks, such as determining the relationship
between a pair of gene mentions. Some of the difficulties
in the GN task, as in the GM task, also lie in ambiguity
among gene names. The ambiguity from the GN perspective, however, is not between gene names and other entity

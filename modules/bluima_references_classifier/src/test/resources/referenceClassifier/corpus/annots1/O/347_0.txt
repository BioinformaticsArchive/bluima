which is still evident today, has not served biology
well. Apart from its inherent intellectual limitations,
it exacerbates tendencies for research universities
to develop silos of research endeavor rather than
interdisciplinary university-wide enterprises. The
next generation of life scientists suffers accordingly.
PhD and postdoctoral training programs that feature
a university-wide faculty and outlook, including a
strong emphasis on integrative and comparative
biology, as well as modeling and simulation, are
offsetting these tendencies to some degree but not
completely so in North America. To foster such
programs, a university culture is required that
continually emphasizes and supports campus-wide
interdisciplinary research.

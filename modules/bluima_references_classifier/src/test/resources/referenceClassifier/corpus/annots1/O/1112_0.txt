Introduction
The column hypothesis states that the fundamental unit of cortical organization is a group of interconnected neurons that share
a certain set of properties and extend vertically through the cortical layers to form a column (Lorente de No ́ , 1938; Mountcastle,
1957, 1978, 1997, 2003). Large columns (100 –500 m diameter),
such as barrel columns in the somatosensory cortex of rodents,
are proposed to be formed by interconnected smaller units called
“minicolumns” (20 – 60 m in diameter) (Hubel and Wiesel,
1974, 1977; Kaas et al., 1981; Favorov and Whitsel, 1988a,b; Mc-Casland and Woolsey, 1988; Favorov and Diamond, 1990; Tommerdahl et al., 1993; Kohn et al., 1997; Bruno et al., 2003; Georgopoulos et al., 2006). Minicolumns would thus be the
elementary units that characterize cortex regardless of areal specialization. Critiques of the column hypothesis do not deny the

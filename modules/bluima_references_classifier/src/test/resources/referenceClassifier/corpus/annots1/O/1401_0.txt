Figure 3. C limbing fibers originating from small areas in the inferior olive distribute within narrow longitudinal bands in the cerebellar cortex. a, Lateral
view of six olivocerebellar axons (colored) reconstructed from 81 serial parasagittal sections. Forty-two climbing fibers arising from these six axons, and
the other 36 labeled climbing fibers ( gray) are included. Inset shows lateral view under low magnification of the entire axonal trajectories from the
injection site in the centromedial portion of the M AO (single injection of 0.01 l of BDA). b, The distribution of climbing fibers plotted on the unfolded
vermal cortex from the midline to the left by 1.3 mm. Colors used for the climbing fibers in b correspond to those used for individual axons in a. Light
and dark gray areas in the unfolded scheme represent the cerebellar cortex exposed in the cerebellar surface and hidden in the sulci, respectively. Dotted
line indicates the contour of the distribution area. Inset shows the area for the unfolded display.

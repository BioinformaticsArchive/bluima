The local bifurcation angles measured in the experiment were
also significantly different than the original reconstructions. The
Neuron_Morpho and Neurolucida values were both highly similar (with less than a degree's difference), and are encompassed
by the experimental interquartile range (≈14°). As the bifurcation
angle is only calculated based upon the angle between the parent
and daughter segments, there is significant scope for subjective
difference as to the parent segment placement.
Both of the original reconstructions were segmented by the
same individual, thus minimizing subjective inter-user differences.
Therefore, it is to be expected that the Neuron_Morpho and Neurolucida reconstructions would be more similar to each other than
to Neuromantic ones.
Some of the reconstruction variability may be attributed to
the fact that the participants were non-experts, hence reflecting
some of the participants' incorrect understanding of the actual
task, rather than issues with the application itself (based on a
short debriefing session afterward). Each participant increased in
speed over the course of the experiment as they became more
used to visually interpreting the image stacks and repeating the
basic process of segmenting the neurons.

Acetylcholine had an excitatory effect on 43% or
the n.urons or the bed nucleus ITable I). wi,h a
significantly peater proportion of ,hese reactive
neurons being located in the ventral portion or the
nucleus (8S'Io, P = 0.03). An example or 'his excitÂ·

nucleus responded to ACb in a CUiicnt..depcndent
manner (Fig. 3). The CUllcnt- response characteristics
of the excitatory effCClS or ACh on the neurons
were always monophasic- no biphasic excitatoryinhibitory etfCClS were seen. .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation and maintenance of slices. Coronal brainstem slices containing the posterior cochlear nucleus were prepared from mice (CBA, ICR,
or B5 strains) of ages between 18 and 26 postnatal days. Mice were
decapitated, and the brains were dissected in external saline at 31°C.
External saline contained (in mM): 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.4
C aC l2 , 20 NaHC O3 , 3 H EPES, 10 glucose, and 1.2 K H2PO4 , pH 7.4.
Then the brain was blocked coronally at the posterior edge of the
cerebellum and anteriorly between the inferior and superior colliculi.
The rostral surface of the brain was glued to a Teflon block, and one to
two slices, 200 μm thick, were made of the most posterior pole of the
cochlear nucleus with an oscillating tissue slicer (Frederick Haer, New
Brunswick, ME). Slices were allowed to recover for at least 1 hr submerged in a holding chamber containing oxygenated external saline at
33°C. Slices then were transferred to a recording chamber that was
superfused continuously with oxygenated external saline at ;8 ml/min.
Electrophysiology. Putative octopus cells were visualized directly with
a 63× water immersion lens in conjunction with differential interference
contrast (Nomarski) optics. Whole-cell patch recordings were made with
standard techniques.
Electrophysiological data were recorded with an Axopatch 200A am-plifier in “fast” current-clamp mode and transferred to computer via a
Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Stimulus
generation and data acquisition were performed with pClamp software
(version 6.0; Axon Instruments). Voltages were low-pass-filtered at 5–10
kHz and sampled digitally at 40 – 80 kHz.
Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.2 mm outer diameter),
and the tips were heat-polished on a microforge. The internal pipette
solution in most experiments consisted of (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 5
NaCl, 1 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 11 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.25. In some
experiments Cs-gluconate (140 mM) was substituted for K-gluconate. All
traces have been corrected for a junction potential of 12 and 10 mV for
K-gluconate and Cs-gluconate internal solutions, respectively.
Pharmacological agents were dissolved in external saline and were
bath-applied. Cesium chloride (CsCl), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and
tetrodotoxin (TTX) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). In
external solutions containing 15 mM CsCl, CsCl was substituted for
NaC l in equimolar concentrations to prevent gross changes in osmolarity. In external solutions with no added calcium (nominally calcium-free),
magnesium was substituted in equimolar concentrations for calcium.
When the external concentration of sodium was reduced from 130 to 20
mM, sodium was substituted with choline (Cl- salt), a molecule impermeant to voltage-gated ion channels.
Responses to injected currents of up to 5 nA were corrected off-line for
the voltage drop across the series resistance of the recording electrodes
(<19 MV). Over this range of series resistances the time constant of the
current-clamp amplifier was ;10 times faster than that of the cell
membrane, allowing voltage contributions arising from series resistance
to be resolved adequately from those of the cell membrane. The adequacy of series resistance corrections was assessed by eye for every trace,
and a given series resistance determination was accepted only if it
accurately described responses to a series of positive and negative current pulses of at least five different amplitudes.
Measurements of the apparent membrane time constant were made by
fitting a single exponential waveform to small hyperpolarizations evoked
by current pulses. Outside of this limited voltage range, responses ap-peared more complex and exhibited multiple exponential components.
Even close to rest, responses typically displayed a small depolarizing sag.
In such cases, responses were fit from near the start of the response to the
maximum of the hyperpolarization. The presence of active conductances
in the physiological voltage range also complicated measurements of
input resistance, particularly in the presence of channel blockers. To
facilitate comparison across different experimental conditions, we as-sessed the input resistance of cells within 5 mV negative to the resting
potential. Values of action potential duration reflect measurements made
at their bases.
Histology. All octopus cells were identified morphologically via the
internal dialysis of the cell with a pipette solution that included 0.1%
biocytin (Sigma). In some experiments, T stellate cells bordering the
octopus cell area were labeled. Their morphology and physiology were
distinguished easily from those of octopus cells and were remarkably
consistent with previous studies in slices in which sharp microelectrodes
were used (Wu and Oertel, 1987; Oertel et al., 1990). Slices were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks. Biocytin-filled
cells were visualized with the avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase

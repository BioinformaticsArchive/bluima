the three dimensional space) have been made for axons in the
frog (Bart et al., 2000) and fish (Triller and Korn, 1986).
Innocenti and colleagues made a topological analysis of cortical
axons that project long distances, i.e. callosal axons in the cat
and thalamic axons in the mouse and explored how the
geometry of axons relates to their computation properties
(Innocenti et al., 1994; Tettoni et al., 1998).
Nearly absent from the literature are metrical or topological
comparisons of the axonal arborizations of different cortical
neurons within the same cortical area. While it is clear that
axons of different neural types have different laminar preferences and different lateral extents, what we do not know is
whether these differences are simply variations on a theme, like
different breeds of horses or dogs, or whether they reflect
fundamentally different `species', each with its own rule of
pattern formation. By analogy, simply measuring the dimensions
of axons will not reveal whether they have structural properties
in common. In this paper we compare structures of the axons of
different neurons drawn from a single cortical area, with the aim
of establishing the similarities and differences in the structure of
different axons, beyond the obvious differences of their patterns of laminar innervation and horizontal spread. We therefore include in our analyses metrical parameters, e.g. the
collateral length, and topological parameters, which are sensitive only to the number and structural arrangement of the
collaterals within the tree, e.g. the number of segments between
origin and tip. Analyses of parameters that rely on the 3D shape
of the axonal tree, e.g. the branch angles and branch locations in
the neuropil, are beyond the scope of the present work.
Establishing whether there are relationships between the
different types will contribute to current debates of diversity
versus stereotypy of cortical neurons. These issues are important, because they address implicitly a deep problem: how do
cortical neuronal circuits assemble themselves using a relatively
small amount of genetic instruction? Here we discovered that
axons of different neurons share more topological and metrical
properties than are immediately apparent from their traditional
2D gestalts.

lation by showing that LY294002 can
completely block this effect (Fig. 4 D).
Together, these results demonstrate
that Gi/o-protein, Src-family kinase, PLC,
and PI3 kinase are required for GABAB
receptor-induced Akt phosphorylation,
and may be required for the neuroprotective effect of GABAB receptor in CGNs.

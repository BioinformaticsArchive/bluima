that of V1. While there does appear to be local contribution to a
surface negative VEP component peaking at 80 ms latency, the
most obvious contributions are to a series of positive/negative
def lections occurring between 200 and 300 ms latency and to a
late negative component that peaks between 350 and 450 ms
latency. For most of the later VEP components, the laminar
voltage gradient is sufficiently sharp that an obvious polarity
inversion occurs across the local laminar expanse.

FIG. 4. Plateau in higher-threshold motor units in chronic spinal rats. A:
firing rate of 2 ventrolateral segmental motor units during a continuously
graded dorsal skin stimulation. Note that the firing rate of the low-threshold
unit (control) was graded in a ramp-like profile (as in Fig. 2D), and this rate
was assumed to provide an estimate of the common synaptic input to both
units. The test unit was recruited when this estimated synaptic input was
moderately high (16 Hz; left dashed line), whereas it was de-recruited when the
estimated synaptic input was very low (2 Hz; right dashed line; drop in rate
DF), likely due to a plateau that aided in sustaining the test unit firing. B: the
test and control unit firing rates were averaged in 200-ms bins and plotted
against one another. After a short period during the onset of the test unit firing
(E), the control and test unit firing rates were well correlated (r2 = 0.77; c),
suggesting that there was a common synaptic input to these 2 units. 3,
direction of time; *, the 1st and last points.

The second assumption of the paired-unit analysis method
was that the firing rate of the control unit was linearly related
to its input. Although the linear correlation of the test and
control units in Fig. 4B is consistent with a linear input-output
relation, this assumption cannot be directly tested. It should,
however, be noted that it is unlikely that nonlinearities associated with a plateau activation occurred in the control unit
during the period of analysis (i.e., during the firing of the test FIG. 5. Lack of plateaus in acute spinal rats. Two ventral segmental motor
units recorded in an acute spinal rat. Same format as in Fig. 4A. Note the
unit). That is, the control unit fired for many seconds before the
symmetrical firing of the test unit with respect to the graded firing rate of the
test unit was recruited, at which point the control unit's plateau control unit (estimated synaptic input), suggesting that a plateau was not

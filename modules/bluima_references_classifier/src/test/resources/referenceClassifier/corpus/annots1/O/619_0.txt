Stereotypical synaptic physiology
Stereotypy is not only evident in the
anatomyofthesynapticconnectivity,but
alsoinitsphysiology.Neocortical
synapsesdifferintermsofmultiple
physiological properties, such as the
numberofreleasesites,quantalsizes,
release probabilities and time constants
forrecoveryfromsynapticdepressionand
facilitation [17,18]. Different types of
GABAergicsynapses,withdistinct
physiological properties, have been found
tobeexquisitelyorganizedaccordingto
the particular anatomical and
electrophysiological identities of
bothpre-andpostsynapticcells[19].
Correspondingly,glutamatergicsynapses
formedbypyramidalcellsappeartobe
preciselyorganized,withmostofthe
current evidence suggesting that synaptic
properties strongly depend on the targetcell identity [17,20â€“22]. Such stereotypical
synapticphysiology,togetherwiththe
precise spatial stereotypy shown by
Kozloski et al. [10], could form the basis for
stereotypical computations and
deterministicfunctionsofneocortical
microcircuits.

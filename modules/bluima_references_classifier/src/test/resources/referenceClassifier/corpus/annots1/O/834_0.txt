Figure 3. Morphological characteristics of single cell and connections in the CCP population. (A) Reconstruction of a single CCP showing the untufted apical dendrite and the circles
defining the Sholl distances. Axon in blue and dendrites and soma in red. (B) Dendrite Sholl analysis. The distribution designates the number of times the circle centered on the soma
with a radius of the Sholl distance crosses a dendrite (cf., A) (n = 23). Front in red: CCPs, behind in gray normalized with a factor of 0.51: TTCs (C) Axon Sholl analysis (n = 23),
same as in (B). (D) Distribution of putative contacts in the population. A total of 4.0 ± 0.3 putative contacts per connection (mean ± SEM, n = 14). (E) Distribution of the distance
between the soma and the putative contacts along the dendrites 130 ± 18 lm (mean ± SEM, n = 55). (F) Reconstruction of a pair of connected CCPs. Presynaptic axon in blue
and dendrites in red and orange. Stars show the location of the identified putative contacts (axodendritic contact points with a bouton at the touch site).

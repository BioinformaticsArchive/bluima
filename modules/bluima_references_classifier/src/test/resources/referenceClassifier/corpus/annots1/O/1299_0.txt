Introduction
Granule cells of the dentate gyrus form the first stage of the trisynaptic circuit within the hippocampal formation (Lisman,
1999). They fire action potentials (APs) in a highly specific manner that is dependent on behavioral paradigms, such as spatial
exploration and object recognition during a delayed non-matchto-sample task (Jung and McNaughton, 1993; Wiebe and Sta Ìˆubli,
1999). The sparse and environment-specific activity of granule
cells is believed to be important for the precise separation of
different entorhinal input patterns (Chawla et al., 2005; Leutgeb
et al., 2007). Although dendritic integration of excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic inputs is an important elementary step in this
process (Treves and Rolls, 1992; Lisman, 1999), our knowledge
about dendritic signal processing in granule cells is only
rudimentary.
Dendritic integration and propagation of synaptic potentials
is shaped by several factors, including the morphological structure of the dendritic tree and passive membrane properties such
as the specific membrane resistance (Rm), the specific membrane
capacitance (Cm), and the intracellular resistivity (Ri) (Rall et al.,

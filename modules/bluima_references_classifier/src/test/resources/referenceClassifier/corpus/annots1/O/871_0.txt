FIGUI~ 5. Activation of GIRK1 currents
during steady state signaling by three different pathways. Traces are from oocytes ex- pressing GIRK1 as well as either m2 receptors
(IKach), 5-HTIA receptom (Irg,wr), or Gl31y2
(IK,c~). Voltage was stepped to various levels
after a 900-ms depolarizing prepulse to 0 inV.
Ig.ach and IK.~rr were evoked by agonists (1
I~5"HT I
~M ACh and 100 nM 5-HT, respectively);
whereas Iv~c~represents currents in high K+
I (Ira0 minus those in the additional presence
of 300 I~M Ba2+. Calibration bars denote 0.5
V~ and 500 ms.

New Research Venues

There are a variety of methodologies that can
be used to further study TMT and its implications. Traditional work on related concepts, es-pecially temporal discounting, relied on comparative psychology (i.e., animal research) and
“casino” situations, where expectancy and
value were expressed explicitly, typically in
terms of ratios, dollars, and deaths. Unfortunately, although these situations give a great
deal of control, their limited realism and complexity makes their generalizability suspect (Ba-zerman, 2001). Consequently, we recommend
that two other venues also be considered: a computerized personal system of instruction and
computer simulations.
Since traditional methodologies have been
criticized as potentially unrealistic, there has
been a movement toward naturalistic decisionmaking research (Ku ̈ hberger, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, & Perner, 2002). Ideally, we would like to
test further refinements to TMT on a wide range
of people who are striving at their own pace
toward an important goal in a standardized but
realistic setting where we can precisely but easily measure their behavior. Although this is a
long list of specifications, there is at least one
venue that presently provides all these features—a computerized personal system of in-struction (C-PSI).
A personal system of instructions or programmed learning has been in use for decades,
but a computerized version has several desired
qualities. As used by Steel, Brothen, and Wambach (2001), hundreds of students simultaneously work toward completing a university
course at their own pace, allowing choice and,
thus, motivated behavior. Furthermore, progress
is assessed at an unparalleled number of points
as the course is broken down into numerous
assignments (e.g., seventy-eight), all computer
administered with completion precisely re-corded. Similarly, a host of other observed and
self-report measures can be easily inserted into

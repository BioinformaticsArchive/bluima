Fig. 7. There is a strong correlation between the increase in supragranular layer complexity and the increase in subventricular zone between (A) lizard, (B) mouse
and (C) monkey. The left panels for mouse and monkey are from Fig. 5 from an E15 mouse and an E72 monkey. The right panels represent the layering in the adult.
Ventricular zone and layers VI and V are labelled red, subventricular zone and supragranular layers are coloured yellow. Note that the increase in the complexity of
supragranular layers is accompanied by an increase in the subventricular zone during development. For the sake of clarity SVZ includes ISVZ and OSVZ in the
monkey panel.

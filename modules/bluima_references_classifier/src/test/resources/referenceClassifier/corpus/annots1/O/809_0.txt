9A). As with in vitro recordings (see above; Zhu, 2000; Berger et
al., 2001), the resting membrane potential became progressively
more depolarized when the recordings along the apical dendrite
were made more and more distal from the soma, whereas the
input resistance remained relatively constant along the apical
dendrite (Fig. 9B).
Whole-cell in vivo recordings revealed numerous spontaneous
synaptic inputs in the soma and apical dendrites of layer 5
pyramidal neurons (Fig. 9C). When the spontaneous EPSPs were
large enough, they triggered regenerative potentials. In the apical
dendrite three distinct forms of regenerative potentials were
observed (Fig. 9C). The differences between these three potentials were seen best when the recordings were made from the
corresponding dendritic action potential initiation zone determined in vitro. One form of regenerative potentials had a fast
rising phase and a quick decaying phase (Fig. 9C, top trace), which
we refer to as fast potentials. The second form rose quickly but
decayed slowly (Fig. 9C, middle trace), and we refer to these as
slow potentials. The third form of regenerative potentials ap-peared as a combination of a fast potential and a very slow
potential with one to seven peaks and dips (Fig. 9C, bottom trace).
We refer to these as complex potentials. These three regenerative
potentials also could be separated according to their duration
(Fig. 9D). Whereas fast potentials could last up to 10 msec, slow
potentials ranged from 12 to 18 msec in the distal dendritic trunk
and primary tuft branches. The duration of complex potentials
varied significantly, ranging from 18 to 40 msec. This was attributable in part to the large variation in interval between the fast
and slow component, ranging from 3.4 to 13.7 msec, and to the
large difference in the number of peaks and dips they had. In four
distal dendritic trunk or primary tuft recordings, over 300 spontaneous regenerative events were collected for each recording,
and the relative occurrence of each form of regenerative poten-

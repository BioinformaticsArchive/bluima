Figure 2. Presynaptic P/Q type Ca2) channels are associated with excitatory connections displaying synaptic depression. (A) Plot of the peak amplitude of the first EPSPs
throughout an experiment during which unitary EPSPs were elicited in a FS cells in control, bath application of x-Conotoxin GVIA (1-10 lm), to block N-type calcium channels, x-Agatoxin IVA (0.5-1 lM) which blocks P/Q-type calcium channels and after the addition of nickel chloride (20 lM) to block R-type calcium channels. (B) Average EPSPs elicited in
a FS cell recorded in each of the condition in (A), superimposed. (C) Amplitude histograms of first and second EPSPs during control (black) and Agatoxin (red) are shown. The grey
bars indicate noise.

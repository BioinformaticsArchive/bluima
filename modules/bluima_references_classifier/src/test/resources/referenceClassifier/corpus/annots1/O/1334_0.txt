FIGURE 3 . Measurements of branching angles from the arterial tree of a rat,
where, at each arterial bifurcation, B l is the angle made by the larger branch
and 02 is that made by the smaller branch . The dashed lines represent the best
fit of the data on a statistical basis (linear regression) . The solid curves represent
theoretical results based on the requirements (P) that the pumping power
through the bifurcation be a minimum and (S) that the total shear force on
endothelial tissue be a minimum . Formulas for the two curves are given in
details in Zamir (1978) . A small dash on a data point indicates that there is
another point in the same position . A count of the data points shows that half
the points are within ±17 ° of the curve marked S for e2 and within t9 ° of that
for B I .

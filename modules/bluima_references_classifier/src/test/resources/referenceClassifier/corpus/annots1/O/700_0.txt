Figure 4. PS1 overexpression may modify intracellular distribution of
ABP280/ Fh1 proteins in transfected cells. After Cos-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the f ull-length PS1 protein, cells were
fixed and double-stained, using polyclonal rabbit anti-PS1 antisera ( B)
and the monoclonal antibody NCL-FIL, which recognizes both ABP280
and Fh1 ( A). Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody or
C y3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary was used to detect ABP280/ Fh1 or
PS1 staining, respectively. ABP280/Fh1 staining is shown in A. The four
cells in the center of the picture were expressing high levels of PS1, as
detected by the anti-PS1 antibody shown in B. In cells not transfected by
the PS1 plasmid, ABP280/ Fh1 staining is more uniform throughout the
cytoplasm, whereas the ABP280/Fh1 staining in cells overexpressing PS1
is perinuclear and similar in distribution to that of PS1 protein (compare
A with B).

While they demonstrate relatively preserved language and face
processing abilities, they are typically impaired in visuospatial
domains. In addition, they are hypersociable, with engaging
personality and excessive sociability with strangers (Bellugi et
al., 1999a,b). Neuropathological data on WS are limited to
descriptions of associations with CNS malformations (Pober and
Filiano, 1995) and A D-like changes (Golden et al., 1995). A single
study of one patient by Galaburda and colleagues (Galaburda et
al., 1994) reported several cytoarchitectonical anomalies, which
included a reduction in columnar organization throughout
the cortex, abnormal neuronal orientation and a generalized
increase in cell packing density. These findings appeared to
be more severe in posterior cortical regions, where there was a
decrease in volume (Galaburda et al., 1994), as had previously
been shown by quantitative neuroimaging (Jernigan et al.,
1993). As the authors of both publications point out, this topographic distribution of severity of abnormalities is in general
agreement with the WS cognitive phenotype. In conclusion,
preliminary data indicate that in WS there is selective cortical
hypoplasia associated with cytoarchitectonical features previously described in unclassified MR and DS (reduced laminar
organization and abnormal neuronal orientation), and in autism
and RS (increased neuronal cell packing density).
The second MR-related disorder in which cytoarchitectonics
suggests dendritic abnormalities is R-TS. With an approximately
similar incidence in the general population to RS (Moser, 1995),
this condition is characterized by MR and a specific pattern of
somatic abnormalities. The initial description by Rubinstein and
Taybi (Rubinstein and Taybi, 1963) emphasized short stature,
facial dysmorphia, broad thumbs and first toes, and MR. More
recent work has demonstrated a wider spectrum of physical and
neurologic abnormalities, which include deficits in expressive
language and maladaptive behavior (Stevens et al., 1990). The
genetic defect in R-TS (16p13.3) has been reported to involve
cyclic A MP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding
protein (CBP) (Petrij et al., 1995), a protein that is recruited
by CREB to bind DNA and activates the basal transcription
factorâ€“enzyme complex (Kaufmann and Worley, 1999). Limited
neuroimaging and neuropathologic investigations have shown
an association between R-TS and several CNS malformations,
such as agenesis of the corpus callosum (Stevens et al., 1990),
Dandy-Walker malformation (Bonioli et al., 1989) and cortical
clefts (Sener, 1995). The most comprehensive neuropathologic
evaluation of a R-TS brain was carried out by Pogacar and
collaborators (Pogacar et al., 1973). These authors reported one
adult male case (33 years) with mild reduction in brain weight,
preserved general cortical architecture, but decreased neuronal
size and a marked increase (semi-quantitative) in cell packing
density. As the latter findings closely resembled those reported
in RS (Kaufmann et al., 1998), a reduction in dendritic arborizations appears also to be a feature of R-TS.
Two other relatively frequent genetic disorders, neurofibromatosis-1 and tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville disease, BD),
usually present with mild MR or learning disorders (Harrison et
al., 1999; Ozonoff, 1999), and display focal cytoarchitectonic
abnormalities suggestive of dendritic pathology. Direct dendritic
evaluations have been carried out only in BD. Cortical tubers, the
hallmark lesion in BD, are foci of disrupted laminar cortical
architecture containing large and disorganized cells. Ferrer and
colleagues (Ferrer et al., 1984) and Machado-Salas (MachadoSalas, 1984) demonstrated that tubers consist of maloriented
pyramidal neurons, with simplified structure and aberrant
dendritic branches and spines. Moreover, large numbers of

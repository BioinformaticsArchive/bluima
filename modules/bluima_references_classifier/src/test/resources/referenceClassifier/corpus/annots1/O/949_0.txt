tials (APs) supported by dendritic Na channels (Waters et al.,
2003; Waters and Helmchen, 2004) and have a concomitant in-flux of calcium ions (Svoboda et al., 1999).
Studies of dendritic excitation have focused on the large thicktufted L5 neurons mainly for technical reasons. Although direct
patch-clamp recordings from the apical dendrite of L5 neurons
have become a routine technique (Gulledge et al., 2005), similar
experiments on L2/3 neurons are more difficult because of their
thinner dendrites. Here, we have overcome this difficulty by
combining infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC)
with fluorescence microscopy for guidance of patch pipettes. This
approach enabled us, for the first time to our knowledge, to ob-tain simultaneous recordings from the somata and apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in brain slices of rat somatosensory cortex.
These dual recordings permitted us to study the subthreshold
attenuation of synaptic potentials generated in the tuft as they
spread toward the soma as well as the ability of the apical dendrite
to actively participate in suprathreshold dendritic signaling.
L2/3 neurons receive their input predominantly from other
L2/3 pyramidal neurons and L4 spiny stellate neurons (Lu Ìˆ bke et
al., 2003; Binzegger et al., 2004). These inputs project almost
exclusively to the basal and apical oblique dendrites. Inputs to the
apical tuft are thought to be feedback connections from higher
cortical areas and nonspecific thalamic nuclei (Felleman and Van
Essen, 1991). These connections show synaptic depression (Walcott and Langdon, 2001), can elicit APs, and can be potentiated by
theta-burst stimulation (Walcott and Langdon, 2002). In L5 neurons, distal inputs can induce AP bursts via dendritic Ca 2 spikes

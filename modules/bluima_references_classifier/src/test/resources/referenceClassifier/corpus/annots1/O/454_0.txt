Fig. 2. Serotonergic (5-HT) afferents anterogradely labeled by Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin [black immunoperoxidase reaction product in axons, Ni2Ãž-intensified 3-30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as chromogen] from the median raphe nucleus. These afferents form multiple contacts (arrows) on the somata and dendrites of cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing (a) and calbindin (CaBP)-containing (b) interneurons (brown immunoperoxidase reaction product, DAB used as chromogen) in the stratum radiatum
of the rat hippocampus. Scale bars, 20 mm.

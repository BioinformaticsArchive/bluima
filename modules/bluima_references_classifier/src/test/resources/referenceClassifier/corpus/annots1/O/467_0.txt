ous Open IE systems return the uninformative
(Faust, made, a deal)
instead of
(Faust, made a deal with, the devil).
This type of error is caused by improper handling
of relation phrases that are expressed by a combination of a verb with a noun, such as light verb
constructions (LVCs). An LVC is a multi-word ex-pression composed of a verb and a noun, with the
noun carrying the semantic content of the predicate (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Stevenson et al.,
2004; Allerton, 2002). Table 2 illustrates the wide
range of relations expressed this way, which are not
captured by existing open extractors. Our syntactic
constraint leads the extractor to include nouns in the
relation phrase, solving this problem.
Although the syntactic constraint significantly re-duces incoherent and uninformative extractions, it
allows overly-specific relation phrases such as is of-fering only modest greenhouse gas reduction targets
at. To avoid overly-specific relation phrases, we in-troduce an intuitive lexical constraint: a binary relation phrase ought to appear with at least a minimal
number of distinct argument pairs in a large corpus.
In summary, this paper articulates two simple but
surprisingly powerful constraints on how binary re-lationships are expressed via verbs in English sentences, and implements them in the REVERB Open
IE system. We release REVERB and the data used in
our experiments to the research community.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes previous work. Section 3 defines our
constraints precisely. Section 4 describes REVERB,
our implementation of the constraints. Section 5 re-ports on our experimental results. Section 6 concludes with a summary and discussion of future
work.
2 Previous Work
Open IE systems like TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al.,
2007), WOEpos, and WOEparse (Wu and Weld, 2010)
focus on extracting binary relations of the form
(arg1, relation phrase, arg2) from text. These systems all use the following three-step method:
1. Label: Sentences are automatically labeled
with extractions using heuristics or distant su-pervision.

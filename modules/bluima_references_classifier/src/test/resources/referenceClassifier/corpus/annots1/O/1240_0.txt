The network frequency was measured for every half-center network in
addition to the burst duration, duty cycle, spike frequency within each
burst, and the number of spikes per burst in the biological neuron. To
determine the regularity of each half-center network we calculated the
autocorrelation for the neuron's membrane potential (an autocorrela-

Separation of ionic current into INa and IK
The results so far described suggest that the ionic current during a depolarization consists of two more or less independent components in parallel, an
early transient phase of current carried by sodium ions, and a delayed longlasting phase of current carried by potassium ions. In each case, the direction
of the current is determined by the gradient of the electro-chemical potential
of the ion concerned. It will clearly be of great interest if it is possible to
estimate separately the time courses of these two components. There is enough
information for doing this in data such as are presented in Fig. 2, if we make
certain assumptions about the effect of changing the solution around the axon.
If we compare the currents when the axon is in the low-sodium solution with
those in sea water, the membrane potential during the voltage clamp being
the same in both cases, then our assumptions are:
(1) The time course of the potassium current is the same in both cases.
(2) The time course of the sodium current is similar in the two cases, the
amplitude and sometimes the direction being changed, but not the time scale
or the form of the time course.

(3) dt =0 initially for a period about one-third of that taken by INa to

reach its maximum.
The first two of these assumptions are the simplest that can be made, and
do not conflict with any of the results we have described, while the third is
strongly suggested by the form of records near the sodium potential, as pointed
out on p. 454. These points are sufficient reason for trying this set of assumptions first, but their justification can only come from the consistency of the
results to which they lead. The differences between the effects of lack of compensation, and of the polarization phenomenon, in the two solutions, referred
to at the end of the last section, will of course lead to certain errors in the
analysis in the later stages of the ionic current.
The procedure by which we carried out this analysis was as follows:
(1) Three series of voltage clamp records at a range of strengths were taken,
the first with the axon in one of the solutions chosen for the comparison, the
second with the axon in the other solution, and the third with the first
solution again. Such a set of records is reproduced in Fig. 2.
(2) Each record was projected on to a grid in which the lines corresponded
to equal intervals of time and current, and the current was measured at a series
of time intervals after the beginning of the voltage change.

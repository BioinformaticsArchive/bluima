of the GLUT-l gene in brain microvascular endothelium with
minimal, if any, expression of this gene in neuropil.
Since it is known that there are at least four members of
the sodium-independent glucose transporter supergene family
(1, 2), it is important to perform a quantitative analysis of
the cellular GT binding sites and to determine what percent
of total glucose transporter activity is performed by an individual functional glucose transporter isoform (1). The availability of human red cells as a source for purifying relatively
large amounts of GLUT-l (28, 29), and the observation that
both the red cell and the BBB GT isoform exhibit identical
mobility and heterogeneity on SDS-PAGE (Figs. 1 and 2)
allowed for the present development of quantitative Western
blotting. These studies, in conjunction with the cytochalasin

Estrogen decreases the number of vesicles adjacent to the
presynaptic membrane
Subsequently, we considered the possibility that estrogen produces a change in presynaptic boutons that could limit GABA
release. A total of 373 axosomatic boutons forming 510 inhibitory
synapses (OVX O, 166 boutons forming 219 synapses; OVX E,
207 boutons forming 291 synapses) that were completely contained within our series were used to quantify bouton volume,
presynaptic density area, and vesicle number, density, and location. Boutons contained only partially within a series were ex-cluded. The number of synapses is greater than the number of
boutons because some boutons form multiple synapses. With the
exception of vesicle location (see below), none of the measured
parameters was significantly affected by estrogen (Table 1). As
observed for excitatory synapses in the hippocampus (Harris and

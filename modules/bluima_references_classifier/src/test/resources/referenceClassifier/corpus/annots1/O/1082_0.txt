roles of Kv1 channels in neocortical pyramidal neurons. J Neurophysiol 97: 1931–1940, 2007. First published January 10, 2007;
doi:10.1152/jn.00933.2006. Pyramidal neurons from layers II/III of
somatosensory and motor cortex express multiple Kv1 -subunits and
a current sensitive to block by -dendrotoxin ( -DTX). We examined
functional roles of native Kv1 channels in these cells using currentclamp recordings in brain slices and current- and voltage-clamp
recordings in dissociated cells. -DTX caused a significant negative
shift in voltage threshold for action potentials (APs) and reduced
rheobase. Correspondingly, a ramp-voltage protocol revealed that the
-DTX–sensitive current activated at subthreshold voltages. AP width
at threshold increased with successive APs during repetitive firing.
The steady-state threshold width for a given firing rate was similar in
control and -DTX, despite an initially broader AP in -DTX. AP
voltage threshold increased similarly during a train of spikes under
control conditions and in the presence of -DTX. -DTX had no
effect on input resistance or resting membrane potential and modest
effects on the amplitude or width of a single AP. Accordingly,
experiments using AP waveforms (APWs) as voltage protocols re-vealed that -DTX–sensitive current peaked late during the AP
repolarization phase. Application of -DTX increased the rate of
firing to intracellular current injection and increased gain (multiplicative effects), but did not alter spike-frequency adaptation. Consistent
with these findings, voltage-clamp experiments revealed that the
proportion of outward current sensitive to -DTX was highest during
the interval between two APWs, reflecting slow deactivation kinetics
at 50 mV. Finally, -DTX did not alter the selectivity of pyramidal
neurons for DC versus time-varying stimuli.

length, as perceived from the somatic recording electrode, are increased (383). Similarly, the overall input
resistance is decreased by the addition of spines. In fact,
in multicompartmental computer models of reconstructed neurons, spines are sometimes accounted for
simply by increasing dendritic membrane capacitance
and conductances (305, 696, 712). The addition of spines
therefore increases the impedance load posed by the
dendritic tree on the soma, thus rendering AP backpropagation less reliable (802) (see sect. IIB). Moreover, the
addition of spines reduces the length constant, which
diminishes the amplitude of EPSPs at the soma as well as
the degree of spatial summation (336). This scenario
changes, however, if spines contain active conductances
(reviewed in Refs. 618, 686, 781), in which case spines
may promote AP backpropagation (44, 336). Also, if
spines are electrically isolated from the parent dendrite
and at the same time contain voltage-dependent ion channels, spikes that are spatially confined to the spine may
even be evoked (686). Indeed, hippocampal pyramidal
neurons (78, 656, 685, 867), neocortical pyramidal neurons (552), as well as Purkinje cells (179) are known to
contain VDCCs in spines. There is also evidence for K
(78, 554) and Na channels in spines (642, 781). Recently,
Bloodgood and Sabatini (78) estimated that synaptic in-put locally depolarizes the spine, along with its parent
dendrite, several tens of millivolts relative to the soma.
Their results demonstrate that synaptic stimulation can
be enough to activate voltage-dependent ion channels in
spines (cf. Ref. 552).
Finally, another possible function of spines is that
they serve as biochemical compartments, which remain
diffusionally relatively isolated from the parent dendrite
(252, 292, 383, 557, 758, 869, 871). As we shall see in the
next section, this view is well supported, although there
are also other ways than using spines to biochemically
compartmentalize the dendrite (252, 292).

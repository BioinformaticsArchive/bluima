The records of instantaneous frequency in Text-fig. 2 show responses of
the primary ending of the same spindle as Text-fig. 1 to stimulation at
100/sec of each fusimotor axon. The discharge from the spindle has been
recorded only during the first 660 msec of stimulation. After the onset of
m1 Y2' y3 and y4 stimulation the discharge reaches the maximum frequency
respectively in 46, 31, 109 and 109 msec. The mean frequency of firing
after 05 sec of stimulation is respectively 76/sec (A), 106/sec (B), 61/sec
(C and D). The primary ending discharge exhibits some adaptation in the
record A. In record B each stimulus evokes one afferent spike (driving).
Some irregularities in the firing rate are noticeable chiefly in record A and

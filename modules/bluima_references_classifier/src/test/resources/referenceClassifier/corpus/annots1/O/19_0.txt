be attributed to our observations parallel to the myofilament, as Maughan and his collaborators measure radial
diffusion in muscle fiber (Maughan and Lord, 1988;
Maughan and Wegner, 1989), and Ju ̈rgens and his collaborators measure the lateral diffusion after protein microinjection into muscle fiber (Ju ̈ rgens et al., 1997) and obtain
similar results. Therefore it appears that the diffusivity of
proteins is higher in cultured muscle cells than in native
muscle fibers. This observation confirms that despite the
high organization of the cultured cells, with a sarcoplasmic
reticulum in place, they are not as well organized as a true
muscle. The cell characteristics are those of a young muscle
rather than of an adult one.
Several theoretical models were developed to describe
the diffusion of particles in the presence of obstacles in
two-dimensional systems (Qian et al., 1991; Saxton, 1993,
1994). These models are suitable for diffusion in membranes (2D) but are not applicable to intracytoplasmic diffusion (3D). Han and Herzfeld (1993) predicted that, under
conditions in which proteins can be approximated by hard
particles, the hindrance of globular proteins by other proteins at a given volume fraction is reduced when the background proteins are aggregated, and the hindrance is further
reduced if rodlike aggregates are aligned. A more elaborate
model for obstructed diffusion in three dimensions was
proposed recently by Olveczky and Verkman (1998). The
latter model considered small objects in a well-organized
space; it was applied to molecular transport in the aqueous
lumen of organelles, and the application to mitochondria
might be transposed to muscle cells. The authors reached
the following conclusions: 1) for short times, the diffusion
hindrance imposed by immobile obstacles is negligible; 2)
for long times, on the other hand, the presence of multiple
barriers impedes the diffusion of large particles. The latter
phenomenon can be detected only if photobleaching experiments are carried over sufficiently long periods, i.e., if
fluorescent molecules can diffuse over long distances. This
is likely because Seksek et al. (1997) observed fluorescence
recoveries for short periods without following fluorescence
intensities until full recovery, and because they obtained
relatively free and rapid diffusion of macromolecule-sized
solutes up to at least 500 kDa. Hence they could conclude
that the cytoplasm is not so crowed that solute motion is
seriously impeded. In fact in the recent article of Olveczky
and Verkman (1998), the authors concluded, as a recommendation, that measurements of solute diffusion in or-ganelles by photobleaching methods should be carried out
over long time intervals to reveal anomalous diffusion as-sociated with spatial heterogeneity.
In the present study, as well as in our former investigation
(Arrio-Dupont et al., 1996), sample illumination by several
10 –17- m fringes represented an observation involving
many sarcomeres of 2.5 m. With the exception of nuclei
regions, where large macromolecules do not penetrate, fluorescence distribution after microinjection and equilibration

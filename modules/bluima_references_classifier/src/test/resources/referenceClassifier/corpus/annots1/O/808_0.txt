Figure 1. Dendritic and axonal morphology of typical CR cells. A1â€“A3,
Light microscopic images of biocytinfilled CR cells showing the heterogeneity in their dendritic morphology with
respect to the length of the stem dendrite, side branches, and frequency of
spine-like appendages. The CR cell in
A1 has a relatively high number of side
branches and spine-like appendages (in-dicated by arrows); the CR cell in A2 has
a single smooth stem dendrite; the CR
cell in A3 is an example with a shortstem dendrite terminating in a terminal
tuft-like structure with short spine-like
appendages. Scale bars: A1, 20 m; A2,
A3, 25 m. B1, B2, Axonal projections
of typical CR cells. The main axon
emerges directly from the soma, running parallel to the pial surface with
short collaterals that form periodically
spaced cluster-like structures. The en-tire axonal arborization is confined to
layer 1. The f ramed area in B2 is shown
at higher magnification in B3. Scale
bars: B1, B2, 50 m. B3, High magnification of a cluster-like axonal arborization with an axonal growth cone (asterisk). Scale bar, 10 m. B4, Axonal
growth cone of a CR cell axon in layer
1. Note the typical filopodia. Scale bar, 5
m. All figures are oriented such that
the pial surface is on top.

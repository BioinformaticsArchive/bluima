cilitates the sequential activation of caspases
within macromolecular complexes (7â€“9).
However, the molecular mechanisms of ac-tion that enable S-nitrosylation to regulate
signal transduction through these complexes
remain poorly understood. We therefore conducted a two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library
derived from cytokine-activated murine macrophages [which are frequently used to study
the involvement of NO in apoptosis (10)] in
the presence of NO. We initially screened 4
million transformants for proteins that interact with procaspase-3 (bait). Thirty-five
clones were isolated, from which prey plasmids retransfected into the bait strain caused
at least threefold increases in growth in the
presence but not the absence of NO. No
growth was seen in yeast transformed with
either bait or prey vector alone. Seventeen of
these 35 clones showed NO-dependent
growth a third time; 2 of 17 clones also
showed at least threefold activation of lacZ
transcription, an independent reporter of protein-protein interactions, in the presence versus absence of NO (P 0.001). Thus, these
clones both activated lacZ transcription and
conferred histidine prototrophy in an NO-dependent manner. One of these clones contained a partial sequence (amino acids 158 to
927) of the apoptosis-related enzyme, acid
sphingomyelinase (ASM) (Fig. 1A). These
data establish the principle of NO-inducible
protein-protein interactions.
To enable rapid large-scale screening, we
developed an alternative method of genomic
two-hybrid analysis in which Escherichia
coli were transformed with plasmids pooled
from yeast transformants that were previously grown for several days in histidine-deficient medium, supplemented continuously
with NO (5). Growth in liquid medium circumvented the requirement for large numbers
of plates, and thus for upfront processing of
individual clones, and provided better control
over NO delivery. The prey plasmids were
isolated and retransfected into caspase-3 bait
strains, whose NO-dependent growth was
then assessed individually. About 1800 E.
coli colonies were derived from a screen of
4 million transformants; 499 of these contained prey plasmids, of which 50 appeared at
least twice as determined by Hae III diges-

For the PPI task, the MINT and IntAct interaction database
provided the data collections. For both databases, trained
domain experts manually extract relevant interaction information from the literature to fill in structured database
records, after detailed reading of full text articles. In general,
there are three basic strategies for selection of articles for

or databases; exhaustive curation of a specific set of journals

eubacteria. The age of the oldest known extinct eukaryotes, Crypania sipiralis, was estimated to be about 2 billion years ago,
whereas the oldest traces of ancient life on the earth are believed
to be approximately 3.6 billion years old [71].
A standard mathematical analysis of the reconstructed phylogenic tree derived from the intron-exon organization of the hu-man ALDH genes strongly suggests that ALDH genes evolved
from an ancestral intronless gene by intron insertion, rather than
by a series of intron deletions of an ancestral gene with introns
[72].
A very early appearance of ALDH is not surprising, since a
non-specific ALDH with a broad substrate specificity was essential to protect early life on the ancient earth which was rich in
varieties of highly reactive and toxic aldehydes. A general role
of the present day human ALDH isozymes, which display di-verse tissue and subcellular distributions, is still detoxification
of biogenic and xenobiotic aldehydes existing in given tissues.
ALDHs with more specialized activities had evolved from
the ancestral ALDH. ALDH1, ALDH6 and the recently identified ALDH11 which have high activities for oxidation of retinal, had evolved together before the radiation of multicellular
organisms.
ALDH3 and ALDH10, which may be involved in the metabolism of membrane lipids, had evolved together during the pe-riod of appearance of mammals. Meanwhile, two distantly re-lated enzymes, i.e. ALDH4 which participates in 4-Abu synthesis, and SSDH which participates in 4-Abu degradation, were
separated much earlier.
We apologize to many investigators whose work on ALDHs
were not cited because of space limitations and because their
work is beyond the scope of this review.

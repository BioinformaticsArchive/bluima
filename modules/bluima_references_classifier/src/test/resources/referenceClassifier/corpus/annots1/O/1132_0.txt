were associated with ion channel activity.
Overall, 27 ion channels were upregulated
and 13 ion channels were downregulated
over the course of maturation (Fig. 3). In
particular, voltage-gated potassium channels were enriched among upregulated
genes, whereas voltage-gated sodium
channels and voltage-gated calcium channels were overrepresented in the set of
downregulated genes.
These developmental changes in ion
channel expression likely manifest as corresponding changes in G42 intrinsic membrane properties. We therefore characterized G42 electrophysiological maturation
by performing whole-cell current-clamp
recordings in the presence of synaptic
blockers from identified G42 cells in acute
cortical slices containing primary motor
cortex and S1 at P7, P10, P15, and P25. The
mature FS phenotype is characterized by
high firing rates ( 200 Hz), narrow spikes
relative to other neocortical cell types, and
little or no spike-frequency adaptation
(McCormick et al., 1985) (Fig. 4, rightmost trace). Consistent with previous
studies of FS interneuron development in
layer 4 (Itami et al., 2007) and in dentate
gyrus (Doischer et al., 2008), we found that
these mature features emerged slowly and
monotonically over development (Fig. 4)
and that immature G42 neurons are electrophysiologically distinct from the ma-ture state. The characteristic lack of adaptation during repetitive firing, for
instance, emerged between P10 and P15,
and G42 cells at P7 exhibited pronounced

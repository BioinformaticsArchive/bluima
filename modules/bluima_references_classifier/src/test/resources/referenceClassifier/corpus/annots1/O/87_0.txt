B. Skeletal Muscle
Motor neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells, resulting in membrane depolarization and Ca2 influx
through voltage-gated L-type channels. The Ca2 influx
then activates ryanodine receptors (RyR1) in ER
membranes closely apposed to the plasma membrane.
Ca2 released from the ER then binds troponin, re-sulting a conformational change that is transmitted
from troponin to tropomyosin, thereby unmasking my-osin-binding sites on actin filaments (Rome, 2006).
Relaxation occurs when intracellular Ca2 levels re-cover toward basal levels; recovery of Ca2 levels is
mediated in part by ATP-dependent Ca2 uptake into
the ER via SERCAs. Skeletal muscle cells predominantly express SERCA1a, although slow-twitch cells
also express SERCA2a.
The critical importance of ER Ca2 handling in skeletal muscle cells has been established by the identification of mutations in RyR1 as the cause of inherited
disorders that manifest abnormalities in skeletal muscle
cells. Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by an unusual and dramatic
metabolic response to volatile anesthetics, with symptoms that include a rapid rise in body temperature,
skeletal muscle contracture, and damage and lysis of

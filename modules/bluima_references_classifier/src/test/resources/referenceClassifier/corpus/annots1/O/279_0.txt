Deletion of V1 neurons leads to slow walking. Recordings of drug-induced (5-HT plus NMDA)
locomotor-like activity in E18.5 spinal cords from wild-type (control), Pax6-/-/, and En1-DTA mice.
The circular plots show that the left-right (lL2-rL2) and flexor-extensor alternation (lL2-lL5) are normal
in both Pax6-/- and En1-DTA mice. The speed of locomotion is, however, dramatically reduced in the
mutants as compared with wild type. Adapted from Gosgnach et al. (2006) (with permission from Nature

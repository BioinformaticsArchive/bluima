usually swollen at one end and tortuous in nature. Cell
bodies of AD neurons also appeared shrunken and less
numerous than the control brains.
Upon quantification a 50% reduction in the number
of spines was observed for human hippocampal AD tissue as compared to control tissue ( P = 0.020) (Fig. 4B).
In addition total dendrite area of the AD tissue covered
42% less area than the control tissue although this result
did not reach statistical significance.

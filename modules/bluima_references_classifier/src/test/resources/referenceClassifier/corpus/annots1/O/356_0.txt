VARIABLE GROWTH MODES
Growth has been described so far as a stochastic
process with probabilities determined by _xed values
for the parameters Q and S[ If the probability scheme
for the branching segments changes during growth\ it
is to be expected that the growing trees will show a
deviating course for the asymmetry index[ Conse!
quently\ it can also be expected that the total
variation in asymmetry values is larger than expected
for a single "constant# growth mode[
The e}ect of non!stationarity in growth on tree
asymmetry mean and standard deviation is illustrated
for six di}erent patterns of variable growth modes
"Fig[ 5#[ A sudden change in growth mode can result
in an abrupt decrease Fig[ 5"a# or increase Fig[ 5"b#
of the tree asymmetry expectation\ or in an
alternating pattern for two changes in succession
Fig[ 5"c#[ The grand!mean of the asymmetry index
"i[e[\ the mean value over the full degree range# has a
value for these growth patterns which is in between
the expected values for the constituting growth
modes[ The grand!S[D[ value "i[e[\ the standard
deviation over the full degree range# is clearly larger
than the S[D[ value for the constituting growth modes[
Both the grand!mean value and the increase in
grand!S[D[ depend on the particular growth patterns\
i[e[\ the growth modes involved and the number of
growth steps for each of them[
Growth patterns in which uniform random choices
for the parameters Q "within 9\0# and:or S "within
9\1# are made at each growth step result in a
substantial increase in tree asymmetry variance\ in
comparison with the single growth mode expectations
Figs 5"df#[ For instance\ in the random Q example
in Fig[ 5"d#\ with a grand!mean of 9[564\ the
grand!S[D[ value of 9[060 is more than doubled in
comparison with the S[D[ value in the single growth
mode "9[970# that produces the same mean asymme!
try expectation see table 2 in van Pelt et al[ "0881#[
For the example in Fig[ 5"f#\ the grand!S[D[ value is
almost 1[4 times larger than the single growth mode
grand!S[D[ value[ These examples show that growth
patterns with changing schemes for the branching
probabilities of the segments result in an increased
variation in the asymmetry of the tree types[ For the
random Q and:or S modes\ the mean asymmetry
index\ dependent on the particular growth scheme\
does not show a clear dependence on the degree\
which resembles the _ndings for single mode curves[

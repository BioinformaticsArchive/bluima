Postnatal development of the rat cortex is characterized by the
gradual development of many calcium-dependent processes which
demand a precise control of the intracellular levels of this cation;
when the balance is disturbed, neuronal death ultimately ensues.
Calretinin (CR), a calcium-binding protein, has been postulated to
have a neuroprotective capacity by buffering intracellular calcium.
This putative relationship between CR and neuroprotection is still,
however, a controversial issue. With a view to shedding further light
on this subject, we studied the temporal and spatial distribution of
CR in five different regions (the frontal-, sensorimotor-, parietal-,
temporal- and occipital region) of the rat cortex during postnatal
development. Qualitative and quantitative immunocytochemistry of
newborn, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-day-old and adult rats revealed a
profound increase in the density of CR-positive neurons during the
first two postnatal weeks in all regions examined. At the end of this
period, CR-immunoreactive cells decreased sharply to adult levels.
Cell classes exhibiting transient CR-immunoreactivity during the first
two postnatal weeks included cells in layer I (amongst which were
Cajalâ€“Retzius cells), the subplate and pyramidal-like cells in the
upper portion of layer V, most of them found in the motor cortices.
The above-described dynamics of CR expression were reflected also
in the biochemical analysis performed (immunoblotting, ELISA). The
temporal and spatial correlation with calcium-dependent events
such as synaptogenesis, neurite elongation and remodelling further
support the contention that CR may play a neuroprotective role
during postnatal development of the rat cortex.

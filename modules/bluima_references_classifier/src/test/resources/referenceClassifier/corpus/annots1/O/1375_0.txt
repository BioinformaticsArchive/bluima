mization poses a computational problem
for biology that is admitted to be
intractable, and requires implausible
mechanisms. The alternative is easy to
implement biologically, and invokes only
the existing theories and observations of
neurobiologists to explain the facts.
Nervous systems lack the ubiquitous
regularities that would be expected by
CPO, while the regularities that do exist
have simpler and better explanations.
Unless Cherniak can adduce some theoretical and experimental evidence in
favour of his model over simpler ones, we
are entitled to conclude that there is no
such biological process as componentplacement optimization in the brain.
Further exploration of the difficulties
of component-placement optimization
theory is presented on the World Wide

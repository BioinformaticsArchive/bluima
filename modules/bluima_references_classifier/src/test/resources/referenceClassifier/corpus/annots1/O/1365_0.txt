locking [9]. In the cortex, Abeles and colleagues [10]
have found correlated firing between neurons in the
monkey cortex. That is, a spike in one neuron sometimes
reliably predicts the spike in another, to a temporal precision of one to three milliseconds; sometimes the second
spike occurs more than a hundred milliseconds after the
first. Similarly, Gray and Singer [7] have found synchronous firing that depends on the animal's attentional state.

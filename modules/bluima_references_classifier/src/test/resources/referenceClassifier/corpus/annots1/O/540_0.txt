identifies UMLS metathesaurus terms in text, is
generally used as the gold standard for evaluating
these tools. Our choice for Mgrep was made based on
criteria for flexibility, speed and scalability as
described before. Note that CONANN is very similar
to OBA and is also available online. CONNAN aims
to identify the best possible matches, whereas Mgrep
in the OBA identifies the greatest number of
concepts. Plus, CONANN uses term frequency to
filter results. However, CONNAN is limited to
UMLS and does not perform any semantic expansion
step. Indeed, the knowledge contained in ontologies
is rarely used to expand annotations, which gives to
OBA a significant advantage. Note that the use of
ontology semantics to enhance search is an active
area of research.[5,,18]

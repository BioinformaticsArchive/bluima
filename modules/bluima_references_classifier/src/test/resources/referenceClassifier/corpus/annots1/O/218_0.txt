responses. The maximal rate of rise of the potential has been as high as
50 V/sec .(Fig. 7B), but such a steep onset has always quickly terminated in
the still steeper rise characteristic of the spike action potential (cf. Fig. 3 D).
However, this all-or-nothing response did not usually occur with gradients
below 30 V/sec. As shown in Figs. 4 and 7A there was an approximately
exponential decay from the summit with a half-time that usually ranged from
2-5 to 3-5 msec. However, as shown in Fig. 8 A, with high amplification and
slow recording, the initial membrane depolarization reversed to a very slight
hyperpolarization, which in its time course resembled the positive afterpotential that followed the spike response (Fig. 5). Repetitive synaptic
activation was followed by a larger positive after-potential just as was
observed by Eccles & Rall (1951a) with ventral root synaptic potentials
(Fig. 8B).

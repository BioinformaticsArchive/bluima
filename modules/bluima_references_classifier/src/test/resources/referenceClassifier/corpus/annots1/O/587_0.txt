of shared properties. As the number of matching contexts grows, the weight for each
additional matching context also grows. Figure 1 compares the behavior of ESP and CSM
as the number of shared properties between two strings increases. Holding the number of
extractions fixed and assuming boolean vectors for CSM, it behaves as a linear function
of the number of shared properties. On the other hand, the ESP has the shape of a
thresholding function: it has a very low value until a threshold point around k = 10, at
which point its probability estimate starts increasing rapidly. The effect is that ESP has
much lower similarity scores than CSM for small numbers of matching contexts, and much
higher scores for larger numbers of matching contexts. The threshold at which it switches
depends on n1 and n2, as well as P1 and P2, but we can show experimentally that our
method for estimating P1 and P2, though simple, can be effective. Experiments in Section
6 compare the ESP model with CSM, as computed using Equation 5.

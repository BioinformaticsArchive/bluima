2.2.1. Central Linear Medialness

An example of a central linear medialness function is the linear convolution

graph of the kernel and medialness of a binary object at small, medium, and large scale. This medialness

is extensively used in [16, 17] for extracting anatomic objects with nonparallel sides, approximately

uniform interiors, edges of fixed contrast polarity, and possibly low signal to noise ratio in portal

radiographs, CT scans, MR images, and other medical images.

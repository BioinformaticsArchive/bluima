Figure 7. In estrogen-treated animals at the 48 2 time point, synaptically
evoked I PSC amplitude has recovered to baseline values and is greater
than that in oil-treated controls. Recordings were made with a C sC l
internal solution. A, Representative individual traces of I PSC s evoked in
a 48 2O cell using 50, 100, 150, and 250 A stimulating currents. B,
Representative individual traces of I PSC s evoked in a 48 2E cell using the
same stimulus intensities as in A. Evoked currents are blocked by bicuculline. decay fast and decay slow values in A and B apply specifically to the
cells shown. C, Averaged stimulusâ€“response curves for 3DO ( gray circles;
n 12 cells from 6 animals), 48 2O (white circles; n 20 cells from 10
animals), and 48 2E (black circles; n 22 cells from 10 animals) groups.
There is no difference in peak I PSC amplitude between 48 2E and 3DO
groups ( p 0.1), whereas I PSC amplitude is significantly reduced in the
48 2O group compared with both 48 2E and 3DO groups ( p 0.01).

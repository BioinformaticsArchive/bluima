Discussion
Our results show that the strength of excitatory GABAergic
synapses in layer I is reduced during the first postnatal week.
This developmental weakening of GABAergic transmission
results from an A1R-mediated decrease of GABA release probability. Presynaptic A1Rs are upregulated between P2 and P5 and
are tonically activated by endogenous adenosine derived from
nonsynaptically released ATP.

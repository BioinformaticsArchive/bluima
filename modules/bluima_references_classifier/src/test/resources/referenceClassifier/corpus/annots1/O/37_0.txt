parameters were optimized as above, and the goodness of fit was
assessed over the rising phase as domoate was binding to the
receptors (5 μM, first 150 msec; 10 μM, first 100 msec; 20 μM, first
40 msec). In the absence of CTZ, the SSEs for the two-site model
were smaller than for other models by factors of 15 6 4 (one-site)

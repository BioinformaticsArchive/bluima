Our findings revealed that the dendrites of presumed NOS-containing and cholinergic LDT cells
have a simple structure in terms of their number and
their degree of branching, and are in accordance with
previous descriptions of these cells. In addition, we
found a heterogeneity of dendritic process types;
processes can range from smooth to varicose and can
be aspiny or sparsely spiny. This variability occurs
between dendrites of a single cell and between segments of a single dendrite, indicating that individual
cells, or even individual dendrites, may process information in a variety of ways. Moreover, the presence
of dendritic varicosities suggests that the dendrites of
these neurons may subserve a local signaling role.
The irregularities in dendritic diameter, as well as
the variability in morphotonic path lengths and Rall
ratios, preclude the use of an equivalent cylinder
approximation for analysis of the electrotonic structure of these cells. The use of such an approximation
would result in errors in the membrane parameters
determined, as well as failing to allow an analysis of
the functional implications of the dendritic heterogeneity. The relative simplicity of these cells make it
computationally practical to implement an analysis
that incorporates the morphological detail described.
The incorporation of the observed dendritic irregularities in such a model would allow for further
analysis of their role in synaptic integration.

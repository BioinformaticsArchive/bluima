Time of neuron origin
Heavily labeled neurons, representing cells that have entered
their last cell division at the time of [ 3H]TdR injections, were
found in layer I of all postnatal animals injected between E38 and
E94 (Figs. 1, 2; Table 1). If the injection was made after this
embryonic period, no heavily labeled cells with neuronal characteristics could be detected in layer I of adult animals although the
production of glial cells continues well into the postnatal ages as
in the other cortical layers (Rakic, 1985). Thus, neurons compos-

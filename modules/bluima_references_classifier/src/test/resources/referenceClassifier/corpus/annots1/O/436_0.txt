6 Independent coders assisted in the aggregation of responses to these domains. Inter-coder reliability was
high, well over 90%. Obviously, the choice of nine categories (as versus 8, 10, etc) is more difficult. By
chance, the distribution across domains is roughly equivalent, which is useful statistically and provides
some support for the idea that we have in fact arrived at a reasonable scheme. The heterogeneity of
responses within domains varies somewhat. The domain, News and Economy, for example, contains the
following kinds of answers: Economy of the country, Stock market, Political things such as the stock
market, Daily news, Economical development in the Third World, Stock market fall, Economy in North
Carolina livestock, Situation in Middle East (oil), and so on. Specific assignments of topics to domains are
available on request.

survival of genetically damaged cells (28, 29). ARH1 mutation
seemed to result in loss of G1 control. Moreover, the lack of
ARH1 in cells led to more rapid proliferation and tumor
formation in nude mice. Loss of ARH1 activity resulted also
in spontaneous tumorigenesis. Thus, ARH1 function may
influence the G1-S phase of cell cycle and thereby affect growth.
Checkpoint control of S phase prevents the cell from
replicating damaged DNA (28). p53-dependent regulation of
replication is important in tumorigenesis (28). Cells with DNA
damage rapidly increase p53 protein levels by a posttranscriptional mechanism (30, 31), and loss of 1 or 2 p53 alleles has
been shown to induce tumors in mice (32, 33). However, no
significant difference was observed in p53 protein expression
/ /)dm, and ARH1/)wt cells
among ARH1 mock, ARH1
(data not shown). Thus, p53 protein expression may not be
related directly to the mechanism of tumorigenesis in ARH1deficient cells.
Posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation) of proteins (e.g., p53, ras, Fox) can regulate cell
proliferation and tumor development in mice (34, 35, 36).
Posttranslational modifications of p53 by phosphorylation,
acetylation, and ubiquitination influence protein stability, and
transcriptional activity, with effects on cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis (34). Poly (ADP-ribosylation) of proteins by
nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) contributes
to DNA repair, carcinogenesis, chromatin functions, and
genomic stability (37). In this manner, posttranslational modifications are involved in disease pathogenesis by altering
protein function. In a similar manner, dysregulation of
mono-ADP ribosylation of arginines in proteins by ARH1
can affect cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.

after fixation, which resulted in mixed activation of knee extensors and ankle flexors during stimulation. On the right side, the
first six electrodes produced bilateral or contralateral responses.
Electrode tip placement in lamina X, close to the central canal
was found to be a cause.
In cat 4, an unknown problem caused seemingly identical
responses in almost all electrodes. The movement was a strong
persistent whole-limb extensor synergy, induced during testing
of virtually every electrode. Interestingly, direct stimulation
through the intramuscular EMG electrodes also caused this
extensor synergy, even when stimulating flexor muscles. The
behavior of this cat before the terminal experiment was qualitatively similar to the other cats, giving no indication, a priori,
that unpredictable responses to intraspinal and intramuscular
stimulation could be expected.

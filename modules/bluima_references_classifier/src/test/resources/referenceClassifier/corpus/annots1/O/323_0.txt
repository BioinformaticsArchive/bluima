diastolic force shifted upward by almost 10* by
the end of the experiment. In that case,
interpolated values were used for calculations.
Resting force at experimental lengths averaged
26% of total force. This value is slightly high,
although it is within the range reported by others.
In one experiment each systolic release was
followed by a diastolic release. Results were
essentially identical.

the plots, it is clear that in these very young layer I neurons the
hyperpolarization-activated sag response was very pronounced.
After the first postnatal week, the sag response began to decline
rapidly and the peak and steady-state voltages were similar (Fig.
6C). In the third postnatal week, the sag was quite small (Fig. 60).
In all cells tested from PN6 to PN15 (n = 8), the sag was blocked
effectively by 1 mM extracellular Cs ' .

Fig. 1. Recording of action potentials in two single fibres. A, D and B, E,
intra-axonal records of potentials set up by stimulation of the lateral
funiculus 60 mmaway fromtherecordingpoint (superimposed traces) and by
pulses passed through the recording micro-electrode (averaged records)
respectively. C and F, averaged records from the surface of the lateral
funiculus taken simultaneously with records in B and E. Right-hand traces
in B, C, E and F show the same records as the left-hand traces with an ex-panded time scale. The averager was triggered by the spikes in B and E
(128-256 averaged sweeps; 20 ,sec/address). The two fibres run in the
dorsal and in the lateral funiculus respectively, their position being indicated
by arrows in the diagram H, which shows (filled circles) the location of the
whole sample of analysed fibres as well. In this and the following figures the
negativity is downwards in micro-electrode recording and upwards in
surface recording (except in Figs. 7 and 8).

branch number increased by 49%, from 47 ± 3.1 in the light reared
group to 70 ± 5.6 in the dark reared group (P < 0.01, anova; Tukey's
post-test) and dendritic spread increased by 39.7%, from
17.75 × 103 lm2 in light-reared turtles to 24.8 × 103 lm2 in the dark
reared group (P < 0.01, anova; Tukey's post-test). Surprisingly,
unlike in other conditions, somatic areas also significantly changed,
increasing by 24.25%, from 111.3 ± 4.6 lm2 to 138.3 ± 6.1 lm2
(P < 0.01, anova; Tukey's post-test). On the other hand, dark rearing
did not affect dendritic growth in small field RGCs (Table 2).
When retinas were chronically exposed to curare from S26 and
turtles reared in the dark, the effect of dark rearing was counteracted in
large field RGCs (although only two cells could be classified as `large
field' cells according to the double median criterion; Table 2, Figs 8B
and 9E–H). Indeed, both the branch number and the total dendritic
length were significantly lower than in cells from dark-reared animals
(P < 0.05 for both, anova, Tukey's post-test). Their cell bodies were
also smaller than in dark-reared cells, but the difference was not
significant.

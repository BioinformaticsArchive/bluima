Figure 4. Electrical synapses can regulate spiking. A, Simultaneous re-cordings from a coupled TRN cell pair. Traces on the lef t show repetitive
firing in cell 1 as it received a 100 pA pulse of depolarizing current; cell
2 received no current. Traces on the right show how a hyperpolarizing
current step of 300 pA delivered to cell 2 reduced the duration and
frequency of spiking induced by the same 100 pA stimulus to cell 1. B,
Simultaneous current steps applied to a coupled pair (coupling coefficient
of 0.1) evoked repetitive firing in both. Note the small spikelets in cell 2
during intervals of spike silence; each spikelet coincided with a spike in
cell 1. C, Cross-correlogram of the spiking in the pair shown in B shows
a sharp, narrow peak centered on 0 msec.

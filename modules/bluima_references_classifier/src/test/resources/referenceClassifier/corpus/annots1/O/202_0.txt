(one of eleven tested cases); however, it was absent from almost half of the fasttwitch muscle units as well (valid for twenty-three of fifty cases, including units with
low fatigue resistance; Fig. 2A). Thus, in our material, a fast vs. slow classification
on basis of sagging behaviour would give markedly different results from a
classification based on measurements of the twitch time course and fatigue resistance.

cells lining the olfactory, lateral, and third ventricles and the
cerebral aqueduct. This suggests potential roles for OCT3 in
regulating transport between brain and CSF. OCT3 expressed
in ependymal cells may be part of a clearance mechanism in
which OCT3 transports bioactive compounds, including
monoamines, into the CSF, which acts as a high-capacity
sink. Indeed, we previously demonstrated OCT3-mediated
monoamine transport in the medial hypothalamus in tissue
minces containing ependymal cells from the third ventricle
(Gasser et al., 2006).
OCT3-ir fibers. Our studies revealed strong OCT3 immunostaining in fibers in only three areas. This may indicate that
OCT3 is expressed predominantly in glial cells or neuronal
perikarya. However, we might have underestimated the num-

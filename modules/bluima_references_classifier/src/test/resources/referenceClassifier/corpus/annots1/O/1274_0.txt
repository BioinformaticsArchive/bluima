cell were obtained by taking the reciprocals
of the interspike intervals during the stimulus trains). The individual cell histograms
for each experiment were then summed to
generate population histograms. Last, in-stantaneous firing frequency was converted to entrainment ratio by dividing it
by the stimulus frequency (e.g., an instantaneous frequency of 10 Hz in response to
10 and 20 Hz stimulus trains would result
in entrainment ratios of 1 and 0.5,
respectively).
For most stimulus frequencies, population histograms had multiple peaks with
locations that corresponded to integral ra-tios of the stimulus frequency (i.e., instantaneous frequency/stimulus frequency
1:1, 1:2, 1:3, etc.). Nevertheless, in most
cases, one peak was dominant. Thus, the
histograms were separated into four categories based on the location of their highest peak, as follows: 1:1, histograms with
their largest peak at an entrainment ratio
of 1; 1:2, histograms with their largest peak
at an entrainment ratio of 0.5; other, histograms with their largest peak at other in-tegral ratios (e.g., 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, etc.); and
none, noisy histograms with no prominent peaks, indicating the lack of a dominant entrainment pattern. An example of
each of the four categories is shown in Figure 7A.
The proportion of population histograms falling into a particular category
varied with stimulus frequency. The probability distributions are shown in Figure
7B. The distributions indicate that the
lowest tested frequencies (4 â€“5 Hz) often
failed to entrain CS activity, with 60% of
the histograms failing to show a dominant
peak in response to 4 Hz stimulation.
Above these frequencies, however, almost
all instantaneous frequency histograms
had at least one peak indicative of entrainment. It should be noted that the failure of
entrainment with 4 and 5 Hz stimulation is
unlikely to have resulted from a failure to

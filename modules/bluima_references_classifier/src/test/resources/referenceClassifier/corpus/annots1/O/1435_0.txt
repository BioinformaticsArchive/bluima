onto film or another electron-sensitive spatially resolving
detector. Specimens are typically thin slices that are cut from
blocks of plastic-embedded tissue, with the resulting electron
micrographs providing a two-dimensional cross section
through the tissue. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(Ardenne 1938a, 1938b), in which a tightly focused beam of
electrons is raster-scanned over the specimen while secondary or backscattered electrons are detected, is used in
biological imaging mostly as a surface visualization tool,
creating a 3D appearance but no actual 3D datasets.
Truly 3D information in the TEM can be obtained using
either tilt-series-based tomography (Hoppe 1981; Frank 1992;
Baumeister 2002) or serial ultrathin sections (Sjostrand 1958;
Ware and Lopresti 1975; Stevens et al. 1980). Tomography is a
very promising technique for obtaining high-resolution
structural data of macromolecules, organelles, and small cells
but may not be applicable when larger volumes need to be
reconstructed, because section thickness is limited to around
1 lm. In the high-voltage EM, somewhat thicker sections can

Abstract
Correct positioning of cortical neurons during development depends on the radial migration of the projection neurons and on the
coordinated tangential and radial migrations of the subcortically generated interneurons. As previously shown, a transient and
moderate maternal deficiency in thyroxin during early corticogenesis alters the radial migration of projection neurons. To determine if
a similar effect might also affect tangential migration of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived neurons at the origin of cortical
interneurons, explants of MGE from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic embryos were implanted into flat cortical mounts
from wild-type embryos. The distances covered and the preferential migration (medially) of GFP-MGE neurons from embryos of
hypothyroxinemic dams are not affected in their tangential migration into wild-type control cortices. In contrast, when GFP-MGE
neurons from embryos of control or hypothyroxinemic dams migrate within cortices from embryos of hypothyroxinemic dams, the
GFP-MGE-derived neurons lose their preferential direction of migration, although they still migrate for long distances throughout
the cortex. Our results show that maternal hypothyroxinemia alters the tangential migration of GFP-MGE-derived neurons in the
neocortex of the progeny and suggest that this alteration is not derived from the migratory neurons themselves but through undefined
short- and long-range cues responsible for the guidance of their migration.

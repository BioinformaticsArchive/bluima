What are the effects of intravitreal APB injections
begun before the ferret cortex is visually responsive
and continued through the normal period of cortical
orientation selectivity maturation?
Ferrets received daily intravitreal injections of APB designed to
yield a vitreal concentration of 350 or 700 μM starting on PND 21,
when some spontaneous but no visually driven activity can be
recorded in the cortex (Chapman and Stryker, 1993) and continuing through PND 45–54 when cortical orientation tuning is adultlike (Chapman and Stryker, 1993; Chapman et al., 1996). Twentyfour to 48 hr after the last eye injection, optical imaging showed
no orientation-specific activity in the primary visual cortex in all
eight treated animals (Fig. 3). Microelectrode recordings in visual
cortex were performed to look for visually driven activity. Five to
10 radial microelectrode penetrations through the entire depth of
visual cortex were made in each hemisphere in each of the eight
animals. Recordings were obtained at 20 μm intervals. No visually driven activity was seen. This result appears to be attributable to effects of the APB treatment on the development of the
cortex itself and is not attributable to damage to the retina or
changes in the LGN. Retinal histology from treated animals
showed normal morphology (Fig. 4 A), and LGN recordings from
two ferrets in each APB concentration group showed normal ON
and OFF responses at the time of the experiments (Fig. 4 B). Four
control animals were given daily intravitreal 0.9% saline injec-

lacking the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL
(Shindler et al., 1997). To test whether
other members of the Rho GTPase subfamily could also induce apoptosis, constructs expressing myc-tagged wild-type
Rac1 or cdc42 cDNAs were transfected
into acutely isolated E16.5 cortical neurons. In distinct contrast to RhoA, neither
of these constructs showed any influence
on apoptotic levels (Fig. 7H ).

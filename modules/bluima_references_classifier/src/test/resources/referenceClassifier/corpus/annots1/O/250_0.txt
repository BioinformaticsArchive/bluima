Conduction velocity
Eccles & Sherrington (1930) demonstrated that the extent to which a motoneurone
branches prior to entering its muscle is related to the axon diameter. This observation led
them to speculate that the larger motoneurones may innervate a correspondingly greater
number of muscle fibres. The importance of axon diameter in determining conduction
velocity is well known (Waxman, 1980) and correlations with both motor unit force and the
time course of the isometric twitch have subsequently been described in the medial
gastrocnemius (Burke et al. 1973; Proske & Waite, 1974), lumbrical (Emonet-Denand,
Laporte & Proske, 1971) and flexor digitorum longus muscles (Bagust, Knott, Lewis, Luck
& Westerman, 1973) of the cat and in the rat tail muscle (Andrew & Part, 1972). However,
these correlations are not universal and in the rat soleus such a relationship is found only
with the contraction time of the isometric twitch (Andrew & Part, 1972). Furthermore, the
largest FF units within the cat medial gastrocnemius are served by axons with conduction
velocities that are generally less than the smallest FR units (Proske & Waite, 1976). Where
differences in conduction velocity have been reported between motor unit types there is
typically no within-group correlation with either the twitch time to peak or motor unit force
(Andrew & Part, 1972; Proske & Waite, 1976). The absence of any difference in
motoneurone conduction velocities between the motor unit categories of the rat medial
gastrocnemius is, therefore, not unusual. Although the range of conduction velocities
recorded in the present study was similar to previously published data from 10- to 13-monthold rats (Kanda & Hashizume, 1989, 1992), the motor axons of FF and FR units reportedly
have higher conduction velocities than those innervating S units in middle-aged rats.
Interestingly, in the study by Kanda & Hashizume (1989) differences between unit
categories in their axonal conduction velocities were lost again by 26-30 months of age.

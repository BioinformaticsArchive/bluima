in the mammalian CNS.32,33,40–42 An interaction network
involved in calcium signaling that contains the intracellular
calcium channels ryr2 and itpr1 and the calcium transporter
atp2a2 is shown in Figure 4. Protein–protein interactions from
the network diagram are represented by single lines, and
proteins that regulate another protein are indicated by arrows.
Solid or dashed lines indicate direct or indirect interactions,
respectively. The various shapes represent different protein
functions: enzymes (diamond), kinase (inverted triangle), ion
channel (dashed rectangle), transporter (trapezoid), and other
(circles). For example, the ion channel itpr1 interacts directly
with slc8a1, homer1, atpb21, and exoc4 and is directly regulated
by ank2. The ion channel ryr2 and transporter atp2a2 are also
regulated indirectly by ank2. Additionally, ryr2 and atp2a2
interact directly with S100A1 and slc8a1, respectively. Representative MS/MS spectra validating the presence of the ER-specific ion channels and transportes are shown in Figure 5,
and a complete list of calcium channels and transporters with
critical importance to neuronal function along with their
corresponding abundance index calculated based on spectral
counting are listed in Table 2. Independent evidence from the
present study supports numerous previous studies that had
identified localization and functional relevance of ER-resident
transmembrane proteins, which mediate calcium signaling in
CNS neurons such as ryr2, itpr1, and atp2a2. This represents
a good indicator for the usefulness of the technologies and
data of the present study in that previous biochemical, cell
biological, immunochemical, and electrophysiological data
sets had been corroborated.33,40–42 Similarly, associated
proteins of such key calcium signaling proteins that were
positively identified by the present study such as for example
homer 1 had been characterized as physically and functionally interacting with ER-resident transmembrane proteins
involved in calcium signling.32,34,35 Therefore, the presented
analysis of a tissue- and organelle-specific subproteome
allows targeted identification and functional localization
analyses at three levels: cataloging and determination of
relative abundance of (a) ER-resident proteins, (b) proteins
en route to other organelles such as plasma membrane and
mitochondria, and (c) proteins physically associated with ER-resident proteins. Especially the latter finding argues for the
sensitivity of the assay and the advantages of the chosen
conditions that allow preservation of protein conformation
and protein–protein interactions prior to proteome analyses.

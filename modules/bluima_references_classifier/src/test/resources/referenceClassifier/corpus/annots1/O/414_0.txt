FIGURE 2 | Physiological classification of SOM neurons. (A) Ward's method
of hierarchical unsupervised clustering based on 19 electrophysiological
variables applied to 36 SOM positive interneurons. The first 2 principal
components were retained for cluster analysis. The x-axis of dendrogram
shows individual cells and the y-axis represents the linkage distance measured
by Euclidean distance squared. Open circles indicate the centroid cell of each
cluster. Black brackets outline the clusters statistically significant at the 5%
level and a horizontal line indicates this cut-off linkage distance. Group 1
(Martinotti cells) are shown in purple, group 2 in orange and group 3 in green.

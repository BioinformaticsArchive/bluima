Figure 3. Simulations suggest that the inductive phase component of the RCh circuit is dependent on passive and h-channel properties. A, RCh circuit representing a single compartment neuron
model, with the h conductance as the only active mechanism. B, Illustration of the measurement. The plot shows the impedance phase profile of the RCh obtained with maximal h conductance,

activation occurs for the h channel (E), activation/deactivation time constant of the h channel (F ), specific membrane resistivity (G), and capacitance (H ). D–H are plotted for two different values
of g to illustrate that each of these plots scale up with increase in g (C), without change in their respective functional forms. The dependencies, with respect to each of these parameters, of

Molecular control of dendritic targeting
Recent studies indicate that transcriptional control plays a
pivotal role in regulating dendritic targeting in the
antennal lobe [57]. The abnormal chemosensory jump 6
(acj6) gene encodes a POU-domain transcription factor
that is expressed in all ORNs [58]. Drifter is another POUdomain transcription factor in Drosophila that is required
for the proper development of multiple tissues [59].
Interestingly, Acj6 and Drifter are expressed in anterodorsal and lateral projection neurons (adPNs and lPNs),
respectively. MARCM analyses indicate that Acj6 or drifter
loss-of-function mutations lead to less specific dendritic
targeting of either adPNs or lPNs in the antennal lobe.
Because ectopic expression of Acj6 or Drifter can change the
specificity of dendritic targeting of lPNs or adPNs, it would
be interesting to identify the direct downstream targets
that are regulated by Acj6 and Drifter. Cell-surface
molecules are probably among the most interesting
candidates that control dendritic targeting in the olfactory
system. Down syndrome cell-adhesion molecule (Dscam)
regulates the axonal targeting of a subset of ORNs [60]. It
would be interesting to test whether this cell-surface
molecule might also control the dendritic targeting of
projection neurons to glomeruli and mediate the recognition between specific ORNs and projection neurons.

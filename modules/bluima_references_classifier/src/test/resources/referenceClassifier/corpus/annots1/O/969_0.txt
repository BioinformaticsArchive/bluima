Statistical analysis

The data were expressed as mean ± SEM. They were also evaluated
by Student's t-test and one-way anova as appropriate. The threshold
level of significance for all analyses was P < 0.05. To estimate the
EC50 and maximal response, the concentration–response curve was
fitted with a least squares regression using a logistic equation:
y = ax / (x + b), where a is maximal effect; x is drug concentration and
b is the concentration attaining half-maximal effect.

the V0 of soleus type I fibres following four months of bed rest without exercise. In the

Trappe et al. (2004) study, a high resistance exercise countermeasure completely

prevented the decline in V0. The authors hypothesized that unloading with no exercise

induces a decline in type I fibre V0, while with exercise countermeasure programs, type I

fibre V0 is elevated. A comparison of our short and prolonged duration space flight

studies, both of which employed exercise countermeasures, suggests that the situation is

more complex. Clearly, fibre V0 changes with unloading are dependent not only on the

exercise countermeasure (amount of resistance and lengthening contractions) but the

duration of unloading. Unlike fibre diameter and force, the effect of space flight on fibre

V0 was not different in the low and high treadmill exercisers as both groups showed the

same decline. It is clear that the exercise countermeasure used on the ISS did not prevent

the decline in fibre V0.


Fibre Power


The post-flight peak power was depressed in all fibre types and both muscles

studied, and with the exception of crew member F, the decline was greater than that

observed for peak force. By far the greatest contributor to the loss of peak power in all

but the fast type II gastrocnemius fibres was atrophy and the resulting loss of force. For

example, the post-flight soleus slow type I fibre developed only 54% of the peak power


-1
obtained pre-flight. When corrected for CSA (expressed as Watts L ) this increased to

87%. The fast type II fibres from the gastrocnemius were an exception in that force was

not altered and the 20% drop in post-flight peak power was attributed to a reduced

velocity.

Three populations of sPSCs, consisting of fast AMPA receptormediated sPSCs, slow NMDA receptor-mediated sPSCs and
chloride-driven GABAA receptor-mediated sPSCs were previously characterized in SPn (Hanganu et al. 2001). The effects
of mAChR activation on the glutamatergic and GABAergic
populations of sPSCs were investigated by separating them
using selective receptor antagonists. GABAA receptor-mediated
sPSCs recorded after blockade of glutamatergic synaptic transmission with CNQX and CPP were significantly (P = 0.023)
increased in their frequency from 0.27 ± 0.06 Hz to 1.35 ± 0.23
Hz (n = 16) following muscarine application (Fig. 8B,C). The
significant (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P < 0.05 to P < 0.001)
leftward shift in the cumulative probability plot of sPSCs
interevent interval (Fig. 8Ci) documented the muscarineinduced increase of frequency. The amplitude (control 15.6 ±
1.5 pA, muscarine 14.6 ± 1.1 pA) (Fig. 8Cii), rise-time (control
4.5 ± 0.4 ms, muscarine 4.1 ± 0.3 ms), or decay-time (control
31.6 ± 1.6 ms, muscarine 33.2 ± 3.3 ms) of these sPSCs were not
significantly changed (n = 16). To address the question to what
extent the muscarine effects were dependent on APs, the

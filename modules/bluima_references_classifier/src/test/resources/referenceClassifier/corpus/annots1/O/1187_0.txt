standard pipeline as well, but during training they
would have to be extracted using the gold standard
instead of the actual predictions made by the classifiers,
as they would be extracted during testing. While it is
possible to use cross-validation to train a pipeline on its
own predictions, however this is rarely done in practice.
Finally, SEARN can be adapted to learn a pipeline of
independently trained classifiers. To achieve this, b must
be set to 1 so that there is only one iteration, the features that are dependent on previous actions must be
removed, and the cost for each action must be set to 0
if it follows from the gold standard, or to 1 otherwise.
This adaptation allows for a fair comparison between
SEARN and a pipeline of independently learned
classifiers.

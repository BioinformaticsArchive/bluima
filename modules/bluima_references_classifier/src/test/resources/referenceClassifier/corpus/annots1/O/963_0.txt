MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLICE PREPARATION AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
350 μm thick coronal slices from 14-day-old C57BL/6 mouse
visual cortex were prepared using a Leica VT1000-S vibratome
with a cutting solution containing (in mM): 27 NaHCO ,
3

1.5 NaH PO , 222 Sucrose, 2.6 KCl, 3 MgSO , 0.5 CaCl . Slices

were incubated at 32°C for 30 min and then kept at room temperature for at least 30 min before transferring them to the
recording chamber. The recording chamber was bathed in ACSF
(pH 7.4), kept at room temperature and saturated with 95% O
2

and 5% CO , containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 MgSO ,
24
2 CaCl , 1.1 NaH PO , 26 NaHCO , and 10 dextrose. For volt-2 24 3
age-clamp recordings, 2 μM TTX, 10 μM NBQX, and 20 μM
APV were added to the ACSF in most cases. Unless indicated,
neurons were held at 0 mV membrane potential. Whole-cell
electrodes (5–7 MΩ) were used. All voltage-clamp recordings,
except those shown in Figures 2C,D were performed with
intracellular solution (pH 7.25), containing (in mM): 115 Cs-methanesulfonate, 20 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 2.5 MgCl , 4 Na -ATP,

0.4 Na-GTP, 10 Na -phosphocreatine, 0.6 EGTA, and 0.1 Alexa

Fluor 594. The voltage-clamp recordings shown in Figures 2C,D
were done with intracellular solution (pH 7.25), containing (in
mM): 135 K-methylsulfate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 2.5 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 0.1 Alexa Fluor 594. For current clamp
recordings, no drugs were added to the ACSF, and pipettes were
filled with intracellular solution (pH 7.25) containing (in mM):
128 K-methylsulfate, 10 HEPES, 4 MgCl , 4 Na-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP,

10 Na-phosphocreatine, 3 ascorbic acid, and 0.1 Alexa Fluor 594.
We performed recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells
using MultiClamp 700B (Molecular Devices) amplifiers, and
acquired the signals through a National Instruments PCI 6259
board with custom Matlab and C++ software. All the analysis
was done using custom Matlab-based software.
mIPSCs were recorded at 0 mV of holding potential in cells
voltage-clamped with cesium-based intracellular solution.
Sucrose-evoked mIPSCs were recorded during the 2 s following a 50 ms 1 M sucrose puff delivered with a 2.5 MΩ patch
pipette placed at the surface of the slice, ∼20 μm away from the

Dendritic and axonal patterns and molecular markers of NG
cells in the SLM
The results reported here arise from recordings from 71 single
neurons and 70 pairs of neurons that had the appearance of NG
cells when visualized by biocytin (Fig. 1 A, B). The characteristic
features of these neurons were a round cell body and short, nonspiny dendrites (Fig. 1C1) that were arranged in a stellate pattern
around the cell body, spatially localized to the SLM, and often
entered the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The main stem
dendrites branched profusely close to the soma, giving the dendritic field a bushy appearance. In addition, the axons of NG cells
were usually recovered in horizontal slices and characteristically
densely arranged and occupied a greater area than the dendrites.
The main axon branched profusely close to the soma, producing
a dense arbor that is a hallmark of the cell (Fig. 1C2). Further-

the local cortical architecture, especially if the stronger
connections are distributed uniformly among neurons.
Naturally, this description is not complete, and future studies
should investigate whether stronger synaptic connections are
distributed among neurons uniformly or belong preferentially to ``hub'' neurons. Also, studies involving larger
networks of neurons will be needed to provide a more
complete understanding of the network structure and
function.
Although broad distribution of synaptic connections
strength has been seen in the cortex [6,11] and in the
cerebellum [39], heavy-tailed distributions have not been
suggested as suitable fits previously. For example, in the feedforward projection from granule to Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum, the distribution was fitted by a truncated
Gaussian distribution, argued to be optimal for information
storage [40]. It would be interesting to see if analogous theory
could be developed to explain the lognormal distribution
seen among the layer 5 pyramid recurrent connections.
Another relevant observation is that of mini-EPSC amplitudes [41], which were fitted by a Poisson distribution based
on a binomial model of the data. In this case, however, we are
looking at direct unitary connections between pairs of
neurons rather than individual synapses, and such direct
connections between nearby cortical neurons are typically
comprised of multiple individual synapses [6,21,34,42].
Evoked and spontaneous release may also produce different
synaptic strength distributions because the underlying
molecular mechanisms are different. Alternatively, the
lognormal distribution could depend on network activity
patterns not present in dissociated cultures.
To illustrate the possible impact of the skeleton of strong
connections on the network dynamics, let us consider a local
network of layer 5 neurons occupying the 300 lm × 300 lm
area. According to Peters et al. [43], there are 4,480 thick
tufted layer 5 neurons under 1 mm2 of cortex, and therefore
400 thick tufted neurons in the considered network. With a
connection probability of 0.11, each neuron receives inputs
from 44 others. If distribution of connection strength is
uniform among neurons, then each neuron has only about
2–3 connections in the greater than 2-mV range. If the
corresponding 2–3 presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously,
they may drive the postsynaptic neuron to fire. This suggests
that a sparse skeleton of strong connections may drive the
dynamics of the network. An exceptionally strong connection
(>10 mV) may alone drive a postsynaptic neuron to fire.
Suprathreshold EPSPs have been observed previously with
paired recordings [37,44,45] and with calcium imaging [46].
However, such connections occur with a very low probability
(about 1/1000, estimated from lognormal distribution), meaning that there are only about 20 of such connections in the
considered network and that therefore most neurons do not
have them. Finally, inhibitory neurons may make it more
difficult to drive a postsynaptic neuron to fire and need to be
investigated.
Because the highly influential, strong, and reliable (Figure
S8) synaptic connections in the network are few in number,
their exact connectivity pattern and properties might therefore be important and make firing patterns of the involved
cortical neurons highly reproducible. This may be manifested
in the simultaneous activation of several neurons in
organized patterns during spontaneous and evoked activity

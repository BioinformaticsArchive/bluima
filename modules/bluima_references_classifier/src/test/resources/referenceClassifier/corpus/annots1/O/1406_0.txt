Tectal BDNF increases overall RGC dendritic
arbor complexity
We observed that increasing tectal BDNF levels increased the
number of RGC primary dendrites as well as dendritic branching,
thus increasing dendritic arbor complexity. It is possible that
RGC s, in an attempt to achieve a targeted total dendritic arbor
surface input area, could compensate for the increased dendritic
complexity by extending shorter dendrites. To determine whether
alterations in dendritic arbor length correlate with the increase in
dendritic arbor complexity, we compared the total arbor length of
RGCs exposed to BDNF-treated, control, or anti-BDNF-treated
microspheres at the tectum (Fig. 2C). Tectal BDN F significantly
increased RGC total dendritic arbor length (172.1 15.4% of
control; p 0.03), whereas anti-BDN F significantly decreased
dendritic arbor length (56.4 5% of control; p 0.001). Total
dendritic arbor length was increased by exogenous BDN F and
was decreased by neutralizing endogenous tectal BDNF in manners similar to those observed for total branch number and
primary dendrites. Thus, modulating tectal BDNF levels en-hances primary dendrite extension and secondary branching, and
these increases correlate with an increase in the total RGC
dendritic arbor length.

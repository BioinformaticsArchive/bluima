Primary axon growth cones pause in regions in which
axon branches later develop
Cortical growth cones in living brain slices of the corpus callosum
undergo complex pausing behaviors involving repeated bouts of
collapse, retraction, and forward extension in regions in which
cortical axon branches subsequently develop. This contrasts with
steady, rapid forward growth in regions of the callosum in which
the same axons do not branch (Halloran and Kalil, 1994). To
determine whether specific growth cone behaviors are consistently associated with extension of cortical axon branches, we
imaged cortical axons and their growth cones at varying intervals
of 3– 6 hr over periods of 4 –5 d. The sequence of images in Figure
4 shows the entire history of a region of the axon, including
changing positions of the primary growth cone and development
of axon branches. During a 30 hr time period (45–75 hr) this
primary growth cone underwent repeated cycles of collapse,
retraction, and extension without any net forward extension. The
distance over which these behaviors occurred averaged 70 μm.
We define these as growth cone-pausing regions. In the next 45 hr
several branches subsequently developed on the axon within the
region of growth cone pausing. From observations of several
hundred axon regions, 58 that met our criteria (see Materials and

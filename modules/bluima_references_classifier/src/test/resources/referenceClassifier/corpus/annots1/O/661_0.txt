DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to elucidate the neural elements of the
microcircuitry within the VMH that exhibit estrogen-induced
neural plasticity. Previous work has shown that estrogen increases
dendritic spine density in the VMH (Frankfurt et al., 1990). Our
results go beyond these original observations in three important
ways. First, within the VMH the induction of spines is subdivision specific. Second, although the dendritic arbors of V M H
neurons are simple, anatomical evidence exists for dendrite specialization. This is supported by the finding that estrogen specifically induces spines in short primary vlVMH dendrites. Third,
spine induction by estrogen occurs on neurons that, based on
immunostaining, do not express nuclear estrogen receptor-α.
Each of these findings is discussed in turn.
Initial studies used Golgi impregnation to define the morphology of VMH neurons (Szentagothai et al., 1968; Millhouse,
1973b, 1979). Our results with Lucifer yellow-filled cells revealed
morphological features similar to those described, particularly
with regard to cell size, dendrite number, and dendrite length
(Szentagothai et al., 1968, Frankfurt et al., 1990; Millhouse,
1973b, 1979). Overall, somewhat higher spine density values were
obtained with L ucifer yellow cell filling (100 –300 spines/mm)
than have been detected with Golgi (50 –200 spines/mm) (Frankfurt et al., 1990; Frankfurt and McEwen, 1991a). A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that Golgi-impregnated cells were
analyzed using camera lucida drawings under light microscopy,
whereas the Lucifer yellow-filled cells were visualized using confocal microscopy, which allows the detection of spines that would
otherwise be obscured by the dendrite. Overall, these two techniques provide comparable morphological results.
Our observation that estrogen-induced spines are localized to
the vlVMH is noteworthy, given the evidence that this subdivision is involved in female sexual behavior. Sexual behavior selectively induces immediate early gene expression in the vlVMH but
not the dorsal VMH (Flanagan et al., 1993; Pfaus et al., 1993;

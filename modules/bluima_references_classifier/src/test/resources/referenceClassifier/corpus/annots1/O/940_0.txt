Two-Neuron Patterns
We started by assessing how well a randomly connected
network [33] describes our dataset. In this model, the
existence of a connection between any two neurons is
independently chosen with a uniform probability p
(Figure 2A). We test the predictions of this model by
classifying all simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons into
three classes: unconnected, unidirectionally connected, and
bidirectionally connected. Given connection probability p
and total number of pairs N, the expected number of
unconnected pairs should be N(1  p)2. The expected number
of unidirectionally connected pairs should be 2Np(1  p), and
the expected number of bidirectionally connected pairs
should be Np2. We find that the actual number of bidirectionally connected pairs is four times that of the expected
numbers ( p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B). The observed overrepresentation of reciprocally connected layer 5 neurons
confirms previous reports [5,6]. Such overrepresentation has
also been observed in layer 2/3 of the rat visual cortex [11].
However, whether projections between layers observe this
pattern remains an open question.
Can the overrepresentation of reciprocal connections
reflect an experimental artifact? Indeed, such overrepresen-

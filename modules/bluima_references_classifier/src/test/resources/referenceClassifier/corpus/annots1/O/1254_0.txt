Dendritic Abnormalities and Synaptic Circuitry and MR
The most obvious mechanism by which dendritic pathology in
general, and reductions in dendritic arborizations in particular,
could lead to neurologic impairment is a decrease in the cortical
postsynaptic surface. The latter should correlate with a reduction in synaptic density, while spine dysgenesis may represent a
preferential reduction in excitatory synapses. These assumptions have not yet been tested rigorously in genetic MR. To date
no study has compared dendritic labeling and synapse analysis in
MR, although some subjects have been independently examined
by one or the other approach. Electron microscopic (EM) studies
have been confined almost exclusively to DS, and with contra-

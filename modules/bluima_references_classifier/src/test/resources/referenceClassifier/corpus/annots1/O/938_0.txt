Figure 5. Neurogliaform cells have a unique position in the cortical microcircuit. To date,
neurogliaform cells are the only interneuron type capable of eliciting slow GABA and GABA
AB
IPSPs on pyramidal cells. Several types of interneurons eliciting GABA receptor-mediated
A

postsynaptic responses are known to form electrically coupled networks with interneurons of
the same class. We found that neurogliaform cells are electrically coupled to other neurogliaform cells (gray), but, unlike other interneurons, neurogliaform cells also establish heterologous gap junctions (at a lower rate of coupling) with regular-spiking nonpyramidal cells,
bitufted cells, basket cells, and axoaxonic cells. Thus, heterologous electrical synapses of neurogliaform cells link multiple networks formed by gap junctions restricted to a particular class of
interneuron. Widespread electrical connections might enable neurogliaform cells to monitor
the activity of different interneurons acting on GABA receptors at various regions of target cells.

The unscaled probe signal p t is chosen to have the same longâ€“term average intensity as the masker m t , defined as I . Let Im t I
be the intensity of the masker with no probe ( 0), and Ip t; 2I be the intensity of the scaled probe signal with no masker.
Beats. Rapid fluctuations having frequency components outside the bandwidth of the T duration rectangular integration window are very
small and will be ignored. Accordingly we drop the time dependence in terms Im and Ip. Because of beats between m t and p t (assuming

synaptic vesicle exocytosis and synaptogenesis.40,41
Both mechanical lesions11,12,24,43 and neurotoxicant
administration placed in aVerent pathways to the
hippocampus, including kainate, trimethyltin (TMT),
colchicine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT),
produce neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus
characterized by alterations in GFAP and SNAP-25
localization and mRNA levels.1,4,8,29,41,47 These
experimental models have utilized the mature adult
brain and have not systematically addressed the
cellular adaptive responses to neuronal injury in the
ageing nervous system.
Ageing aVects the expression of GFAP and
SNAP-25 as indicators of neuronal damage. The use
of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
has demonstrated an enhanced concentration of

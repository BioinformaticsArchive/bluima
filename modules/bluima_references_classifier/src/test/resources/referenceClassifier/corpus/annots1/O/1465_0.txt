2000). CO, a mitochondrial enzyme, is one of the easiest
techniques to apply (Wong-Riley 1989). After loss of
visual function in one eye, the CO level diminishes in
columns formerly served by the affected eye. As a result,
a pattern of dark and light CO stripes emerges in layer
4C (figure 7). These stripes are identical to those
labelled anatomically by injection into one eye of a
transneuronal tracer, such as [3H]proline, proving that
they represent ocular dominance columns (Sincich &
Horton 2003a). The most effective way to visualize their
complete pattern is to unfold the occipital lobe and to
flat-mount the cortex prior to sectioning. Local regions

neurectomy. During the daily training periods on the first few
days after the neurectomy, the cats often showed bouts of walking
in which they would display an exaggerated plantar flexion of the
toes at the beginning of the stance phase (data not shown). These
movements would make walking irregular, and the cats would
eventually fall, making these segments unsuitable for kinematic
analysis.
Instead of being prepared for the acute experiment 10 â€“11 d
after the neurectomy, cat 3 was trained on the treadmill for an
extended period of time. Thirty-six days after the LGS neurectomy, the nerve to PL was cut. In Figure 8 A, the yields of the
ankle at f = 0.3 after LGS and PL neurectomies are superimposed. There is no significant difference in the time course of the
two curves ( p > 0.8). The pattern of MG EMG activity during
this second compensation was qualitatively similar to what was
observed after cutting LGS, with an initial large increase followed
by a more modest steady increase. Quantitatively, the change in
EMG activity after the PL cut was smaller than after LGS (Fig. 8,
compare B, C). Again, burst duration was not changed.

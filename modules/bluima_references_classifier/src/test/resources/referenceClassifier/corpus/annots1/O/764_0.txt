Figure 2. bAPs successfully invade spines. A, Layer 5 pyramidal neuron filled with voltage
sensitive dye (left) and magnified view of the region outlined by the box (red) showing the
line-scan (dashed line) transversing a spine and its parent dendrite (right) located 94 m from
the soma. B, Hyperpolarization recorded at the soma (black) in response to somatic current
injection ( 300 pA; 150 ms; second from the top), and corresponding changes in fluorescence recorded in the spine (red) and parent dendrite (gray) shown in A. Exponential curves
were fitted to the fluorescence traces, and amplitudes were calculated at steady state (120 â€“
150 ms; average of 160 trails). C, Fluorescence change recorded in the spine (red) and parent
dendrite (gray) shown in A in response to somatically evoked APs (black; average of 150
individually aligned trials; 2 ms somatic current pulse; second from the top). D, Comparison of
bAP fluorescence in the spine (red) and dendrite (gray) after normalization and conversion to
absolute voltage based on the hyperpolarization response at each location (assuming 5%
steady-state voltage attenuation from the soma to the spine). E, Plot of bAP amplitude in basal
dendrites at different distances from the soma. The data are fitted with a single exponential,
which is used in subsequent experiments to convert spine and parent dendrite fluorescent
signals into absolute voltage during synaptic input.

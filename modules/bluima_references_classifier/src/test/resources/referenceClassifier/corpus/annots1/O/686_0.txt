Cell treatments
Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 12-well plates. Twentyfour hours before treatment the media was replaced with phenol red
free DMEM supplemented with charcoal-stripped FBS (1%).
b-Amyloid peptide 25–35 was suspended in sterile PBS and
incubated for 1 h at 37 C immediately before use. b-Amyloid
peptide was then diluted to a final concentration of 10 lM in culture
media and cells were exposed for 24 h. 17b-Estradiol was initially
dissolved in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 1 mM and diluted to
the appropriate concentration (10 nM) in culture media. Exposure to
17b-estradiol was initiated 15 min prior to b-amyloid peptide
addition. Ethanol was used at a final concentration of 0.1% as a
vehicle control. This concentration of ethanol had no effect on cell
viability or b-amyloid peptide toxicity. ICI 182, 780 and PD98059
were made as 1000 × stocks in 100% DMSO and were added to
cells 15 min prior to 17b-estradiol exposure.

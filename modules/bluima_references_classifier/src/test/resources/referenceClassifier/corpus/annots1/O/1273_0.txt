conditioning stimulus was being applied, the inverse of Hebbian
associative LTP as shown by McNaughton. This inverse of LTP was
elegantly consistent with the growing notion that the parallel fibers
carry an error, which must decrease during learning and was thus
also consistent with notions of classical conditioning. It should be
noted, however, that this form of plasticity is neither Hebbian nor
classical STDP.
In 1988, Yves Frégnac et al reported a cellular analog of visual
cortex plasticity in vivo (Frégnac et al., 1988). They found that by
repeated pairing of visual stimulation with direct positive or negative iontophoretic stimulation of a cortical neuron, they could
often restructure the functional preference of the cell in question
in a manner consistent with Hebb's postulate. The experimenter
could thus alter a cell's receptive field in a form of supervised learning paradigm, interestingly even in the mature brain. This study
also provided some of the first results consistent with the existence
of homosynaptic LTD in neocortex.
The discovery of homosynaptic LTD has been reported in many
studies (e.g., Dunwiddie and Lynch, 1978; Bramham and Srebro, 1987; Frégnac et al., 1988), but is typically attributed to two
studies, one by Serena Dudek and Mark Bear and the other by
Rosel Mulkey and Robert Malenka, both conducted in the hippocampus (Dudek and Bear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992).
These teams used long periods of precisely timed low-frequency
stimulation to achieve depression, an approach that is perhaps biologically implausible (see e.g., Perrett et al., 2001). Nevertheless,
this particular induction protocol became a major LTD paradigm for years to come and is still in use, probably because it
is quite reliable. In general, the problem of extracellular stimulation would haunt the search for true homosynaptic plasticity
for some time, since extracellular stimulation potentially activates
heterogeneous inputs and possibly even neuromodulatory fibers
(see Bear, 1999).
The early 1980s was also the time when the molecular substrate
for associative plasticity was discovered in the unique properties
of the NMDA receptor. This remarkable receptor only opens to
allow a calcium influx after the presynaptic terminal has released
glutamate and the postsynaptic membrane has been depolarized (Collingridge et al., 1983; Harris et al., 1984; Wigström and
Gustafsson, 1984; Slater et al., 1985) but not with either condition
alone – an elegant molecular coincidence detector.

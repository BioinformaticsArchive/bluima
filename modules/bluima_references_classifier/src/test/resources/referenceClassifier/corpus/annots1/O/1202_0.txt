Here, we present detailed calculations of energy expenditure
on different cellular mechanisms in the brain. Readers who are
interested in the conclusions of the analysis, but do not wish to
go through the calculations in detail, can read the Results section with no loss of continuity. Limitations on the accuracy of
the calculations are considered in the Discussion.

was not qualitatively different from the distribution of
all callosal neurons demonstrated in the preceding paper.
In agreement with Shatz (1977) and Keller and Innocenti
(1981), we found that callosal neurons in area PMLS
with heterotopic projections to the contralateral area
17/18 border were concentrated primarily in layers V and
VI. It is interesting to note that Gilbert and Kelly (1975)
found that the projections of the lateral suprasylvian
visual areas to ipsilateral areas 17 and 18 also originated
primarily from neurons in layer VI. The functional significance of the differences in laminar distributions of
cells with homotopic and heterotopic projections in areas
PMLS is unknown. The importance of these differences
may become clearer as we attain a better understanding
of the response properties of the neurons in each layer of
this region of the cortex.
In addition to the close overlap of the sites of origin

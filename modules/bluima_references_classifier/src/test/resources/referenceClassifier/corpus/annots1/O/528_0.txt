Figure 1. Dynamic protein–protein interaction between estrogen receptor and PI3K regulatory subunit p85. Rat cortical neurons were exposed to E (10 nM) for specific time intervals (0,

5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min), and lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-p85, the
regulatory subunit of PI3K, or ER (clone TE111.5D11), which principally detects ER but can
partially recognize ER . A, Lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-p85, the regulatory subunit
of PI3K, were subsequently immunoblotted for detection of ER. A dynamic pattern of p85–ER
interaction was apparent in which significant immunoreactivity of ER occurred at 10 and 30 min,
with intervening uncoupling at 20 and 45 min. B, To confirm these findings, the corollary
experiment was performed. Cortical neuron lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ER and
subsequently immunoblotted with anti- p85. Evidence for an ER protein interaction with p85
occurred at 10 and 30 min, with maximal complexing of the proteins at the 30 min time point.
The uncoupling of proteins was apparent at 20 and 45 min. Data are from a single experiment
and are representative of three independent experiments. *p 0.05 versus control neurons;
**p 0.01 versus control neurons. Con, Control.

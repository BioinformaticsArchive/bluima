which have not been assessed by immunoblot analysis. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from these 10 different tissues was
performed under high stringency so that related sequences
are notdetected. As shown in Fig. 3, a single mRNA of about
8kbwasdetectedinallthetissuesexaminedalbeitatdifferent
levels. Brain, testis, heart, liver, kidney, and lung have relatively higher mRNA levels than intestine, stomach, spleen,
and muscle. Since the same mRNA was detected in all 10
tissues examined, it is reasonable to speculate that all the
nonerythroid tissues express spectrins. The results of Fig. 3
suggest thatthe spectrinsinallnonerythroidtissues are
essentially identical, although some minor differences might
still exist.
Southern Blot Analysis-As suggested from the above re-sults, the a-spectrinmRNA in nonerythroid tissuesare essentially identical since the hybridization for Northern blot
analysis was performed under high stringency. T o distinguish
the possibilities that there is a single gene or several genes
with essential identical sequences for a-spectrin of nonerythroid tissues, Southern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 4).
Ten pg of genomic DNA isolated from rat liver was digested
with BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, and PstI, respectively. The di-gested DNA was analyzed by Southern blot analysis. The
probe used is the 900-bp cDNA insert from the XC4 clone
that was labeled by the random priming reaction. As shown,
BglII digestion gave a single DNA fragment of about 6.6 kb,
suggesting only a single gene present. Two DNA fragments
were detected from the PstI digested DNA. There are three
PstI sites in this 900-bp cDNA insert. Therefore, the result
obtained from P s t I digestion is again consistentwith the
predictionthatonlyonegeneispresentintheratgenomefor
nonerythroid a-spectrin. EcoRI and Hind111 digestion gave
two DNA fragments that were hybridized with the probe.
Although there is no EcoRI and HindIII sites in the 900-bp
insert, thetwo fragments detected canbe easily explained by
the presence of the restriction sitesin introns that are present
in the genomic DNA. Taken together, the above results predict,although do not prove, that a single gene in the rat
genome codes for the a-spectrin inall nonerythroid tissues.

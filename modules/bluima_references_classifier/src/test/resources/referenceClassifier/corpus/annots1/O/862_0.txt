FIG. 1. Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) blocks the actions of baclofen and y-aminobutryic acid (GABA) at postsynaptic GABA, receptors in
CA3 pyramidal neurons. .4: responses to 2 s, & 20 mV voltage steps from a
holding potential of -70 mV are shown: stimuli are delivered to proximal
stratum radiatum as indicated by the arrow (t). 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3
dione (DNQX. 20 PM) and (+)-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate (APV, 50
PM) are present throughout, and the pipette contained K-gluconate and
tris( hydroxymethyl)aminomethane gaunosine S-triphosphate (tris-GTP).
THA (0.3 mM) blocks the outward current and conductance increase in-duced by baclofen (30 PM) and the late inhibitory postsynaptic current
(IPSC). indicated by the triangle (A). Baclofen depresses evoked GABA,
receptor-mediated IPSCs in the absence and presence of THA. Spontaneous synaptic currents are also depressed by baclofen in both conditions, as
well as during the late IPSC. B: isolated late IPSCs evoked by stimulation
in stratum radiatum in the presence of DNQX, APV. bicuculline methochloride (20 PM) and picrotoxin (50 PM) are shown; the holding potential
was -60 mV. THA (0.3 mM) blocked the late IPSC. A 20 mV hyperpolarizing command precedes the stimulus, which is indicated by the arrow (t);
capacitative transients are truncated.

1.3 msec; n = 7). At various prepulse voltages, the time constants
for the onset of IC a facilitation were not significantly different ( p >
0.05) with either Ca2+ buffer (Fig. 6C). These results are consistent
with a role for Ca2+ in controlling the amount but not the rate of
onset of IC a facilitation.
Although Ca2+ entry during the prepulse did not affect the rate
of onset of ICa facilitation, it did significantly slow its decay. As the
interval between the 50 msec conditioning prepulse and the second
test pulse was increased, facilitation of ICa decreased with a singleexponential time course (t = 112.7 6 17 msec; n = 9) with 0.5 mM
intracellular EGTA. The time course was sensitive to Ca2+ influx
during the prepulse because the decay of facilitation was almost
twice as slow (t = 221.5 6 48.4 msec; n = 6) with a longer 200 msec
prepulse and twice as fast (t = 43.5 6 5.6 msec; n = 6) with a 5
msec prepulse (Fig. 7A,B). These data suggest that the persistence
of facilitation is caused by the intracellular accumulation of Ca2+
ions that had entered during the prepulse.
Consistent with this idea, the decay of facilitation depended on
intracellular C a 2+ buffering. After a 50 msec prepulse, the decay of

Relation between the subthreshold and suprathreshold ocular
preferences in the different cell types
The comparison between the subthreshold and suprathreshold
ocular preferences of V1 pyramids indicated that their ocular
preference was sharper at the AP level, as described in cat V1
(Priebe, 2008). As indicated by the examples of Figure 3, the AP
threshold amplified a slight subthreshold ocular preference for
the ipsilateral or contralateral eye. The scatter plot of Figure 5A,
left, shows the relationship between the subthreshold and su-prathreshold ocular preferences of the different cell types. Overall, it is evident that the vast majority of cortical pyramids receive
dominant inputs from the contralateral eye (PSP-ODI 0) and
produce AP outputs that are even more contralateral, as shown
by the fact that most of the dots reside above the dashed line (that
is, AP-ODI PSP-ODI). The same data are presented as an xâ€“y
error plot (Fig. 5A, right), which summarizes the main findings
described above: (1) layer 5 contains the two populations of output pyramidal neurons whose AP responses are the most and the
least binocular along a V1: 5TPs (green) and 5NPs (blue), respectively; (2) 2/3Ps (black) and 5TPs (green) are similarly binocular
at the PSP level but produce AP responses that are highly and
scarcely binocular, respectively (note the similar PSP-ODI error but
the threefold larger AP-ODI error of 2/3Ps).
This latter difference is attributable to the fact that 2/3Ps and
5TPs differentially convert the subthreshold into the suprath-

mature than mature cells (Fig. 6 B) ( p 0.01; KS test). The
sublaminar distribution of axon length also did not change with
development ( p 0.9; KS test).
Developmental maintenance of topography in this plane
should require that axon length be added proportionately inside
the home barrel column and outside it, in neighboring columns
within the row. Indeed, we found that as total axon length in L1–3
increased in within-row slices during development (Fig. 6C)
(P8 –11: 1580 1110 m; P17–21: 3940 2220 m; p 0.01),
axon length increased significantly, and approximately proportionally, within (P8 –9: 1390 1060 m; P17–21: 3380 2110
m; p 0.02; R 2 0.18) and outside (P8 –9: 190 260 m;
P17–21: 560 540 m; p 0.02; R 2 0.18) the 220 m
column (Fig. 6 D). Consistent with growth outside the home column, the maximal breadth of this projection increased signifi-

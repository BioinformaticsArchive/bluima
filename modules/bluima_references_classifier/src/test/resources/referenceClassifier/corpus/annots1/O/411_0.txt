Inhibition of the Caz+ current
Depolarizing voltage stepsfrom -80 mV to various potentials
positive to -60 mV elicited a high-threshold inward current
(HVA) that peakedrapidly, and decayedgradually with maintained depolarizations(Fig. 1C). Superfusionwith 50 PM Cd2+
virtually eliminated the inward current (97 + 3%block, n = 5;
not shown),demonstratingthat it is carried by Ca*+channels.
PeakCa2+channelcurrentwasreducedinaconcentration-de-pendentfashionby cortisol, corticosterone(CORT), andallotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), acquiring steady-state
values over the concentration range examined at 30-240 set,
with the fastestime to inhibition occurring for the highestconcentrations (l-l 00 PM). The concentration-dependent inhibition by cortisol, CORT, and THDOC is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Sequencing strategy.
The insert from pRGAPDH-1 clone was excised by PstI, recleaved by
AluI and sequenced in the directions indicated by arrows by either the
Maxam-Gilbert (M.G.) or M13 procedures as described under Materials and
Methods. Shaded areas marked G and C refer to the homopolymeric
extensions used for cDNA cloning.

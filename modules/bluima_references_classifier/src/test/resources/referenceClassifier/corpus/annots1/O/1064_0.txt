ferent types had been previously proposed (DiFrancesco,
1984). Second, voltage gating of several ion channels
has been recently interpreted on the basis of allosteric
models (Marks and Jones, 1992; RÃ¬os et al., 1993;
McCormack et al., 1994; Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999;
Horrigan et al., 1999; Jones, 1999). Third, the structural homology of HCN channels to 6-TM domain K
channels favors the hypothesis that HCN channels, too,
are tetramers.
Our starting point was based on a recent investigation in cardiac SAN cells, showing that basic kinetic and
modulatory properties of native pacemaker f-channels
can be explained by a hybrid HH-MWC model (Di-Francesco, 1999). In that model, voltage gating was de-scribed by a standard HH scheme with two independent subunits, while cAMP-induced activation occurred
according to a cyclic allosteric Monod-Wyman-Changeaux
(MWC) model (Monod et al., 1965) involving binding
of one cAMP molecule per gating subunit.
On the basis of the above considerations, we explored
the possibility that, as well as by cAMP, gating of pacemaker channels is modulated allosterically by voltage,
too. In this attempt, we extended the hypothesis made in
the gating scheme proposed earlier (DiFrancesco, 1999)
that pacemaker channels are composed of subunits,
each independently gated by voltage and cAMP. We
made the assumption that, like mSlo channels (Horrigan
and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999), HCN channels
are homotetramers, with each subunit carrying one in-dependent voltage sensor, and that closed/open channel transitions involve concerted structural modifications of all four subunits and occur allosterically.
We found that by simply selecting an appropriate set
of rate constants for each isoform, the allosteric as-sumption accounts for quantitative features of voltagedependent gating of different isoforms. The allosteric
hypothesis provides an interpretation of the possible
mechanisms responsible for the different gating properties of different isoforms, and may represent an unifying model for HCN channel gating.

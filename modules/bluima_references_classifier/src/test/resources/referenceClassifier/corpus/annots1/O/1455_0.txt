voltage would be large. In contrast, activating
the same inputs in the centrifugal direction
would result in a much lesser degree of summation because the proximal EPSP will de-cay by the time the distally originated EPSP
will arrive. Assuming that the voltage peak is
translated into action potentials, the neuron
will show directional selectivity. Although the
mechanism proposed is clearly feasible, there

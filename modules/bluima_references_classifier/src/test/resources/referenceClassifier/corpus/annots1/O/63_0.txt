Prediction of calcium-dependent changes in synaptic filtering
paradigm and its test in hippocampal slices
To validate the model's prediction, we took advantage of the fact
that lowering the extracellular calcium concentration reduces the
basal vesicle fusion probability , thus reducing vesicle use and
depletion (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). The model predicts that
under these conditions of reduced depression, synaptic response
continuously increases during high-frequency stimulation (Fig.
6). The model also predicts large calcium-dependent changes in
the synaptic filtering pattern during natural stimulus trains; synaptic strength during discharges at reduced extracellular calcium
is expected to not rapidly saturate like that observed at standard
calcium concentration but rather to continue to increase, reaching much more elevated strength levels.
To computationally reproduce the decrease in vesicle depletion at reduced extracellular calcium, we modified a single model
parameter, the basal vesicle fusion probability , which was re-duced to 0.0002 (Fig. 7A). The synaptic dynamics during stimulus trains was then determined without free parameters, solely
based on the timing of stimuli during the train. As predicted, the
reduced led to a much larger continuous increase in synaptic

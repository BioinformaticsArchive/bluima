MK 801 treatment
Analysis of dendritic segments from CA1 pyramidal cells in
animals treated concurrently with estradiol and MK 801 re-vealed that this noncompetitive NMDA receptor blockade in-hibits the effect of estradiol on dendritic spine density. Twoway ANOVA indicated a significant effect of estradiol treatment
on both apical (F[2,30] = 13.742, p < 0.01) and basal (fl2,30]
= 5.566, p < 0.01) spine density. Additionally, a significant
effect of MK 80 1 treatment was indicated for both apical (fl1,30]
= 7.233, p < 0.05) and basal (F[1,30] = 4.63, p < 0.05) spine
density. A trend toward an interaction between estradiol and
MK 801 was indicated for apical (F[2,30] = 3.021, p < 0.1) and
basal (F[2,30] = 2.58 1, p < 0.1) spine density. Consistent with
previous findings (Gould et al., 1990), post hoc comparisons
indicated that, in saline-treated animals, ovariectomy results in
a decrease in dendritic spine density (p < 0.0 1) that is prevented
by estradiol (Figs. 2, 3). The decreaseswereapproximately 26%
for apicaland 31%for basalspinedensity. In contrast, theeffects
of ovariectomy and estradiol treatment were not significant in
MK 80l-treated animals.

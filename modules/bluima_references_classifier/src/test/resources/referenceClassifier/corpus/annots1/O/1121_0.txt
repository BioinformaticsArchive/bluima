5.3 Evaluation At Scale
Section 5.1 shows that REVERB outperforms ex-isting Open IE systems when evaluated on a sample of sentences. Previous work has shown that
the frequency of an extraction in a large corpus is
useful for assessing the correctness of extractions
(Downey et al., 2005). Thus, it is possible a priori that REVERB's gains over previous systems will
diminish when extraction frequency is taken into ac-count.
In fact, we found that REVERB's advantage over
TEXTRUNNER when run at scale is qualitatively
similar to its advantage on single sentences. We ran
both REVERB and TEXTRUNNER on Banko and Et-zioni's corpus of 500 million Web sentences and ex-amined the effect of redundancy on precision.
As Downey's work predicts, precision increased
in both systems for extractions found multiple
times, compared with extractions found only once.
However, REVERB had higher precision than

The distribution of voltage-sensitive sodium channels on axons
in the dorsal and ventral spinal roots of the dystrophic mouse
129/ReJâ€“Lama 2dy was determined via immunocytochemistry.
In these nerves there are regions in which Schwann cells fail to
proliferate and myelinate axons in a normal manner, leaving
bundles of closely packed large-diameter amyelinated axons.
We have identified discrete and focal concentrations of sodium
channel immunoreactivity on these axons by both confocal
immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, using a
peptide-derived polyclonal antibody. In addition, simultaneous
labeling with an antibody recognizing neuronal-specific ankyrin revealed a distinct colocalization with the sodium channels

on both normal and amyelinated axons. The presence of

receptor (EGFR); there is evidence that E can use
2

this mechanism50. For instance, E signals to ERK in
2

breast cancer cells through heparan-bound EGF and
the EGFR (Ref. 51). In turn, EGF might require the
presence of ER in one or more compartments as a
necessary component for signaling to behaviors such
as lordosis in female rats52.
Recent data in cells expressing the gene encoding
ER indicate that the insulin-like growth factor type I
(IGF-I) receptor (IGF-1R) might contribute to E
2

signaling53. The authors demonstrated, mainly in
cells co-transfected to express both the genes
encoding IGF-1R and ER, that E causes the rapid
2

phosphorylation of IGF-1R, association of the two
receptors and subsequent ERK activation. This might
be relevant in breast cancer, in which E potentiates
2

the IGF-I-induced production of G1/S cell-cycle
components and cell proliferation54. Interestingly,
activation of an estrogen response element
(ERE)â€“luciferase reporter occurred in response to
IGF-I, and required the presence of ER (Ref. 53). This
is consistent with the ability of a variety of growth
factor receptor tyrosine kinases [such as those for
EGF, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and IGF]
to stimulate the phosphorylation of nuclear ER at
Ser118, leading to E -independent activation of this
2

receptor55.

Comparison of circular variance and bandwidth with
another measure of selectivity
It is interesting to compare the orientation selectivity measures
we are using in this paper with different selectivity measures used
by others. One such measure is the response at the orthogonal
orientation divided by the response at the preferred orientation.
This measure was used by Gegenfurtner et al. (1996) in their
study of orientation selectivity in V2 neurons. It resembles a
related selectivity index used by Zhou et al. (2000) in a study of
V1 and V2 neurons. A graph of a scatterplot of orthogonal /
preferred ratio versus circular variance is shown in Figure 6a. For
circular variance 0.5, the orthogonal/preferred ratio is very
close to zero. For values of circular variance 0.5, the orthogonal/preferred ratio is approximately proportional to the circular
variance. Clearly, these two global measures of orientation selectivity are strongly correlated, but circular variance distinguishes
between tuning curves that all have zero orthogonal/preferred
ratio. Another way of stating the relationship is to write that low
( 0.5) values of circular variance can only occur when the or-thogonal/preferred ratio is very close to, or equals, zero. This
empirical observation is supported by the analysis of tuning
curves and the relationship between off-peak responses and circular variance offered in Appendix.
The relationship between bandwidth and orthogonal/preferred
ratio is shown in Figure 6b. In that plot, there is much less
covariation of the two measures than between circular variance
and orthogonal/preferred ratio shown in Figure 6a. The implication of Figure 6 is that the neural factors that cause low values of
orthogonal/preferred ratio also lead to low values of circular

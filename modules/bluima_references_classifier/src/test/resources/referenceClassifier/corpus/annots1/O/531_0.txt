of the known rostrocaudal and mediolateral gradients of cortical
histogenesis, regions rostra1 and lateral to this site exhibit slightly
more advanced development, whereas the converse holds true
in more caudal and medial cortical regions.
Regulation of SCIP expressionduring cerebralcortical
development
The developing cerebral cortex was examined by in situ hy-bridization to assessthe temporal and spatial patternsof SCIP
expressionatavarietyofages,beginningatE13.Wethencorrelated thesedynamic patterns with the birth and subsequent
development of specificcortical layers, asrevealed by experimentsin which theseneuronshave beentaggedon their birthday
with 3H-thymidine. The in situ hybridization studiesreveal a
pattern of SCIP expressionthat is correlated with the birth,
migration, and subsequendt ifferentiation of neuronsof cortical
layers 5 and 2/3.
E13. At El 3, SCIP hybridization is associatedwith the preplate of the anteriormostportion of the cerebralwall (Fig. 6A,B).
Within presumptive sensoryregionsof cortex, no SCIP expression is observed, and there is no detectable expressionin the
ventricular zone at any location. In the developing striatum,
SCIP expressionis localized to the subventricular zone of the
ganglionic eminence,but is not associatedwith the ventricular
layer of this region. SCIP is clearly detectablein the olfactory
bulbandspinalcordaswell(notshown).

E16. At El6 SCIP hybridization is observedin the subventricular zone and intermediate zone of the cerebralwall, albeit
at low levels (Fig. 7A). This pattern is apparent throughout the
rostrocaudalextent of cortex. There is no detectableexpression
in the cortical plate or in the ventricular zone. The latter is of

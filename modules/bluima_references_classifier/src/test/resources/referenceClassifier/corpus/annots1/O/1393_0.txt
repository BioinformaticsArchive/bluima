were fixed and immunolabeled for calbindin D-28K and NSE.
Enolase-positive and calbindin-negative cells with diameters of
;5–10 μm were identified as granule cells and counted in three
randomly selected fields (223 × 174 μm). The results showed that,
in the presence of 100 μM APV, the survival rate of granule cells
was markedly decreased from ;300 to 140 cells per field (Fig. 3Ac),
which was rescued by coincubation with 300 μM NMDA. At this
concentration of NMDA, a higher survival rate of granule cells was
observed even in the presence of APV (;450 cells per field) than
that of the control culture (;300 cells per field). In the absence of
APV, chronic exposure to 30 μM NMDA significantly increased the
number of granule cells but not that to 300 μM NMDA (Fig. 3Ac,
inset). The absence of the trophic effect at 300 μM NMDA is
probably attributable to Ca2+ toxicity resulting from overstimulation of NMDA receptors. Subsequently, the dose –response relationship of APV on the survival of granule cells was established
(Fig. 3Ba). As the concentration of APV increases, the survival
rate of granule cells decreased with an IC50 value of 5.5 μM, which
is almost identical to the IC50 of APV (4.7 μM) for NMDA-induced
current elicited from recombinantly expressed NMDA receptors
(Laube et al., 1997). Furthermore, statistical analysis indicated a
correlation between granule cell number and maximum dendrite
length or number of branch points/ longest dendrite of a Purkinje
cell (Fig. 3Bb,Bc). These results suggest that NMDA receptor
signaling in granule cells regulates Purkinje cell differentiation by
controlling the survival of granule cells.

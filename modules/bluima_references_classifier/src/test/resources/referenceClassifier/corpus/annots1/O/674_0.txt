95% CI = 0.6 to 1.8).The point estimate for AD was
reduced by 30%, however, when analyses were re- stricted to oral estrogens (odds ratio = 0.7; 95% CI =
0.4 to 1.5). By way of comparison, different routes of
estrogen administration (oral only, oral plus injection or cream, injection or cream only) were each
associated with significantly lower AD risks in the
Leisure World cohort.l14
Morrison e t al.36identified 38 incident cases of AD
from among 472 older women participating in the
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The use of
oral and transdermal estrogen therapy had been documented prospectively and, after adjusting for education, the relative risk of developing AD among
ever-users of postmenopausal estrogen as compared
to never-users was reduced by over one-half (odds
ratio = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.97).
Information on oral estrogen use was available for
1,124 cognitively intact older women reported by
Tang et al.s5In this community-based northern Manhattan cohort, 167 incident cases of AD were identified over a follow-up period of 1 to 5 years. Postmenopausal use of oral estrogens had been reported
by 6% of women with AD and 16% of other cohort
members. Among estrogen users, the risk for AD was
reduced by 60% (odds ratio = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.22 t o
0.85), and the age at onset of AD was significantly
greater among estrogen users who became demented
than among never-users who became demented.
Estrogen and AD: Dose-response relationship.
There appears to be a dose effect between greater
estrogen use after the menopause and a lower risk
for AD. In the Leisure World cohort, the estimate of
the relative risk for AD decreased significantly with
increasing dose of the longest used oral estrogen
preparation and with increasing duration of use for
all For the higher dose range (21.25 mg/
day of conjugated estrogens), the risk estimate was
0.46; for women who used estrogen replacement for
at least 7 years, the estimate was 0.49.In the Puget
Sound cohort, the relative risk for AD was lowest
among women who filled the largest number of estrogen prescriptions (odds ratio = 0.8).128I n the Manhattan information on estrogen dose was un-available, but women who reported estrogen use for
more than 1 year had a lower risk for AD (odds
ratio = 0.13) than those using estrogen for 1year or
less.
Consistency of findings: Converging evidence.
Other evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that
estrogen may protect against the development of AD
in women. After the menopause the ovaries cease
producing estrogen, and residual circulating estrogens are principally derived through aromatization
of adrenal androgens, a process that occurs in adipose tissue and other peripheral Higher body

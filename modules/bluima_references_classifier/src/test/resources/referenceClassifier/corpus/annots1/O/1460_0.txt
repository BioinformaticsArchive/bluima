parent shafts (Figure S4B). The degenerated axon shafts then
disintegrated into small fragments (Figure 5C), the entire
process taking less than 12 h. The debris then disappeared
within 24â€“48 h, presumably after being cleared by glia. This
differed from retraction in that retracting axons did not leave
fluorescent debris behind (Figure S4D). It was not possible to
predict degeneration based on axonal morphology. Axonal
degeneration often spanned all the imaged axon arbor of one

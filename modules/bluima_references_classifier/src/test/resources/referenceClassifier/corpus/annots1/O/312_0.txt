Subjects and methods
Twenty patients with a long-standing diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis (aged 29–61 years, mean SD, 46 10 years)
and 23 healthy control subjects (aged 21–63 years, 37 12
years) were examined. According to the Declaration of
Helsinki, all gave informed consent to the examination, which
was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Bornholm,
Frederiksborg, Roskilde, StorstrØm and Vestskelland. All
patients were evaluated clinically (Table 1). None of the
patients received any antispastic medication. Three of them
showed spasticity on the examined side only, whereas the
rest showed spasticity on both sides. In these cases the most
affected side was studied. The healthy subjects had no signs
or symptoms of neurological or other disease and had no
history of neurological disease.
The subjects were seated in an armchair with the leg to
be examined semiflexed at the hip (120°), the knee flexed to
160° and the ankle in 110° plantar flexion. The foot was
mounted on a foot-plate that was connected to a torque meter,
and the torque was displayed on an oscilloscope placed in
front of the subject. Surface electrodes were used for
stimulation and recording.

FIG. 14. Effects of 4-AP on APs. Al : APs evoked by
a 60-pA current pulse at -60 mV in normal saline. A2:
APs evoked by the same current at an early stage of washing
in 3 n&I 4-AP. fAHPs were abolished, AP duration was
prolonged, and firing behavior resembled that of pyramidal
neurons. A3: records obtained after wash-in of 3 mM 4-AP. Half-amplitude duration of first AP was increased by
> 150% ( 1.22 ms in Al vs. 3.24 ms in A3). Also note
DD. mAHP was only slightly enhanced due to effect of
abolishment of fAHP. BI : APs evoked by lOO-pA current
injection at -61 mV in normal saline. B2 : APs evoked by
lOO-pA current injection at -63 mV in presence of 4 mM
4-AP. Half-amplitude duration of first AP was increased
by only 57% (2.22 ms in BI vs. 3.48 ms in B2). mAHPs
were enhanced.

Figure 3. Layer 4Cα spiny stellate neurons labeled in E122 slices. All three cells (a–c) have a main descending axon extending into the subplate and
either one (a, b) or two (c) axonal branches originating in layer 4Cα and extending to and branching further in more superficial layers. Cells a and c
have axonal branches in the subplate, and cell c also has branches in layers 5 and 6. Conventions are as in Figure 1. Scale bars, 200 μm.

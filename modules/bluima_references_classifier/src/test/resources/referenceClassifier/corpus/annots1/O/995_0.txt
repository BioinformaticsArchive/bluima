Figure 6. Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to bipolar cells. A, Excitatory input map from a bipolar cell, while
B shows an inhibitory input map from another bipolar cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of the bipolar cell
illustrated in A, see supplemental Fig. S2 Jâ€“L, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). C, Average laminar
strength for excitatory input from the bipolar cells, and D shows their average inhibitory input strength. Conventions are as in
previous figures.

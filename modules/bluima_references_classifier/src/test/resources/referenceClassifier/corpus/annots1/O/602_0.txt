Little information is available regarding the precise topography of
AB afferents in the Acb; it has been reported that the AE%projects to
both the medial (Brog et al., 1993) and ventrolateral Acb (Mc-Donald, 1991b). The location of the AESmg [Turner and Zimmer's
(1984) AB, and the BLv of Alheid et al. (1995)] with respect to the
basal nuclei, and the fact that the projections of the ABmg to the Acb
overlap with and are topographically related to those of the midrostrocaudal ABpc, supports the inclusion of the ABmg in the AB
complex. As shown in the present study, the projection patterns of
the AB are complementary to those from the Bmg and Bpc, and also
express a medial-to-lateral topography in the Acb based on the
caudal-to-rostra1 position of the projecting neurons (Fig. 12). This
explains the differences in the projection patterns as inferred from
retrograde studies (McDonald, 1991b; Brog et al., 1993).

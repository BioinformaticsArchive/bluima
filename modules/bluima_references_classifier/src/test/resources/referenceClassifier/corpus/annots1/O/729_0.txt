Properties of recurrent activity
Our main finding is that, whereas low-frequency activity led to
spiking in only a small number of excitatory neurons, highfrequency trains of TC inputs inevitably led to widespread activity in layer 4 and in other cortical layers. The strong frequency
dependence of recurrent activity suggests that temporal summation of TC inputs is necessary to recruit action potential firing in
a sufficiently large number of layer 4 neurons to trigger selfsustaining activity via intracortical synapses.
Multiple mechanisms could explain the propensity of layer 4 to
generate recurrent activity. Excitatory neurons within single barrels are strongly interconnected (Feldmeyer et al., 1999; Petersen
and Sakmann, 2000), thus favoring the generation of recurrent
excitatory loops (Douglas et al., 1995). Furthermore, excitatory
synapses between layer 4 neurons might function primarily via
NMDA receptors with only modest voltage dependence (Fleidervish et al., 1998), allowing for the generation of persistent
activity.
A question unexplored in our study is how ongoing thalamocortical activity and its effect on synaptic strength can influence
cortical responses to both low- and high-frequency activity. Re-cent studies have suggested that the effectiveness of thalamocortical bursts in triggering action potentials in cortical interneurons
arises from the sustained period of silence preceding each burst,
allowing for significant recovery from short-term depression at
thalamocortical synapses (Swadlow and Gusev, 2001) (see also
Sherman, 2001). On the other hand, tonic low-frequency activity
with on average briefer interspike intervals might be accompanied by a larger degree of steady-state synaptic depression
(Chung et al., 2002). Thus, the high responsiveness of cortical
circuits to high-frequency thalamocortical activity might be me-diated by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.
Previous work has shown that the response behavior of cortical
neurons is determined by the synaptic properties and connectivity
of cortical afferents. Individual thalamic inputs have powerful
influence on the response behavior of cortical neurons (Reid and
Alonso, 1995; Swadlow and Gusev, 2001). However, few experimental studies have directly examined the influence of intracortical synapses in modulating afferent activity. In the thalamic
input layers of cat V1, TC synapses comprise only 6% of all
excitatory synapses, whereas most inputs are provided by excitatory neurons within the same local circuit (Ahmed et al., 1994).
Our study provides insight into the conditions under which these
local circuits are recruited and how they influence the response
behavior of individual neurons.

FIG. 2. The influence of proteins on the hormone binding ac-tivity of PR at 30 °C. A, samples of stripped PR adsorbed to antibody
resin were incubated at 30 °C for the times indicated. The samples
contained incubation buffer plus 5 mM ATP (triangles); 20 μg of hsp70,
2 μg of YDJ, and 5 mM ATP (squares), or the complete system with 20
μg of hsp70, 2 μg of YDJ, 5 μg of Hop, 20 μg of hsp90, 5 μg of p23, and
5 mM ATP (circles). After incubation, the samples were analyzed for
hormone binding activity and for composition by SDS-PAGE. B shows
the Coomassie-stained gel of the stripped PR before incubation (lane 1)
and samples after incubation at 30 °C for 30 min in the complete system
(lane 2), plus hsp70 and YDJ (lane 3), or without added proteins (lane
4).

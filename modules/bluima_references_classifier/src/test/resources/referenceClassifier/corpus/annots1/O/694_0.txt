subtype could be resolved in the AL.
Comparison of the distributions of non-NMDA (AMPA
and kainate) with NMDA receptors revealed two patterns.
Regionssuch as the VMH, DMH, and ARC tended to have
low non-NMDA/NMDA ratios. On the other hand, more
rostra1 hypothalamic and preoptic nuclei tended to have
higher non-NMDA/NMDA ratios (l.lO-1.39), suggestinga
stronger relative contribution from AMPA/kainate receptors.
This latter distribution was similar to the relative distributions
observed in the cortex, hippocampus, caudate, and septal

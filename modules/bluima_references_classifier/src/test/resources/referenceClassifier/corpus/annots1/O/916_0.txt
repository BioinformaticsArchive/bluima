Statistical Analysis
Unpaired Student's t-tests were applied to compare between the means of
groups. Unpaired non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney) were employed
to compare the medians of two groups with sample sizes of <8.
Chi-square (χ2) tests were applied to compare two distributions. In order
to determine the significance of the proposed subclassification of BCs,
we carried out Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (Fukunaga, 1990).
Separability values (represented as discriminant scores, DS) for points
where each point is a cell in a 14-dimensional parameter space (m-code of
14 morphological features) were calculated as the ratio between the
inter-class and intra-class spread. The result of the calculated separation is
visualized by projecting the points onto an optimal hyperplane
(described by the coefficients C1 and C2), ref lecting the value of the DS
and the quality of the separation. In order to test the validity of the
proposed subclassification, the labels of the data points were randomly
scrambled (i.e. their assignments to the three morphological subclasses)
and the Fisher analysis was repeated 10 000 times. In 9520 cases the
random partition yielded DS < 23.98, which was the score for the
proposed subclassification. The probability of mistakenly identifying
three groups in this data set is therefore P < 0.048.

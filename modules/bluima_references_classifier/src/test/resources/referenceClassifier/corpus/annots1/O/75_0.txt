The Ca 2 dependency of fast and slow
transmitter release
To summarize the Ca 2 -uncaging data,
we plotted the release time constants, the
release rates, and the number of vesicles
released in the fast and the slow release
component as a function of [Ca 2 ]i (Fig.
6 A–D) (n 104 flashes in n 55 paired
recordings). Above 4 M [Ca 2 ]i, the ma- jority of the responses (n 66 of 96) was
best fitted by a double-exponential line
function (n 63 of 96) or by doubleexponential functions (n 3 of 96), and
these responses are represented by filled
and open triangles in Figure 6 A–D, referFigure 5. Differential regulation by Ca 2 of the number of fast and slowly released vesicles. A1, [Ca ]i was increased to ring to the fast and the slow exponential

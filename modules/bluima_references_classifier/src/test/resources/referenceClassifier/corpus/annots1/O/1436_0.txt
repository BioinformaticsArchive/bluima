I decided to stick closely to the facts. Pauling launched forth in his characteristically
brilliant style. When he got to a diagram of the antibody molecule folding around the antigen
he said: “This is a diagram of one of the polypeptide chains of the antibody molecule.” I realized
that he had instantly grasped what I had said at dinner the night before. When I finished
presenting my contrary evidence (without polemical confrontation) I returned to my seat. I
found a note on the seat. It said: “Edelman, send reprints. Pauling.”
Before I deconstruct these events, I want to recount a second anecdote about my encounter
with another great scientist. This was Macfarlane Burnet, whose selectional theory, the theory
of clonal selection (8), turned out to be correct. While Gally and I were pursuing our work on
myelomas, convinced that selectionist ideas were correct, we received a visit by Burnet in our
small basement laboratory. He asked: “What are you doing?” I replied, “We are working on the
chemistry of antibodies and hope to work out their detailed structure. Like you, we are
selectionists.”
He replied, “You are wasting your time. Chemistry only makes things more complicated. I
don't even call them antibodies. The term recognizers is good enough.” I replied, “But Sir, if we
don't do the chemistry to show how many variants there are in the antibody repertoire, we
won't know if the theory is sound.” He said, “Mathematics can make things even worse. Don't
worry, young man, my theory is correct.”
Well, it turned out that it was correct. Reflecting on the gifts and contributions of Pauling,
the chemist, and Burnet, the biologist, I could see hints of blind spots that sooner or later we
must all confront. Pauling looked only at the chemical level. He ignored the fact that the body
did not produce antibodies to its own antigens, a fact difficult to account for simply by
instructional folding. This cellular phenomenon of immune tolerance was a key element in
Burnet's thinking. For his part, Burnet was insufficiently respectful of the biochemical rules,
the syntax that would ultimately reveal in detail the origins of antibody diversity and
specificity.

The De ́nouement: Domains and Somatic Variation
The analysis of these rules was to emerge largely from the work of our laboratory and that
of Rodney Porter (13, 14) in the mid-1960s. Porter had cleaved the antibody molecule by the
protease, papain, yielding one fragment with antigen binding properties and another fragment
with other physicochemical characteristics. This early work nicely complemented our studies
of chain structure and allowed the formulation of a model consisting of two light chains and
two heavy chains. Following upon Hilschmann's demonstration (15) that light chains were
composed of variable and constant regions, both laboratories began work to establish the
complete amino acid sequence of a myeloma protein, work completed in our laboratory in 1969
(16, 17). The resulting picture was quite beautiful, providing a basis for the assignment of
function and for analyses of the origin of antibody diversity. It was also the first demonstration
of domain structure in a large protein.
From the mid-1960s on, there was an explosion of theoretical work, which would eventually
show that antibody variation at the antigen binding site was largely a somatic process
involving somatic mutation and recombination of DNA in antibody-forming cells and their
precursors. This was eventually confirmed by the studies of Tonegawa (18), which revealed
these processes in fact to be the origin of diversity. Immunology was revealed as a science of
recognition having special mechanisms of somatic selection that themselves had evolved by
natural selection.

Cell-Cell Recognition and Morphogenesis
By 1970, I concluded that the work in immunology had “scratched my itch” and I decided to
move on to developmental biology. I was particularly intrigued with the daunting puzzle of
morphogenesis. What kind of recognition does this require at the molecular level? In the
classic period of embryology, this question could not have been asked with any reasonable
expectation of an answer. Instead, there was the now discredited ontogenetic law of Haeckel
(ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) and the rather more correct view of von Baer which stated
that, although early stage embryos of different species resembled each other, as development
progressed each species expressed its own idiosyncratic morphological pattern. Later on the
German biologists His and Roux (19, 20) concentrated on the mechanics of development, the
so-called “enwicklungsmechanik.” This emphasis is important to this day. However, it did not
deal with the equally important problem of how shape is inherited, a central concern of

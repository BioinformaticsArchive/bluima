oligonucleotide probe sets representing approximately 1,200 neurobiology-related genes.
Hybridization, washing, and staining of Rat Neurobiology U34 Arrays were carried out
according to the Affymetrix technical manual in an Affymetrix hybridization oven and
fluidics station. The arrays were scanned using an Agilent GeneArray Scanner (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Expression values were globally normalized and
compared across the samples using Affymetrix Microarray Suit 5.0 Software (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA).

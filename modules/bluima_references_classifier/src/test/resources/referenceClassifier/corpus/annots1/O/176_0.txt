The visual system is constantly challenged to organize the retinal pattern of stimulation into
coherent percepts. This task is achieved by the cortical visual system, which is composed by
topographically organized analytic areas and by synthetic areas of the temporal lobe that have more
holistic processing. Additional visual areas of the parietal lobe are related to motion perception and
visuomotor control. V1 and V2 represent the entire visual field. MT represents only the binocular
field, and V4 only the central 308â€“408. The parietal areas represent more of the periphery. For any
eccentricity, the receptive field grows at each step of processing, more at anterior areas in the
temporal lobe. Minimal point image size increases towards the temporal lobe, but remains fairly
constant toward the parietal lobe. Patterns of projection show asymmetries. Central V2 and V4
project mainly to the temporal lobe, while peripherals V2 (more than 308) and V4 (more than 108)
also project to the parietal lobe. Visual information that arrives at V1 projects to V2, MT and
PO, which then project to other areas. Local lateral propagation and recursive loops
corroborate to perceptual completion and filling in. Priority connections to temporal, parietal
and parieto-temporal cortices help construct crude early representations of objects, trajectories and
movements.

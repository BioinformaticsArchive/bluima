tions around a Feshbach resonance may help
in characterizing superfluid features also for
strongly interacting fermionic potassium (8).
Radio-frequency spectroscopy was invented by Fermi and Rasetti as a tool for investigating atomic spectra (12). Nearly 80 years
later, the same technique is used to characterize intriguing effects associated with the
Fermi quantum statistics. Through its application to degenerate Fermi gases, radio-frequency spectroscopy allows interactions between
fermions to be probed with unprecedented ac-curacy, particularly in regimes where universal laws and fascinating phenomena such as
superfluidity may be explored.
Further important developments are ahead
of us. Ramping a magnetic field through a
Feshbach resonance has been used as one of
the ways to couple bosonic atoms into molecules. Fermionic atoms appear to be better
candidates. Ultracold molecules have been
created by means of a Feshbach resonance in
a degenerate fermion potassium gas (13).
Radio-frequency spectroscopy turns out to be
important in detecting photodissociation
spectra of the weakly bound molecules.

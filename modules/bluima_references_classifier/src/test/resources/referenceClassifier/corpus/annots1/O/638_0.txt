(Wehrenberg et al., 2001). Furthermore, Hojo and coworkers (2004) demonstrated that the concentration of estradiol
in the hippocampus of male rats is six-fold higher than the
plasma concentration, strongly suggesting a local estrogen
synthesis in male hippocampi as well. Furthermore, estradiol treatment of hippocampal slices does not result in an
increase of spine synapse density, irrespective of the gender of the animals providing the tissue. From these data it
appears that synaptogenesis is equally regulated by en-dogenous estrogen both in male and female.

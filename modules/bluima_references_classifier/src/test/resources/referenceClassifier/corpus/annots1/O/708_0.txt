trodes, since the former allows a better voltage control (Marty
and Neher, 1983).
Until now, few studies have employed the patch clamp technique in slices to record voltage gated K and Ca currents. In
earlier reports we and others (Spigelman et al., 1992; Stabel et
al., 1992; Karst et al. 1993a,b, 1994) have compared the current
properties, as observed with the patch-clamp technique in slices,
with currents recorded either with sharp microelectrodes in hippocampal slices or with patch electrodes in cultured or acutely
dissociated hippocampal cells. The properties of the K conductances, that is, of the IA and the delayed rectifier, were comparable in terms of voltage dependency, kinetics and sensitivity to
4AP and TEA, respectively (cf. Numann et al., 1987). However,

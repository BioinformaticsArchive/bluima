Calretinin-immunoreactive cells were also sought by tripleimmunofluorescence studies for calretinin, somatostatin, and in-jected biocytin. Nine calretinin cells negative for somatostatin
(n = 7 in layer II/III, and IZ= 2 in layer V) (Rogers, 1992;Kubota
and Kawaguchi, 1994;Kubota et al., 1994)were either RSNP cells
(n = 5) or BSNP cells (n = 4). The electrophysiological parameters of calretinin RSNP and BSNP cells were similar to VIP
RSNP and BSNP cells, respectively (Table 1). These included
cells with descending axonal arbors (double bouquet cells and
bipolar cells) (n = 5) (Fig. 6C) or small basket cells (n = 2). This
suggeststhat calretinin cells have morphological and electrophys-

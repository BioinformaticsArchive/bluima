Identification and characterization of cell types
In this study, we examined excitatory and inhibitory input to nine
different inhibitory cell types in layer 2/3 of the barrel region of
mouse S1. Before describing investigations of the sources of input
to each cell type, we describe results demonstrating the methods
used to reliably sample from and characterize each inhibitory cell
type. Although the methods that we have used clearly distinguish
different cell types, for some of these it is not possible to clearly
relate the cell types studied to those identified in previous studies
(Kawaguchi, 1995; Markram et al., 2004). These relationships are
further considered and relevant publications cited in the context
of each of the cell types described below. A recent review of cortical inhibitory neuron classification and nomenclature is also
instructive (Ascoli et al., 2008).
All of the inhibitory neurons described in this study were sampled from three transgenic mouse lines in which enhanced GFP
was expressed in limited subsets of inhibitory neurons (Table 1).
Thus, our studies are limited to those inhibitory cell types which
express GFP in these mouse lines and exclude other inhibitory
cell types. For each recorded cell, its type is further determined
based on a combination of intrinsic physiological properties,
protein expression, and morphology. Careful characterization of
GFP-positive cells in each line indicated that expression is reliably
limited to only particular neuron types, obviating the need to
measure every property in every GFP-positive neuron. Nevertheless, the intrinsic physiology and morphology, as well as the presence of GFP expression, were characterized for every neuron in
our sample.
We recorded from GFP-expressing inhibitory neurons in the
S1 region of mouse brain slices, facilitated by using three transgenic mouse lines in which enhanced GFP was expressed in limited subsets of inhibitory neurons. These lines were G42 transgenic mice which express GFP under the control of a murine
GAD67 bacterial artificial chromosome clone (Chattopadhyaya
et al., 2004), GIN transgenic mice which express GFP under a 2.8
kbp fragment of the murine GAD67 promoter (Oliva et al., 2000),
and G30 transgenic mice expressing GFP under a 6.5 kb fragment
of the murine GAD65 promoter (Lo ÃÅ pez-Bendito et al., 2004). In
these mouse lines, GFP cells are bright enough for targeted
recordings in living brain slices. Generally GFP cells in G30 and
GIN mouse sections are brighter than those in G42 mouse sections. GFP cells are mostly distributed in upper layers in GIN
and G30, whereas G42 GFP cells are more concentrated in
deeper layers.
GFP cells in G42 mice have been previously identified as
parvalbumin-positive, and those which have been described

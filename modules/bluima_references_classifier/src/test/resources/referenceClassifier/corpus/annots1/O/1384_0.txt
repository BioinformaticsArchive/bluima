Neurotrophins can mediate cell death
A new view of neurotrophin action is emerging, including the
concept that in addition to their growth- and differentiationenhancing effects, neurotrophins can induce neuronal death if
introduced at improper levels or times, either through their Trk
receptors or p75, and associated neurotransmitter receptors
(NGF, von Bartheld et al., 1994; C assaccia-Bonnefil et al., 1996;
Frade et al., 1996; BDN F or N T-3, Fernandez-Sanchez and
Novelli, 1993, 1995; Koh et al., 1995). Such analyses led Koh et al.
(1995) to propose that although neurotrophins f unction to protect
neurons from apoptosis, they also may potentiate neuronal death
by necrosis (Koh et al., 1995). Results from Hoechst 33258 staining of granuleâ€“Purkinje cell cocultures support this idea. All
Purkinje cells in cocultures with granule cells at 6 or 14 div
contain nuclei diff usely labeled by Hoechst staining, suggesting
that any Purkinje cell death occurring at these times is necrotic
(data not shown). These data indicate that a precise balance
between BDNF signaling and glutamate stimulation is vital for
Purkinje cell survival, with excess BDNF triggering Purkinje cell
death.
The finding that cellular environment and/or contacts can alter
Purkinje cell responses to growth factors has implications for

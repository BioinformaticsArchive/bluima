Figure 5. Facilitation of lordosis behavior by 8-br-cGM P and 8-br-cGM P reversal of prazosin inhibition of lordosis behavior. In A, 8-br-cGM P (1 μM) or saline was inf used into the third ventricle of rats primed
only with EB for 44 hr; hourly behavior testing began 4 hr later. In B,
EB-primed rats were injected with 0.5 mg / kg prazosin 1 hr before
inf usion of 1 μM 8-br-cGM P or saline into the third ventricle. P (200 μg)
was given subcutaneously to all the animals at the same time as 8-br-cGM P or saline inf usion. ( indicates the mean L Q 6 SEM from animals
receiving the same hormone priming without prazosin or 8-br-cGM P;
n = 13) (Chu and Etgen, 1997). The data are shown as mean 6 SEM (n =
3–5). p < 0.05 versus saline; T ukey test.

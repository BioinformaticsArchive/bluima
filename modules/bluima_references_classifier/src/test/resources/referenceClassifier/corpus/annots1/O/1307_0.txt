Summary of parameter constraint and verification
Together, Figures 3â€“5 depict a re-creation of salient experiments
performed on octopus cells in vitro and completed in previous
modeling studies (Cai et al., 2000). These figures demonstrate
that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the octopus
cell model were qualitatively similar to those of real octopus cells.

Optimization of Motif Number
We hypothesized that high functional motif number and
diversity represent important ingredients in the global
organization of cortical networks, and that a selective
advantage for these two properties might contribute to the
generation of other significant structural properties. To test
this hypothesis we applied an evolutionary algorithm (Sporns
et al. 2000) that selects for networks with high functional
motif number, while rewiring their connectivity. All simulations were carried out with networks of size N = 30, K =

VIP-containing bipolar cells and double bouquet cells
VIP cells also mostly belonged to RSNP (Fig. 3A2) and BSNP
types (Fig. 3C2). VIP RSNP cells were found in both layers II/III
and V, as were VIP BSNP cells (Table 1). The number of spikes
arising on depolarizing humps in BSNP cells was 2 in all 5 cases.

Corticospinal-to-corticostriatal
This connection was largely absent, precluding analysis of dy-namic properties. A similar lack of connections was found on
testing the potential pathway from corticospinal neurons to an-other class of callosal projection neurons, corticocortical neurons. The “rectifying” connectivity between corticostriatal and
corticospinal neurons implies that corticospinal neurons are
compartmentalized at a downstream position within the excitatory intracortical network.

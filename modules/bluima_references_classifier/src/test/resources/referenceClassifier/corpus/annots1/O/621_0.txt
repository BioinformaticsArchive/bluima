images are generated in many areas of biology, including
automated microscopy of neural tissue [19]. Often,
structures in the tissue must be traced through many
images in a stack. The process of identifying, aligning,
and reconstructing these structures is computationally
intensive [20]. Using the BG/L platform and the current
generic application interfaces to process image stack data
in parallel for rapid reconstruction of 3D structures
observed in microscopic images of neural tissue is,
therefore, another domain for application of this
architecture.

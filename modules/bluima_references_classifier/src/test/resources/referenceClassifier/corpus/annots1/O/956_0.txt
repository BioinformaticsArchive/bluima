Trettel and Levine 2003; Bodor et al. 2005; Glickfeld and
Scanziani 2006). In agreement, anatomical studies have
reported that the expression of CB1 receptors is cell specific
and only a subset of inhibitory terminals express functional CB1
receptors (Bodor et al. 2005; Glickfeld and Scanziani 2006).
Yet, the synaptic properties and connectivity of the inhibitory
neurons expressing CB1 receptors in the neocortex remain
mostly unknown.
Distinct networks of c-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic)
interneurons interconnected by electrical synapses are re-sponsible for promoting different patterns of coordinated
activity within the neocortex (Galarreta and Hestrin 1999;
Gibson et al. 1999; Wilson and Nicoll 2002; Freund 2003;
Klausberger et al. 2005; Somogyi and Klausberger 2005). Two
major types of GABAergic interneurons provide inhibitory terminals at somatic and proximal regions of pyramidal neurons:
parvalbumin-positive, CB1-negative fast-spiking (FS) cells and
parvalbumin-negative, CB1-positive irregular-spiking (CB1-IS) cells
(Galarreta et al. 2004; Bodor et al. 2005). Using paired
recordings, we report here that synapses of CB1-IS cells, but
not synapses of FS cells, are suppressed by release of endocannabinoids from pyramidal neurons. Unitary CB1-IS synapses
showed, in contrast to those of FS cells, a very high failure rate,
long latency, and variable short-term plasticity. Furthermore,
CB1-IS cells received less efficient excitatory drive from local
pyramidal neurons than FS cells. It was previously shown that
networks of FS cells can produce rhythmic activity, whereas
networks of CB1-IS cells are more likely to exhibit nonrhythmic
activity (Gibson et al. 1999; Galarreta et al. 2004; Klausberger
et al. 2005). Taken together, these data suggest that CB1-IS and
FS cells have different impact on cortical networks and that
activity-dependent release of endocannabinoids, by blocking
CB1-IS synapses and not those of FS cells, may control the relative impact of these 2 inhibitory networks on cortical activity.

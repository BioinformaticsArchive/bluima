Fig. 4. Blockade of the Na / K-ATPase does not affect the AMPA-mediated
outward current. (A) In control, AMPA induced an inward current followed by
an outward current. (B) Application of ouabain affected neither the inward nor
the outward current induced by AMPA. (C) Summary plot showing the mean
density of the AMPA-induced outward current in control and ouabain.

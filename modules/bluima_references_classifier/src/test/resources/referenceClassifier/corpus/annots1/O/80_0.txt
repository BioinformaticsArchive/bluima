-DGG has no differential effect on AMPAR-meditated
EPSCs at the pyramidal-to-bitufted synapse
Based on the above results, it seems likely that at the pyramidalto-bitufted synapse, raised Pr resulting from either elevated
[Ca 2 ]o or repetitive stimulation, enhances current amplitudes
by recruiting additional release sites. In addition, however, raised
Pr might also increase the glutamate transient at individual re-lease sites like at the pyramidal-to-multipolar synapse. To test

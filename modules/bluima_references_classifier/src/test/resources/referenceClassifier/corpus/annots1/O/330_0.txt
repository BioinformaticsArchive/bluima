system is not a prerequisite for rudimentary dendrite bundle formation in
the spinal cord, but does appear to be important for bundle maturation.
Two of the animals examined from the 2-week cordotomized groups had
virtually no bundling in the lumbosacral region (Fig. 2a). The remaining
lumbosacral cords of the animals cordotomized at 2 weeks of age did
contain many sections with dendrite bundles. Most bundles, however, were
0.5 mm or less in length and contained at most three to five dendrites; no
sections showed ratings higher than 3. Figure 2b is a representative sample
of these sections. It seems unlikely that this material was inadequately
impregnated as the control cervical levels, which were processed along with
the lumbosacral blocks, showed good impregnation and very complete bundling (Fig. 2~). All animals cordotomized at 2 weeks were killed at an age
at which dendrite bundles are fully developed (ratings 4 and 5) in the
normal kitten (28).
In animals cordotomized at 12 weeks of age, subsequent development
appeared arrested and there was evidence of progressive deterioration of
dendrite bundles. The normal 1Zweek postnatal cat shows quite complex

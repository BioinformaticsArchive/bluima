elegans were 8,930, 17,556, and 76,452 configurations for two-node
permutations and 830,490, 2,299,836, and 21,024,300 configurations
for three-node permutations, respectively.
Similar simulating annealing approaches were employed to create
benchmark networks in which components were rearranged for
maximum total wiring length, or in which connections were rewired
to minimize or maximize average path lengths across the network. In
each case, 20 runs of simulated annealing were performed and the
minimal or maximal values were chosen as lower or upper limit for
the benchmark, respectively.
Minimal rewiring of networks. To investigate the role of longdistance connections in neural systems, we also compared the
original networks with networks of the same size (that is, with an
identical number of nodes and connections) that had been rewired
with the shortest possible connections. In order to generate such
minimally rewired networks, possessing a greatly reduced proportion of long-distance connections, we employed the following
procedure.
Starting with the spatial configuration of nodes in the original
networks, but without edges, a minimum spanning tree was
generated, to ensure that the resulting network would be connected.
The minimum spanning tree for N nodes consists of N  1 edges such
that all nodes are part of the network and the total wiring length of
all edges is minimal (compare [43]). The application of this initial step
was required, since wiring of only the shortest available distances in C.
elegans produced a fragmented network with multiple compartments.
For the more densely connected cortical network of the primate, in
contrast, the wiring of only the shortest distances already resulted in
a connected network. However, for consistency, we started by
creating the minimum spanning tree for both C. elegans and primate
cortical networks. This constituted a conservative approach with
regard to the subsequent computation of average path lengths.
In the next step, all pairwise distances of nodes were calculated and
sorted by length. Starting with the shortest distance between any two
nodes, edges between these nodes were generated until the total
number of edges matched those of the original C. elegans or cortical
networks. Thus, the resulting minimally rewired networks represented a lower bound for the wiring length of a connected network
with the same total number of edges and identical node positions as
in the original neural networks.
Network characterization measures. The following measures were
used to characterize original and rearranged networks. Total wiring
length was the sum of the metric length of all individual connections.
In addition, total wiring volume included information about the
anatomical strength of connections (as a first approximation of fibre
diameter), as derived from tract-tracing experiments. The volume of
an individual fibre was calculated as its metric length multiplied by its
squared anatomical strength or density (as given by ordinal values 1,
2, or 3; 1 being the sparsest), with the total wiring volume as the sum
of the volume of all individual fibres.
The average path length was the average number of connections
that had to be passed on the shortest paths between all pairs of
network nodes. It was calculated using Floyd's algorithm (compare
[43]). The average metric path length described the metric distance
that had to be travelled on average along the edges of the shortest
path between any two network nodes. Therefore, it represented the
average total wiring length of the shortest paths of the network. The
clustering coefficient [19] was the proportion of actually present
connections, out of all possible connections, among network nodes
directly connected to a target node (i.e., the index measured the
local connectivity among the target node's neighbours). The
coefficient was calculated as the average over all individual nodes
of the network.
Control calculations for C. elegans network: Variations in connection site. One possible confound of the C. elegans analyses was that
exact positions of synapses were not included in the data, so
morphological differences between neurons may have influenced the
actual length of projections between neurons. Therefore, we tested the
effect of variations in the position of synapses, by varying the
connection distances between individual neurons through shifts in
soma positions. As the animal extends mainly in the horizontal
direction, variations in the spatial positions of synapses and cell bodies
matter most along the horizontal axis. The position of each neuron
along the longitudinal axis was shifted randomly rostrally or caudally,
following a normal distribution with the mean around the actual
position and a standard deviation of 10% of the total length of the
worm (0.12 mm). Twenty different networks with varied longitudinal
position were tested for potential reductions of total wiring length. A
reduction of total wiring length was found that was almost as large as for

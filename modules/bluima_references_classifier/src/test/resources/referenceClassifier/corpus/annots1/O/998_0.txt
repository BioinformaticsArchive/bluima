specific synapsin-1 promoter (Ku Ìˆ gler et al., 2001; Boulos et al.,
2006), as this promoter avoids randomization of distribution
patterns due to overexpression (Vigot et al., 2006). To accurately
release the N-terminal Myc-epitope in the Myc-GB1a and MycGB1b proteins, we used a surrogate signal peptide instead of the
intrinsic signal peptides (Ango et al., 1999). We coexpressed
Myc-GB1a or Myc-GB1b with the freely diffusible red fluorescent
protein (RFP) tdimer2, which outlines the morphology of the

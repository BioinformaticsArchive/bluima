well as nematode unc-33. The sense primer is composed of all
possible codons for the amino acid residue stretch from 24 –34 of
CRMP and the antisense primer from residues 380 –390. These
primers were used to amplify sequences from an adult rat brain
cDNA library and for cDNA derived from postnatal day 1 (P1) rat
brain mRNA. With both cDNA sources, we obtained a single
major product from the PCR reaction with the expected size of 1.1
kb. The amplified DNA was subcloned, and 41 independent
clones were analyzed for the sample derived from adult brain
cDNA, and 61 clones were analyzed from the neonatal cDNA
sample. By restriction digest analysis and Southern blotting, we
determined that 24 clones corresponded to rCRMP-1, 58 to

Summary

Quantum indeterminism may make available the option of an interactionism that does
not have to pay the price of a force over and above those forces that are acknowledged
in physics in order to explain how intentions can be physically effective. I show how
this option might work in concrete terms and offer a criticism of it.

1. Introduction

The aim of this paper is to clarify in what respect quantum indeterminism may be
relevant when it comes to the problem how free will relates to physics. I show that there
is an option according to which quantum physics paves the way for a particular solution
to this problem and offer a critical evaluation of this option.1
One can endorse compatibilism, that is the position that free will is compatible with
physics even if physics is deterministic (see, for instance, O'Leary-Hawthrone and
Pettit, 1996). In this case, one takes the issue of free will to be independent of the issue
whether physics is deterministic or indeterministic. In this case, there is hence no need
to pay particular attention to quantum indeterminism. By contrast, if one subscribes to a
libertarian position, one claims that indeterminism in physics is a necessary condition
for free will. One may then envisage making use of quantum indeterminism to support
such a position. I shall be concerned only with examining this latter possibility. Let us
therefore, for the sake of argument, adopt the following two assumptions:
a) Intentions are not identical with or realized as physical states or events,
such as, for instance, brain states or events in the brain.
b) Intentions are causally relevant to some physical events. For instance, if
you have the intention to raise your arm, and your arm goes up, then
that intention counts among the causes of that event. If there had not
[178] been that intention, then, ceteris paribus, your arm would not have
gone up at that particular time.
By physical states or events, I mean, for the sake of the argument of this paper, all and
only those types of states and events which are acknowledged in our physical theories
taken in a broad sense – that is, including biology and neurophysiology, but excluding
descriptions in intentional vocabulary such as “having the intention to raise one's arm”.
Note, however, that employing descriptions in intentional vocabulary as such is
innocuous as far as the argument of this paper is concerned. The point is whether or not
the phenomena to which these descriptions refer are identical with or realized as

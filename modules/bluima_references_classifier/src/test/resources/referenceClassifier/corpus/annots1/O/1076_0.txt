The recovery of membrane conductance after activity
The most plausible explanation of the recovery in membrane conductance
is that the potasium lost during activity was reabsorbed from the external
fluid by the axis cylinder. Another possibility is that the excess potassium
disappeared by diffusing along the axon into the agar wick electrodes which
acted as potassium sinks. Calculation indicates that a process of this kind
would require about 1 hr. to be 70 % complete. It was therefore unlikely
to account for more than a fraction of the recovery observed. The effect of
diffusion into the electrode could be eliminated experimentally by removing
the polarizing electrode from the axon during the greater part of the recovery
period. The electrode had to be brought into contact with the axon for a few
seconds in order to determine the recovery curve. But the total time in which
it was in contact could be made so small that diffusion could be safely ignored.
This test showed that recovery occurred in exactly the same way whether the
electrode was in contact with the axon throughout the whole of the recovery
period or during a small part of it. Recovery curves obtained in the normal
way therefore give a true picture of the absorption of a potassium-like substance
into the axis cylinder.
Recovery curves after five tetani of different frequency are given in Textfig. 9 a. In the interpretation of these curves the membrane conductance
may be taken as roughly proportional to the external potassium concentration.

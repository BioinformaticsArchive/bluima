A new method for visualizing gap junctions at the light microscopic level. (a) Parvalbumin (PV)–immunoreactive neuron in layer 5 of area 18 gives rise to a descending dendrite that forms a dendrodendritic contact at a distal site
(arrow). (b) Enlargement of the contact site in a, visualized by dual-confocal laser-scanning microscopy for PV
(green) and connexin 36 (Cx36; red). Two Cx36-immunoreactive punctate structures (1, 2) are located between the
contacting dendrites (asterisks). (c) Immunoelectron micrograph of the same structures shown in b. The contacting
dendrites (asterisks) demarcated by open squares and circles, as well as another neighboring profile (arrowhead),
can be identified with DAB labeling for PV. Enlarged views of the contact sites (1, 2) clearly indicate ultrastructural
profiles of gap junctions at the positions corresponding to Cx36-immunoreacitve puncta in b. By this direct method,
coincidence of Cx36-immunoreactive puncta and gap junctions was confirmed in 17 of 17 Cx36-positive puncta.
Scale bars: a, 50 μm; b, c, 1 μm; right panels, 0.1 μm. (Reproduced with permission from Fukuda and others 2006;

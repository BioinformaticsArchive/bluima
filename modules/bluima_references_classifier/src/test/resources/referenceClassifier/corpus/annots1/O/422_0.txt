membrane potential (25). Antimycin A
and oligomycin (Sigma) were injected into
the culture media to a final concentration
of 10 μmol/l and 1 μmol/l, respectively, at
1 min following baseline fluorescence
measurements. All axons in each field
were assessed as average of
fluorescence pixel intensity per axon
length using the Carl Zeiss software
package (16).
Intra-mitochondrial ROS
measurement. Intra-mitochondrial ROS
generation, mainly superoxide, was
detected using the fluorescent MitoSOX
red dye (Molecular Probes, cat
#M36008). Lumbar DRG neurons were
loaded with 400 nmol/l of MitoSOX red (in
100% anhydrous DMSO; Molecular
Probes) for 15 min with or without 1.0
μmol/l oligomycin at 370C, and then
washed three times with F-12 and excited
at 514 nm and emission > 560 nm.
Respiratory chain function. Oxygen
consumption was determined at 37°C
using the OROBOROS Oxygraph-2K
(OROBOROS Instruments GmbH,
Innsbruck, Austria) (8). Mitochondria
from freshly isolated and intact lumbar
DRG were resuspended in KCl medium
(80 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 3.0
mmol/l MgCl2, 1.0 mmol/l EDTA, 5.0
mmol/l potassium phosphate, pH 7.4).
Various substrates and inhibitors of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain
complexes were used as described (8).
Enzymatic activities in lumbar DRG
mitochondrial preparations were
performed spectrophotometrically as
previously described (8).
Statistical analysis. Where appropriate,
data were subjected to one-way ANOVA
with post-hoc comparison using Tukey's
test or regression analysis with a onephase exponential decay parametric test
with Fisher's parameter (GraphPad Prism

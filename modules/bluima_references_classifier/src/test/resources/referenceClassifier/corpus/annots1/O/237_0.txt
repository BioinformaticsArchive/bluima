shocked 3 unshocked), all Ps < 0.05. Unshocked 3 un-shocked rats had significantly longer response durations than
all the other groups, all Ps < 0.05. No other differences were
statistically significant, P > 0.05.
Rats that had previously received noncontingent shock
(shocked 3 unshocked, shocked 3 yoked) continued to re-spond throughout the test session and exhibited a greater number of flexion responses (Fig. 6, bottom). Again similar results
were obtained irrespective of whether contingent shock was
applied to the ipsilateral or contralateral leg, all Fs < 1.00, P >
0.05. Consequently, we collapsed the data across this variable
(Fig. 6, right). The subsequent ANOVA revealed a significant
main effect of group and a group × time interaction, both Fs >
1.66, P < 0.01. The main effect of time was not significant,
F(29, 1218) = 1.26, P > 0.05. Post hoc tests confirmed that
rats that had received only noncontingent shock (shocked 3
yoked, shocked 3 unshocked) made more contacts with the
salt solution than both the shocked 3 master rats and the
unshocked 3 unshocked rats, all Ps < 0.05. No other differences approached significance, P > 0.05.
SUMMARY. As previously reported (Joynes and Grau 1998,
2001), intrathecal naltrexone blocked the expression of the
behavioral deficit, allowing previously shocked rats to acquire
the instrumental response. More importantly, this instrumental
training had a long-term therapeutic effect that naltrexone
alone did not, reducing the adverse consequences of noncontingent nociceptive stimulation. This benefit of behavioral
training was observed 24 h after drug treatment and was
evident on both the pretreated and opposite leg. The fact that
the therapeutic effect extends to the contralateral leg suggests
that the benefits of behavioral training do not reflect a peripheral modification. Rather it appears that instrumental training
reverses a centrally mediated process that undermines behavioral potential within the spinal cord. Rats that received the
drug in combination with either nothing (shocked 3 un-shocked) or noncontingent shock (shocked 3 yoked) exhibited
the usual behavioral deficit. This suggests that the drug treatment alone was not sufficient—the pharmacological manipulation was only effective when combined with behavioral training.

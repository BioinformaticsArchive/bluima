Systems Level
Cortical circuits comprise many tens of thousands of neurons.
Thus, any functional difference endowed at the neuronal level
by specialization in pyramidal cell structure must necessarily
then be amplified in the cortical circuitry. It follows that the
extent of the cellular specialization, and differences in the
numbers of cells within a network, may determine the functional capabilities of the cortical circuits. Surprisingly few
studies have addressed this issue, and those that have have
revealed spectacular results. Fuster and colleagues revealed that
the discharge properties of neurons in V1 differed from those in
inferotemporal (IT) cortex, those in the former being characterized by phasic discharge properties whereas those in the latter

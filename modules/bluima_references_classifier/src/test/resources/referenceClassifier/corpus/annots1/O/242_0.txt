Morphology and passive properties
A TC cell from rat ventrobasal nucleus (shown in Fig. 1 A) (also
see Huguenard and Prince, 1992) was reconstructed using a
three-dimensional tracing system. The reconstructed TC cell is
shown in Fig. 1 B (see Materials and Methods for details concerning the tracing of the cell). There were 11 primary dendrites,
having a total length of 7095 μm; the total membrane area of the
cell was 23,980.5 μm 2, including 2625 μm 2 for the soma, which
was ;20 –25 μm in diameter (assuming that a 0.1 μm error on
diameters leads to approximately 69% error on the total membrane area). The dendritic arborizations tended to be organized
in a bush-like structure, similar to previous morphological observations (Jones, 1985).
Voltage-clamp recordings of passive responses obtained in that
cell are shown in Fig. 1 A. These recordings were used to estimate
the passive parameters by fitting the model to the data (Fig. 1C).
Because model and data correspond to the exact same cellular
geometry, this procedure leads to a unique set of passive parameters if they are uniform (Rall et al., 1992).
To perform passive fitting, leak currents were inserted in all
compartments of the reconstructed cell model. The values of the
passive parameters [leak conductance ( gL ), leak reversal potential (EL ), axial resistivity (Ra ), and specific membrane capacitance (Cm )] and the electrode series resistance (Rs ) were ob-tained by fitting the simulations to experimental data using a
simplex algorithm (Press et al., 1986). At each iteration of the
simplex algorithm, the model was run, and the root mean squared
(rms) error between the experimental recording and the model
was minimized. This procedure was repeated from different initial conditions to avoid unstable values of parameters. The values
of passive parameters were considered uniform and were consistent with the values estimated from the recordings. Approxi-

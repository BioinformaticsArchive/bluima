ulation by PKC in neurons. The rationale
is that overexpression of the channel binding domain from PP2c will compete with
and therefore displace endogenous PP2c
for binding to Ca 2 channels and effectively reduce the local PP2c concentration near Ca 2 channels. As a result, more
channels will become phosphorylated
when PKC is activated (Fig. 7A).
Mutagenesis studies showed that the
channel binding domain in PP2c was lo-cated downstream of the catalytic domain,
within a fragment of 100 aa residues (Fig.
2, PP2c -D2). Blast of the GenBank database with this fragment did not pick up
any other proteins except PP2c itself, in-dicating that overexpression of PP2c -D2
is less likely to interfere with other signaling processes in neurons. As expected,
when GFP-tagged PP2c -D2 was overexpressed in hippocampal neurons, modulation of Ca 2 currents by PDBu developed much faster and became more
effective, compared with nontransfected
control neurons (Fig. 7). The time re-quired for modulation to develop from 10
to 90% of the maximal response (T10 –90)
was reduced from 270.5 44.9 s for control (n 12) to 147.9 17.1 s for PP2cD2-transfected neurons (n 9; p 0.02).
Transfection of GFP-PP2c -D2 did not
affect voltage-dependent activation of the
Ca 2 currents (Fig. 7D,E). Effects of GFPPP2c -D2 on potentiation of Ca 2 currents by PDBu were observed at all the test
voltages (Fig. 7E). On average, potentia- 2

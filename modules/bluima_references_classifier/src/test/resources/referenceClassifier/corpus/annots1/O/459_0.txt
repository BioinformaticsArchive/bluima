Figure 1. Immunohistochemically classified GABA cells in rat frontal cortex. (Left) Shared chemical composition of GABA cells. CB, calbindin D28k; CCK, cholecystokinin; CR,
calretinin; NPY, neuropeptide Y; PV, parvalbumin; SOM, somatostatin; VIP,vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. In addition to pyramidal cells of layers II/III, calbindin D28k is expressed
either weakly or strongly in GABA cells immunoreactive for somatostatin or parvalbumin. In layers V and VI, calbindin D28k is strongly expressed mainly in somatostatin cells. The
relative number of cells immunoreactive for a substance is proportional to the size of the box. (Right) Three chemical classes of GABA cells stained by triple immunofluorescence
method using DTAF for parvalbunin (A), TRITC for somatostatin (B) and AMCA for VIP (C). Parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) and VIP-immunoreactive cells are single-labeled cells.
Asterisks show capillary as landmarks. Scale bar, 50 Î¼m.

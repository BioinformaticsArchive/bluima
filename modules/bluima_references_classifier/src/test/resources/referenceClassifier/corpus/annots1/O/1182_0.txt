a recall of 0.633. This compares favourably with the
manually constructed heuristic rules reported in [66],
which achieved precision and recall values of 0.730 and
0.657, respectively.
For the purposes of the BioLexicon construction, we
generated 1,000 normalization rules, using the gene/protein names gathered from existing databases as the dictionary for normalization rule generation (given that these
names represented an updated set compared to those of
the BioThesaurus). Terms that could not be mapped to
any accession number were omitted. Further control of
the quality of new term variants was assured by filtering
out highly ambiguous terms - those that were mapped to
more than 10 accession numbers were discarded.

Figure 7. Whole-cell recordings of ePSCs of non-CR cells after electrical stimulation in de-veloping neocortex. A, Seven traces recorded from a non-CR cell after electrical stimulation
(triangle) at layer 1 of a P6 slice are superimposed. B, ePSCs were recorded in the presence of
bicuculline after electrical stimulation at layer 2/3 in a P7 slice. Both monosynaptic and polysynaptic components of non-CR cells were resistant to bicuculline (better observed in washout of
APV). APV abolished the polysynaptic component but still left the very rapid monosynaptic
currents. Three traces were superimposed (left and right) and averaged (middle). C, The monosynaptic ePSCs of non-CR cells after stimulation at layer 1 in a P8 slice were characterized by
different combinations of antagonists. D, Paired recording between P9 non-CR cells. The action
potential elicited by current injection into cell 1 induced ePSC in postsynaptic cell 2, which was
completely blocked by bicuculline.

shown here to be a crucial factor that requires that the cell use
a buffer that is either very mobile or very concentrated if it is
to be effective at sites of large calcium influx. The three main
goals of the present study were (1) to provide a general understanding of the possibilities and limitations of buffered diffusion
from point sources, (2) to provide the theoretical basis for the
interpretation of experimental data, and (3) to incorporate previous physiological and anatomical data into a model of the
presynaptic calcium concentration in frog saccular hair cells.
Materials and Methods
Geometrical assumptions
Two models of the cytoplasmic space were used, one using simple
geometrical assumptions (diffusion from a single point into a large volume), the other incorporating more spatial details. There were two main
reasons for beginning with the simple model. On a conceptual level, it
allows one to understand the basic principles of buffered diffusion without introducing unnecessary complexity. On a computational level, it
makes the calculation of the complete time course of changes in [Ca?+],
tractable. This model is useful for understanding the effect of a mobile
buffer on [Ca*+], near a single channel, or far enough from a cluster of
channels that they appear as a single point source. The second model
was needed to investigate the spatial variations in [Ca*+], within a cluster
of channels, and to relate the simulations to previous experimental data.
The price ofthe greater spatial detail in the second model was the greatly
increased computation time, which made it impractical to calculate the
time course of changes in [Cal+],. Instead, only the steady-state [Caz+],
was calculated. As will be shown below, this steady-state calculation is
useful for understanding the calcium concentration profile within an
array of channels during maintained depolarizations. No attempt was
made to incorporate the hair cell's overall shape or size into either model
because, on the distance scale of interest here, the hair cell's plasma
membrane is nearly flat and the cytoplasmic volume nearly infinite (see
below).

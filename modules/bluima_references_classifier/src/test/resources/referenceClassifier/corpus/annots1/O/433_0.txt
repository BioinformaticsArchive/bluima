Molecular and biophysical studies of influences
on sexual arousal in female animals
Arousal. In recent years, a concept named “generalized CNS arousal” has been defined in the following
way: A more aroused animal or human being (i) is more
responsive to sensory stimuli in all sensory modalities,
(ii) emits more spontaneous motor activity, and (iii) is
more reactive emotionally [37]. From the behavior of es-trous female rats, it is obvious that prior to and during the
series of mating behaviors with male rat the females are
more aroused. They locomote more and faster; they have
a great deal of muscular tension; their darting movements
once stopped leave them in a braced position ready to
support the weight of the male rat; and their axial muscles
are so tense that rapid head movements result in ear wiggling [8]. In several respects, these courtship behaviors
foster successful mating with the male. Striking was the
recent report of Holder and Mong [38] that chemical activation of arousal pathways by methamphetamine results
in more courtship behaviors and in the expression of fos,
an immediate early gene, in nerve cells involved in fe-male sexual behavior.
Genes connected with estrogen signaling are not limited in their effects to changes in locomotor activity and
other responses. They also affect social behaviors by
altering the stimulus properties of the animal engaging
in social behavior [39]. As a result, the other animal's be-havior is changed, thus causing the first animal to behave
differently, and so forth, potentially radiating through a
long time series of responses. For example, Ågmo et al.
[40] found that the social or sexual incentive properties
of animals with the ER-beta gene or the oxytocin gene
knocked out were different from their wild-type controls.
In experimental animals, we must infer “arousal” from
the tension and rapidity of movements as noted above
and also from motor and vocal acts animals will perform
to meet their mates, because introspective reports of
feelings are not available as they would be with human
subjects. Along these lines, a long history of classical
studies, notably from the laboratory of Bengt Meyerson
in Sweden, showed that female rats would perform active
work to approach a male rat, and that this behavioral proclivity was increased by estrogen treatment (reviewed in
[41]). More recently, a wider variety of proceptive behaviors has been studied. For example, female hamsters use
ultrasounds for a portion of their precopulatory behaviors

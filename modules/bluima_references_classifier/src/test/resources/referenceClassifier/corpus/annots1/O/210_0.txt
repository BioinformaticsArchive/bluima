A decrease or a pause in the discharge is observed when such a fibres
are stimulated at low frequency. It is very likely that in these conditions
of stimulation the unloading of the spindle which results from the contraction of extrafusal muscle fibres is not compensated by the weak
contraction of intrafusal muscle fibres innervated by the same ax fibre.
On the contrary, when higher rates of stimulation are used, the intrafusal
contraction counteracts the unloading effect and the result of these
opposite actions is an acceleration of the discharge of the primary ending.
When the rate of stimulation is higher than the tetanic fusion frequency
this acceleration continues to increase progressively because the unloading
factor does not increase whereas the intrafusal factor does.
We are aware that the tension or the shortening recorded at the tendon
may not be a faithful image of the mechanical events taking place in the
vicinity of the spindle, although distortion in this exceptionally small and
short muscle is likely to be less important than in larger muscles. At any
rate the fact that we also found discharges of primary endings whose
frequency was proportional to the tension developed by motor units
(p. 658), regardless of the rates of stimulation used, enhances the value of
the observations reported on p. 656.
Discharges of this second type were more frequently found with fastcontracting units which develop relatively high tensions and were observed
mostly when the resting tension was high. Mechanical actions exerted on
spindles by the contraction of extrafusal muscle fibres are probably
responsible for them, since their frequency depends on the tension de-veloped by these fibres. Similar explanations have been proposed by
Hunt & Kuffler (1951b) for the discharges they recorded during twitches
or brief tetani and by Harvey & Matthews (1961 a) for the discharges of
soleus spindles elicited by repetitive stimulation of the muscle nerve. Pulling
exerted by muscle fibres situated in series with spindles may not be the only
possible mechanism. Augmentation of intramuscular pressure or uneven
deformation of the spindle might also be responsible for these discharges.
The experiments on curarization showing the persistence of discharges of
primary endings after stimulation of slow a fibres in the absence of any
extrafusal activity lend themselves to a simple explanation, based on
Granit, Homma & Matthews's (1959) observations that extrafusal neuromuscular junctions are more easily blocked by gallamine triethiodide than
intrafusal junctions. The selective blocking was easier to obtain than we
expected. We attribute this to the fact that Flaxedil injected intravenously
reached the junctions through the artery of the muscle, which was carefully
preserved, and also to the high rate at which we stimulated the a fibre so as
to add the action of fatigue to the action of the curarizing substance.
It is very difficult to compare our results with Granit, Pompeiano &

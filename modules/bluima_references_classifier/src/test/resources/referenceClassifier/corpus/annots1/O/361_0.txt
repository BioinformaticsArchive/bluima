would occur consistently in cells pre-selected on anatomical
bases. These data therefore indicate that the three subclasses of
BCs do not simply lie on a smooth continuum of molecular
diversity and strongly support the anatomical and electrophysiological evidence that these cells constitute distinct basket
cell subclasses. While mRNA expression patterns for calcium
binding protein were less distinctive for the different subclasses
of BCs, some trends seem to emerge; CR mRNA expression was

thyroid hormone-regulated expression occurred when se-quences from -177 to -166of the genewereremoved. In
contrast, our studies indicate that full thyroid hormone-regulated expression occurs when these sequences are deleted
(Fig. 1, pGH-cat(51, pGH-cat(G), andpGH-cat(l0)). Using
stable transformants,Wight et al. (30) reported that a thyroid
hormone stimulatory element is located between -254 and
-241 and that a thyroid hormone inhibitory element is present between -46 and -21. However, we found no L-T3
inhibition of CAT expression with pGH-cat plasmids extending to -145 (pGH-cat(1)) or -104 (pGH-cat(2)) (Fig. 1).
Secondly, incontrast with the -236/-178 fragment, se- quences from -530 to -237 did not mediate L-T3 stimulation
of CAT expression (Fig. 1).The reasons for these different
results areunclear but raise the possibility that several regions
maybe able to function as a thyroid hormone response
element, depending on thelocation of these sequences relative
to other regulatory elements of the promoter and the nature
of the promoter used for functional analysis.
Functional studies using an enhancerless RSV promoter
(Fig. 3) suggest that both a distal thyroid hormone response
element and a cell-specific basal element are required for
efficient L-T3 regulated expression of the ratgrowth hormone
gene. We have also recently found that both the thyroid
hormone and thecell-specificelements are required to confer
L-T3 regulated expression to thenhancerless SV40 promoter
of pAIo-Cat2 (32). Since these sequences function in an
orientation-independent manner (Figs. 1 and 3), they appear
to behave as a functional enhancerunit which can confer
both cell-specific and thyroid hormone-regulated expression.
T o account for our observations we propose a mechanism
where two elements are required for L-T3 stimulationin
which hormone receptor cell-specific protein interactions oc-cur. In thismodel we assume that theL-T3-receptor complex
binds to sequences in the-208/-178 region (Fig. 11B) which
actsto“stabilize”or“enhance”theprotein-DNAinteractions
of the cell-specific basal element to form a more “active”
transcription complexwhich increases the level of gene
expression. Although we have not verified that thefunctional
element inthe -208/-178region binds receptor, the 31-nucleotide sequence contains an interesting region of reverse
dyad symmetry (Fig. 11B).This region also showsome
homology with 5“flanking DNA of other rat genes whichare
stimulated by L-T3 after in vivo administration (9).
Recent studies on the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter support an analogous two-element model for glucocorticoid hormone stimulation of gene expression. Inactivation
of the binding site for the NF-I transcription factor (or a
protein with a similar recognition sequence; e.g. TGGCAbinding protein) markedly lowers glucocorticoid stimulation
without significantly altering basal gene activity (33, 34).
Furthermore, in vivo footprinting indicates that glucocorticoid
hormone incubation increases the association of NF-I with
its cognate sequence (35) suggesting that the glucocorticoid
receptor enhances NF-I binding or interacts with NF-I to
form a transcription complex which activates expression of
the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Since the control
elements of other thyroidhormone-responsive genes have not
yet been identified, it is not possible to determine whether
two elements are necessary for L-T3 regulated expression in
other systems. However, it provides a mechanism to explain
how thyroid hormone can positively (e.g.rat growth hormone)
or negatively (e.g.thyroid stimulatinghormone) regulate gene
expression. Whether positive or negative regulation occurs

Discussion
Each GABAergic cell subtype is assumed to make axon terminals
on relatively specific surfaces of cortical cells (Somogyi, 1989;
Jones, 1993). In addition to which subcellular domain is
innervated, it is also important to know whether each GABA cell
subtype innervates cortical cells uniformly or specifically. There
may be GABA cells specialized to inhibit specific cell types in
cortical circuits. Recently a systematic analysis with double
immunostaining techniques identified specialized interneurons
that innervate specific subsets of interneurons in the
hippocampus (interneuron-selective cells) (Freund and Buzs치ki,
1996). Hippocampal GA BAergic interneurons that selectively
innervate other interneurons are immunoreactive for calretinin
and/or VIP (Acs치dy et al., 1996a,b; Guly치s et al., 1996). These
interneuron-selective cells are proposed to have a role in
synchronizing inhibitory cells (Freund and Buzs치ki, 1996). In
the cortex, there is also a GABAergic cell group immunoreactive
for VIP and/or calretinin (Fig. 1), including double bouquet cells
and arcade cells (Fig. 5). These cells may make GABAergic
synapses onto specific cell subtypes in the cortex. The axons of
cortical calretinin-immunoreactive cells indeed form synapses
with pyramidal cells in deeper layers, but with GABAergic
neurons in the superficial layers (Meskenaite, 1997), including
parvalbumin- or calbindin D28k-immunoreactive cells (Gabbott
and Bacon, 1996).
Electron microscopic obser vations with postembedding
GABA immunohistochemistry revealed that axon terminals of
all identified non-pyramidal cell subtypes contain GABA.
Using paired intracellular recording, FS cells as well as other
physiological classes of non-pyramidal cells indeed elicit fast
IPSPs in pyramidal cells, probably via GA BAA receptors
(Deuchars and Thomson, 1995a; Thomson et al., 1996). Each
GABA cell subtype differs in firing mode, axonal arborization
pattern, postsynaptic target, co-localized transmitters and
perhaps postsynaptic cell type. Furthermore, IPSPs induced by
these GABAergic cells may also be different among cell subtypes. Recent paired recordings between identified inhibitory
non-pyramidal cells and pyramidal cells show that FS cells elicit
shorter-duration IPSPs than other physiological classes of
non-pyramidal cells (Thomson et al., 1996). GABAA and GABAB
IPSPs are separately induced by stimulation at particular
locations, and are considered to be mediated by distinct classes
of inhibitory neurons (Benardo et al., 1994; Kang et al., 1994).
These findings suggest that different types of GABA receptors
are expressed on postsynaptic sites of terminals of GABA cell
subtypes.
Each type of GABA cell displays specific patterns of axonal
arborizations in the cortex. Excitatory pyramidal cells also have
extensive arborizations of local axon collaterals (Gilbert and
Wiesel, 1979, 1983; Martin and Whitteridge, 1984). These
collaterals of pyramidal cells innervate non-pyramidal cells as
well as other pyramidal cells (Thomson and Deuchars, 1994).

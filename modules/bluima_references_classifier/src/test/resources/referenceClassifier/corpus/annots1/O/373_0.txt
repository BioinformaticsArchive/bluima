Stress does not alter spine density immediately after
its cessation in males or females
Next we present data that evaluated the effects of stress on apical
dendritic spine density in area CA1 within minutes of stressor
cessation (Fig. 1 A). Using the stress condition (stress versus no
stress) and sex and stage of estrous (male versus estrus female
versus diestrus 2 female) as independent variables, there was no
main effect of stress (F(1,28) 0.95; p 0.34) and no interaction
between stress and sex versus stages of estrous (F(2,28) 0.01; p
0.99). Thus, there was no effect of stress on dendritic spine density
immediately after stressor cessation. However, there was a main
effect of estrous stage and sex differences (F(2,28) 5.32; p
0.01). Females in estrus had a reduced density compared with
females in diestrus 2 ( p 0.01) and males ( p 0.05). The mean
density ( SEM) was 13/10 0.71 m for males, 14/10 0.66 m

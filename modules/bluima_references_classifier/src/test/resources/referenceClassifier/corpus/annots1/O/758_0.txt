Our observations may help reconcile
the opposing views on the effect of spike
broadening on presynaptic ICa among different synapses. At the squid giant synapse, classical work showed that an AP
opens only a small fraction of presynaptic
VGCCs ( 10%) (Pumplin et al., 1981;
Llinas et al., 1982) and that AP broadening
enhances calcium entry primarily by in-creasing the number of calcium channels
that open, leading to large increases in the
amplitude of ICa (Augustine, 1990). In
contrast, theoretical computer simulations and experimental evidence in central
synapses, including the calyx of Held synapse, demonstrate that an AP effectively
opens a majority of VGCCs ( 70%), and
AP broadening increases calcium influx
mainly, if not exclusively, by prolonging
the kinetics of calcium currents with little

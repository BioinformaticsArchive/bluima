above motor threshold, the extra force that arose in addition to
the direct response to motor axon stimulation could reach >40%
M VC. E xamples are shown in Figure 1, B and C, for trains of
stimuli lasting 60 and 7 sec, respectively. The additional force
arose at a variable latency after the onset of the trains and could
be evoked using a variety of stimulation protocols. Across eight
subjects the maximal force in a prolonged train lasting >10 sec
(as in Fig. 1 B) increased 1.6 –5.7 fold over the force 0.5 sec into
the train. This represented a mean increase of 21 6 6% MVC
(mean 6 SEM; range, 7– 43% M VC). Peak force occurred 44 6
11 sec after stimulus onset (range, 8 –106 sec). This additional
force occurred even though the force due to the direct stimulation
of motor axons declined. This is shown in Figure 1 B by the
reduction in the amplitude of the response to the brief test train
(five stimuli at 100 Hz; mean reduction across the eight subjects,
56%). This decrease presumably reflects a reduced number of
stimulated motor axons (Bergmans, 1970; Vagg et al., 1998) and
peripheral fatigue in the muscle fibers activated by the stimulated
motor axons. Sometimes the stimulation induced a cramp in the
calf muscles that could be avoided by moving the stimulating
electrodes or reducing the stimulus intensity.
To exclude the possibility that these unexpected forces re-flected an odd peripheral property of the stimulated motor axons
and the innervated muscle fibers, we assessed responses during
block of the tibial nerve in two subjects. This prevented activation
of motoneurons via reflex or antidromic paths and the resulting
forces could only arise from peripheral properties of the motor
axons and muscle fibers beneath the stimulating electrodes. When
muscles below the knee were paralyzed and “disconnected” from
the CNS in this way, the additional forces associated with sustained high-frequency stimulation were absent (Fig. 1C), and the
evoked forces were much more consistent and predictable.
The relationship between stimulus frequency and the evoked
force was investigated with a triangular pattern of stimulation
with increasing then decreasing stimulus frequencies (Fig. 2). The
evoked force remained abnormally high or even increased as the
stimulus frequency declined. In some instances a prominent “take
off” for the extra force was identified (Fig. 2, arrow), although the
stimulus frequency when this occurred was variable across subjects (between ;30 and 100 Hz). This resulted in a marked
distortion of the relationship between stimulus frequency and
evoked force clearly evident by the hysteresis in the forcefrequency plot in Figure 2 B. This distortion was abolished during

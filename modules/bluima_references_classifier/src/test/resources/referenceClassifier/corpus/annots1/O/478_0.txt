Figure 6. Plasma ACTH response to an acute 30 min restraint stress of posterior BST lesion
rats were elevated at the 30 and 60 min time points compared with sham rats at their respective
time points ( p 0.05), whereas plasma ACTH levels of anterior BST lesion rats were not
different compared with shams. Data are shown as mean SEM; n 7â€“12. *p 0.05 versus
sham.

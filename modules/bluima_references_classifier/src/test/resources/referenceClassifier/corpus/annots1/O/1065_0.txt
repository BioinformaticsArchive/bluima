Implications for the mechanisms underlying GP synchrony in
Parkinson's disease
In PD, GP neurons and the tightly coupled neurons in the STN
spike in synchronous rhythmic bursts. The motor symptoms of
the disease are thought to arise from this pathological spiking
pattern (Bergman et al., 1998; Vitek, 2002). The mechanisms
responsible for the emergence of the synchronous discharge have
yet to be clearly defined. Recent simulations of the GP/STN network argue that enhanced striatopallidal inhibition after striatal
dopamine depletion could trigger the development of synchrony
(Terman et al., 2002). Our data are strongly supportive of this
model, providing clear evidence that striatopallidal GABAergic
synaptic contacts are capable of resetting the pacemaking mechanism in GP projection neurons. In this way, shared striatopallidal input or simply temporally correlated activity should be ca-pable of inducing phase synchrony among a subpopulation of GP
neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that this feature of the

Two different test signals were applied to the proximal end of the
spine neck via a “perfect” voltage clamp (SEClamp with series resistance rs 1000 Ω): a depolarizing spike waveform from resting potential
that was based on a cubic spline fit to an optically recorded spike
waveform, and a 50 ms × 50 mV hyperpolarizing step from resting
potential. The amplitudes of these signals were monitored in the
spine neck and spine head.
Source code for these models will be made available from
ModelDB https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ (Hines et al.
2004).

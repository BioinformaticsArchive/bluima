Introduction
To survive, owners of large brains must compete with owners of
small brains. However, in large brains, action potentials must
travel for long distances, placing limits on the speed at which
information can be processed. This scaling problem is particularly apparent in mammalian brains, which, from shrew to whale,
can vary in diameter by nearly 100-fold and in volume by
100,000-fold. Even in brains as small as that of the rabbit, crossbrain conduction times on the order of 100 ms have been ob-served (Swadlow, 2000), comparable with the time course of synaptic conductances. Axonal conduction can therefore have a
substantial impact on the operation of networks that are distributed across the brain (Ringo et al., 1994) and, therefore, on realworld performance.
Vertebrate axons can respond to selection pressure for speed
with two adaptations that increase conduction velocity: myelination and increased diameter (Ritchie, 1995). However, these ad-aptations are accompanied by significant volume and construction costs. Myelination requires considerable amounts of protein

butions in developing and adult cortex have attracted
increasing attention as influences on areal size and regionalization (Donoghue and Rakic, 1999; O'Leary and Nakagawa,
2002; Job and Tan, 2003). Of particular interest with regard to
the uppermost layers, the monoclonal antibody 8B3, that
recognizes a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, is expressed in
a rostrocaudal gradient in monkey cortex. More specifically,
8B3 is concentrated in three bands, including a row of neurons
at the border of layers 1 and 2 (Pimenta et al., 2001).

terminal tufts at their tips (Fig. 3A, inset), whereas others had
smooth dendrites without any appendages.
For most CR cells with an atypical dendritic configuration the
axonal projection and density of synaptic boutons were similar to
those of typical CR cells with a maximal field span of 1.5â€“2 mm.
However, CR cells were found that, besides their projection
within layer 1, had descending axonal collaterals that were seen to
terminate in layer 2/3 (Figs. 4, 12 B). Furthermore, the axonal
plexus of such neurons was less dense than that of typical CR cells
(compare Figs. 4, 12C with 2, 12 B).

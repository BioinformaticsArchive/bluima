Briefly, first the MG, and then the TA muscle and its
associated nerve were isolated carefully with the
blood supply left intact. The muscles in the right
limb were tested, unless there was a technical problem; in these cases, the muscles of the left limb were
tested. The hindlimb was stabilized by a combination
of bone pins, bars, and clamps such that each muscle
was fixed rigidly and tested in a horizontal position.
A reservoir for a mineral oil pool was formed by
retraction of the skin and superficial fascia. During
testing, the pool was maintained between 36 and
38°C by a radiant heat lamp and was monitored with
a digital thermocouple inserted in an adjacent
muscle. The final preparatory step involved securing
a stiff wire around each of the tendons at the musculotendinous junction. This wire has virtually no
compliance within the force ranges observed in
these experiments.
As previously described,29,32,33 a modification of
a pneumatic isotonic lever was used to measure all
isometric and isotonic contractile properties. The
distal tendon of the MG or TA was attached in situ by
a wire (see above) to a lightweight magnesium lever
arm on which force and displacement gauges were
mounted. Initially, the muscle length at which the
maximum isometric twitch force could be elicited
(Lo) was determined. For isotonic testing, a variable
air pressure system in series with the lever arm was
used to vary the muscle load. All contractile events
were recorded simultaneously on a polygraph (Grass
Instruments model 79D) and an FM tape recorder
(Vetter model D instrumentation recorder) at a
speed of 3.5 in./s and monitored on a storage oscilloscope. Contractions were induced by stimulation
of the severed nerve trunk through bipolar silver
electrodes with a square-wave pulse of 20-μs duration. Stimulus strength was supramaximal, i.e., set at
2–3 times the minimal voltage (usually 0.5–1.0 V)
required to produce a maximum twitch tension (Pt)
at Lo. Average time to peak tension (TPT), halfrelaxation time (HRT), and Pt were determined
from 10 consecutive isometric twitch responses.
Peak isometric tension development was measured
at stimulation frequencies of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40,
50, 75, 100, and 200 Hz for a duration that resulted
in a plateau in the force curve, i.e., between 300 and
500 ms. Each tetanic stimulation was followed by 2
min of active recovery (stimulated at 0.5 Hz). The
highest tension, regardless of stimulation frequency,
was considered to be the peak isometric tetanic tension (Po). Isotonic properties were obtained at Lo
for 15–20 afterloaded contractions at various loads
less than 30% of Po. Each stimulation was a 330-ms

Human experiments
We recorded 13 connections in layers 2/3 in slices derived from human
association cortices in which the presynaptic neurons were neurogliaform
cells. Like the neurogliaform cells identified previously (Simon et al.,
2005; Tamas et al., 2003), all neurogliaform cells showed similar
anatomical features (Figures 1Bc and 2A). Their somata were relatively
small and mostly spherical. Multiple dendrites radiated from all parts of
the soma and were arranged to a relatively small dendritic field. Small
boutons frequently occurred along thin axonal collaterals, forming a
dense meshwork within the compact axonal field.
In general, firing parameters of human neurogliaform cells were similar to what was described previously in the rat. Neurogliaform cells in
the human sample responded to long (800 ms) suprathreshold current
injections with late spiking firing pattern or with an accelerating train of
spikes when activated from resting membrane potential (-62.4 ± 4.7 mV,
Figures 1Aa, 1Ba, and 2Ba). This firing behavior was changed to a decelerating pattern when applying larger current pulses. The time constant
and the input resistances of human neurogliaform cells were 8.7 ± 1.5 ms
and 219.1 ± 55.1 M , respectively. Human neurogliaform cells showed a
characteristic sag in response to hyperpolarizing current injections, which
was not typical of neurogliaform cells in rat cerebral cortex (Figures 1Aa,
1Ba, and 2Ba). Postsynaptic cells were pyramidal cells (n = 4) and various
interneurons (n = 7) in the human sample. We identified these cells based
on firing characteristics and dendritic and axonal morphology. All four postsynaptic pyramidal cells showed regular spiking firing pattern, their input
resistances and membrane time constants were 150.5 ± 42.1 M and
11.9 ± 1.5 ms, respectively. Electrophysiological properties of postsynaptic interneurons were variable; input resistances and time constants were
255.3 ± 88.2 M and 13.3 ± 6.9 ms, respectively (Figures 1Aa, 1Ba,
and 2Ba). Five out of seven postsynaptic human interneurons responded
with a sag to hyperpolarizing current injections and, in two cells showed
rebound spikes following the hyperpolarization (Figure 2Ba). The sag
and rebound spiking was apparent in postsynaptic human interneurons
exhibiting various firing behavior (i.e., fast spiking and accommodating)
in response to depolarizing current injections.
Human neurogliaform cells evoked long-lasting inhibition in postsynaptic cells (Figures 1Ab, 1Bb, and 2Bb). The rise times and half-width
of IPSPs in these connections were 16.5 ± 8.5 and 184.9 ± 96.5 ms,
respectively. When comparing IPSPs arriving to postsynaptic pyramidal cells (not shown) and interneurons in the human sample, we could
not detect significant differences in 10–90% rise times and half-widths
(20.1 ± 9.8 ms and 12.7 ± 6.8; 230.4 ± 64.6 ms and 148.6 ± 108.4,
respectively). For comparison, 10–90% rise times and half-width of IPSPs
evoked by neurogliaform cells in rat pyramidal cells were 23.4 ± 9.8 ms
and 183.9 ± 82.5 (Tamas et al., 2003). The maximal amplitudes of IPSPs
evoked by human neurogliaform cells were 0.94 ± 0.88 mV.
We applied pharmacological blockers to dissect the contribution of
the two GABA receptor subtypes to the inhibition evoked by human
neurogliaform cells. Addition of the GABAB receptor blocker CGP35348
(60 M) into the bath solution could shorten the duration of slow IPSPs
evoked by neurogliaform cells (n = 2; postsynaptic cells were interneurons, Figure 1Bb). When testing the connections by applying the GABAA
receptor blocker gabazine (10 M), we could isolate the slow component
of the IPSPs (n = 2; postsynaptic cells were interneurons, Figure 1Ab).
In addition to chemical neurotransmission elicited by human neurogliaform cells, we detected homologous electrical connections from
neurogliaform cells to other neurogliaform cells (n = 2, not shown) and
a heterologous electrical connection between a neurogliaform cell and
a different type of interneuron which was combined with a slow IPSP
triggered by the neurogliaform cell (Figure 2). Electrical synapses were
detected as spikelets in the postsynaptic cells in response to presynaptic action potentials (Figure 2Bb). When injecting hyperpolarizing current

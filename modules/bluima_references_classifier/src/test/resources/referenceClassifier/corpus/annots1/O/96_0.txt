DISCUSSION
We created an OWL ontology representing the subcellular anatomy of the
nervous system to provide the necessary scaffold for integrating molecular
and anatomical data through accurate description of mesoscale anatomy.
By codifying it in OWL, we have enabled algorithmic query and analysis of that knowledge. Moreover, we have enabled the use of formalized
knowledge as a standard for making connections between data formats,
making connections between other ontologies, and as a data exchange
format for image annotation tools. This scaffold is amenable both to tool
development and to semantically driven information exchange across the
field. It also provides individual researchers a means to perform reasonerbased quality control and inferential analysis of annotated neuroimages.
Applying formal semantic representation techniques to neuroanatomical
structure has been preliminarily addressed in the macroscopic domain
(Martin et al., 2001; Mechouche et al., 2006); little exists in the mesoscopic neuroanatomical domain as yet. A Synapse Ontology was recently
constructed (Zhang et al., 2007), but it does not situate synapses in their
cellular and tissue contexts, nor is it built on top of community-shared foundational ontologies. Our motivation for creating the SAO was to provide the
necessary tools for describing the types of subcellular and supracellular
entities located in the dimensional range now termed the mesoscale. The
SAO is designed as a reference ontology, defined by Brinkley et al. (2006)
in the following way: “Unlike application ontologies, reference ontologies are not designed for any specific application, but are intended to be
re-used in multiple application contexts [. . .] Reference ontologies are
designed according to strict ontological principles, whereas application
ontologies are designed according to the viewpoint of an end-user in a
particular domain.” We elected to tackle the more difficult task of creating a reference ontology with formal semantics, because we believe
that such resources are needed to build models of mesoscale structures
that combine information from multiple domains and to be able to utilize information obtained at the mesoscale at coarser and finer scales
of granularity. Through application of the ontology, researchers can work
in a narrow dimensional range, but their observations are immediately
linked across scales. For example, a researcher segmenting a reconstruction derived from electron tomography may make the observation
that an endoplasmic reticulum of a dendritic spine from a Purkinje cells
expresses the IP3 receptor. Through the SAO, the following inferences
can be made: There exists a Purkinje cell dendrite that expresses the IP3
receptor; the cell class Purkinje cell expresses the IP3 receptor; the cerebellar cortex expresses the IP3 receptor; and the cerebellum expresses
the IP3 receptor.
The SAO is meant to describe structure, not function nor dynamic processes, following the parcellation of biomedical reality established by the
BFO. However, although we try to adhere as much as possible to this distinction within the formal class structure of the ontology, as can be seen
by the labels assigned to SAO classes, many labels that are applied to
our SAO entities have a functional flavor to them, for example, “chemical
synapse”. Where possible, we tried to remove entities that mixed a structure with a function, for example, myelinating oligodendrocyte or with a
physiological state, for example, activated microglia. However, we also felt
in some cases that it was important to assign the labels that are commonly
employed by the community. Although these labels appear in the figures
and text provided in this paper, SAO classes are actually identified using
semantically neutral numeric labels (e.g., SAO class sao1507566336 has

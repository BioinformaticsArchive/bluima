Immunohistochemistry
Sections from the supratemporal region and the superior temporal
gyrus were processed for PV, CB and CR immunohistochemistry.
Tissue sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 0.05 M,
pH 7.4) and then treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
10 min in order to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. They were
then washed twice for 10 min in TBS and permeabilized for 10 min in
TBS containing 1% Triton X-100. After washing, the sections were
preincubated for 1 h in TBS containing 0.5% casein and 0.05% sodium
azide. The sections were then incubated at 4 Â°C in 0.25% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in TBS containing antibody against CaBPs (PV28,

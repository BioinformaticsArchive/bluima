Figure 5. The C a 2 dependence of the enhancing effect of -SNAP. For
[C a 2 ]i up to 500 nM, [C a 2 ]i was controlled via whole-cell dialysis of
C a 2 -buffered solution, and the rate of exocytosis (events per second)
was measured as described in Figures 2 B and 3. For higher [C a 2 ]i , flash
photolysis of caged-C a 2 (similar to Fig. 4) was used. Data from control
cells ( filled symbols) were fitted to and sigmoidal f unction was centered at
pC a 6.51, which corresponds to a Kd of 1.3 M [C a 2 ]i and a Hill
coefficient of 3.5. Data from cells dialyzed with 500 nM -SNAP (open
symbols) were fitted to the sum of two sigmoidal f unctions, one identical
to that for the control data, the other centered at pC a 7.25, which
corresponds to a Kd of 80 nM [C a 2 ]i and a Hill coefficient of 6.5.

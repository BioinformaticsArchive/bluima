Rapid Signaling between TL5 Neurons
Most synapses are at an electrotonic distance of <0.1 from the
soma (average, 0.13; Markram et al., 1997a) and the latency from
the time of a presynaptic AP to the excitatory postsynaptic
potential (EPSP) onset in the soma is therefore brief (average of
1.7 ms). The risetimes of EPSPs are typically <2 ms, also
consistent with a large A MPA component of the EPSP.
Simulations of fully reconstructed synaptically coupled neurons
and iterations to fit experimentally observed response
properties (Markram et al., 1997a) suggest that each synaptic
contact is composed of 60–100 AMPA and 2–6 NMDA receptors
(A. Roth and H. Markram, unpublished data).

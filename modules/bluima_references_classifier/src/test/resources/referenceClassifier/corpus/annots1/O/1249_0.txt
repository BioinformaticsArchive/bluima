synchrony [67]. GABABR responses are of the appropriate
duration ($300 ms) to promote 3 Hz spike-wave discharge,
although the frequency of this epileptic response can be
higher in rodents (4â€“10 Hz) than in humans. A computational study [68] has suggested that at least some of
the species-dependence of spike-wave frequency might
be explained by differential activation of GABAA versus
GABAB receptors in relay neurons.

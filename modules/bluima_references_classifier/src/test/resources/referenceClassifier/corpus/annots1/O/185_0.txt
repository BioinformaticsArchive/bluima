To sum up, two major types of thalamic neurons, RE
and TC, behave differently during cortically generated SW/
PSW seizures. RE neurons are excited by each corticofugal drive during SW/PSW complexes (Steriade and Contreras, 1995; Slaght et al., 2002) and, then, these GABAergic thalamic neurons participate actively during cortically
generated SW seizures. This conclusion is also drawn
from the increase in the ionic current that underlies spikebursts of RE cells in SW seizures (Tsakiridou et al., 1995;
Avanzini et al., 1999) and the fact that the Cd2 -induced
blockage of RE-cells' spike-bursts leads to a decrease in
the ipsilateral SW activity (Avanzini et al., 1992). On the
contrary, the opposite occurs in TC cells that are inhibited
during cortically generated SW/PSW seizures (Fig. 11).
The inhibition of thalamic relay cells may explain the un-consciousness during absence seizures, due to the blockage of signals from the external world in their route to the
cerebral cortex.

Layer I of the neocortex is relatively cell-sparse and contains
mostly nonpyramidal neurons (Prieto et al., 1994). This low density and the location immediately beneath the pial surface has
hampered detailed studies of the cellular elements in layer I. In
particular, there have been only few studies of layer I neurons
using intracellular recordings (Martin et al., 1989; Zhou and
Hablitz, 1996).
Ramon y Cajal (1911) described a horizontal cell type, later
named the Cajal–Retzius (CR) cell, and several types of “shortaxon” cells in layer I. The CR cells are observed only rarely in
adult tissue (but see Cond ́e et al., 1994), whereas the short-axon
cells of layer I are maintained in adult cortex. The majority of
layer I cells (90 –95%) stain for glutamate decarboxylase or
GABA and therefore may be GABAergic (Gabbott and Somogyi,
1986; Winer and Larue, 1989; Li and Schwark, 1994; Prieto et al.,
1994). Moreover, most of the cells in layer I have smooth dendrites or only a few spines, suggesting that these may be similar to
interneurons or nonpyramidal cells in layers II–VI. Most of the
information reported has been obtained using Golgi techniques,
some of which may not reveal fine axonal projections. We used
patch-clamp techniques (Edwards et al., 1989) to record from
visually identified layer I neurons and obtained physiological and
morphological characterization of these cells.

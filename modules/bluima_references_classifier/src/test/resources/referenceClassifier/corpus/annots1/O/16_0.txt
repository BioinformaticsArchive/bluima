where K and [B] are the affinity and the total concentration of buffer,

whereas [Ca 2 ] and [Ca 2 ] are basal [Ca 2 ] and [Ca 2 ] increments,

respectively. In contrast, NMDAR-mediated [Ca 2 ] signals are more
complicated to interpret because NMDAR activation is long ( 100 ms),
so that Ca 2 influx and extrusion overlap in time. Therefore, AP- and
depolarization-evoked Ca 2 influx is optimal for quantitatively studying

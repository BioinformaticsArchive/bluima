Threshold initiation of recurrent activity in small
clusters of layer 4 neurons
The above data suggest that short trains of TC EPSPs trigger a
small number of excitatory neurons in layer 4 to fire action
potentials that then recruit recurrent activity. We estimated the
number and spatial extent of active neurons necessary to generate
recurrent activity by optically measuring activity patterns just
below and above threshold (Fig. 5A). Stimulus parameters were
carefully adjusted so that a stimulus train at a given frequency
and a given number of pulses would evoke recurrent activity but
would fail when the number of pulses was decreased by one. For
stimulus trains just below threshold, activity in only a small
number (3â€“10) of neurons was detected. Active neurons were
typically localized in layer 4 within areas 50% the size of a
barrel. Whole-cell recordings revealed that action potentials in
these neurons were generated by temporal summation of TC
EPSPs (data not shown), with little contribution of long-latency
polysynaptic activity.
Stimulus trains just above threshold initiated activity within a
cluster of neurons as under subthreshold conditions but then
reliably evoked more widespread recurrent activity. These observations suggest that only a small number of neurons, activated by
temporally summating TC EPSPs, are sufficient to trigger recurrent activity.

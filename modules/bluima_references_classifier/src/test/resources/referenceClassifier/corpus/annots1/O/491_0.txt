Introduction
The appearance of the neocortex, along with its expansion and differentiation in mammals represents one of
the fundamental events in the evolution of the vertebrate brain. This brain region is where faculties such
as speech and thought are localized, those which distinguish humans from other mammals. Thus, understanding its structure and function is one of the prime
aims in neuroscience. In general, the neocortex of all
species contains a set of elements similar to that of
any other part of the brain. That is, two major types
of neurons (projection cells and interneurons), glia (as-trocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia), nerve fibers
(extrinsic and intrinsic) and blood vessels. Furthermore, the physiological properties, neurotransmitters
and neuroactive peptides, receptors and ion channels,
and other compounds generally expressed by cortical
neurons are not unique to the neocortex, but are found
throughout the brain. Thus, one of the fundamental
questions in neuroscience is, what neural substrates
make a human being human? In other words, what is

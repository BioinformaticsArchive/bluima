Simulation of growth cone guidance by a discrete repulsive
cue
As defined by Eq's. (1) and (2), growth cone migration is
modeled as having explicit deterministic and stochastic
components. It is important to emphasize that these two
components make fundamentally different contributions
to growth cone migration. Migration originating from
deterministic motion is simply proportional to elapsed
time, T: its integrated value is 0 in the x-direction and
âˆ†y *T in the y-direction. By contrast, migration driven

rains fewer than s Steiner points and so can be constructed by the inductive
procedure.
If B is a Steiner point, its location is not known. Nevertheless, the construction of Fig. 2 can proceed part way. B' can have only two locations
(on opposite sides of the line AiA). It may be necessary to try both possibilities although other properties, such as 3.5, can often rule out the wrong
choice. If a relatively minimal tree T exists, it can be constructed as follows.
First solve a simpler problem iu which vertices At, A.. and S are removed
and B' is added as one of the Ak. Connections to points other than S are
the same as before; in addition, a line B'B is required. The new minimal
tree has the same length as the old one because B'B AiSI + AS]
BS I. When the new tree is found, B'B may be replaced by A iS, A.S
and BS to get the desired tree.
One cannot always immediately rule out the wrong one of the two choices
for B'. For a given B t, the computation may then place B outside the
"nondegenerate" region of Fig. 2, or it may conclude that the relatively
minimal tree for the new topology (with B' replacing S, A i, A.) does not
exist. One must then try the other choice of B'. If both choices fail, the given
topology had no relatively minimal tree.
The inductive procedure replaces the problem with s Steiner points by
one with s l. This in turn is replaced by an s 2 point problem, etc.

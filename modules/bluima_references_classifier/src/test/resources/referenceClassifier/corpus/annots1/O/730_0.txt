Figure 1. Outlines of TC projection columns. (A) Fluorescence image of a semi-coronal slice of barrel cortex showing thalamic VPM axons visualized by viral-mediated
fluorescence (mOrange). Barrels A-E in layer 4 can be delineated as spots of high VPM axon density. (B) GAD67 immunofluorescence image of the slice shown in (A). The GAD67
immunofluorescence showed hot spots in layer 4 whose outlines match the patches of TC projection. (C) GAD67 fluorescence image of a tangential slice of L4 of barrel cortex.
Arcs 2-4 of rows B-D are shown. Barrels can be delineated as hot spots of GAD67 immunofluorescence. The white box (dashed rectangle) illustrates the region of interest that
was selected for imaging the C2 barrel column (dashed barrel outline) through the entire depth of the cortex using confocal scanning microscopy. The D2 and D3 barrel columns
were also imaged. (D) NeuN immunofluorescence image (single optical slice) from a confocal scan of a tangential slice (thickness: 50 lm) of the region of interest outlined in (C).
Dashed line: barrel outline of the C2 barrel. The inset illustrates that NeuN immunolabeling predominantly stains the nucleus. However, it also outlines the cytosol (arrows);
sometimes, even parts of dendrites can be followed (asterisk), as reported before (Mullen et al. 1992).

may help G42 FS cells control their intracellular calcium concentration in the face of dramatic increases in firing rates over development that presumably increase calcium entry through voltagegated channels. Regulatory patterns of other genes involved in
calcium homeostasis lend additional support to this hypothesis.
For instance, the calcium-buffering molecule parvalbumin is up-regulated nearly 30-fold between P10 and P40. Additionally, the
Ca 2 -ATPase, encoded by the Atp2b3 gene, which extrudes calcium ions from the cell, is upregulated fourfold between P7 and
P25. In addition to influencing cell excitability, calcium plays a
critical role as a signaling molecule whose downstream effects
mediate a host of cellular processes, including cell differentiation
and synaptic plasticity, often by inducing transcriptional modifications (Moody and Bosma, 2005; Flavell and Greenberg, 2008).
Thus, mechanisms that promote calcium entry early in development may be necessary for cell differentiation and may be distinct
from calcium sources required for the subsequent maintenance
of mature cell identity.
Changes in the abundance of transcripts for ion channels and
other genes likely reflect changing patterns of transcriptional regulation. It is known that PV-expressing FS cells derive from

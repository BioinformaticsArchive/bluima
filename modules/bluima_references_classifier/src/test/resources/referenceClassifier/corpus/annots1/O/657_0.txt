Figure 8. Cell type-specific spiking of individual neurons during different behavioral states. (A) Left panel: Vertical locations of all reconstructed somata. Center panel:
spontaneous spiking in the anesthetized state. Right panel: evoked spiking (i.e., difference to spontaneous activity), 0-50 ms after passive touch. (B) Left panel: Vertical locations
of somata (closed circles mark anatomically identified cells; open circles mark cells assigned by depth and spontaneous spiking). Center panel: Spontaneous spiking activity in
awake state. Right panel: Spiking activity during free whisking.

Discussion

The major findings of this study are two-fold. First, in general
agreement with a previous study (Owens et al., 1999), GABAactivated whole-cell current responses in Cajal–Retzius cell are
mediated exclusively by GABAA receptors. Second, by combining
pharmacological analysis and single-cell expression profiling of genes
encoding GABAA receptor c subunits, Cajal–Retzius cells express
c-less GABAA receptors at an embryonic stage of cortical development
but switch to expressing c-containing GABAA receptors postnatally.
Consistent with the notion that GABAA receptor subunit expression
is developmentally regulated (Laurie et al., 1992), this study
uncovered a developmental switch involving the GABAA receptor c
subunit in Cajal–Retzius cells during corticogenesis. Embryonic
Cajal–Retzius cells lacked expression of the c subunit transcript; their
responses to GABA were insensitive to positive modulation by
diazepam and inhibited by Zn2. This was apparently unique to
embryonic Cajal–Retzius cells, as all non-Cajal–Retzius cells examined at the same embryonic age, as well as those examined at P5,
expressed at least one of the c subunit transcripts, and their responses
to GABA were robustly potentiated by diazepam and insensitive to
Zn2+. It should be noted that our observations do not preclude the
possibility that Cajal–Retzius cells examined postnatally may express
mixed c-less and c-containing GABAA receptor isoforms.
E14.5 and P5 neocortex express multiple GABAA receptor subunits
that partially overlap (E14.5: a1, a2, a3, b1, b3, c1 and c2; P5: a1,
a2, a4, a5, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2 and c3; data not shown). Given that
GABAA receptor function is subunit-dependent, different subunit
expression patterns may well account for the reciprocal modulatory
outcomes observed in this study with diazepam and Zn2+ on
embryonic vis-a`-vis postnatal Cajal–Retzius cells. As expression
profiling of GABAA receptor subunits in neocortical tissue necessarily
reflects mRNA expressed in multiple cell types, we resorted to
profiling the expression of c subunit transcripts in individual
electrophysiologically examined Cajal–Retzius cells. We found that
the pharmacological profile of diazepam and Zn2+ sensitivity is tightly
correlated with c subunit expression, a relationship established in
studies using recombinant GABAA receptors but rarely demonstrated
in situ (Hosie et al., 2003).
The significance of a switch from c-less to c-containing GABAA
receptors in Cajal–Retzius cells during neocortical development awaits
elucidation. A parsimonious explanation may be that this merely
reflects the maturation of GABAA receptor expression in Cajal–

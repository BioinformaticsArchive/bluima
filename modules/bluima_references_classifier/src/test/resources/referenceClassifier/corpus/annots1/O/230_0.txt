the durations of the right and left soleus bursts nor the amplitude
of the left soleus burst. Furthermore, conditioning did not appear
to affect step-cycle duration or right/left symmetry. Because
treadmill speed for each rat was the same before and after conditioning, these results also indicate that conditioning did not affect
step-cycle length.
In the two unsuccessful HRdown rats that showed large in-creases in their stance H-reflexes (Fig. 5), right soleus burst am-plitudes did not change (i.e., 103 and 104% of control after conditioning, respectively).

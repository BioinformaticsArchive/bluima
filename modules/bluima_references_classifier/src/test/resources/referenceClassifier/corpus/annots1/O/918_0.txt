In this investigation, we first report the characterization of developmental changes of CR and non-CR cells during the postnatal
period. We then report analysis of whole-cell recordings of CR
and non-CR cells, indicating that synaptic inputs to CR cells and
non-CR cells are clearly segregated into GABAergic alone and
GABAergic plus glutamatergic, respectively. Furthermore, CR
cells and non-CR cells show synchronized, repetitive barrages of
sPSCs that reflect a network-driven activity in the developing
cortex. These findings demonstrate that the layer 1 neurons serve
as an integral part of an early cortical network.

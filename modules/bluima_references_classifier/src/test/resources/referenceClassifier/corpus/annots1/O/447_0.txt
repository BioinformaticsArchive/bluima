degree of overexpression is also less (Fig. 4b). To determine whether
overexpression of RS/DJ-1 mRNA results in increased protein, protein levels of NSCLC tumors and normal adjacent lung tissue were
examined by Western blot using anti-RS/DJ-1 antibody (Fig. 4c). The
three cases examined with overexpressed mRNA showed higher RS/
DJ-1 protein levels in tumors as compared with normal tissue.
Functional Proteomic Analysis of RS/DJ-1 and RhoGDI in
Apoptosis. RS/DJ-1 was first identified as a novel oncogene that
weakly transforms NIH3T3 cells when applied alone and dramatically
enhances transformation in cooperation with Ras. These results im- plicated its role in cellular proliferation (21). Additional studies demonstrate that RS/DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of RNA-protein
interactions (18). From our proteomic studies, if decreased RS/DJ-1 is
indeed involved in enhanced drug-induced apoptosis, then introduction of RS/DJ-1 should reverse this apoptotic process. To directly
address this issue, a RS/DJ-1 expression plasmid was transiently
transfected into H157 cells, and the effect of RS/DJ-1 on apoptosis

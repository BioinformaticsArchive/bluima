Figure 6. Analysis of the results of the Hodgkin-Huxley network model. (A) Ratio between the excitatory (A1) and the inhibitory (A2) current through the recurrent synapses and
the current through afferent synapses of excitatory model cells (blue contour lines). Currents were calculated for stimuli at the cells' preferred orientations and averaged over all
model cells within orientation domains (0.6 \ map OSI \ 0.9). Contour lines are drawn on top of the posterior plot of Figure 5. (B) Ratio of the slopes of the regression line for
the OSI-OSI relationship of the total excitatory (ge) versus the total inhibitory (gi) conductance (blue contour lines). Contour lines are drawn on top of the posterior plot of Figure 5.
(C) Product of the normalized Bayesian posteriors of the average tuning for Vm, f, ge, and gi (cf. Methods) evaluated only for cells close to pinwheel centers (map OSI \ 0.3) and
only for cells in orientation domains (0.6 \ map OSI \ 0.9). Blue lines outline the area where the posterior for pinwheel center cells and orientation domain cells is above 0.5.
Contour lines are drawn on top of the posterior plot of Figure 5.

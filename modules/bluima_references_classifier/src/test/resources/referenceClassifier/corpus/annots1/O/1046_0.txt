column: current traces elicited in CA3 pyramidal
e . cells with command potentials of +30 mV. Pulse
6 9 protocol is illustrated in the inset. Subtraction cur-T rents are shown under original current recordings.
Calibrations in C apply to all recordings in A-C.
Right column : current-voltage relationships of averaged and normalized late currents in CA3 pyramidal
cells (measured at the end of the test pulse). A:
effects of 300 PM Cd2+. B : effects of 10 PM La3+.
I C: effects of Ca2+ -free solution. Open circles represent control medium, and closed circles represent
30 50 Cd2+- or La3+ -containing or Ca 2+-free medium.

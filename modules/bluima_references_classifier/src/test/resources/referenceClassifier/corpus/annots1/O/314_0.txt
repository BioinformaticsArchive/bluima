stimulus threshold for electrodes with tips in the ventral horn
was 30.6 9.0 A on the day of surgery. ISMS thresholds
for activating muscles rose in the days after implantation,
typically reaching about twice their original values [9]. This is
probably due to progressive encapsulation of the electrodes by
connective tissue. By delivering trains of amplitude modulated
stimuli (e.g., ramp up—hold—ramp down) through individual
electrodes, smooth and graded force recruitment was achieved
and powerful extensor movements capable of lifting the an-imals' hindquarters were produced. Stimulating through the
remaining 10% of the ventrally located electrodes generated
cocontraction of mutually antagonistic muscles resulting in the
stiffening of one or more joints [9].
Electrodes implanted in the dorsal and intermediate locations
(laminas I–VI and parts of lamina VII) only produced ipsilateral limb flexion. No extensor, weight-bearing movements were
evoked by stimulating these locations. A few locations produced
rhythmic paw shakes and flexor withdrawal movements. The
animals consistently reacted by licking the dorsum of their foot
following the paw shake and withdrawal movements. Finally,
the responses generated by stimulating through some electrodes
outlasted the duration of the stimulus. Our results showed no ev-idence that tonic microstimulation through individual electrodes
implanted in nonsensory areas in the cord generates rhythmic
movements as one might expect from activation of a central pattern generator mechanism [see Section IV].
Based on these findings, we targeted ventral horn locations
for generating the locomotor-like stepping and goal directed
movements described in the remainder of this paper. Fig. 3 de-picts the distribution of the electrode tips along the extent of
the lumbosacral enlargement from the three cats used in these
acute experiments. Electrode tips were primarily placed in the
ventral horn in the region of Rexed lamina IX. In general, electrodes implanted in the rostral half of the lumbar enlargement
generated hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion,
and those implanted in the caudal half generated hip extension, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion. The mean SEM
threshold and maximal pulse amplitudes across all electrodes
were 33.0 5.6 and 186.5 14.6 A, respectively.
The question arises whether the species of interneurons
and motoneurons activated by ISMS were the same in the
anesthetized and awake states or significantly different. The main
difficulty in answering this question is that a direct comparison of
muscle activation thresholds in the anesthetized and awake states
is misleading. For, although the threshold currents obtained on
the day of surgery in the chronic experiments were the same as in
the acute experiments, the thresholds rose in subsequent days in
the chronic implants. This does not mean that interneurons and
motoneurons became less excitable in the chronic experiments.
In fact, the opposite is more likely: inactive interneurons were
probably partly depolarized and closer to their firing threshold
in the awake animals. The question can instead be approached
indirectly by systematically comparing latencies of responses
in the different states. We have attempted this in a separate
study, which will be reported elsewhere [30].

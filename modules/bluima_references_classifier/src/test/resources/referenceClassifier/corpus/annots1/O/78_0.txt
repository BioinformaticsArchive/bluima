In contrast, we detected in the PSD fraction a paucity of
scaffold proteins associated with AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Neither SAP97 (a PSD-95 family protein that binds GluR1
(43) nor GRIP/ABP (multi-PDZ proteins that binds directly to
GluR2/3) (44, 45) were detected by the LC-MS/MS analysis. A
small number of peptides were identified corresponding to the
liprin- family of scaffold proteins that are implicated in AMPA
receptor trafficking (46) and synapse development (47, 48). It is
possible that AMPA receptor-associated proteins are easily
extracted from the PSD by detergents, or alternatively, their
interaction with AMPA receptors is more involved in trafficking rather than postsynaptic anchoring (49, 50).
GTPases and Regulators—The MS analysis of the PSD found
a striking diversity of proteins involved in small GTPase signaling. The monomeric GTPases identified included members
of the Ras family (K-ras, Rap-1a, Ral-a, Ras-related c3 Botulinum toxin substrate homolog), Rho family (Rac2, Rho-G), and
PIKE-L (a protein containing a Ras-like GTPase domain)
(Table S1). The small G-proteins were generally identified
based on a single peptide hit, suggesting they are not abundant
components of the PSD. However, this is perhaps not surprising given that small GTPases are generally recruited to specialized membrane microdomains (such as synapses) upon ac-tivation. Previously, by an immunoblot screen, H-Ras, RalA,
Rac1, and Rap2 were detected in the NMDA receptor complex
(17).
More abundantly represented in the PSD than the small
GTPases themselves were the guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that
regulate the activity of small G-proteins. Particularly prominent was SynGAP, a PSD-95-associated RasGAP that was
identified in earlier studies (17, 51, 52). We also identified a
known PSD-enriched RapGAP (SPAR) (53), two ArfGAPa
(GIT1, PIKE-L) (54 –56), and a RacGEF known to regulate
spine morphogenesis (Kalirin) (57). In addition, we detected
two putative RhoGAPs (KIAA0097 and KIAA1688), two RhoGEF (clone:6230420N16 and zizimin1), a novel putative RapGAP (KIAA0440), a cAMP-regulated RapGEF (cAMP-GEFII),
two putative ArfGEFs (KIAA0522 and KIAA0763), and a GAP
for Rab3 (KIAA0856), which were previously not known to be
present in the PSD. Despite the relative abundance of RasGAPs, we did not pick up any known RasGEFs in our MS
screen. In addition to the small GTPases, heterotrimeric G-proteins were found in the PSD, with the Go -subunit being
particularly abundant (Table S1).
Kinases/Phosphatases and Regulators—CaMKII is well
known to be highly enriched in the PSD, and the - and -isoforms were abundantly identified (Table S1), in agreement
with previous MS studies of the PSD and NMDA receptor
complex (14, 17). We also detected CaMKII - and -subunits.
Protein kinase C (PKC)- is another abundant kinase identified in the PSD, consistent with the brain-specific expression of
this subtype (58). However, there were notable absences from
our list of identified kinases in the PSD. We did not find the
MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2, or any tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src,
PYK2), although they had been detected in the NMDA receptor
complex by immunoblotting (17). Protein kinase A was also not
identified, although we detected its anchoring protein
AKAP150 repetitively (by 4 peptides). Given the lack of detectable MAP kinases, it was notable to find peptides corresponding to MINK-2 and TNIK in the PSD. These kinases belong to
the Ste20 family of Ser/Thr kinases that typically function in
MAP kinase cascades. In addition to protein kinases, several
protein phosphatases were found in the PSD: PP1- , PP1- ,
r-PTP- , and the receptor-linked form P1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Calcineurin/PP2B was not detected in the PSD by MS.

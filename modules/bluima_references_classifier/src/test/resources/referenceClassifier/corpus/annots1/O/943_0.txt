cantly elevated in aged animals throughout the train and analysis of AUC of the
Ca 2 response during RSS also revealed a
significant increase above the 4 month
group, beginning at 12 months of age
(F(4,48) 3.64; p 0.05) (Fig. 3C). Time
constants for the rising (Fig. 3D) and de-caying (Fig. 3E) phases of somatic [Ca 2 ]i
at the beginning and the end of RSS, re-spectively, as determined by single exponential fit parameters, did not differ significantly with age.

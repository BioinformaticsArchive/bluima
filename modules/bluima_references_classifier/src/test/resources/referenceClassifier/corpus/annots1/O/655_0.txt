Construction and expression of recombinant proteins
Reverse transcription-PCR was used to generate the full-length PP2c
(GenBank accession number J04503). PCR-based methods were used to
generate all of the constructs used in this study. All constructs were
verified by sequencing. To generate recombinant proteins, cDNA constructs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins or
pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for polyhistidine-tagged (6 His)
proteins. GST-fusion proteins and 6 His proteins were produced in
Escherichia coli. Glutathione agarose beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were
used to purify GST-fused proteins. Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen) were used
for purification of 6 His proteins. To express the recombinant proteins
in mammalian cells, cDNA constructs were subcloned into the following
vectors: pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), HA-tagged pcDNA3,
FLAG-tagged pcDNA3, or pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The
calcium phosphate method was used for transfection in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells or hippocampal neurons.

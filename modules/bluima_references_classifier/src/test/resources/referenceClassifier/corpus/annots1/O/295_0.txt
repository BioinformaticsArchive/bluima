Use of treadmill training to enhance recovery of walking
in animals with transected spinal cords implies some
use-dependent plasticity in spinal pathways involved in
locomotor generation. Few studies have demonstrated
functional plasticity of the spinal cord after changes in
the supraspinal or peripheral inputs. One such study
involved superimposed spinal cord transection in cats
that had undergone previous unilateral neurectomy of
the ankle flexor nerves.75 Following spinal cord transection, the cats retained an asymmetric gait pattern with
the compensatory strategy of knee hyperflexion on the
neurectomized side. Another cat that underwent spinal
cord transection first and then neurectomy did not
exhibit this compensatory pattern. These findings intimate that plastic changes may have taken place in the
spinal circuitry to maintain locomotion following the
peripheral nerve lesion.

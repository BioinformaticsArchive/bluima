Figure 3. Customized atlas diagrams. Series of customized, color coded coronal (B, F), horizontal (C, G), and sagittal (D, H) atlas diagrams, generated using the
slicing and filling module in the atlas tool. Blue, red, and green bounding boxes in (A, E) indicate the levels from which the respective slices were obtained. (A–D)
Standard orientation of atlas slices, oriented perpendicularly to axes of the stereotaxic coordinate system. (E–H) Example of atlas slices cut at non-standard
angles, tilted 5 degrees from the planes used in (B–D). Black arrow heads indicate examples of structural differences between the corresponding diagram pairs,
emphasizing the importance of having atlas diagrams with similar orientation as experimental slices. hy, hypothalamus, whole region; ic, internal capsule; cc,

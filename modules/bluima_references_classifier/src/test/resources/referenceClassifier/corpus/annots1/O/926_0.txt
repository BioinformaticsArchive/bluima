been determined. The ion channel genes supporting
MC electrical properties are also not known. At the
biochemical level, the co-expression profiles for
neuropeptide and calcium binding protein genes are not
known.
In the present study, we employed whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings to acquire electrophysiological
properties, histochemical staining to obtain 3-D
anatomical reconstructions and morphometric analyses,
as well as aspiration of the cytoplasm to determine the
mRNA expression profile of neurones using multiplex
RT-PCR (Fig. 1). We report for the first time that
(a) MCs are found in all layers IIâ€“VI, (b) they all
display some common anatomical, electrophysiological
and biochemical properties, (c) they display distinct
layer-specific differences, and (d) infragranular MCs
also target layer IV in addition to layer I. We also report
for the first time, the ion channel genes expressed in
MCs.

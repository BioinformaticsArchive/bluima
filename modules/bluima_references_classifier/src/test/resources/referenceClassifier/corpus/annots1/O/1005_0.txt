to achieve a corrected cluster-level 0.05 (Forman et al., 1995). The
Monte Carlo simulation estimates the probability of generating a cluster
with 680 voxels based on randomly computed images with the same
dimensions, voxel probability threshold, and smoothness parameters as
MRI images inputted for analysis, which can be used as a threshold to
remove small clusters likely to be significant only by chance. Although
violation of nonstationarity is a concern for cluster correction of imaging
data, our use of a 4 mm full-width at half-maximum kernel does not
appreciably bias the true when using this permutational estimate of
cluster size (Hayasaka et al., 2004).
Motor performance testing. We used an automated monkey movement
assessment panel (mMAP) testing system (Gash et al., 1999) to test the
motor performance times of the animals retrieving small food items from
a receptacle chamber. A day's testing session consisted of 12 trials, with
equal trials between the right and left hand. The trial was initiated when
the tester placed a small food item (e.g., a piece of cereal) into the center
of the food receptacle. The trial was completed when the monkey re-moved the food from the receptacle and withdrew its hand back into the
home cage. There was a 30 s delay before the next trial was initiated. The
process was repeated until six trials had been completed with each hand.
Monkeys were given 45 s to retrieve food before the trial was aborted.
Three tests of increasing level of difficulty were evaluated for each
animal. The platform task (level I difficulty) required the removal of a
small food item from a level platform in the food receptacle. The straight
rod task (level II) involved maneuvering the food item up a straight rod.
The q-mark task (level III) required the animal to thread the food item
over a question mark-shaped rod in the receptacle. Each task was tested
for 10 d before progressing to the next level of difficulty. Mean manual
performance speed was computed for each session for the amount of
time it took a subject to initially move its hand into the outer testing
chamber [reaction time (RT)], the time spent in the outer chamber
(“coarse” movement), and the time spent removing the object from the
inner chamber and withdrawing the hand (“fine” movement). Motor
performance of a given animal for each task, was divided into an “acquisition” phase during which the animals learned the task and improved
their performance with each trial and a subsequent “proficiency”
phase during which the animals' performance reached an asymptote.
Task proficiency was determined by examining when a subjectspecific asymptote in performance occurred throughout the consecutive series of 12 trials per session; a scree test was used for this
determination (Cattell, 1966).
Behavioral and peripheral iron statistics. Multivariate repeated measures analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) were used as omnibus analyses to test RT, coarse, and fine motor performance for each of the tasks
(platform, rod, q-mark). ANCOVA was used for post hoc testing between
controls and CR monkeys. ANOVA tested differences in dietary iron
intake, peripheral serum iron, and hematology variables. To explore
whether CR-induced changes in central iron and motor performance
were related, one-tailed split-level correlations were conducted between
motor performance indices and regional R2 signal changes that were
statistically different between CR and control monkeys. Maximal values
of clusters generated from the diet group or age diet group analyses
were used as regressors to test for associations between regional iron
deposition and behavior. We predicted that controls would show slower
motor performance as central iron increased in these maximal cluster
values, whereas CR animals would not show this relationship. All behavioral analyses included age and sex as covariates. Alpha was set at 0.05.
Analyses were conducted using SPSS 16.0.

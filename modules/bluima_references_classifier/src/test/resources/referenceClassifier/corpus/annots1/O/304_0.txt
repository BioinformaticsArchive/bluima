neurons are grouped for each distance bin. The numbers in
parentheses indicate the number of Renshaw cells that
showed data at each distance bin. Too few dendrites/Renshaw
cells provided data beyond 200 m, and therefore these bins
were not analyzed further. A decrease in the number of
VGLUT1-IR contacts per 10 m of linear dendrite was apparent in most distance bins (except for the 50 –100 m), indicating that there are no major shifts in VGLUT1-IR bouton distributions at different distances from the cell soma. K, Similar
analyses for VAChT-IR boutons. In contrast to VGLUT1-IR boutons, VACHT-IR bouton density was either maintained or had a
tendency to increase at P20 and adult compared with P15.
Scale bars: A, B, 20 m; (in G) F–I, 50 m.

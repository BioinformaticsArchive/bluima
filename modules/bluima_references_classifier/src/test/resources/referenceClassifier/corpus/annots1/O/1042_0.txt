Neocortical layer VI modulates the thalamocortical transfer of
information and has a significant impact on sensory processing. This
function implicates local g-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic)
interneurons that have only been partly described at the present
time. Here, we characterized 85 layer VI GABAergic interneurons in
acute slices of mouse somatosensory barrel cortex, using wholecell current-clamp recordings, single-cell reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction, and biocytin labeling followed by
Neurolucida reconstructions. Unsupervised clustering based on
electrophysiological molecular and morphological properties disclosed 4 types of interneurons. The 2 major classes were fastspiking cells transcribing parvalbumin (PV) (51%) and adapting
interneurons transcribing somatostatin (SOM) (26%). The third
population (18%) transcribed neuropeptide Y (NPY) and appeared
very similar to neurogliaform cells. The last class (5%) was constituted by well-segregated GABAergic interneurons transcribing
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Using transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 67k
(GAD67) promoter, we investigated the densities of GABAergic
cells immunolabeled against PV, SOM, VIP, and NPY through the
depth of layer VI. This analysis revealed that PV and NPY translating
interneurons concentrate in the upper and lower parts of layer VI,
respectively. This study provides an extensive characterization of
the properties of layer VI interneurons.

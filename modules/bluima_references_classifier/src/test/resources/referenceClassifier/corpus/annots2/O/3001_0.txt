Animal mortality

We found that the mortality of ageing Fischer rats
was less than that of ageing Wistar rats. The precise
causes of death were not studied in detail, but we saw
no evidence that it was related to facial nerve section,
as operated and non-operated rats succumbed
equally. We mainly noted pituitary and skin tumours
in the culled rats. These rats were not included in the
study. It is likely, however, that many of the Fischer
344 rats actually used in the study may have suVered
from undetected testicular tumours and nephropathy, as these conditions are reportedly common in
this particular strain.8,69 Similar provisos may also
apply to the ageing Wistar rats used. Further studies,
possibly including calorically-restricted rats to prolong life and reduce pathology,69 are needed
to determine whether age-related deteriorations in
general health aVect motoneuronal number.

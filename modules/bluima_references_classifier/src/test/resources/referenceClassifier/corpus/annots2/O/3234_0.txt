Converging evidence indicates that mesocorticolimbic
DA function is also modulated by the ventral hippocampus
VH. w9,19,22,23,33,39,47x. Moreover, adult rats with
neonatal excitotoxic lesions to the VH display behavioural
changes that are believed to reflect increased DA transmission in NAcc. These include attenuated haloperidol-in-duced catalepsy and potentiated apomorphine-induced
stereotopy and disruption of prepulse inhibition of acoustic
startle w29,40x. Neonatal VH lesions also lead to more
intense locomotor activity in response to a novel environment, stress and to D receptor agonists and amphetamine

Exactly how neonatal VH lesions come to enhance
NAcc DA-mediated behaviors has yet to be elucidated and
attempts to do so have thus far yielded unexpected results.
In one study, neonatal VH damage was reported to result
in a reduction of basal 3-methoxytyramine 3-MT. levels
in NAcc and PFC of adult rats that been subjected to

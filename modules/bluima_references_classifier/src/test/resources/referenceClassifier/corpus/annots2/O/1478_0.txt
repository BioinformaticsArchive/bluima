Chemicals—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless mentioned otherwise. Monochlorobimane was purchased from either Fluka
or Molecular Probes and made as a 100 mM stock solution in Me SO
2

and stored at 20 °C. Sulforhodamine 101 (SR 101) was prepared as a 10
mM stock solution in Me SO and also stored at 20 °C. Propidium
2

iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes and made as a 10 mM
solution in PBS and stored at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used in this study
included anti-laminin (rabbit), anti-S-100 (mouse), and anti-NeuN
(mouse, Chemicon). Secondary antibodies included FITC anti-rabbit,
FITC anti-mouse, and Alexa 594 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes).
Plate Reader GSH Assay—Fluorometric assays were performed using
a plate reader (Fluoroskan; Ascent, FL), 355 19 nm and
ex em

527 5 nm. Although these excitation/emission filters are suboptimal
for MCB detection, they prevented saturation of the detector within the
plate reader permitting linearity between the concentration of MCBGSH and detected fluorescence over the range associated with the fluorescence values in our measurements. Purified 200 M GSH and 10 M
MCB were added together, with varying concentrations of purified GST
enzyme (0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 units (equine); Sigma). Fluorescence was
measured using a plate reader over a 4-h reaction period.
Calibration of the GSH-MCB Fluorescence—A 5 mM stock solution of
GSH-MCB was made from 20 mM GSH and 3 mM MCB in the presence
of a GST. Excess GSH and GST were used to ensure that all MCB was
conjugated. A dilution series of 5, 1.5, 0.5, and 0.15 mM was made from
this stock. The standard solutions were contained within in vitro cells
(glass microcuvettes, inner diameter 50 m; VitroCom) and imaged
with two-photon microscopy using identical power settings to those
used on brain tissues. This method of GSH-MCB calibration was routinely used in our studies in brain slices.
Rat Brain Slice Preparation—Coronal brain slices were prepared
from P15-21 or P1-2 Wistar rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories,
Canada). Under halothane anesthesia, animals were killed, and the brain
was quickly removed from the skull and placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM) 200 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl , 26.2 NaHCO ,
23

10 MgSO 7H O, 1 NaH PO , 11 glucose (pH was maintained at 7.4 by
42 24

saturation with 95%O and 5%CO ). Slices (300 m) were obtained with
22

a vibratome (Leica VT 1000 S) and then transferred to a static bath
chamber where they were maintained at room temperature for at least
1 h before imaging. The slices were kept in artificial cerebral spinal fluid
(ACSF) containing (in mM) 120 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO , 24.2 glucose, 2.5
3

KCl, 1.25 NaH PO , 1 MgCl 6H O, 2 CaCl , saturated with 95% O and
24 22 2 2

5% CO . For imaging, individual slices were transferred to a recording
2

chamber and perfused with ACSF saturated with 95% O and 5% CO .
22

MCB was added to the perfusion system at a final concentration of 60
M. To identify dead cells, we added 10 M propidium iodide together
with MCB.
Animal Preparation for in Vivo Imaging—All experiments were
approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and were conducted in strict accordance with guidelines from the
Canadian Council on Animal Care. C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at the University of
British Columbia animal facilities. Cranial windows for in vivo imaging
were produced as described previously (14). In brief, mice aged 3–5
months were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
urethane (0.12% w/w, supplemented with 0.02% w/w as needed) (15),

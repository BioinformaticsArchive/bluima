Fig. 4. Quantitation of exon 37 splice variants in human male (A) and female (B) cerebellar samples. The percentage of EFa expression in bar graphs
is expressed in white while that of EFb is expressed in black. The numbers in parentheses above each bar indicate the number of colonies screened.
A switch from predominant EFa to predominant EFb expression was observed in males between 30 and 40 years old. Such a switch was absent in
the females, whereby EFb expression predominated from 24 to 93 years of age.

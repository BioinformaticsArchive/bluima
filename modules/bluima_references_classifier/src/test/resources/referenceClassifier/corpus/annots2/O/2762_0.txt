Fig. 1. Typical microinjection site in the rostra1 ventrolateral me-dulla (RVLM). Photomicrograph shows a representative microinjection site in the right RVLM. Because of a lack of contrast between the
microinjection site marked with fast green dye and neurons stained
with neutral red, this picture was taken using fluorescence microscopy with a CY3 filter cube (Chroma Scientific). Neutral red-stained
neurons fluoresce under these conditions and appear light, whereas
the fast green at the microinjection site, indicated by the arrow,
appears dark. RVLM microinjections sites were localized -500 pm
ventral to the nucleus ambiguus (NA). The bar in the lower right
corner represents 200 pm.

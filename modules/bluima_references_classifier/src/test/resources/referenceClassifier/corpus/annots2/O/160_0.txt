tion. Topotecan lactone pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 4. The topotecan systemic clearance in mice
receiving topotecan alone was similar to that in mice receiving
topotecan along with vincristine. The topotecan lactone systemic exposure measured in the two groups of mice was similar,
with or without vincristine. Plasma concentration plots for vincristine also showed a biphasic linear elimination. The estimated
vincristine pharmacokinetic parameters are also summarized in
Table 4.
Toxicity of Topotecan-Vincristine Combinations.
The toxicity of vincristine and topotecan, administered as
single agents and in combination, was evaluated by calculating the weight loss during the first course of treatment (21
days). In addition, changes in the blood counts were documented from serial measurements in non-tumor-bearing mice
over the same period. Weight loss of mice bearing Rh12
RMSs treated with vincristine (1 mg/kg), topotecan (1.5
mg/kg), and both agents together is shown in Fig. 6A.
Clearly, the combination was more toxic than either agent
individually; however, the total weight loss was <20% at
doses that were 75 and 80% of the MTD for topotecan and
vincristine, respectively. No drug-related deaths occurred in
mice that received three cycles of therapy over a period of 8
weeks. As can be seen from Fig. 6, B and C, a marked
reduction in both hemoglobin and platelets resulted from
combination treatment in non-tumor-bearing mice. Also, re-covery of the blood count was more prolonged after the
combination treatment. Of note is that vincristine was my-elotoxic in this animal model, a toxicity not usually encountered in the clinical setting.

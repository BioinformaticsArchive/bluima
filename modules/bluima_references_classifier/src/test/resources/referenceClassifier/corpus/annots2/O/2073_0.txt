INTRODUCTION

In the preceding paper electrophysiological and anatomical investigations showed that the
uvula (lobule IX) of the rabbit receives multiple inputs from peripheral somatic nerves in
addition to afferents from widespread ponto-medullary nuclei (Bradley et al. 1990). The
area of innervation encompasses the previously described cardiovascular region of the
uvula (Bradley, Ghelarducci, Paton & Spyer, 1987), which when stimulated in the
anaesthetized rabbit elicits apnoea, bradycardia, a depressor response associated with an
inhibition in renal sympathetic nerve discharge and vasodilatation in the femoral bed. In
contrast, in the decerebrate preparation the pattern of evoked responses consists of an
apneusis, a rise in heart rate and arterial blood pressure with an increase in renal nerve
discharge and vasoconstriction in the hindlimb.
It is suggested that this region of the posterior vermis may be involved in mediating some
aspects of a complex behavioural response, such as the alerting or arousal reaction, which
is consistent with recent reports describing a role for the posterior vermis in the startle
response and in several species-specific behaviours in the rat (Supple, Leaton & Fanselow,
1987; Supple, Cranney & Leaton, 1988; Lopiano, De'Sperati, Bergui & Montarolo, 1988).
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of uvula stimulation in the conscious
rabbit while monitoring both visceral and somatic changes.
A preliminary report of this work has been published (Bradley, Ghelarducci, La Noce &
Spyer, 1988).

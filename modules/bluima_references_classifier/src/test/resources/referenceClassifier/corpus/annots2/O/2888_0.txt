Environmental sound recognition
Twenty exerpts from a BBC sound effect CD (BBC CD 792)
were played and the subject asked to identify the sound.
Common sounds with which the patient would have been
familiar were selected from the CD. These included the
sounds of animals such as dogs and cows, mechanical noises
such as trains and aeroplanes, and other environmental noises
such as footsteps and church bells. H.V. scored 36 out of 40
compared with a mean of 39 out of 40 in age-matched
controls .

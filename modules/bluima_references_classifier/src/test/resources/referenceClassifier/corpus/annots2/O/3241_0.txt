MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiments were performed on 280–380 gm male Sprague Dawley rats
(Bantin and Kingman, Fremont, CA). These animals were maintained in
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), animal care facility
in accordance with applicable university policies. Experimental protocols were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research.
Antinociception in awake animals was measured as elevation of threshold for withdrawal of the hindpaw from an increasing mechanical stimulus. Antinociception in anesthetized animals was measured as attenuation of the nociceptive jaw-opening reflex (Mason et al., 1985; Gear and
Levine, 1995) (Fig. 1).
Anesthesia. In some experiments, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.9 gm / kg urethane and 45 mg / kg α-chloralose
(both from Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Urethane–α-chloralose was chosen
for anesthesia because this anesthetic protocol provides a stable jaw-

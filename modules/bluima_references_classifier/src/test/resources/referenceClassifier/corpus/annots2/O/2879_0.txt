Fig. 6. Low magnification fluorescence photomicrograph of a slice of
mouse cerebral cortex, with dura mater intact, showing penetration of
the pyrrolopyrimidine U-87663 into brain parenchyma after a 23 Î¼M/kg
(approximate 10 mg/kg) i.v. bolus. The color scale shows relative
drug-associated fluorescence pseudocolor intensity (white = highest
concentration). The black holes represent brain microvessels. The circular structure on the right is a pial artery. Note that vessel walls show
relatively low drug-related fluorescence compared to parenchyma
(higher magnification inset).

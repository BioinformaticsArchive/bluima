Figure 7. Fluorescence photomicrographs showing the distribution of NOS-IR in sagittal sections of the L6 spinal cord ipsilateral and contralateral
to axotomy. A, Orientation figure of a transverse section from a control animal of the L6 spinal cord showing the approximate location (wrrical
c&i@, line) of the sections in B-II. K and C are in the same plane of section, with C illustrating only the dorsal part (Lissauer's tract. LT: dorsal
horn, I>H) of the section and A illustrating the ventral part near the region of the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN). R. Ipsilateral to axotomy,
clu\ter\ of NOS-IR hberj (rrr~rrc) are located dorsal to the SPN and also intermtngled with cells in the region ot the SPN. In contrast, no NOSIR fiber5 are located 111a similar region of the SPN on the contralateral side (n). C, NOS-TR fibers (c~~,~/z~rrrl\) projectmE rostrocaudally within
LT are present on the axotomized s;e along the dorsal and dorsolateral edge of the DH. Scale bar. 150 pm for A, i3frfor @and I), 190 kh for C.

High-grade gliomas are highly invasive brain tumors that are in-variably fatal. The factors controlling the invasive behavior of these
tumors are poorly understood. There is, however, good evidence that
interactions between hyaluronan, a highly polymerized glycosaminoglycan, which is abundantly present in the brain, and receptors of
hyaluronan play an important role in the invasiveness of the tumor
(1–5). There are several hyaluronan-binding proteins in the extracellular matrix of the brain, including link protein and other members of
a family of related proteins such as BEHAB3/brevican, neurocan,
versican, the glial hyaluronate-binding protein (GHAP), and hyaluronectin, both of the latter proteins derived by proteolytic degradation
of versican (6 –11). In addition there are several cell-associated hyaluronan-binding proteins including: (a) CD44, the predominant hyaluronan receptor; (b) BEHAB/brevican; (c) a COOH-terminal fragment of BEHAB/brevican; and (d) RHAMM/IHABP (12–16). These
cell-associated hyaluronan receptors have been reported to mediate
cell migration in response to hyaluronan during fetal development and
during tumor formation (3–5, 17).
Hyaluronan can be taken up by cells via CD44 interactions and
transported into lysosomes, in which lysosomal hyaluronidases cause
its degradation (18, 19). HYAL2 degrades hyaluronan from M
r

;8,000,000 to M ;20,000, or about 100 sugar moieties (19). The
r

hyaluronidase, found in the serum HYAL1, similar to the spermderived hyaluronidase, PH-20/SPAM1, cleaves hyaluronan into small
oligosaccharides of two to three tandem repeats of D-glucuronic acid
and N-acetyl-glucosamine (20). There is some evidence that degrada-

Striatal connections of the PFN
In our study, we demonstrate both anterogradely (by means of biocytin
in the adult and lipophilic dyes in neonatal brains) and retrogradely
(with beads and fluorescent dextrans in the adult and lipophilic dyes in
neonatal brains) a strong striatal projection from the PFN. The
observation of PFN neurons double-labelled retrogradely from both
cortical and striatal targets suggest that PFN projections to the cortex
and the striatum might consist of bifurcated axons. Single midline
thalamic neurons in the medial part of the PFN have been reported as
projecting to both the ventral striatum and autonomic/limbic-associated areas of the prefrontal cortex (Otake & Nakamura, 1998).
A topographical organization of PFN connections with the striatum,
less precise than that with the cortex, can be observed. The loose
mediolateral topography was already evidenced: (i) for the CPu by
Berendse & Groenewegen (1990), with the lateral PFN projecting to
the lateral CPu, and the medial PFN to the medial CPu; and (ii), for the
globus pallidus by Kincaid et al. (1991), such that lateral and ventral
PFN neurons project preferentially to corresponding parts of the
globus pallidus, and medial PFN neurons project primarily to the
ventral globus pallidus. A rostrocaudal topography emerges also from
other studies (Feger et al., 1994).
PFN axons project onto spines of the cholinergic neurons of the
dorsal striatum (Dube et al., 1988; Lapper & Bolam, 1992), whereas

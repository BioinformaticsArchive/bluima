ever, ERK activation by cocaine may occur through
other mechanisms, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling (13), because BDNF
and the activated form of its receptor, TrkB, are both
up-regulated in the NAc after cocaine exposure
(14–16). Furthermore, manipulations of BDNF and
its TrkB receptor in this brain region potently
modify rewarding responses to cocaine (15–19).
Despite these important insights into BDNF signaling and dopaminergic transmission in the NAc,
it remains unclear which MSN subtype is involved
in these phenomena.

FIG. 1. The pXO1-encoded BslA protein plays a prominent role in promoting adherence to and invasion of brain endothelium. (A and B)
Adherence to (A) and invasion of (B) hBMEC by B. anthracis Sterne 7702 and its isogenic LF/EF mutant, B. anthracis Sterne 34F2 and its
isogenic pXO1 and bslA:: Spr mutants, and the closely related B. thuringiensis (B.t.). Data are expressed as the total cell-associated or
intracellular CFU recovered compared to the input inoculum (MOI of 1, 1 105 CFU). All experiments were repeated at least three times in
triplicate; data from a representative experiment are shown. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of mean values from three wells. *, P
0.05; **, P 0.005; ***, P 0.001. (C to E) Micrographs of Gram-stained hBMEC monolayers infected with vegetative B. anthracis Sterne 34F2
(C) or the pXO1 (D) or bslA:: Spr (E) strain.

Fig. 5. (Aâ€“F) Horizontal section through the olfactory epithelium of saline (A) and NPY (B) -treated fish showing GnRH-like immunoreactive ORNs
(arrows). Note the increase in number and intensity of GnRH immunoreactive ORNs. Fibers in the basal lamina (arrowhead) also showed an
augmentation in GnRH-like immunoreactivity in the NPY-treated fish (B). (C , D) Horizontal section through the olfactory bulb (OB) of saline (C) and
NPY (D) -treated fish showing GnRH-like immunoreactive fibers in the olfactory nerve layer. Note the increase in number and intensity of GnRH
immunoreactive fibers in the olfactory nerve layer of NPY-treated fish (D; compare with C). (E, F) Sagittal section through the telencephalon (Tel) of
saline (E) and NPY (F) -treated fish showing GnRH immunoreactive fibers in the MOT. Note the increase in the number of GnRH immunoreactive fibers
in the MOT (F; compare with E).

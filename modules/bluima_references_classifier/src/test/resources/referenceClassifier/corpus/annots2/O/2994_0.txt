Fig. 3. Testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) concentration
in serum. The differences in concentration of T between malepromoting (27 ± 0.5°C) and female-promoting (32 ± 0.1°C)
temperatures during undifferentiated gonad (UDG) and differentiated gonad (DG) are significant (P < 0.0001). No difference was detected (P = 0.85) in the thermosensitive period
(TSP). The concentration of E2 is different (P < 0.001) only
in the differentiated gonad (DG). No differences were registered (P = 0.85) at TSP and UDG at the two temperatures.

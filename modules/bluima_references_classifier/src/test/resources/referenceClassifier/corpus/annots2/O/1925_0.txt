The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has been traditionally viewed in fear conditioning to serve as an output neural center
that transfers conditioned information formed in the basolateral amygdala to brain structures that generate emotional responses.
Recent studies suggest that the CeA may also be involved in fear memory consolidation. In addition, corticotropin-releasing factor
systems were shown to facilitate memory consolidation in the amygdala, which contains a high density of CRF immunoreactive cell
bodies and fibers in the lateral part of the CeA (CeAl). However, the involvement of CeA CRF in contextual fear conditioning
remains poorly understood. Therefore, we first conducted a series of studies using fiber-sparing lesion and reversible inactivation
methods to assess the general role of the CeA in contextual fear. We then used identical training and testing procedures to compare
and evaluate the specific function of CeA CRF using CRF antisense oligonucleotides (CRF ASO). Rats microinjected with ibotenic
acid, muscimol, or a CRF ASO into the CeA before contextual fear conditioning showed typical levels of freezing during acquisition
training but exhibited significant reductions in contextual freezing in a retention test 48 h later. Furthermore, CeA inactivation
induced by either muscimol or CRF ASO administration immediately before retention testing did not impair freezing, suggesting
that the previously observed retention deficits were caused by inhibition of consolidation rather than fear expression. Collectively,
our results suggest CeA involvement in the consolidation of contextual fear memory and specifically implicate CeA CRF as an
important mediator.

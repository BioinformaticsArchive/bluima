immunohistochemical profiles of Cases 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Immunohistochemistry for GFAP was
positive within tumour cells (Figure 2f) as was CD34
(Figure 3a) and vimentin. There was variable focal positivity for S100 and EMA (Figure 3b). Immunohistochemistry for pan cytokeratin, desmin, NFP, synaptophysin,
Factor VIII (Figure 3c), oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor was negative. The Ki67 proliferation index
was low (Figure 3d). On ultrastructural examination both
Case 1 (Figure 4) and Case 2 showed focal basal lamina
deposition and microvilli formation suggesting ependymal
derivation. However, the cases lacked more definitive
ultrastructural features of ependymoma such as cilia and
desmosomal junctions.
The resected recurrent tumour in Case 2 had similar
appearances to the original specimen on histology. Mitotic
activity was not identified and the Ki67 proliferation index
was low. The only changes noted were a small focus of
necrosis and hyaline change, with no other histological
evidence of malignant transformation.

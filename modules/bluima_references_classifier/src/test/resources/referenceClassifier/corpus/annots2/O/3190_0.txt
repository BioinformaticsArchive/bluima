mutants, EphB3/Nuk1. In addition, these mice have
specific defects in pathfinding of the habenular
commissure and in the fasciculation of the habenularâ€“interpeduncular tract.29
Regions surrounding the anterior commissure and
corpus callosum, including the hippocampus, are
areas of high expression of EphB2 and EphB3.18,29
Corpus callosum axons are dependent on EphB3/
EphB2 for crossing the brain midline, as has been
demonstrated in double mutant mice. In these
animals, a few callosal fibers are able to cross the
midline through a path alternative to the normal
route, the hippocampal commissure. This commissure is the main interconnection between the right
and left hippocampi in rodents, and occupies some
areas neighboring the anterior commissure and
corpus callosum. It seems probable that the axons
of this tract express different Eph receptors.

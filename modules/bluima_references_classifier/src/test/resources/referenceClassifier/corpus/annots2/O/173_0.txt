Figure 5. Multiple sessions augment the LTD effect observed after the
first session of low-frequency (1 Hz for 15 min) stimulation. A, Representative sweeps from an animal in the spaced-trains group comparing the
first session and 10th session LTD effect to the last baseline response.
C alibration: 1 mV, 25 msec. B, C, Changes in response amplitudes for the
early monosynaptic ( B) and longer latency polysynaptic ( C) components
monitored during LTD induction in the multiple train groups. Trains
were delivered either hourly (MASSED-TRAINS) or daily (SPACEDTR A INS). Iâ€“ O tests were recorded both before and after each train in the
spaced trains groups, so that the decay of the LTD effect could be
observed for each 24 hr poststimulation period. The final point in the
graph shows response amplitudes 24 hr after the last low-frequency train.
Similar amounts of LTD were observed for both spaced and massed
groups.

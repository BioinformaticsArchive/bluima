cytotoxicity. For transgenic mice, Kay et al. (17) have shown
that increased expression of the gp70 surface protein of
Cas-Br-E is sufficient to induce neuropathological changes
without the severe paralysis that is seen with virus-induced
neurological disease. Moreover, in vivo expression of the
gp120 surface protein of HIV-1 in transgenic mice is also
associated with widespread minor neuropathological change in
astrocytes, microglia, and dendrites without paralysis (25).
Ectopic expression of virus-specific envelope proteins may be
responsible for certain pathological features in diseased transgenic mice; however, these features do not completely recapitulate the neurological features in virus-induced neurodegeneration. In this article, experimental evidence indicating that it
is possible that a superinfection mechanism or, alternatively,
direct cytotoxicity of unintegrated viral DNA may be responsible for the more profound cell damage and the severe clinical
features of virus-induced neurological disease was presented.
These results raise additional mechanistic possibilities for
explaining the neuropathology of neurovirulent MuLVs that
relate the mapping of the disease process to aspects of change
in the envelope protein that promote superinfection in addition to other pathogenic mechanisms. Further research will
shed light on the mechanisms whereby env gene-specific properties determine the neurovirulence of this group of MuLVs.

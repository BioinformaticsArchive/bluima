Distribution of Areas 4 and 3
Among the 40 hemispheres examined, the portion of sensorimotor cortex that showed the most interindividual variability
was the extension of areas 4 and 3 onto the mesial face of the
hemisphere in the paracentral lobule â€” an observation also made
by Brodmann (1909) and more recently by Rademacher et al.
(1993). In contrast to this variability, the locations of the
cytoarchitectonic borders of areas 4 and 3 along the central
sulcus were remarkably consistent among individual specimens;
a representative hemisphere is illustrated in Figure 10.
Near the superior margin of the central sulcus, the anterior
border of area 4 (i.e. the area 4/area 6 border) was located in the
posterior bank of the precentral sulcus (e.g. Fig. 10, section 6) or
the junction between the superior frontal and precentral gyri.
Thus, area 4 has its greatest anterior-to-posterior extent along the
most medial portion of the central sulcus. Proceeding inferiorly
toward the Sylvian fissure, the anterior border of area 4
withdraws posteriorly; near the junction of the superior frontal
and precentral sulci it is typically located at the lip of the anterior
bank of the central sulcus (e.g. Fig. 10, section 16). From this
position, the anterior border of area 4 recedes from the crest of
the precentral gyrus into the depths of the central sulcus.
Throughout the middle third of the precentral gyrus, the area
4/area 6 border remains in this operculated position, with area 4
residing in the lower two-thirds of the anterior wall of the central
sulcus. In the region of increased gyral complexity near the
middle of the central sulcus, the protrusion of the anterior wall

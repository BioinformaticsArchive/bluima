Immunofluorescence
Four different marker antibodies and procedures were used: (1) monoclonal antibody 0, against galactocerebroside (GalC) (Sommer and
Schachner, 1981; Singh and Pfeiffer, 1985) for oligodendrocytes and
myelin; (2) antiserum against the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acid
protein (GFAP) (Ortho Diagnostic System, Raritan, NY); (3) goat antiserum against myelin basic protein (MBP) of rabbit (Omlin et al., 1982);
and (4) rabbit antiserum against laminin (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland). In
all cases sections from 5-azacytidine-injected rats and controls of the
same age were washed twice with 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 5%
sucrose and 5% BSA.

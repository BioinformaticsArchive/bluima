nae. The presynaptic IFN-cR in the LSpN, on the other
hand, may be involved in regulating the release of
neurotransmitter in this nucleus. It also remains to be
analyzed whether the IFN-cR in DRG neurons that is
transported to the spinal cord and the periphery can
operate as an autoreceptor providing feedback regulation of neuronal IFN-c release.
In conclusion, the IFN-cR in laminae I and II of the
spinal cord dorsal horn is localized mainly to postsynaptic sites and in the LSpN mainly to presynaptic
axon terminals. The remarkable concentration of different receptors to laminae I and II indicates an extensive
modulation of primary afferent input at the spinal level
(Coggeshall & Carlton, 1997). Activation of the IFN-cR
is probably involved in the mediation of neuropathic
pain-related behavior, since autotomy, evoked by sciatic nerve transection in wild-type mice, is abolished in
mice with disruption of the functional gene for the
IFN-cR (Robertson et al., 1997). The presence of the
receptor for the key immunomodulatory molecule
IFN-c in the superficial dorsal horn and the LSpN
therefore indicates that nociception associated with
neuropathic pain-related behavior may be modulated
also by immune system signals at the spinal cord level.

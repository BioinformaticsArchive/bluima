Lactic acidosis
During ischaemia, glucose metabolism is switched from
the aerobic phosphorylation pathway to the anaerobic
glycolytic pathway, which results in the accumulation of
cellular lactate and a decrease in pH. 27'4z
In a primate model of severe focal ischaemia, Michenfelder et al. noted lactate accumulation of almost four
times the mean control level of 2.14 p.moi .g-t within 30
rain of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. 56 By the
end of three hours post-occlusion of the MCA, lactate
levels increased to approximately 17 mmol.kg -~ of
tissue, s6 Lactate levels in the range of 16-20 mmol. kg-are considered to be the threshold above which tissue
damage occurs. 57
It has been suggested that lactate is a major contributor
to ischaemic neuronal damage when it is present in high
concentrationsY Mechanisms by which lactate accumulation can contribute to neuronal injury are given in
Table I.

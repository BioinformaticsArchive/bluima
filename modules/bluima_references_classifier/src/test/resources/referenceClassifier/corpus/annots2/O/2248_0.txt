in which the retinotectal projection was mapped electrophysiologically. Three
aspects of the retinotectal projection were assessed:
(i) detailed order in the projection as it is normally mapped;
(ii) the size of the multiunit receptive fields (MURFs) recordable at one tectal
locus - this is a quantitative index of the precision with which optic fibres
terminating at a given tectal site arise only from ganglion cells at a restricted,
retinal locus; and
(iii) the differential depth distribution of terminals from different classes of
retinal ganglion cells (Maturana, Lettvin, McCulloch & Pitts, 1959; Keating &
Gaze, 1970). A brief account of some of these results has appeared (Dawes,
Grant, Keating & Nanchahal, 1984).

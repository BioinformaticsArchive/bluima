METHODS

We prepared thick brain slices following our standard laboratory procedures (Llinas and Sugimori 1980a; N. Hori, personal
communication). Briefly, 150- to 250-g adult female Hartley
guinea pigs were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/
kg) and decapitated. The brains were rapidly removed and placed
in ice-cold Ringer solution (composition in mM: 123 NaCl, 3
KCl, 2.6 MgS04, 4.8 CaCl,, 26 NaHCO,, 1.2 KH2P04, and 10
glucose, saturated with 95% O,-5% C02, pH 7.4 at room temperature). A block containing the caudoputamen (CPU) and GP was
dissected and 600-pm sagittal slices were cut using a Vibratome.
Each thick slice was hand-dissected parallel to the striopallidal
fibers into several 600- to l,OOO-pm-wide strips to ensure proper
oxygenation (Fig. 1). These strips, containing both GP and CPU,
were incubated with oxygenated Ringer solution at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation the strips were transferred to a recording chamber and maintained at 33 t 0.5‚ÄùC (mean t SD) under
continuous superfusion with the oxygenated Ringer solution
(Fig. 1).
Intracellular recordings were obtained using glass microelectrodes filled with either 3 M potassium acetate (electrode resistance 70-80 MQ) or 2% biocytin (Sigma) dissolved in 1 M potas-

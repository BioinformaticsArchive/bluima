INTRODUCTION
Only few authors have described cases of facial nerve in -jury due the dental practice (1-6). Gray et al. ( 1) published
multiple cases of peripheral facial nerve paralysis of dental
origin, one of which was apparently related to a prolonged
attempt to remove a mandibular third molar and subsequent
infection. He also cited 3 cases caused by the local anesthesia
technique that had a maximum recovery period of 7 hours.
The case caused by a dental infection had not recovered 90%
of full muscular function until five months.

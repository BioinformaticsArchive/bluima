Notch-1 mRNA expression after injury

Hybridization signals for Notch-1 were not detectable in the intact
spinal cord (data not shown). Only a few cells with weak hybridization
signals were found in grey and white matter on the 2nd day after injury
(Table 2). Notch-1 expression increased on the 4th day (Fig. 4A and
B), reached a peak on the 7th day after injury and then declined to a
nondetectable level 1 month after injury. Spatially, the cells expressing
Notch-1 were scattered evenly in the dorsal and ventral horns of the
grey matter. Notch-1 expression was not detectable in white matter.
The strongest Notch-1 signal was found in the spinal cord immediately
adjacent to the lesion both rostrally and caudally, where GFAPpositive astrocytes were most abundant and intense in immunofluorescence. The expression levels of Notch-1 in the parts more distal to
the lesion site were lower than in the more proximal parts, within
5 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion site. In the single cell layer of
ependymal cells lining of the central canal of the spinal cord (Fig. 4E
and F), Notch-1 expression reached its peak on the 2nd day after
injury, which is earlier than the appearance of Notch-1 hybridization
signal in white and grey matter. Notch-1-expressing ependymal cells
were localized within a range of 5 mm from the lesion. In the sections
10 mm away from the lesion, no Notch-1 signal was found in the
ependyma. Notch-1 signals declined to the control levels of uninjured
animals on the 14th day after injury.

Procedures, except incubations were carried out with or without 20 mM NaF in the absence of EGTA. The inset represents the kinetics under
compicte phosphorylating conditions [phosphorylating mixture (mix P) as in Fig. 2, but with 20 mM NaF]. (0)Control assay; ( 0 )HisDC
assays under complete phosphorylating conditions; (a)HisDC assays under complete phosphorylating conditions, in the presence of rat
cerebellum protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI; 80 pg protein); (----) control with 0.1 mM ATP. The apparent K, obtained were 0.3 mM for
the control, 2.2 mM for HisDC subjected to a complete phosphorylating mixture, and 0.66 mM for HisDC subjected to a complete
phosphorylating mixture in the presence of rat cerebellum protein kinase A inhibitor (80 pg protein). The V, calculated as 0.60 nmol . mg
protein-' . h - I , was approximately the same under each condition. Incubations were performed in the absence of EGTA

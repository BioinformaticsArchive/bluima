Figure 4. Proliferation of newly generated neurons visualized by immunostaining for the proliferation marker BrdU (red) and
the immature neuronal marker DCX (green) in the neuroproliferative zones of C57BL/6 mice. Increased expression of BrdU and DCX
in EAE mice and, to a greater extent, in EAE GA mice in the SVZ (A; confocal images) and in the hippocampus (C) 25 d after EAE
induction 1 d after the last GA injection. Right panels are high magnifications of the SGZ and the GCL. Note the DCX cells in the
hippocampus that migrated into the GCL and manifest a dense and branched dendritic tree. B, DCX expression in the SVZ at
different times points: 1 d (I), 10 d (II), and 30 d (III) after the last GA injection. Neuroproliferation declined with time; however,
DCX expression in GA-treated mice was higher than that in EAE mice 1 and 10 d after treatment (coronal sections). Scale bar: A, 50
m; B, C, 200 m; C, right, 20 m. st, Striatum; LV, lateral ventricle; IML, inner molecular layer; OML, outer molecular layer. D,
Quantitative analysis of BrdU incorporation and DCX expression in EAE (red) and EAE GA (blue) mice at various time points after
EAE induction and GA treatment. Increased neuronal proliferation is observed in both neuroproliferative zones after disease
appearance; subsequent decline is observed below that of naive mice and augmentation of neuroproliferation by the various
schedules of GA treatment. Quantification was performed in the SVZ by counting BrdU-positive cells (Figure legend continues.)

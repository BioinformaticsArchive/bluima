Some second-order NTS neurons had sIPSC rates that were un-responsive to ST stimulation. Given the consistency of isolated
neurons in their mGluR responses, the unresponsive slice neurons may reflect damage to ST connections to GABA terminals in
preparing slices. In dissociated cells, conducted responses are not
necessary, because GABA events arise from isolated terminals
and mGluR responses were evoked by exogenous agents. In slices,
variability in rates of GABA release may reflect activity from local
circuits that may obscure the smaller mGluR group II–III re-sponses in slices more than in isolated cells. The slice studies
focused on a select subpopulation of NTS neurons: second-order
neurons. The dissociated work may include a more diverse population (e.g., higher-order neurons). Consistent with that view,
we recorded two dissociated neurons with EPSCs that were not
responsive to either CAP or -m-ATP (nonafferent profile)
but nonetheless showed a decrease-type mGluR sIPSC re-sponse. We speculate that this nonafferent agonist profile reflects
a higher than second-order NTS neuron that is not included in
the slice work.
Our results are consistent with the conclusion that no mixed
populations of group I with group II–III mGluR occur on NTS
GABA terminals. If mGluR intermixing had been the case,
subtype-selective antagonism would have produced oppositely
coupled mGluR responses, yet such reversed responses were
never observed. Thus, our overall results support a differential
distribution of distinct mGluRs on GABA terminals that populate different NTS neurons.

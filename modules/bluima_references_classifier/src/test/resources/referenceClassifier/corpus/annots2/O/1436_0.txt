microscope. Immunofluorescence patterns of flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2
were diffusely distributed in the control primary microglia (Fig. 3A, a
and b) and BV2 cells (Fig. 3B, a and b). Treatment with 50 g/ml Gmix
for 5 min induced clustering and polarization of flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2
in rat primary microglia (Fig. 3A, d and e) and BV2 microglial cells (Fig.
3B, d and e). The merged images revealed that flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2
are colocalized in Gmix-treated primary microglia (Fig. 3A, f) and BV2
cells (Fig. 3B, f). These results indicate that in Gmix-treated microglia,
lipid rafts are reformed and p-SHP-2 is localized at lipid raft.
SHP-2 Is Recruited to Detergent-insoluble Fractions by Gmix—Be-cause lipid rafts are easily isolated by their insolubility in non-ionic
detergents at 4 °C, they are also called detergent-resistant microdomains. Whereas many signaling proteins are permanently associated
with lipid rafts, some are only temporally associated with rafts via biochemical or biological modifications. SHP-2 is primarily present in the
cytosol and is recruited to its target molecules in lipid rafts. Because we
observed p-SHP-2 localization at the lipid raft in Fig. 3, we investigated
whether SHP-2 is recruited to lipid rafts by Gmix using detergent-insoluble fractionation by the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. Primary
microglia or BV2 microglial cells were treated with 50 g/ml Gmix for
the times indicated in Fig. 4, and cell lysates were then fractionated into
insoluble and soluble fractions using 0.5% Triton X-100. These separated fractions were then subjected to Western blot analysis. SHP-2
appeared to be translocated to the detergent-insoluble fraction at 5 min
after Gmix treatment in rat primary microglia (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in
BV2 microglial cells, Gmix increased the recruitment of SHP-2 to the
detergent-insoluble fraction quickly (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting with flotillin-1 confirmed the presence of lipid rafts in the detergent-insoluble

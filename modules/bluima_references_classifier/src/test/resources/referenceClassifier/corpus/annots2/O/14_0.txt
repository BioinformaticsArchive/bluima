with propagation of action potentials are probably too
small to affect diffusion measurably as seen by MRI.
These results may also shed light on the nature of the
ADC changes seen by other groups upon stimulation in
vivo. In the preliminary human visual stimulation experiments of Kato et al, the apparent diffusion changes, if not
artifactual, could have had contributions from changes in
blood flow and blood volume (8). In the electrical stimulation experiments of rat cortex carried out by Prichard and
Zhong et al also, blood flow and blood volume changes
cannot be ruled out as a source of the ADC changes (9,10).
In our experiments, on the other hand, vascular changes
can be excluded as a source of possible ADC changes since
we used excised tissue. Our results therefore support the
hypothesis that the ADC changes seen in the aforementioned experiments are related to blood flow or volume.
This hypothesis is supported by experiments on rat optic
nerves, in which no ADC changes were observed when the
nerves were depolarized with KCl without allowing accompanying osmotic volume changes (11). Our results and
conclusions are also consistent with BOLD functional
imaging experiments in which diffusion weighting has
been found to affect the vascular component of the BOLD
fMRI signal in humans, but not the non-vascular component (43,44).

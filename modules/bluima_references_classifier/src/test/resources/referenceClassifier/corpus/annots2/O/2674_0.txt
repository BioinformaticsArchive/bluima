Development of geniculocortical arbors in TTX-treated
animals
P23. Four arbors were reconstructed from caseMUC 719 in
which retinal activity was blocked for 6 d, from P17 to P23,

bank of the lateral gyrus.
Figure 11 illustrates coronal and surfaceviews of typical ar-bors. Arbors TTX 15andTTX 18ramified predominantly in the
upper portion of layer IV, whereasthe terminal field of TTX 17
spanned the entire width of layer IV. The three arbors were
spatially homogeneousandlackedapatchy organization, similar
to arbors reconstructed at P19 and P23 in normal animals. In
contrast to the arbors found in age-matchedcontrols shown in

muscle nerve stimulus accessed the CTN and
effectively resulted in a resetting of the clock
(i.e., the CTN) that produced a resetting of
the rhythm (17). Although a separation of a
CTN from a CPG network has yet to be demonstrated for RJMs and, in fact, might be
just a semantic distinction. We, nevertheless,
propose a similar interpretation for the ef-fects of PnC-Gi stimulation on cortically
evoked RJMs. The PnC-Gi stimulus effects a
CTN (the PnC-Gi may be a part of such a
network) responsible for generating the
oscillations observed during RJMs without
effecting neuronal networks responsible for
coordinating particular muscle synergies
(CPG) during a given jaw-movement task.
For cortically evoked RJMs, the neurons
comprising the short-latency corticotrigeminal pathway would constitute a component
of the CPG network or coordinating network
responsible for producing the particular
muscle synergies during RJMs.

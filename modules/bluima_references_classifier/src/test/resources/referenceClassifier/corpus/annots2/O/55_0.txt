In vivo morphologies of nasal and temporal growth cones
differentially vary depending on their position along the
rostrocaudal axis of the SC
The response of nasal fibres to contact with anterior SC membranes in
vitro was intriguing in that, aside from the changes in their
morphologies, and judging from their growth rates, it seemed to
activate the growth of these fibres. This might suggest that the
anterior tectal environment contains cues which render it more
permissive for the growth of nasal than temporal fibres. In vivo, fibres
from the whole retina grow into the SC which is their target, therefore
the tectal environment must be permissive for the growth of all retinal

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

ProtonMagneticResonance Analysis of Oligosaccharidealditols 4 , 5 , and 6-Oligosaccharides 4,5, and6, isolated from
liver of Sandhoff patient L. O., were confirmed as branchedchain glycoconjugates using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fig. 1and Table I. Oligosaccharide4 was identified
as a biantennary hexasaccharide with 2 GlcNAc residues at
the nonreducing terminus. Signal assignments for the C-1
and C-2 protons of each carbohydrate residue were in good
agreement with those reported for the aldose form of this
compound isolated from Sandhoff urine (7) andglycopeptides
of similar structure (17, 18). Since the crude liver extract
containing the oligosaccharide mixture was initially treated
with NaBH, prior to HPLC chromatography, the oligosaccharides were isolated and characterized as oligosaccharidealditols. Thus the HPLC-purified compounds, including oligosaccharide4-alditollackedanomericprotonsignalsat5.240
and 4.760 ppm which arise from the C-1 protons, of the a and
B anomers, respectively, of the reducing N-acetylglucosamine
residue. Chemical reduction of oligosaccharide4 also resulted
in enhanced resolution of the anomeric proton signals for the
two outerchain GlcNAc moieties. The C-1 proton of the
GlcNAc residue on the a1-6branch of the molecule givesrise
to thedoublet(51,=28Hz)at4.594ppm,whiletheC-1proton
signal for the GlcNAc residue on the a1-3branch is partially
resolved giving rise to the upfield doublet (J1,2= 8.1 Hz) at
4.573 ppm. Signal assignments for these resonances were
made based on previously reported data for glycopeptides in
which the anomeric protons for the peripheral GlcNAc residues have been resolved (17). In contrast, oligosaccharide 4,

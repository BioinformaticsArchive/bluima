Second messenger systems
Consistent with previous reports that cAMP and PKA are necessary for spontaneous activity of LC neurons (Alreja and Aghajanian, 1991, 1995), intracellular administration of the cAMP an-tagonist/PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMP-S and the PKA inhibitor H89
both reduced the spontaneous discharge rate of LC neurons.
However, only Rp-cAMP-S prevented the CRH-evoked activation of LC neurons. Both compounds, which have comparable
molecular weights, were applied intracellularly through the re-cording electrode at sufficient concentrations ( 400-fold and
1000-fold Ki for Rp-cAMP-S and H89, respectively) because they

depolarizing prepulses sped up the activation time course of
whole cell calcium channel currents after dialysis of GTP- -S in
the majority of 3 / DRG neurones (9 of 13), but no increase
of current amplitude was observed, and accordingly, there was
no shift in the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 7B). Thus, the
main difference between this group of 3 / neurones and
wild type neurones is observed in the degree of prepulse facilitation of whole cell calcium currents (Fig. 8, A and B). This
observation is in line with previous studies, which showed that

absorption of groups V and VI antisera removed
the shared minor antigens, but did not diminish
the titers for the major antigens of the appropriate respective organisms.
Group VI consisted of 28 strains. Most of these
were from the human mouth, but four were
isolated from the intestinal tract of man. This
group was serologically identical with V. parvula
Te3, from Prevot. Homologous titers ranged
from 1:2,560 to 1:40,960, with a modal range of
1:5,120 to 1:10,240. The organisms in this group
generally reacted very weakly with group V
antisera at titers of 1:40 to 1:80; five strains
cross-reacted at 1:160 to 1:640, and one strain
at 1:1,280. The weak heterologous antigens of
group VI were easily absorbed from group V
antisera without loss of titer to homologous or-ganisms of gro3up V. It has already been mentioned that the weak cross-reactions of group V
cells were eliminated by absorbing group VI
antisera with group V cells without affecting the
homologous group VI titer.
Group VII consisted of three strains, ERN,
FIS, and National Collection of Type Cultures
(NCTC) 9816. The first two strains were isolated from the human mouth by Langford, Faber,
and Pelczar (1950). Strain 9816 was isolated
from the human respiratory tract by Hare et al.
(1952). High titers (1:10,240 to 1:20,480) were
generally obtained with homologous sera. Cells
of group IV were negative in about one-third of
the tests, but in the remaining trials cross-reacted
with group VII antisera at relatively low titers
(1:80 to 1:1,280). Cells of group VII behaved
similarly toward group IV antisera. Reciprocal
heterologous absorptions of group IV and VII
antisera were easily accomplished, however, and
the major antigens in each case were found to be
distinctive.

rats and was accompanied by the release of bioactive
IL-1β in the extracellular fluid (29, 32). However, no
IL-1-like activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of LPStreated rats was detected by other authors (4, 31). The
sensitivity of the technique used for measuring IL-1β is
likely to be critical, since the levels of IL-1β that occur
in the brain in response to peripheral LPS treatment
are very low.
In the present study we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to accurately determine relative amounts of transcripts. The validity of this technique was first checked
to confirm the lack of a plateau amplification of the
internal standard (pMus3) and cDNA and to ensure
that β2-microglobulin mRNA levels remained stable in
hypothalamus of mice injected systematically with
LPS. Because this was the case, the results were
expressed as the ratio of cytokine amplification to
β2-microglobulin × 100. As previously demonstrated,
intraperitoneal administration of LPS induced expression of cytokine mRNA in the hypothalamus of mice 1 h
after treatment (22). The basal expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the hypothalamus was relatively
high in the present study compared with our observations in previous studies (22, 23). This difference could
be due to a propagation of the cytokine signal induced
by implantation of the cannula into the brain (18, 35).
However, this possibility still needs to be checked by a
direct comparison of cytokine expression in the brain of
implanted and nonimplanted mice. Despite this in-crease in basal levels of cytokines, exogenous injection
of IL-1ra in the lateral ventricle of the brain was able to
fully block the LPS-induced expression of IL-1β, TNF-α,
and IL-6 mRNAs. Contradictory data have been re-ported concerning the effect of intracerebroventricular
IL-1ra on LPS-induced IL-6 protein (1, 24). In the rat,
Luheshi et al. (24) could not detect any effect of
intracerebroventricularly injected IL-1ra on LPSinduced IL-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas it was
blocked in the cat (1). In both studies, IL-6 was
measured by ELISA. Inasmuch as more cerebrospinal
fluid can be collected from the brain of a cat than from
the brain of a rat, it might be easier to pick up
significant differences due to IL-1ra in the cat than in
the rat.
In terms of mechanisms of action, IL-1ra binds to
both types of IL-1 receptors: type I (IL-1RI), which is
the active receptor, and type II (IL-1RII), which acts as
a decoy target for IL-1 (2, 5). IL-1ra abrogates the effect
of IL-1 on its receptors by preventing the formation of
the complex IL-1RI–IL-1–IL-1R accessory protein,
which is thought to be the transducing receptor complex (14, 34). Although these data have been obtained
in peripheral immune and nonimmune cells, there is
evidence that brain cells also express IL-1RI, IL-1RII,
and IL-1RacP that do not differ from peripheral IL-1
receptor subtypes (10, 12, 17) and that the in vivo
effects of IL-1 in the brain are mediated by IL-1RI (6,
30) and its accessory protein (unpublished observation), whereas the brain IL-1RII downregulates the
effects of IL-1 (7).

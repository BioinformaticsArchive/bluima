tionship between sound pressure level and basilar-membrane motion,
pointing out the two characteristic response segments: a linear growth at
low levels, followed, above a certain breakpoint, by a compressive growth.
This mechanical input is common to all three model fibers. A value of 0.2,
commonly encountered in the guinea pig (Yates et al., 1990), has been
chosen for the exponent of the slope of the compressive segment (equal
to parameter A4 in Equation 1) in this example. B, Relationship between
basilar-membrane motion and neural discharge rate. The three curves
represent examples that differ in their sensitivity and spontaneous discharge rate in a way typically found in mammals, i.e., the most sensitive
fiber has the highest spontaneous rate. They are labeled according to the
shape of rate –intensity f unction that will result. C, Neural rate –intensity
f unctions (solid curves), i.e., the relationship between sound pressure level
and discharge rate. The three curves result from the combination of the
inputs shown in A and B. The dashed lines illustrate different parameters
used in the model, according to Equations 1 and 2. The parameters A1
(maximal rate) and A3 (breakpoint) are common to all three model fibers
in this example; A0 (spontaneous rate) and A2 (half-maximum point) are
only indicated for the flat– saturating curve to avoid conf usion.

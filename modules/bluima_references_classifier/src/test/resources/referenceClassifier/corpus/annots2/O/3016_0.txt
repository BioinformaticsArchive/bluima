cDNA sequence (Fig. 2) and since the subunit size determined
by SDS-PAGE is very close to the calculated molecular mass of
26,923 Da, it is apparent that the cloned cDNA encodes a novel
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from human brain.
Structure and Organization of the Human Short Chain L-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Geneâ€”Before the human
genomic library was screened with a cDNA fragment of the
dehydrogenase, the GenBank Data Bank was searched with
the Advance Blast program (25) using the human brain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase cDNA sequence as a query
sequence. A match with gaps was fortunately found in the
human chromosome region Xp11.2. The nucleotide sequence of
this 130-kb DNA segment was determined as part of the chromosome X project at the Sanger Center (Hinxton, United Kingdom) and has been submitted by D. Grafham to the GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank (accession no. Z97054). However, it
was not known that this piece of DNA contains the human
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene. The exon locations
were determined by closely scrutinizing the nucleotide se-quence in the particular region where the human short chain
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene was mapped. All
exon-intron junctions conform to the GT-AG rule (26) (Fig. 2). It
was thus found that the direction of transcription of this gene
is opposite to that of the KIAA0178 gene and the DNA-binding
protein gene, which flank the gene of interest. The human
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene spans ;4 kb and
consists of six exons and five introns (Fig. 3). The N-terminal
amino acid sequence of the gene product was determined by
Edman degradation. The results demonstrated that the first

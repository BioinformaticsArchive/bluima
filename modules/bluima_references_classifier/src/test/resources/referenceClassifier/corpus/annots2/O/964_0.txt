some of the analgesic action of COX-2 inhibitors, whether
selective or not, is central (Hay et al., 1997; Yamamoto and
Nozaki-Taguchi, 1997; Samad et al., 2001; Tegeder et al.,
2001a; Yaksh et al., 2001).
COX-2 levels in the dorsal spinal cord have been re-ported to increase following a L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation
(Zhao et al., 2000) and intrathecal (Zhao et al., 2000) or
local injection (Syriatowicz et al., 1999) of nonselective or
selective COX-2 inhibitors were found to prevent the de-velopment of allodynia, or provide relief from mechanical
hyperalgesia resulting from nerve injury. These data have
been interpreted as indicating that spinal COX-2 may play
a role in the development of hypersensitivity in animal
models of neuropathic pain. The present study was undertaken to determine if COX-2 plays a role in the spared
nerve injury model (SNI) of partial nerve injury pain (De-costerd and Woolf, 2000). This model involves the tight
ligation and transection of the tibial and common peroneal
branches of the sciatic nerve while sparing the sural nerve.
The resulting behavioral sensitivity is robust, with nearly all
animals being responders, and long-lasting, with mechanical allodynia thresholds remaining lower than control levels for at least 6 months.

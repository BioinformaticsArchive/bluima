creased transmission of nociceptive signals. Supraspinal actions of these drugs probably add to their
analgesic effects (14).
There are thus reasons to believe that spinal aZ-adrenoceptor agonists might be useful in the treatment of severe pain. Before introducing such compounds into clinical use, potential adverse effects
should be carefully studied. The present investigation
is one in a series of experiments designed to analyze
the possibilities and limitations of a,-adrenoceptor ag-onists in the treatment of severe pain (15-18). In this
study, using a rat model, daily intrathecal injections
of clonidine and guanfacine were given under controlled circumstances and possible spinal neurotoxicity investigated by light and electron microscopy.

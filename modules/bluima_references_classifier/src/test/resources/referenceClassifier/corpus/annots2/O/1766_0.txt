We initially hypothesized that during the normal period of
synaptogenesis, numbers of excitatory inputs to PMG cells
would be increased over control levels. To determine
whether the number of functional synapses was changing
during the ages examined (P7â€“P11), we separated the results
by survival age. Surprisingly, for control cells, neither
sEPSCs nor mEPSCs increased in frequency with age during
this period (Fig. 4A, one-way ANOVAs, NS). The sEPSC
frequency showed a relatively stable mean from 1.5 0.4 at
P7 to 2.1 0.6 Hz at P11. In contrast for PMG cells, the
frequency of sEPSCs significantly increased with age from
0.9 0.1 at P7 to 4.8 1.1 Hz at P11 (Fig. 4A, one-way
ANOVA, P 0.05).
The sEPSC frequency for control and PMG groups (experimental condition) were compared over this age range with a
two-way ANOVA. Age and experimental condition showed

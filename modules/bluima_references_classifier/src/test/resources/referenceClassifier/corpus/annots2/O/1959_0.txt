ROCKII / mice develop with
impaired motor function
On an outbred strain background,
ROCKII / mice are born at close to
Mendelian ratios and most survive to
adulthood. Brain and spinal cord tissue
from adult ROCKII / mice shows no
detectable ROCKII protein expression by
immunoblot (Fig. 1). Trace levels of
ROCKI protein are present in the adult
CNS but are not upregulated in
ROCKII / samples (Fig. 1). Gross ex- amination reveals malformation of digits

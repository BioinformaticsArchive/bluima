Fig. 1. Cdc25B immunoreactivity in neurons of human brain. Sections of hippocampus obtained at autopsy from AD (A, B),
age-matched controls (C, D, G), and sections of temporal cortex taken from younger non-AD individuals at biopsy (E, F)
were immunostained with antibody speci¢c for human Cdc25B. E, F, and G are 4% paraformaldehyde-¢xed, vibratome sections of biopsy and autopsy brain from non-demented individuals stained with Cdc25B antibodies. In the ¢gure, the same
case is presented at lower magni¢cation (A, C, E) to show the pattern and extent of neuronal staining, and at higher power
to show the subcellular localization of the protein in neurons. With the exception of the biopsy samples that are from temporal lobe, most of the images shown are from the CA1 region of hippocampus. H shows widespread staining with the Cdc25B
antibody from Pharmingen and neurons of adult mouse brain. The inset at 50U magni¢cation shows clearly the presence of
Cdc25B immunoreactivity in the neuronal cytoplasm. Scale bars = 250 Wm (A, C, E, H) ; 80 Wm (B, D, F, G).

pain and autonomic dysreflexia) (Romero et al., 2000; Cameron
et al., 2006) or diverge to coactivate both motor inhibitory and
excitatory circuits to reduce overall functional recovery.
During spinal cord development, sensory axons bypass inappropriate lamina and project directly to their target lamina
(Ozaki and Snider, 1997; Sharma and Frank, 1998) in which they
establish lamina-restricted synaptic terminals (Sanes and Yamagata, 1999). For TrkA-positive (peptidergic nociceptive) axons,
entry into the spinal cord and projection into laminas I and II
correlate with the ventral migration of a chemorepulsive gradient
established by semaphorin 3A expression (Fitzgerald et al., 1993;
Messersmith et al., 1995; Wright and Snider, 1995; Puschel et al.,
1996; Fu et al., 2000). In the embryo, as fibers enter and begin to
form arbors, semaphorin 3A expression extends high into the
dorsal horn. During this period, the addition of exogenous NGF
has little effect on their ventral-mediated growth. As sensory axon
growth continues, the semaphorin 3A gradient migrates ventrally, and, at these early postnatal time points, exogenous NGF
increases growth over dorsal as well as ventral regions (Redmond
et al., 1997). This alteration in NGF sensitivity to elicit axon
growth throughout the dorsal and ventral horns correlates with
the dorsal reduction in semaphorin 3A expression, which in the
adult persists only in motor neurons (Puschel et al., 1996; Pasterkamp et al., 2000). Thus, semaphorin 3A has the ability to
modulate NGF-induced axon growth even during development.
In the present study, the production of opposing guidance cue
gradients were used to target the regeneration of primary peptidergic
nociceptive axons to their dorsal lamina. Dorsal expression of NGF
was used to induce regeneration of nociceptive axons into the spinal
cord; however, as demonstrated in previous studies, these axons fail
to terminate in their normal targets and continue to extend throughout the entire dorsal horn and, in some cases, extend into the ventral
horn as well (Romero et al., 2001). To restrict these axons from
regenerating into the deeper dorsal or ventral horns, semaphorin 3A
was expressed within the ventral horn. It is proposed that this molecule produces a gradient for repulsion to commence (Kolodkin
1996; Nakamura et al., 2000). Although the extent of the gradient
was difficult to quantify by immunofluorescence, the genetic
method for cellular expression of these factors would provide a lo-calized production source, and the secretion of either NGF or
Sema3A would necessitate the production of a gradient extending
outward from the local source of production (Cao and Shoichet,
2003; Heron et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2006). Our results with NGF/
Sema3A-treated rats suggest that regenerating axons encountered a
permissive environment (provided by NGF) within the superficial
layers of the dorsal horn and then stop in contact with Sema3A, in
which the overall signal becomes inhibitory. The pattern of adult
CGRP-positive axons terminating growth at the dorsal aspect of the
Sema3A gradient appear almost identical to the developmental patterning of TrkA-positive axons encountering Sema3A in the chick
embryo (Shepherd et al., 1997; Fu et al., 2000). Likewise, this patterning led to a regional distribution of synapses for regenerating nociceptive axons that were primarily confined to laminas I and II. This
matched the synaptic distribution of these axons in the normal cord,
although at a significantly lower density. Expression of NGF alone
led to a dramatically different synaptic patterning that was more
evenly distributed throughout all laminas within the dorsal horn.
Retrograde track tracing experiments also demonstrated that co-expression of semaphorin resulted in a 40% reduction in the
total number of regenerating nociceptive axons when compared
with NGF but no reduction in functional recovery. This is in
contrast to our previous studies that show that similar reductions
in nontargeted regenerating nociceptive axons result in a sub-

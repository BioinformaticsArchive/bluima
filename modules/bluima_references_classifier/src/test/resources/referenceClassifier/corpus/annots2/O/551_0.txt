sient lymphopenia, the degree of lymphocyte depletion was
significantly greater in H5N1-infected animals (P 0.001).
While both H5N1 viruses were isolated from lungs on day
3 p.i., infection with only one of the H3N2 viruses (Panama/99)
yielded virus from the lungs on day 3 p.i. Histopathologic
features found in the lungs of H3N2-infected animals included
bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia but were substantially
less severe than those detected in H5N1-infected animals (data
not shown). To our surprise, virus was isolated from the brains
of ferrets infected with either H3N2 virus, as well as from the
H5N1-infected animals, as presented earlier. However, none
of the H3N2-infected ferrets showed any neurological signs.
While virus was isolated from the spleen and intestine of
H5N1-infected ferrets, no virus was detected in these organs
from H3N2-infected animals. Taken together, these results
suggest that infection of ferrets with the H5N1 viruses caused
substantially more severe clinical disease, despite the less-efficient replication of these viruses in the upper respiratory tract
compared to H3N2 viruses.

In three healthy gravidas at 38 and
39 weeks gestation, fetal MR spectroscopy was performed with a
breath-hold technique by using the
following pulse sequences: single
voxel point-resolved spectroscopy,
or PRESS, for liver and heart studies
and stimulated-echo acquisition mode,
or STEAM, for brain studies. Signal
peaks of lipid from heart and liver
were detected, as were the signal peaks
of choline, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate from fetal brain. Findings demonstrated the feasibility of performing proton MR spectroscopy to
assess mobile fetal structures.

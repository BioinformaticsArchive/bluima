Figure 12. One- and two-dimensional models illustrating possible effects of scanning velocity on RF geometry. The purpose of these models is to show
how inhibition can be delayed relative to excitation but result in either no shift of the center of inhibition relative to the center of excitation as scanning
velocity varies (as in A) or only a minimal shift (as in B). The illustrative models assume inhibition whose origins on the skin overlap the region giving
rise to excitation perfectly but whose effect is delayed by 20 msec relative to the excitation. Profiles above (below) the line in each panel represent profiles
of excitation (inhibition). The horizontal axis in each panel represents the location on the skin surface where the excitation or inhibition appears to have
arisen. When the stimulus moves at a constant velocity and there is an unknown delay between the stimulus event on the skin and the effect on the
neuronal discharge, then the effect appears to have arisen from a location that is displaced from the true location by an amount proportional to the delay
and the scanning velocity (see Appendix A). When the delay to inhibition is 20 msec greater than the delay to excitation, then the skin region giving rise
to inhibition appears to be displaced by 0.02*velocity mm relative to the apparent location of the excitation (0.4 mm at 20 mm/sec, 1.6 mm at 80 mm/sec).
A, The top row illustrates this effect at scanning velocities of 20 and 80 mm/sec in both the proximal and distal scanning directions. The second row
illustrates the net effect (i.e., the observed RF) after accounting for the canceling effects of overlapping excitation and inhibition (assumed to be additive).
Rectangular profiles, 3 mm wide, are illustrated for simplicity. Note how the offset between the observed centers of excitation and inhibition is unaffected
by changes in scanning velocity (compare Fig. 8) and how the observed excitatory and inhibitory volumes (masses) increase in intensity (compare Fig.
9). B, Same effects with Gaussian excitatory and inhibitory profiles meant to simulate more closely the RF profiles observed in this study. The inhibitory
peak value is 10% less than the excitatory peak value, but its width is increased relative to the excitatory width so that they have equal mass. As in the
simpler case illustrated above, the relative displacement between observed excitation and inhibition is affected little by changes in scanning velocity, and
both excitation and inhibition become more intense with increasing velocity. C, Gray scale plots of the RFs that would be observed in B. The correlation
of the RFs illustrated at 20 and 80 mm/sec is 0.95. The offset of the inhibition from the excitation is 2.3 mm at both 20 and 80 mm/sec, indicating apparent
synchrony with the excitation (compare Fig. 8), whereas the actual relative delay was 20 msec.

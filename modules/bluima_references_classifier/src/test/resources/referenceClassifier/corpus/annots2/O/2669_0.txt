higher frequency is displayed on a faster time scale. It therefore seems to have the same number of cycles and the stimulus artifacts are similarly spaced. This mode of presentation
clearly shows that a stronger synchronizing effect was in-duced by the ~-HZ oscillations where the time of the peaks
of the responses extended over a period of 8 ms (right bar in
Fig. 3A ) , whereas the input signals covered a range of 60 ms
(left bar in Fig. 3A ) . At a frequency of 8 Hz, on the other
hand, the peaks of the responses extended over a period of
28 ms (right bar in Fig. 3 B), which is only slightly less than
the relative period covered by the input signal (30 ms; left
bar in Fig. 3 B). This difference implies that the stronger
synchronizing effect of the ~-HZ oscillations is a result of
larger shifts in the delays between the stimuli and the re-sponses.
A more quantitative description is shown in Figure 3,
C-F. To reveal the effects of the sine wave on the delay of
the synaptic responses, the sine wave responses were subtracted from the integrated responses, and the delays were
plotted as a function of the input phases (Fig. 3, C and D).
Analyzing the delay of the responses revealed that at 4 Hz
the delays change over a range of close to 80 ms (Fig. 3C)
with a strong dependence on the input phase. At a frequency of 8 Hz, on the other hand, the delays are loosely
dependent on the input phases and vary over a range of
only 40 ms (Fig. 3D).
Synchronization is accompanied by shifts in the delay,
although the existence of such shifts does not necessarily
imply a synchronizing effect. It should be demonstrated
that the output phase is at least partially independent of the
exact time of input. Indeed, at 4 Hz (Fig. 3 E) most of the
outputs occur around a phase of r/ 2, independent of the
input phases. At the higher frequency the output depends
on the input phase and the period within the cycle where
the output is independent of the input is completely missing (Fig. 3F). These results clearly show that both the delay
and the phase relations measured at 4 Hz are consistent
with a stronger synchronizing effect of this frequency.
The ability to synchronize synaptic input was found in all
neurons ( yt = 9). Because a method to compare this ability
is not yet formulated, we used the extent of the change in
the delay to quantify this property. All the neurons showed
an ability to change the delay of the synaptic input, as a
function of the phase. The delay of the synaptic responses
(as measured after subtracting the sine wave) could be
changed by up to a factor of four. In six experiments an
average factor of 2.2 t 1.1 was calculated. In all cells the
ability to change the synaptic delay was a function of the
frequency and amplitude of the imposed oscillation.
The ability of spontaneously occurring oscillations to synchronize synaptic input was examined in three experiments
where two conditions were met: I ) the neuron displayed
spontaneous oscillations, and 2) synaptic potentials could
be evoked at low stimulus intensities that did not interfere
with the generation of the spontaneous oscillation [usually,
evoked synaptic potentials reset or even abolished the spontaneous subthreshold oscillations (Llinas and Yarom
1986)]. The results are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. In this
case the spontaneous oscillations had an amplitude of 2-3
mV and a frequency of 4 Hz (Fig. 4A). The stimuli were
delivered at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and thus the responses

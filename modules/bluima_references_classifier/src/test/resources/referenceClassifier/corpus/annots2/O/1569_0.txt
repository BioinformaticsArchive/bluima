Fig. 4. Dose-response study for CBZ microinjected into the VB in GAERS:
mean percent time in seizure ( S.E.) over a 90-min EEG recording
following bilateral microinjection of CBZ at 0.1, 0.4, and 0.75 g in 0.2 l
compared with vehicle alone and with the baseline (predrug injection)
recording. Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant effect
of the treatments (n 3, p 0.005), with the increase in percent time in
seizure after the 0.75- g dose of CBZ ( , p 0.005) compared with vehicle
alone.

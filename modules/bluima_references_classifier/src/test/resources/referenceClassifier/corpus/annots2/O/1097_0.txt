related to P. a, Regression map in SPM-derived T scores thresholded at p 0.005 (uncorrected)
and superimposed on the average structural image. Color bar shows the strength of the correlation with P. Axial view with associated z coordinates is shown; left hemisphere is shown on the

and probabilities.

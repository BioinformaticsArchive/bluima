animals. We first isolated PSDs from bilateral hippocampi of
fear-conditioned animals and sham-trained controls using
standard subcellular fractionation methods (60 â€“ 68) 5 min
after fear-conditioning training. We then performed quantitative immunoblots for phosphorylated Ser-831 and Ser-845 as
before. A significant increase in Ser-831 phosphorylation relative to total GluR1 was observed in PSDs isolated from fearconditioned animals compared with sham-trained controls
(Fig. 5). Again, no measurable change was observed in Ser-845
phosphorylation (Fig. 5) or total GluR1 phosphorylation (normalized to actin, p 0.69, n 12; normalized to control total
GluR1 only, p 0.27, n 12; not shown). Thus, the increase in
GluR1 phosphorylation in the hippocampus during learning
occurs at synaptic GluR1 subunits.
GluR1-containing AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the
hippocampus are thought to predominantly exist in heteromeric complexes with GluR2. Thus, we asked whether the
increase in GluR1 phosphorylation occurs on GluR1 subunits
after immunoprecipitation with GluR2 antibodies. We immunoprecipitated GluR2 from hippocampal homogenates of fearconditioned and sham-trained controls 5 min after fear-conditioning training. Quantitative immunoblots of the resulting
GluR2 immunoprecipitates were then performed with phosphorylated GluR1 Ser-831 and Ser-845 antibodies as before. A

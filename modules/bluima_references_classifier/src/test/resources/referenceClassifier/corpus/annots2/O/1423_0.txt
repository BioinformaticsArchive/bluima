(Fig. 1). This effect was more pronounced after 4 hr
than after 1 hr (increase of 39% vs. 94%; Fig. 2). We
detected peroxidase precipitate distributed throughout
the cytoplasm of the immunopositive neurons (Fig. 1B,D).
We observed numerous strongly labeled processes, especially in the dorsal part of the SON.
After in situ hybridization, we found that the level
of the Gal radioactive probe (optical density) in the
SON was increased slightly after 1 hr of incubation with
noradrenaline (100.00 6 5.16 vs. 122.59 6 5.36; Figs.
3A,B, 4), whereas, after 4 hr of incubation, the level of
Gal mRNA was double that in the control slices (104.50
6 8.87 vs. 186.25 6 7.14; Figs. 3C,D, 4).

the post-L FS period as in some hippocampal neurons (Dudek
and Bear, 1992; Mulkey and Malenka, 1992), it is highly unlikely
that STD could be induced in type I cells in this manner. By
comparison of the post-LFS responses in neurons with and without such pharmacological treatments (compare Figs. 3 and 5),
therefore, it appears most likely that the neuronal groups showing
rapid recovery or STD under D-APV or EGTA were associated
with type I and type II behaviors, respectively.

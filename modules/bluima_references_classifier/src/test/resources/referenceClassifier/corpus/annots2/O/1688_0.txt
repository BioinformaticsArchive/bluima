Fig. 5. Concentric segregation disambiguates the nitric oxide (NO) volume signal. The graphs show how frequently a particular peak NO concentration is
encountered by the NO-sensitive Kenyon cell axons if their entire population is considered. The different graphs correspond to the simultaneous activation of
different percentages of the NO source fibres. The graphs thus show, for different percentages of active sources, the predicted distribution of peak NO concentrations
experienced by the targets. The salt-and-pepper architecture (left) results in much broader distributions than the centre-surround architecture (right). For example, in a
salt-and-pepper architecture, activation of 1 and 2.5% of the sources yields overlapping peak concentrations at the targets (over 5% overlap between distributions,
corresponding to a likelihood of more than 5% that the signal will be misinterpreted). In contrast, with concentric segregation, with activation of 0.25 and 0.5% or 2.0
and 2.5% of the sources there is very little overlap between the distributions (less than 5% in all cases).

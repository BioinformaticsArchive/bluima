Fig. 3. Early DTH lesion. (A, B) Relatively intact myelin sheaths are separated from the axons by
processes filled with myelin debris. (C) Demyelination at the edge of a lesion in the corpus callosum; one
side of an axon is completely demyelinated, whereas the other (arrowhead) shows the remnants of a very
thin layer of myelin. Scale bars=0.5 μm (A, B), 1 μm (C).

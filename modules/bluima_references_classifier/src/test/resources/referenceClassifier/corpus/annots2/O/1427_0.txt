Focusing the anova on the HERA model, a significant triple
interaction occurred (F1,18 = 8.418, P = 0.010). This finding is the
result of the HERA pattern in the sample drawn from the population
that received rTMS on the PFC (F1,9 = 23.65, P = 0.001), and of the
lack of such asymmetry in the PC-rTMS group (F1,9 = 0.165,
P = 0.694) (Fig. 3).
In control experiment 1, a close descriptive inspection of recognition performance in R-Ret showed more variable effects (i.e. higher
standard deviations of hitsâ€“false alarms) than that observed in the
PC-rTMS group (Table 2, Fig. 2). However, anova indicated that the
performance was significantly lower in the PC-rTMS-120% group

The animals were cared for throughout the experimental
procedures in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Nine Fischer 344 rats weighing 200 –250 g were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml/100 g body
weight of 25 mg/ml of xylazine and 2.5 mg/ml of ketamine.
Through a small burr hole, 9L cells (25000 in 2 l) were
stereotaxically implanted (17) into the forebrain of the
animal on the right side (3 mm lateral to bregma and 3 mm
deep). On the postimplantation days indicated, the animals were reanesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(40 mg/kg, i.p.). A cannula was placed in the femoral vein
to infuse anesthesia during MR procedures. The trachea
was exposed through a midline incision, and a tracheotomy was performed to maintain a patent airway. The rat
head was fixed with ear bars and taped to the coil and
cradle to avoid motion artifacts. Body temperature was
monitored and maintained at 37.5°C 0.5°C using a heating pad. During the MR experiments, a continuous infusion of dilute sodium pentobarbital in saline was infused
by infusion pump (15 mg/kg/hr, i.v.). At the end of the
study, the anesthetized rat was killed by an intravenous
injection of KCl, and the brain was then excised and sectioned. Histologic sections (10 thick) were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin.

number of previous studies that have investigated 5-HT6
receptor mRNA distribution in the rat brain by Northern blot
analysis (Monsma et al., 1993; Ruat et al., 1993) and in situ
hybridization (Ruat et al., 1993; Ward et al., 1995) and in
human brain regions by Northern blot analysis (Kohen et al.,
1996) and in situ hybridization (East et al., 2002). In keeping
with the radioligand binding studies, we could only detect
very low levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in mouse brain
regions using the sensitive and quantitative technique of
TaqMan RT-PCR and did not observe enrichment in the
striatum. The low level of expression of 5-HT6 receptors by
mice was not a strain-specific phenomena, because we ob-tained identical results from two distinct strains of mice,
C57/Bl6 and CD-1 (data not shown).
These results clearly demonstrate that the mouse is unique
compared with rat, pig, and human, all of whom express
relatively high levels of 5-HT6 receptors, especially in the
striatum (Hirst et al., 2000). Although the direct physiological implications of this are currently unknown, it does suggest that mice are not an ideal species in which to conduct
behavioral or physiological experiments pertaining to 5-HT6
receptor function. Interestingly, a 5-HT6 receptor knockout
mouse has been generated in which a preliminary report
described increased anxiety in these animals (Tecott et al.,
1998). However, more recent studies have failed to demonstrate anxiogenic effects of selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists in rats (Bentley et al., 1999; Routledge et al., 2000;
Stean et al., 2002), making the interpretation of the knockout
studies rather difficult.
Despite the low level of expression, the mouse receptor was
cloned without difficulty using standard protocols, and the
sequence we obtained was identical with that reported previously (Kohen et al., 2001). Transient expression in HEK
293 cells allowed us to investigate the pharmacological profile of the receptor, which was not undertaken previously by
Kohen et al. (2001). Surprisingly, considering the high degree
of sequence homology between rat and mouse 5-HT6 receptors, in the present study we obtained a distinct pharmaco-

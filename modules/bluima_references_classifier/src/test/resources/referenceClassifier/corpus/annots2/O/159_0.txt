N-[3-(2*,4*-DICHLOROPHENOXY)-2-18F-FLUOROPROPYL]-N-METHYLPROPARGYLAMINE (18F-FLUOROCLORGYLINE, 18F-4). Aqueous
18F-fluoride (10 –100 mCi) was treated with potassium carbonate
(0.34 mg) and Kryptofix (1.88 mg) in a Pyrex round-bottomed flask.
The mixture was dried by heating at 85–90°C under a stream of
nitrogen. Last traces of water were removed azeotropically with
acetonitrile (1–2 mL). Into this dried Kryptofix-K18F complex, a
solution (2 mg in 200 μL of acetonitrile) of N-[3-(2',4'-dichlorophenoxy)-2-mesyloxypropyl]-N-methylpropargylamine was added,
and this mixture was refluxed at 80 – 85°C. After 20 min, the
acetonitrile in the mixture was dried under nitrogen and the residue
was taken up in methanol. This methanolic solution was passed
through a mini-column of neutral alumina, followed by washing the
alumina with methanol. The methanolic eluate was evaporated to
near dryness and the residue taken up in 60% methanol/40% buffer
(<1 mL) and injected into the HPLC. Separation was carried out
on an Alltech C18 column, using gradient elution with 0.01 M
phosphoric acid and acetonitrile (95% 0.01 M phosphoric acid and
5% acetonitrile at 0 min, flow rate of 3 mL/min to 5% 0.01 M
phosphoric acid and 60% acetonitrile at 20 min, flow rate of
3 mL/min). The retention time of the radiotracer, N-[3-(2',4'-dichlorophenoxy)-2-18F-fluoropropyl]-N-methylpropargylamine
(18F-fluoroclorgyline) was 16.2 min, whereas that of the mesylate
precursor was approximately 17.5 min (Fig. 3). The yields varied
between 15% and 20% (decay-corrected) in several experiments
with a radiochemical purity >95%.
To determine specific activity of 18F-fluoroclorgyline, the fraction collected between 15.6 and 16.5 min (containing the majority
of the radioactive peak eluting at 16.2 min, as seen in Fig. 3) in the
first HPLC purification was reinjected under the same gradient
conditions for a second purification. A fraction between 15.6 and
16.5 min was collected to provide 18F-fluoroclorgyline and all the
mass associated with this peak was assumed to be that of 18Ffluoroclorgyline for purposes of computing specific activity. This
mass peak was compared with standard fluoroclorgyline injections.

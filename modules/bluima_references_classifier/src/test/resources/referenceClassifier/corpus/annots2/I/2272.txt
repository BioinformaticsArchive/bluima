region of the heart most metabolically effected by local
cardio-cardiac reflexes involving afferent axons in the
left thoracic vagus. These results further support recent
research demonstrating that thoracic autonomic ganglia
are not just the loci of efferent synapses but that these
ganglia may have an integrative role in the processing of
afferent information from specific local cardio-cardiac
reflexes.

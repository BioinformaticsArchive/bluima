less degree in both the old-WT and old-KO animals
(less than 2-fold). Spot h was heavily oxidized in both
young-KO and old-KO mice (11- to 13-fold), but its
level of oxidation was increased less than 3-fold in oldWT animals. The levels of oxidation of the remaining
proteins (g, y, q, u, A, and D) were increased 3- to 10-fold in young-KO, 5- to 10-fold in old-WT, and 4- to
14-fold in old ApoE-KO animals.

Identification of individual oxidized proteins

For protein identification of individual protein spots
on 2-DE, these spots in Fig. 2 were excised from the gel,
digested in situ with trypsin, and analyzed by mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS and capillary-HPLC –
ESI/MS/MS). Spots a, h, g, y q, and D were identified
as glial fibrillary acidic protein, creatine kinase BB,
glucose-regulated protein (Erp61, disulfide isomerase),
chaperonin subunit 5, dihydropyrimidase-related protein
2, and mortalin. Spot u was also found to be dihydropyrimidase-related protein 2 (Table 2). The mass spectrum
of the tryptic peptide corresponding to residues 375 – 390
of dihydroprimidase-related protein 2 revealed one me-thionine residue at amino acid position 375, which was
oxidized and identified as methionine sulfoxide.

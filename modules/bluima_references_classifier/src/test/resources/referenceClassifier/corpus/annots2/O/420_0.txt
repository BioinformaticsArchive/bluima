IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL PROCEDURE
The affinity-purified antibody against HCNP was prepared as
described before (Ojika et al., 1992), and stored at ¡40– C. Its
immunocytochemical specificity was established in an earlier study (Katada et al., 1996). As shown previously, the
antibody employed in this study specifically recognizes the
21-kDa HCNP precursor protein (Tohdoh et al., 1995) in western blot analysis, whereas the 1.1-kDa HCNP proper is not
detected because of its low binding to the transfer membrane
(Ojika et al., 1995). On the other hand, in radioimmunoassay
this antibody reacts with HCNP proper, but not with its precursor protein (Ojika et al., 1995). Hence these observations
suggest that we cannot distinguish at present whether the
anti-HCNP antibody reacts with HCNP proper or its precursor protein, or both. Immunostaining was carried out using
the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method exactly as recommended by the manufacturer (SAB kit; Nichirei Laboratory,
Japan). Briefly, the sections were incubated through the following sequence (the temperature being kept at 4– C unless
otherwise stated): 1 h with 10% normal goat serum at room
temperature, 3 £ 30 min rinses, overnight with the affinitypurified anti-HCNP antibody diluted to 1 : 100 in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin,
3 £ 30 min rinses, overnight in biotin-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG, 3 £ 30 min rinses, 1 h with 10% hydrogen peroxide
in PBS, 3 £ 30 min rinses, 2 h in peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at room temperature, and 3 £ 30 min rinses. Cold PBS
was used for all rinses. Following preincubation with 0.05%
3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetra HCl (DAB) dissolved in 0.05 M
Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, for 1 h in a dark room at 4– C, the tissue antigen was visualized by incubation with the same solution containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room
temperature. Immunoreactive products could be examined
by light microscopy at this stage. Control experiments were
performed to establish immunostaining specificity. These in-cluded the incubation of sections either with anti-HCNP antibody preabsorbed using an excess of synthetic HCNP or with
non-immune rabbit serum (diluted to 1 : 100 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin). For the immunohistochemical
detection of ChAT, deparaffinized tissue sections were incubated through the following sequence (the temperature being
kept at 4– C unless otherwise stated): 15 min with 10% normal
swine serum at room temperature, 3 £ 30 min rinses, 24 h
in polyclonal ChAT antiserum derived from goat (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA) diluted to 1 : 100 in PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin, 3 £ 30 min rinses, 4 h in biotin-conjugated
swine anti-goat IgG (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
diluted to 1 : 1000 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 3 £ 30 min rinses, 1 h with 10% hydrogen peroxide in
PBS, 3 £ 30 min rinses, 30 min in peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at room temperature, and 3 £ 30 min rinses. Visualization of immunostaining for ChAT was carried out using
the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method as above.

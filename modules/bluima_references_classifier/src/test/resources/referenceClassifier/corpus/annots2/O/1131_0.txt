also dependent on hippocampal function (Stubley-Weatherly et al.,
1996; Izquierdo & Medina, 1997).
Thus Foxb1 mutant mice are impaired in some of the hippocampusdependent tasks (Barnes maze) but have no deficit in other
hippocampus-dependent tasks (contextual fear conditioning and social
transmission of food preference). This might be possible if learning
and memory in the Barnes maze depends on the participation of MB in
a neural circuitry, which is implicated in this task but not in the other
two. MTt links MB to the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATn), which
projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (Gonzalo-Ruiz et al., 1992).
This cerebral circuitry is known to be important for successful
performance in spatial tasks, including the Morris water maze (Kolb
et al., 1983; Sutherland et al., 1988; Granon & Poucet, 1995).
Moreover, lesion studies in rats have shown that the ATn and mPFC
play a crucial role in working memory (Granon et al., 1994; Boehm
et al., 1996; Byatt & Dalrymple-Alford, 1996; Kesner et al., 1996).
Therefore, we next investigated whether Foxb1 mutant mice have
impairment in working memory functions.
The results from spontaneous alternation and the eight-arm maze
tests indicate that Foxb1 mutants with lesions of MB and MTt are
indeed impaired in the spatial tasks involving working memory.
However, ablation of these brain structures in Foxb1– / – mice
obviously does not impair their ability to learn the spatial location
of baited arms, as shown in the reference memory task in the eight-arm
maze (Fig. 7B). That fact that Foxb1 mutants decrease the number of
working memory errors during training in the version of the radial arm
maze, when only four arms were baited (Fig. 7A), is explained by a
reduction in the number of appealing arms due to acquisition of
reference memory rather than by an improvement of their working
memory. At the beginning of the experiment mice visit both baited and
4 unbaited arms at random, but in the course of training animals from
both groups learned the spatial location of unbaited arms and stopped
visiting them. However, the Foxb1– / – mutants repeatedly visited
5 unbaited arms due to impairment of working memory. Because the
number of baited arms was half the total number of arms, improved
reference memory resulted in a simultaneous two-fold reduction in the
mean number of working memory errors (Fig. 7A).
Thus, our results showed that although MB and MTt were not
critical for the memorization of allocentric spatial information, they
were essential for behaviour that required extended navigation using
this spatial information (as in the Barnes maze). This conclusion is in
agreement with data showing that electrolytic lesions of MB in rats do
not disrupt learning in allocentric spatial conditional associative tasks
(Sziklas et al., 1996; Sziklas & Petrides, 2000), but do impair spatial
working memory in the radial arm (Saravis et al., 1990; Sziklas et al.,
1996; Neave et al., 1997) and performance in the spatial version of
the Morris water maze (Santin et al., 1999). Thus our results suggest
that the role of MB and MTt is restricted to a subset of spatial tasks
that rely on working memory to navigate to a memorized spatial
location.
Working memory is defined as the ability to retain and manipulate
mnemonic information to guide ongoing behaviour (Baddeley, 1986)
and consists of at least two important components. One is the shortterm storage of information regarding recent trials to make decisions
about future actions (Goldman-Rakic, 1995). Such retrospective
working memory is implicated in tasks dependent upon choices made
in previous trials (for instance, making choices of arms in spatial
alternation and radial-maze tests). This behaviour is obviously
impaired by the genetic ablation of MB and MTt (present study) as
well as by cytotoxic and electrolytic lesions of MB (Aggleton et al.,
1995; Sziklas et al., 1996), which constitutes evidence for the
implication of MB in this first component of working memory.

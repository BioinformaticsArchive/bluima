ber (N = 6) of units responded most strongly
to a relatively low concentration ( 10-4). Furthermore, no units showed a monotonic concentration-response curve. In the case of
CLT, however, units that responded best at
10-l were most frequent (six units). Three
units showed a somewhat monotonic relationship between the response intensity and
the odor concentration (dotted lines).

Control injections
Injections which failed to reach the subicular cortex and labeled, instead,
neurons in overlying neocortex did not result in the subsequent labeling of internal
capsule fibers seen following prosubicular injections. Following injections placed into
any subfield of the cornu ammonis at any level along its longitudinal axis no fibers
could be traced to the anterior thalamus, in addition, projections to the thalamus were
not observed from any component of the subicular complex situated within the ventral
hippocampal formation (Table I).

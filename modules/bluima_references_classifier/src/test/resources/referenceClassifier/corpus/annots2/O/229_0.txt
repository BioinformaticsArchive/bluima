DISCUSSION

It has been reported that the shortest pathways that link the
pyramidal tract to neck and forelimb motoneurons are disynaptic
whereas the connection to hindlimb motoneurons contains a monosynaptic component [1,3,7,8]. The present experiments demonstrate that the shortest path from the CST to tail motoneurons can
also be monosynaptic. However, the incidence of monosynaptic
EPSPs is as high as 30% for hindlimb motoneurons [8] and only
4% for tail motoneurons. It could be considered that monosynaptic
pathways control the motoneuronal activities directly by the CST
and are influenced by various afferent inputs. The most remarkable
feature of the effects of the CST on the tail motoneurons is that
36% (18/49) of responsive motoneurons produced EPSPs after a
single stimulation of the pyramidal tract, and most of the remainder produced PSPs after double-shock stimulation. In neck, forelimb and hindlimb motoneurons, there are few motoneurons which

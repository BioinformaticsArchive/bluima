As has been found by others (Strick, 1976b) VPLO contains cells discharging in
relation to movement. But it is noteworthy that only part of VPLo contained 'motor'
cells and the most caudal part of this nucleus was occupied by cells which also had
afferent input from peripheral zones. Movement related cells occupy most of the
body of VPLo giving way initially to a rim of deep 'sensory' cells and then to superficial 'sensory' cells. This afferent input to some cells in VPLo can be claimed to have
been established with confidence because of the conventions adopted in the Methods.
Only cells clearly within VPLO are included in this category.
Despite differences in cytoarchitecture between VL., VL, and VPLo, no un-equivocal differences could be detected in the natural discharge patterns of cells in
these nuclei in relation to movement performance by the animal.

sients, and advance for many millimeters as a sharp wave front
perpendicular to the pial surface, at speeds ranging between 50
and 300 Î¼m/sec. The expression of waves is restricted temporally to a brief period in postnatal development, until postnatal
day 6, and spatially to some neocortical areas. The ability of
isolated neocortical networks to generate large-scale patterned
activity endogenously during a period of massive neurite ex-tension and synaptogenesis raises the possibility that at least in
some cortical areas these processes might be influenced by
patterned neuronal firing generated independently of thalamocortical input.

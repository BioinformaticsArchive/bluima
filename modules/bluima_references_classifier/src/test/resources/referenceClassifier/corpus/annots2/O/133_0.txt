smaller compared with those of a 35-kg adult goat.
Although the neonate medulla is not as small as might
be anticipated, it is smaller than would be predicted by
calculations provided in this manuscript. The predicted
distance of the rostral pole of the XII nucleus from obex
in a 5-kg goat would be 2.85 mm, whereas the actual
distance in a 5-kg neonate goat is 2.4 mm. This
emphasizes the need for anatomic atlases appropriate
for the species and maturity of an animal.
Fixation and histological processing of the goat me-dulla influenced the dimensions of medullary landmarks, as determined from measurements of distances
between ventral surface cranial nerve landmarks in
vivo and after fixation and processing. Paraformaldehyde fixation and standard histological processing
caused a significant shrinkage of the brain stem in the
rostrocaudal plane, 19.5% for a 35-kg goat in the middle
of the weight range. This shrinkage requires that
target coordinates be adjusted by 1% for every 3.5-kg
increase or decrease from a 35-kg goat, on which the
present histological atlas was based. The variation in
the mediolateral plane was less, with the brain stem
shrinking 16.4% in the mediolateral direction for a goat
that weighed 35 kg. To correct the target coordinates,
this value should be adjusted by 1% for every 6-kg
change in body weight. The reason for the discrepancy
in fixation and/or processing shrinkage in the two
planes is not apparent, but it could be due to the
cytoarchitecture of the fiber tracts around the periphery of the medulla that may limit shrinkage in the
mediolateral plane. Furthermore, shrinkage may be
related to the columnar orientation in the rostrocaudal
plane of the majority of the neuronal groups and
central fiber tracts.
To effectively use the atlas that is presented in this
manuscript for precise stereotaxic location of medullary nuclei in the adult goat medulla, the following
three-step process should be followed. First, identify
the coordinates of the target location from Figs. 1â€“3;
second, correct the coordinates for variations in fixed
tissue that result from differences in body weight; and
finally, adjust the coordinates for the shrinkage that
occurs between in vivo and fixed conditions. The following example predicts, in one dimension, the distance of
the rostral pole of the X nucleus from obex in a 50-kg
goat. The distance for a 35-kg goat is identified from
this atlas as 6.0 mm. To correct for variation due to body
weight, the equation shown in the lower panel of Fig. 7
is employed, where y = 0.026x + 5.0; the calculated
distance of the rostral pole of the X nucleus from obex in
fixed tissue for a 50-kg goat is then 6.3 mm. Fixation
and/or processing shrinkage (FS) is then determined
for a 50-kg goat by using the equation shown in Fig. 8,
where y = 0.28x + 9.6, or 23.6% in this case. Finally, the
calculated value of target distance for fixed tissue is
multiplied by 1/1.0 - (FS/100), which, for this example,
is 6.3 (1/1.0 - 0.236) and equals 8.2 mm. Therefore, for
a 50-kg goat, the predicted distance from obex of the
rostral pole of the X nucleus in vivo is 8.2 mm. This
atlas can be used to obtain the coordinates for nuclei
other than those listed in Table 1. For example, to

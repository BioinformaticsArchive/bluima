Fig. 1. Maintenance of simultaneously expressed long-term
potentiation (LTP) and heterosynaptic long-term depression
(LTD) in the medial and lateral perforant paths. The protocols
used in this study generated decremental forms of LTP and
LTD. A through C, Average responses for each pathway
obtained for 15 days before and 15 days after high-frequency
stimulation (HFS). Filled circles, medial path responses; unfilled
circles, lateral path responses. HFS conditions were: A, 50
trains to the medial path, Med(50); B, 10 trains to the medial
path, Med(10); C, 50 trains to the lateral path, Lat(50). Inset in
B, schematic diagram of the separate stimulation of medial
(mpp) and lateral (lpp) perforant paths, as well as the field
potential recording in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The medial and lateral paths terminate on separate but adjacent zones
of the granule cell (gc) dendritic arbor. D, Scatterplot comparing LTP and LTD decay time constants across all groups shown
in A through C. The slope of the fitted regression line is near
unity, indicating that heterosynaptic LTD persists for as long as
LTP. Figures have been redrawn with permission from Abraham
and others (1994). EPSP = excitatory post synaptic potential.

The identification of mutations in the Tau gene in frontotemporal
dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) has made it possible to express human tau protein with
pathogenic mutations in transgenic animals. Here we report on
the production and characterization of a line of mice transgenic
for the 383 aa isoform of human tau with the P301S mutation.
At 5â€“6 months of age, homozygous animals from this line
developed a neurological phenotype dominated by a severe
paraparesis. According to light microscopy, many nerve cells in
brain and spinal cord were strongly immunoreactive for hyperphosphorylated tau. According to electron microscopy, abundant filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein were
present. The majority of filaments resembled the half-twisted
ribbons described previously in cases of FTDP-17, with a mi-nority of filaments resembling the paired helical filaments of

T
he occipital lobe is involved in many aspects of
visual function. '~3 The knowledge of its arterial supply is essential in understanding the syndromes occurring in occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Although several authors6"10 have described the
cortical (leptomeningeal) branches of the posterior ce-rebral artery (PCA), there is a lack of detailed information concerning the regions of supply of the individual
branches. The aim of this study was 1) to determine the
variability of theregionssupplied by individual occipital branches, and 2) to compare the anatomic data to
the neurologic deficits produced by occlusion of individual occipital arteries.

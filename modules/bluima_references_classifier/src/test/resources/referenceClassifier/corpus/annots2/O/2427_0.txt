especially steep near f = 1. The shortest in-terval (f = `/8) corresponds to 1.85 ms. This
is probably longer than the conventional re-fractory period (2 1). Shorter intervals were ex-plored with a two-shock paradigm. The first
shock was placed at f = Y2 and was suprathreshold. For both units, the threshold for
the second shock increased rapidly as the in-tershock interval was reduced below 1 ms and
a second action potential could not be evoked
when the interval reached 0.4 ms.
Anodal shocks were used to activate the
proximal axon and study its recovery properties. Such stimulation should result in an
inward (hyperpolarizing) current at the trigger
site and a balancing outward (depolarizing)
current more proximally (Fig. 4B). The action
potentials produced by anodal shocks are due
to this proximal depolarization rather than to
anodal-break excitation. This is indicated by
three facts: I) lengthening the anodal shock
did not increase the LP; 2) the LPs for anodal
shocks were always shorter, usually by 0.05-0.15 ms, than were cathodal LPs; and 3) in-hibitory head rotations that abolished cathodal
responses did not affect anodal responses. Figure 9B shows anodal recovery functions for

plex; Spo0A synthesis is autoregulated (27) and Spo0A regulates synthesis of proteins that control Spo0A activity by
controlling its phosphorylation (28). Amino acid substitutions
in Spo0A may also reduce its stability or prevent DNA binding.
To circumvent the complications of indirect effects on Spo0A
activity, we compared the ratio of spoIIG promoter activities
produced by wild-type and mutant forms of A in the presence
of a single form of Spo0A to the ratio of these activities in
strains containing a different form of Spo0A. In these genetic
experiments, activation of the spoIIG promoter by E221A mu-tant Spo0A was more efficient in combination with the R355A
mutant A than with the wild-type or R358A, R362A, or
S361A mutant forms of A (Fig. 3). Therefore, regardless of
any indirect effects that the E221A substitution in Spo0A may
have had on its function, the allele specificity of this effect is
consistent with the model that R355 of A interacts directly
with E221 of Spo0A during spoIIG promoter activation.
To explain the effects of the E221A and R355A substitutions, we note that an amino acid substitution in a position that
normally interacts directly with a ligand may have two types of
effects. First, the substitution may remove a favorable interaction with the ligand, and second, the substitution may introduce, directly or indirectly, an interfering or unfavorable interaction. We suggest that the E221 substitution in Spo0A does
both. It eliminates a favorable interaction with R355 in A. In
addition, the E221A substitution in Spo0A produces an unfavorable or interfering effect on Spo0A- A interaction because
the positive charge of R355 in A cannot be neutralized. Substitution of alanine for R355 in A eliminates the interfering
effect created by the E221A substitution in Spo0A, partially
restoring Spo0A- A interaction at the spoIIG promoter. However, the R355A substitution does not restore the favorable
interaction found between R355 of wild-type A and E221 of
wild-type Spo0A. Comparison of the absolute values of spoIIG
promoter activity in mutant and wild-type cells shows that the
R355A substitution does not fully suppress the effect of the
E221A substitution on promoter activity because it results in
only 40% of the promoter activity in wild-type cells (not
shown). Therefore, we suggest that the negative charge of
E221 in wild-type Spo0A is neutralized by R355 in wild-type
A during their interaction at the spoIIG promoter. There
appears to be little or no interaction of Spo0A E221 and the
residues R358, R362, and S361 of A. These genetic results
support our structure-based model for the interacting surfaces
of Spo0A and A at the spoIIG promoter.
Our discovery of a role for E221 of Spo0A in promoter
activation is somewhat surprising. All amino acid substitutions
in Spo0A that had previously been shown to play a role in
spoIIG promoter activation lie within -helix E of Spo0A.
E221 is located near but outside of -helix E in the C terminus
of the DNA recognition helix. The recognition helix of the
helix-turn-helix region in Spo0A is unusually long (3, 15). The
N-terminal amino acids of the recognition helix bind in the
major groove of the DNA (31). The C-terminal end of the
helix, including position 221, extends away from the DNA
where it could interact with region 4 of A. Therefore, this
position of E221 makes it unlikely that the E221A substitution
affects DNA binding by Spo0A. Furthermore, the E221A mu-tant Spo0A repressed expression of an abrB-lacZ fusion (data
not shown), an activity that requires DNA binding by Spo0A.

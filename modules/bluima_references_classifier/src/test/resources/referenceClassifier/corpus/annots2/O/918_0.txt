Discovering a new peptide is one thing; revealing its
function is quite another, mainly because no bioassay was
involved in the purification. IPNamide can be tested in well
established bioassays, but the complete absence of sequence
homology to known peptide families makes success rather
improbable. Whereas mass spectrometry can provide a clear
idea of how peptides are processed exactly, immunocytochemistry can show the precise distribution pattern, revealing
clues about the peptides' physiological function. The abundant immunoreactive material in both larval and adult CNS
suggests that IPNamide plays a rather important role(s) in
both stages of development. In addition, the complexity of
the immunoreactive projections implies that there may be
several sources of input causing release of IPNamide at
different sites. Comparing the immunoreactive pattern of
IPNamide with the data on the distribution of other
Drosophila neuropeptides described in literature, we found
a striking resemblance with the distribution pattern of
TPAEDFMRFamide (McCormick et al. 1999; Nichols et al.
1999b). In the larval CNS, 13 cells at similar positions with
projections towards the midline and encircling the oesophageal opening were stained with TPAEDFMRFamide antisera.
Moreover, an additional fourteenth cell in the first thoracic
ganglion was stained, although only in the third instar and
puparium stage (Nichols et al. 1999b). Faintly stained cells
without projections were found in the same regions, i.e. brain
lobes and suboesophageal ganglion. Furthermore, the same
complex arborization of projections was observed in the
adult brain, starting as a cross-like formation in the pupal

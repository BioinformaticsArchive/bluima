(Hume et al., 1983; Young and Poo, 1983), then a growing
GABAergic axon could potentially initiate communication with a
prospective postsynaptic target before establishment of a synapse.
It may be that the calcium-elevating actions of GABA constitute
a critical part of the early stages of synapse formation. Based on
data presented here, glutamate could theoretically inhibit this
communication either by inhibition of GABA release from the
developing axon or reduction of calcium influx into a potential
postsynaptic partner for the growing GABAergic axon.
Glutamate inhibition of the excitatory actions of GABA would
only occur during an early transient phase of neuronal development, but during this time period the inhibitory actions appear
robust. In this paper we found that in almost all neurons that
showed a greater calcium response to GABA than to glutamate,
that together, glutamate would reduce the amplitude of the
GABA-mediated calcium rise. We have previously shown that in
very early stages of development, the majority of neurons show a

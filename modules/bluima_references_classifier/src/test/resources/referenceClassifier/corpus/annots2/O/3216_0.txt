Figure 2. A, B, Photomicrographs of retrograde-labeled cells in the area ventralis of Tsai (AVT) after injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) in
the hippocampus and parahippocampalis. The small arrows indicate individual cells, and the larger arrows indicate groups of several cells. Note the cells
labeled in the nucleus of the basal optic root pars dorsalis (nBORd) and between stria of the third cranial nerve (III ). C, Retrograde-labeled cells in the
pretectum after iontophoretic injection of C TB in the AV T. The arrows indicate retrogradely labeled neurons, and the dotted lines show the boundaries
between the pretectal nuclei. GT, Griseum tectale; LMl/m, nucleus lentiformis mesencephali lateralis/medialis; LPC, nucleus (Figure legend continues)

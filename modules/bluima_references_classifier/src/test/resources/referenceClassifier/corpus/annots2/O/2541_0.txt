Figure 9. Cells from the E8 ciliary ganglion were cultured overnight and then stained with the FYN antibody. A-C are examples of FYN
immunoreactivity, and D-F are corresponding controls, incubated in the presence of the FYN peptide. In A, the arrowheads point to filamentous
m-positive processes emanating from the neurite, and the open arrow points to a ganglionic non-neuronal cell that is FYN positive. In B, the
open arrows point to neurites in which staining is increased in the distal neurite and proximal growth cone, and the solid arrow points to a neurite/
growth cone that is more uniformly stained. The arrows in C and F demarcate the borders of growth cones, showing that the distal growth cone
is poorly stained or negative. Scale bar: 20 pm for A, B, D, and E, 10 pm for C and F.

Neural substrates of incidental recognition memory
in infancy
Both the emergence of delay-dependent recognition-memory
performance at 18 months of age in the sham-operated animals
and the recognition-memory impairment observed after neonatal hippocampal lesions at that same age suggest that important
maturational changes in the neural substrate supporting incidental recognition memory occurred after 6 months of age in monkeys. These developmental trajectory patterns in both groups
suggest that the medial temporal cortical structures, such as the
perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex, known to mediate this
function in adulthood (Buffalo et al., 1999; Nemanic et al., 2004),
could support incidental recognition-memory processes in
which the hippocampus will ultimately participate. This proposal
concurs with our current knowledge of the postnatal maturation
of the medial temporal lobe structures in monkeys.
Detailed descriptions of the neurobiological development of
structures within the medial temporal lobe are still lacking. Nevertheless, available data suggest that the medial temporal cortical
areas seem to mature earlier than the hippocampus (for review,
see Alvarado and Bachevalier, 2000; Zeamer et al., 2009). Thus,
most of the neurogenesis in medial temporal cortical areas occurs
prenatally, whereas several morphological and neurochemical
changes occur within the first few months postnatally (Webster et
al., 1991, 1995; Berger and Alvarez, 1994). By contrast, the basic
trisynaptic pathway of the hippocampus (ERh 3 dentate gyrus 3
CA3 3 CA2 3 CA1 3 subiculum) exhibits a protracted postnatal maturation that extends until the beginning of the second
postnatal year (Seress and Ribak, 1995a,b; Lavenex et al., 2007).
This delayed postnatal maturation is substantiated by an overall
increase in hippocampal volume from birth to 11 months of age
in monkeys, as revealed in a recent longitudinal structural neu-

Statistically reliable effects were observed in CPU
and NAcc with DPDPE on K+-evoked, but not on
spontaneous DA release; only slight increases of
basal DA levels were occasionally observed. The
potentiating effects of DPDPE on stimulated DA
release were more potent and longer lasting in CPU
than in the NAcc (see Fig. 1); local injections of an
equivalent volume of the saline vehicle had no effect
on K+-stimulated DA release. At 1 nM, DPDPE
caused a significant (140-170%) increase in stimulated DA efflux in CPU which returned to baseline
levels after 35 min whereas in NAcc, DPDPE caused
a considerably more modest but significant (53%)
~tentiation which returned to baseline after 5 min.
In six other animals, pretreatment with naloxone
(5 mg/kg, i.p., 20min before DPDPE) blocked the
potentiating effects of DPDPE on stimulated DA
efflux in both CPU and NAcc (Fig. 1). For one
animal, the typical time-course of DPDPE-

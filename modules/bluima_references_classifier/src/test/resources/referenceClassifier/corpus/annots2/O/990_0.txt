infected, reactive macrophages. Because of the central
position of mononuclear phagocytes in the pathogenesis
of ADC, a functional association between HIV-1 and
uPAR in the CNS therefore can be hypothesized. In this
regard, HIV-1 infection has been shown to upregulate
uPAR expression in monocytic cells and macrophages in
vitro, 14 –16 and, more in general, evidence is emerging
of functional interactions between the uPA/uPAR system and HIV-1 infection. 17–19
Several mechanisms by which overexpression of
uPAR in the brain could lead to ADC-associated neurodegeneration can be hypothesized. First, the uPA/
uPAR system might induce the degradation of functionally important ECM proteins, including BBB
proteins. Although the brain barrier permeability was
not assessed in this study, a strong correlation was ob-

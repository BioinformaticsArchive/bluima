hypotonia, and anxiety. The tics remained under control, but
coprolalia persisted although milder and intermittent. The
patient asked for a divorce and wanted to go back to the job

confirmed the improvement in tic severity (YGTSS 265%;
RVBTS 267%) and the disappearance of self injurious
behaviour, although mood and impulsivity were worse than
with thalamic stimulation (table 1). The patient continued to
lose weight although she ate normally.

Netrin-1 protein is membrane-associated in the adult
spinal cord
The subcellular distribution of netrin-1 protein was identified
using fractionation by differential centrif ugation of adult rat spinal cord homogenates (Fig. 6 B). We followed the initial steps of
a netrin purification protocol that was developed to isolate membranes derived from embryonic day 10 chick brains (Serafini et
al., 1994). Although a secreted protein, netrin-1 was isolated from
the membrane-associated fraction of the embryonic CNS (Se-rafini et al., 1994). To what extent netrin-1 protein is soluble or
membrane-associated in the embryo has not yet been determined.
The fractionation of adult rat spinal cord homogenates reported
here indicates that the majority of netrin-1 in the adult CNS is
not freely soluble. The results are consistent with much of the
netrin-1 protein being membrane-associated or incorporated into
an insoluble component of the extracellular matrix. After homogenization, full-length netrin-1 was detected in the LSP (Fig. 6B,

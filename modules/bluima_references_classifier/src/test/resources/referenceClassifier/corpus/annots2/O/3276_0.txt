remained awake, displaying grooming and feeding
behaviors in addition to a low to moderate degree
of locomotion. All animals remained awake during
the intervening period, as well as during the last 30
min before sacrifice. The period between exposure to the labyrinth and the moment of sacrifice
for the REM group did not differ significantly from
those of WK or SW groups (WK = 311 ± 8,
SW = 322 ± 10, REM = 325 ± 7; means ± S.E.M., in
minutes). Furthermore, the time spent in REM
sleep did not differ significantly between C and EE
animals (148 ± 40 and 137 ± 24, respectively;
means S.E.M., in seconds). No qualitative differences between the EEG patterns from EE and C
animals were observed within the WK, SW, and
REM groups.
zif-268 expression in control animals generally
decreased from the WK to the SW and REM groups
(Fig. 2, a–a88); this effect was most prominent in
the cerebral cortex (Fig. 3). Such a decrease after a
single episode of either SW or REM sleep is consistent with previous studies showing that brain

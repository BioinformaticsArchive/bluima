NrCAM mediates Sema3F-induced
growth cone collapse of thalamic
neurons and associates
with neuropilin-2
The posterior shift of motor and somatosensory thalamic axons to the visual cortex in NrCAM-null mutants may be due
to impaired repellent of thalamic axon
guidance away from the high caudal
Sema3F gradient in the VTe, where axons
are sorted initially along the rostrocaudal
axis to discrete cortical areas (Dufour et
al., 2003). To determine whether NrCAM
is required for growth cone collapse in
thalamic axons in response to Sema3F,
growth cone collapse assays were performed
using cultures of dissociated thalamic neurons from WT and NrCAM-null mutant
embryos (E15.5). Sema3F-Fc induced a
pronounced growth cone collapse response
in WT thalamic neurons, notably increasing
the percentage of collapsed growth cones
compared with control treatment with nonimmune IgG (Fig. 6 A, B,F ). In contrast,
Sema3F-Fc treatment of NrCAM-null mu- tant thalamic neurons failed to induce
growth cone collapse compared with the
control treatment. Basal growth cone collapse in the presence of nonimmune IgG
was equivalent for WT and NrCAM-null
neurons and was not different from un- treated cultures (data not shown). NrCAM
was expressed in 58% of cells in the thalamic
cultures and colocalized with Npn-2 in 53%
of cells (n 62). NrCAM immunofluorescence was evident on cell bodies, processes
and growth cones of cells with neuronal
morphology and was enriched at tips of
filopodia (Fig. 6 E).
A molecular complex of NrCAM and
Npn-2 (characteristic doublet) (Giger et
al., 2000) was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation from lysates of E15.5 mouse

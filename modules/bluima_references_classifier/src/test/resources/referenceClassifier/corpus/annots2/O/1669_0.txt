order (Lashley, 1951). We predicted that learning the order of
component actions that constitute an observed procedure would
involve the well established motor sequence learning network,
including dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), inferior parietal and
mesial frontal [supplementary motor area (SMA) and/or preSMA] cortices, cerebellum, and basal ganglia (Doyon et al., 1996;
Hazeltine et al., 1997; Grafton et al., 1998). We also asked whether
activity within any of these areas during action encoding predicts
the accuracy with which observed procedures are subsequently
performed. A likely candidate is anterior intraparietal cortex,
which is implicated both in forming effector-independent representations of motor sequences (Grafton et al., 1998) and in coding the goals of observed (Hamilton and Grafton, 2006) and ex-ecuted (Tunik et al., 2005) grasping actions.

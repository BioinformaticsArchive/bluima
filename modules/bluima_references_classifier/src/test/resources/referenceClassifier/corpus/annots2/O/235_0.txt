Fig. 6. Effects of single treatment of citalopram on
the dopamine D2 receptor gene transcription in rat
brain striatum. Male Wistar rats (n = 3–5) were treated
with citalopram. Four hours after the injection, rats
were decapitated and nuclei were extracted. Each
experiment was repeated 2–3 times. Statistical analysis was made using student t-test. Each value is the
mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05 vs control.

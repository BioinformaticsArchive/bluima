ABSTRACT
A 6-wk exposure to excess iodide intake (EII) via drinking water (260 mg potassium iodide/L) demonstrated
different effects on growing (4-wk old) and nongrowing (45-wk old) male Fischer-344 rats. In growing rats,
EII induced a significant increase in thyroid weight, pituitary weight, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), and thyroxine (T4). The labeling index (LI) of thyroid follicular cells was slightly increased, although
not statistically significant. Histologically, an increase in follicular cell height, an increase in colloid accumulation, and evidence of colloid absorption were noted. The effect of bovine TSH (bTSH) and protirelin
tartrate (TRH-t) on LI was significantly augmented by EII. In nongrowing rats, EII induced a significant
increase in thyroid weight and serum T4 but no increase in pituitary weight, serum TSH, and the LI of
follicular cells. Histologically, an increase in colloid accumulation was found in small follicles. EII did not
augment the effect of bTSH and T R H t on the LI of follicular cells. This study suggests that growing rats
are still susceptible to acute hypothyroidism even after 6 wk ofcontinuous exposure to excess iodide, whereas
nongrowing rats are refractory within an equivalent treatment period.

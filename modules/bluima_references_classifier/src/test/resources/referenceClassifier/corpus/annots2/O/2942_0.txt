Correlation analysis
Pearson's linear correlation on a pixelwise basis including
all 13 patients with Huntington's disease from both groups
revealed a significant negative correlation between the failure
rate and neuronal activity, inducing relative rCBF changes
in the supplementary motor area predominantly rostral to the
intercommissural line and adjacent parts of the cingulate
(BA 6/24/32), reaching a significance level above P < 0.01.
The same appeared to be true for a smaller area of the left
parietal cortex at the border of BA 2 and BA 40. This
indicates that there was a decrease of activation in these
areas with a decrease in task accuracy, reflecting impaired
higher order motor control (Fig. 4). Table 5 summarizes the
areas showing negative correlation with the failure rate, their

concave regions on the other hand get squeezed with a decreased fluid content, e.g. the constriction
in the peanut-, cross and bone shape. This characteristic distribution of fluid content corresponds very
well to the location of oedema in hydrocephalic brains, which form especially at the strongly convex
ventricular horns.
Also the fluid velocity can be seen to be the highest near the protuberances, owing partly to the
stronger dilation and hence higher permeability in those regions and partly to the shorter distance to the
subarachnoid space and thus steeper pressure gradient.
While the simulation of the hydrocephalic state of the human brain is valuable for its explanations
and its predictions, which can be compared to real hydrocephalus, it is practically more relevant to
treat the reverse problem of recovering the original, undistorted brain configuration from the deformed
ventricle shape and ventricular and subarachnoid pressure. Even more important is the simulation of
treatment given a particular ventricle geometry (Sivaloganathan, personal communication): this allows
one to predict the time evolution of brain displacement and pressure for each individual patient and might
be used to adjust the treatment procedure, e.g. the shunt placement. In our linearly elastic model, this is
particularly simple: due to the assumption that the deformed and undeformed configuration sufficiently
coincide we may use the same pressureâ€“displacement iteration that we use to compute the hydrocephalic
state, only that the displacement is solved for in the deformed domain and that the pressures in the
Dirichlet conditions (2.11) and (2.12) are given from measurements. If now the computed displacement
is subtracted from the deformed brain shape, we recover the original, undistorted brain.2

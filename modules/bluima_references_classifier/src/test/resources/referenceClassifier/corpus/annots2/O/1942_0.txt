(MEC: by 35 11%, n 5, p 0.018) (Fig. 6C1,C2) (MLA: by
4 4%, n 9, p 0.17) (data not shown). Moreover, MEC (5
M) did not alter sEPSC frequency in 4-KO mice (change of 4
11%, n 6, p 0.21) (Fig. 6C1,C2). These data suggest that
nicotine facilitated glutamate release via desensitizing 4 2*
nAChRs that are directly or indirectly presynaptic to MSNs.
The activation of 4 2* nAChRs on dopaminergic terminals
facilitates DA release in the dorsal striatum (Zhou et al., 2001;
Salminen et al., 2004; Grady et al., 2007; Nashmi et al., 2007;
Drenan et al., 2008); in contrast, desensitization of these receptors reduces DA release (Zhou et al., 2001; Rice and Cragg, 2004;
Zhang and Sulzer, 2004; Exley et al., 2008). We previously
observed low but detectable expression of 4-YFP* nAChRs in
the dorsal striatum (Nashmi et al., 2007); immunostaining for
GFP now confirms that these signals mostly occurred in TH-immunostained structures (Fig. 6 D). These data support the lo-calization of 4 2* nAChRs in dopaminergic fibers/terminals. In
addition, DA acting via D2/D3 receptors inhibits glutamatergic
terminals (Bamford et al., 2004). We hypothesized that nicotine
( 1 M) may modulate glutamate release through this pathway.
That is, nicotine desensitizes 4 2* nAChRs in DA terminals,
reduces DA release, and therefore indirectly disinhibits glutamatergic terminals. We observed that 10 M sulpiride, a D2/D3
receptor antagonist, robustly enhanced sEPSC frequency (by
34 3%, n 9, p 0.0001) (data not shown) without changing
the amplitude of sEPSCs (data not shown). This suggests that the
baseline DA level in the dorsal striatum is high enough to inhibit
glutamate release by activating presynaptic D2/D3 receptors
(Bamford et al., 2004; David et al., 2005). Meanwhile, in the
presence of 10 M sulpiride, neither nicotine (1 M) (Fig. 6 A2,A3)
nor DH E (0.3 M) (Fig. 6 B2,B3) enhanced sEPSC frequency.

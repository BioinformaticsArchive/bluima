brain region. These data may also have important
implications for the role of NO in cerebral pathophysiology. In epilepsy, one might speculate that
imbalances between nNOS versus eNOS function
may lead to imbalances in excitatory versus inhibitory tone. In cerebral ischemia, NO has been shown
to have multifactorial eVects with the prevailing
hypothesis that NO derived from nNOS contributes
to excitotoxic and free radical cascades3,5,28 whereas
NO derived from eNOS mediates compensatory
vasodilatory responses that serve to protect brain
from the lack of blood flow.12,13,18 The fact that
nNOS and eNOS isoforms may diVerentially modulate excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission provide further possible avenues for NO action. One
might speculate that after cerebral ischemia, nNOS
can promote neuronal damage by amplifying
pathological glutamate release whereas eNOS
activity can be beneficial by enhancing potentially
neuroprotective GABA release.

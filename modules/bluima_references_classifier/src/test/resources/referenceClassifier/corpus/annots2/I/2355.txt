in rat olfactory cortex when the LOT is stimulated? 3) Why are there receptors for Glu
and Asp on these cells?
There is no easy answer for any of these
questions. Possibly the transmitter is an un-identified peptide. If so, it is possible that the
release of Asp in rat and Glu in guinea pig
prepyriform slices seen on LOT stimulation
results from a degradation of the peptide,
which releases component amino acids. While
receptors for Glu and Asp clearly exist, their
possible location at principally or exclusively
extrajunctional sites may indicate that an im-portant function is to regulate resting membrane conductance and potential.
The results of our study in rat prepyriform
cortex are most easily explained by the ex-istence of two receptors: 1) a relatively in-sensitive receptor responding to both Glu
and Asp that is insensitive to all antagonists
we have studied, and 2) a receptor mediating
natural synaptic excitation of the LOT that
is sensitive to APB. NMDA, KA, and HC
may function as agonists at this second re-ceptor, although they are less sensitive to
APB than is the natural transmitter.
This pattern of amino acid receptors does
not correspond to any other that has been
described. Although further characterization
in this preparation is necessary, our results
to date provide additional reasons for caution
in proposing general principles of amino acid
receptor and antagonist organization.

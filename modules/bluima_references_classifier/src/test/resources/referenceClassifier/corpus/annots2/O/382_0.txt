Fig. 3. Electron microscopic photographs in the periventricular
area adjacent to medial side of the lateral ventricle in 3-month-old
SAMP8 mice decapitated after HRP circulation for 5 (A) and 90 (B)
minutes. The staining reaction for HRP appears in vesicular profiles
of the endothelial cells, the cytoplasm of the perivascular cells (pv) (B;
arrow), and the basal lamina (bl) (A; arrow). (bl; basal lamina, pv;
perivascular cell) (A ×47,600; B ×8,500).

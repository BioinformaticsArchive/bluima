(1993), who indicated that opioids had no effect on voltage-dependent K currents. Although the reason for the
difference is unclear, there are several possible explanations for the discrepancy. Our data were obtained from
acutely dissociated small diameter TRG neurons, projecting onto the superficial layer of cervical dorsal horn,
whereas Akins and McCleskey (1993) used unidentified
projecting site and various diameter DRG neurons in the
acutely cultured conditions. This difference may be ex-plained by the fact that the opioid sensitivity in neurons
projecting onto superficial layers is higher than that in the
neurons projecting deeper layers, because there is evidence demonstrating that naloxone differentially affects
the nociceptive neuronal excitability in the superficial and
deeper dorsal horns (Mohka, 1992. Other factors also
needed to be considered, for example: 1) tissue difference
(TRG vs. DRG) and 2) age (neonatal vs. adult).
In the present study, on acutely dissociated TRG neurons, the molar concentrations of a -opioid receptor agonist,
DAMGO, were higher than those of endogenous enkephalin
( 1 M). Thus it is possible that potentiation of the DAMGOinduced K conductance may represent either reduction in
the number of functional receptors or, a non-specific effect
of the -opioid receptor. But we found that potentiation of
K conductance was blocked by a specific blocker of the
-opioid receptor, CTOP. Similar concentrations in the
present study (20 â€“50 M) examining modulation of the
-opioid receptor agonist have been used in the periaqueductal gray neurons (Osborne et al., 1996). Since -opioid
receptors are metabotropic receptors, characterized by the
G-protein-coupled receptor subtype, we did whole-cell re-cording under perforated-patch configuration to prevent
cell dialysis and washout of the second messenger system
(Takeda et al., 2002a,b, 2004). Therefore, it is likely that
potentiation of voltage-dependent K currents by DAMGO
may be due to a specific -opioid receptors-mediated ef-fect on the TRG neurons.

Putative synaptic actions of the hypothalamic
innervation of trigeminal motoneurons
In the present study, we describe a glutamatergic input
from the hypothalamus to the mV (see Fig. 2). In addition,
we provide evidence that the hypothalamus may influence
the motor nucleus of the trigeminal complex through the
production of at least three other substances: Hcrt, MCH
and NO.
Peever et al. (2003) have presented pharmacological
evidence indicating an indirect excitatory effect of hypocretins/orexins on trigeminal motoneurons by means of the
presynaptic release of glutamate. Yamuy et al. (2004)
have shown that Hcrt acts as an excitatory neuromodulator
directly, as well as indirectly, on motoneurons to promote
their discharge. For most other types of neurons, hypocretins/orexin acts pre- and postsynaptically as an excitatory
neuromodulator (Sutcliffe and de Lecea, 2002).

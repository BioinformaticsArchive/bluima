Studies performed with long-term cerebroventricular
perfusions have also found a saturable component for
the clearance from the CNS of radiolabeled Leu-enkephalin (33). These studies, unlike those done with TyrMIF-1, indicate that a portion of the transport is inhibited by tyrosine (Table 4). At first this might suggest
that the peptide or a radiolabeled degradation product is
being transported by the well-characterized system in
the BBB for large neutral amino acids. However, this
seemsnot to be the case, since other neutral amino acids
do not inhibit transport, and 2aminobicyclo (2,&l)-heptane-2carboxylic acid (BCH), a substrate specific for
the large neutral amino acid system, is not as effective
an inhibitor as is tyrosine. Leucine was not found to
influence transport in this study, although it is an allosteric regulator of the system that transports Tyr-MIF-1 and Met-enkephalin (10). It is currently unclear
whether these discrepancies represent subtypes of the
PTS-1 system or methodological differences.
Preliminary results suggestthat PTS-1 may be located
in the capillary bed of the brain (92). However, the
choroid plexus is also able to sequester, and perhaps
transport, enkephalins and their analogues from its brain
(50, 62-65) or blood side (126). Once again, the charac-

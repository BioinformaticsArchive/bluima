considered unusual for bacterial, parasitic, or fungal
infections. Initial MR imaging showing multiple le-sions involving the posterior fossa and subcortical
white matter raised the possibility of cyclosporine
toxicity. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
or lymphoproliferative disorders were considered re-mote possibilities. The clinical course and initially
negative diffusion-weighted findings did not support
the diagnosis of stroke.
In the United States, toxoplasma encephalitis is a
rare condition in non-AIDS patients, occurring with a
frequency of 0.31% of BMT patients. The disease is
extremely rare in seronegative patients, especially in
syngeneic recipients, but it can complicate an allogeneic BMT, suggesting an acquired infection (4). Im-munohistochemistry yields positive results concordant with autopsy in only 65% of cases, whereas PCR
for toxoplasmosis DNA is positive in only 75% of
cases (5). Our case highlights the limited sensitivity of
PCR in diagnosing toxoplasmosis in BMT patients.
Brain MR imaging in AIDS-related cerebral toxoplasmosis usually shows multiple lesions in the deep
gray and subcortical white matter– gray matter junction of variable size and enhancement patterns (1, 4,
6 –9). Other common locations include the posterior
fossa, cortical gray matter, and periventricular white
matter. Toxoplasmosis lesions are usually associated
with copious surrounding edema and marked mass
effect. After contrast administration, intense parenchymal enhancement is nearly ubiquitous, whereas in
our case we saw only subtle, irregular meningeal en-hancement with possible extension to the cortex and
white matter– gray matter junction. Most of the pa-renchymal lesions, however, were nonenhancing. To
the best of our knowledge, brain toxoplasmosis with
such a paucity of enhancement has not been reported
in patients with AIDS. In toxoplasma encephalitis
complicating BMT, a lack of enhancement is occasion-

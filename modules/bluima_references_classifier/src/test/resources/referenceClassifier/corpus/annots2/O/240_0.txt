cell death in Fgf2 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. As
NeuN-positive cells are 8.8 and 5.4 million in adult wild-type and
Fgf2 knockout mice, respectively (Vaccarino et al., 1999a), the
number of NeuN-positive neurons that die between birth and
adulthood is ;7 million cells in wild-type mice and 2.3 million in
Fgf2 knockout mice, which represent 50 and 30%, respectively, of
the neurons that are born. This effect may represent an indirect
compensatory phenomenon for the decreased generation of cortical neurons in Fgf2 knockout mice.
Fgf2 and Egf play different roles in cortical development.
There are no abnormalities in the cerebral cortex of Egfr mutant
mice at birth, but cortical neurons die progressively, and the
rostral portion of the cerebral cortex degenerates beginning at P4
(Sibilia and Wagner, 1995; Sibilia et al., 1998). Thus, Egfr is not
required for cortical morphogenesis but is essential for neuronal
survival during postnatal stages of development.
In Ffgf2 knockout mice the proliferative population of the
PVE is 40% of the wild type at the beginning of neurogenesis
(E10.5). Thus, one might expect that in the absence of any
compensatory phenomenon the number of neurons in the cortical
plate would also be 40% of wild type. Instead, the number of
cortical neurons of Fgf2-/- mice is 54% of wild type at the
completion of neurogenesis, 30% larger than expected. These

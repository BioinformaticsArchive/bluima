To establish whether activation of the Group II
mGluRs depressed GABA transmission by a presynaptic
mechanism, we determined the effect of the mGluR
agonist l-CCG-I on the amplitude of the NTS-evoked
GABA IPSCs in conjunction with the paired-pulse
ratio of two consecutively evoked IPSCs, and on the
frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs and mIPSCs. l-CCG-I
produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the
peak amplitude of the GABA eIPSC in conjunction with
an increase in the paired-pulse ratio, evidence that the
inhibition was mediated by activation of presynaptic
mGluRs (Debanne et al. 1996; Saitow et al. 2000; Jang et al.
2001; Morisset & Urban, 2001; Kato & Shigetomi, 2001;
Behr et al. 2002; Dietrich et al. 2002; Kerchner & Zhuo,
2002; Kirischuk et al. 2002; Kline et al. 2002; Saviane et al.
2002; Hjelmstad & Fields, 2003; Jeong et al. 2003; Kombian
et al. 2003; Sekizawa et al. 2003). Had the mGluR agonist
acted postsynaptically to decrease GABA responsiveness
of the baroreceptor neurone, then the amplitudes of the
first and second eIPSCs would have decreased to the
same extent resulting in an unchanged paired-pulse ratio
(Henneberger et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2003; Scheiderer
et al. 2004).
The presynaptic locus was further confirmed by the
findings that the frequencies of the sIPSCs and mIPSCs
were decreased, while the amplitudes remained unchanged
(Koyama et al. 1999, 2000, 2002; Glitsch & Marty, 1999;
Cooper & Stanford, 2001; Iyadomi et al. 2000; Kishimoto
et al. 2001; Doi et al. 2002; Kerchner & Zhuo, 2002;
Jeong et al. 2003; Lim et al. 2003; Mtchedlishvili & Kapur,
2003; Ziskind-Conhaim et al. 2003; Huang & Bordey,
2004). Had the agonist acted at postsynaptic mGluRs to
decrease GABA transmission, then the amplitudes rather
than frequencies of the sIPSCs and mIPSCs would have
decreased (Henneberger et al. 2002), and the holding
current would have changed (Brussaard et al. 1996; Wardle
& Poo, 2003). The demonstration that mIPSC frequency
decreased the same as the sIPSC frequency suggests that
the agonist depressed the GABA release mainly by
activation of the mGluRs located on the terminals rather
than preterminal axons or cell bodies (Banks et al.
2002).
Taken together, the findings are consistent with
the hypothesis that glutamate spillover from sensory
afferent fibres activates presynaptic Group II mGluRs
on nearby GABA terminals to suppress GABA release
at second-order baroreceptor neurones. A number of
mechanisms have been shown to fine-tune baroreceptor
signal output of NTS neurones (Chiba & Kato, 1978;
Glaum & Miller, 1993; Liu et al. 1998; Zhang & Mifflin,
1998; Kato & Shigetomi, 2001; Chen et al. 2002; Kline
et al. 2002; Seagard et al. 2003). The distinctive feature
of the glutamate–mGluR–GABA interaction is that
the glutamate, through activation of mGluRs, can
regulate not only its own release, but also that of a

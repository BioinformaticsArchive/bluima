nant with previous demonstrations that functional gonadal
ablation during the neonatal period abolishes sexually di-morphic magnitude of analgesic responsiveness to morphine
administered either systemically (Cicero et al., 2002) or into
the ventrolateral periaquaductal gray (Krzanowska et al.,
2002). It is important to note, however, that neonatal androgen treatment can result in an anovulatory syndrome in
female rats (Pfaff, 1999). Consequently, the adult ovarian
hormonal milieu can be altered in adult females androgenized during neonatal development (Pfaff, 1999). Thus, a
possibility remains that obliteration by neonatal androgenization of the female-specific KOR component of i.t. morphine
antinociception could result from the loss of activational ef-fects of ovarian sex steroids (that persist longer than the
1-week interval between ovariectomy and i.t. morphine testing) as well as from the loss of organizational actions of these
steroids.
The realization that sex-dependent recruitment of different populations of opioid receptor can underlie comparable
pharmacologic antinociception in male and female rats un-derscores the imperative for including female as well as male
subjects in all investigations of pain and antinociceptive
mechanisms and their regulation. Clearly, implicit or explicit
conclusions of common mechanistic underpinnings inferred
from behavioral similarities between male and female subjects are fraught with ambiguity. Regardless of the degree to
which the ability of i.t. morphine to recruit different spinal
populations of opioid receptor generalizes to other opioid
agonists, current findings reveal a heretofore unrecognized
parameter of nociception and antinociception, attention to
which could prove to have clinical utility.

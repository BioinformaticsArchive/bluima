rate in sheep 26 and dogs. 2s The mechanism whereby
PACAP augments cardiovascular activities is not
known. As the peptide was found to stimulate cyclic
AMP production in cardiac myocytes, a direct
inotropic and chronotropic effect on the heart has
beensuggested.2sInviewofthepresenceofPACAPIR fibres in the lateral horn area, the possibility that
the peptide may directly stimulate preganglionic
neurons cannot be excluded. While the effect of
PACAP on preganglionic neurons remains to be
studied, the peptide has been found to exert a potent
depolarizing action on enteric neurons with an ECso
in the nanomolar range. 3
The significance of PACAP-IR in various regions
of the medulla is far from understood. None the less,
the presence of intense immunoreactivity in vagal
afferents, caudal raphe nuclei and lateral reticular
nuclei invites speculation that PACAP may be
involved in cardiovascular functions. For example,
PACAP-IR projection to the NTS may represent
vagal afferents and, therefore, may participate in
baroreceptor reflex. With respect to the lateral reticular nuclei, PACAP-IR somata and fibres are mainly
localized to ventrolateral medulla at the level of, or
caudal to, area postrema. It remains to be determined
whether PACAP-IR neurons in the lateral reticular
nuclei send their axons to the autonomic nuclei of
the spinal cord, thus, influencing sympathetic nerve
activity and/or to other areas of the brain. Alternatively, the dense network of PACAP-IR fibres in
this region may influence cardiovascular activity
secondarily by making synaptic contacts with
neurons in the lateral reticular nuclei that project
either to the spinal cord or to other regions of the

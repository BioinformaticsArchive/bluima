(transformation of AMP to adenosine by 5'-nucleotidase)
seems to be the rate-limiting step. As we have reported previously, cAMP is converted to adenosine as well, but on a much
slower time scale than any of the other nucleotides tested.
These experiments demonstrate that fast, localized release of
AMP, ADP, or ATP can result in a transient activation of adenosine receptors but that this is unlikely to occur with cAMP. The
existence of a highly active ecto-nucleotidase pathway in brain
provides a mechanism for the rapid generation of adenosine
after the release of adenine nucleotides into the extracellular
space.

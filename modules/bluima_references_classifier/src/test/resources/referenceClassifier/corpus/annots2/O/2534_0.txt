(tn). By PND 10, however, rBNP1 mRNA is restricted in its
patternofexpression,beingmostabundantinthecerebralcortex, hippocampus,and cerebellum. Low levels of expression
are detected in midline structures.
As illustrated in Figure 9, expression of rBNP1 appearsto
be related to the development of the cerebral cortex and hippocampalformation. The rBNP1 hybridization signal is apparent at embryonic day 17 in the ventricular zone (VZ) and is
more abundant in the outer layer of the cortical plate (CP)
which develops in an “inside-out” pattern (Fig. 9A-C). By
PND 1 rBNP1 mRNA appearsto be localized over the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampusand the granulecell layer
of the dentate gyrus. This pattern becomessharply defined by
PND 10.

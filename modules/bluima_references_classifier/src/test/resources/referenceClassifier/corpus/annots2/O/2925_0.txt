Microtubule-associated protein MAP1B, a major neuronal cytoskeletal protein, is expressed highly during
the early stage of brain development and is thought to
play an important role in brain development. Although
it has been shown that MAP1B localizes both in cytosol
and particulate fractions, the underlying molecular
mechanism in the membrane localization has yet to be
elucidated. In the present study, we show that MAP1B
purified from young rat brain can bind to acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine, but not to a neutral phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore,
the binding of MAP1B to taxol-stabilized microtubules
was inhibited by the addition of phosphatidylserine or
phosphatidylinositol. The addition of phosphatidylcholine showed no effect on the binding of MAP1B to the
microtubules. A 120-kDa microtubule-binding fragment
of MAP1B was also released from microtubules by the
addition of acidic phospholipids. Synthetic peptides de-rived from the C-terminal half of the tubulin-binding
domain, but not that corresponding to the N-terminal
half, bound to acidic phospholipids specifically. These
results suggest that MAP1B binds to biological membranes through its tubulin-binding site, and the binding
may play a regulatory role in MAP1B-microtubule
interaction.

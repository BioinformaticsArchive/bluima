channel. In some experiments, incorporation of additional
channels (10) or unstable background conditions (14) led
to exclusion from the study, and in seven experiments the
lipid membranes broke during repeated administration of
drugs. Therefore, the 16 remaining experiments with a
single channel were included in the study.
In the presence of BTX, sodium channels were open
most of the time, with brief closures (<500 ms) (Fig. 1A),
with a single channel conductance of mean 26.5 (SD 1.8)
pS (n=16). The fractional open time of the channels was
0.95 (0.02) and the time-averaged conductance of the
channels (which is the product of single channel conductance
and fractional open time) was 25.3 (1.8) pS. These conductances were voltage-independent between 650 mV.
When pentobarbital was added to the channels they began
to flicker (Fig. 1B), representing rapid transitions between
a fully open and a fully closed state.19 Single channel
conductance was unaffected (see Table 1) by pentobarbital;
however, time-averaged conductance of the channel

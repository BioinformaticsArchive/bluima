Brain ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion, as described
by Pulsinelli et al. (1979). Brie£y, with rats under anesthesia with
chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.), vertebral arteries were electrocauterized, and common carotid arteries were exposed. Rats were
allowed to recover for 24 hr and fasted overnight. Ischemia was
induced by occluding the common arteries with aneurysm clips.
Rats that lost their righting re£ex within 30 sec and whose pupils
were dilated and unresponsive to light during ischemia were
selected for the experiments. Rats with seizures were discarded.
An EEG was monitored to ensure isoelectricity within 30 sec
after carotid artery occlusion. Carotid artery blood £ow was
restored by releasing the clips. Rectal temperature was maintained
at about 37°C during and for 2 hr after ischemia. Sham controls
were performed using the same surgical exposure procedures
except that the arteries were not occluded.

WERE THESE CHILDREN TRULY DECORTICATE?
One might argue that the remarkableness of these cases is
muted by the fact that none of the children was absolutely
devoid of cortical tissue: they were not truly decorticate.
The proper nomenclature for subject 1's and subject 3's
pathology is admittedly debatable; it is more dysgenetic than
classical hydranencephaly (the end-product of in utero
necrosis of normally developing hemispheres [Halsey et al.
1971, Sarnat 1992]). Subject 1 had mesial temporal remnants and a large supratentorial cyst partially lined by tissue
capable of generating epileptiform discharges. Subject 3 has
a sliver of holoprosencephalic frontal lobe. But the point is
that even if these two children were not decorticate absolutely, they were enough so that physicians, including neurologists, predicted a vegetative outcome absolutely.
Even in classical hydranencephaly there is often a thin
remnant of inferior temporo-occipital cortex (Halsey et al.
1971), as exemplified in subject 2 and subject 4. Typically this
tissue does not mediate vision because it is severely gliotic
and optic radiations are absent. Thus, despite the cortical
remnant, such children are universally cortically blind, as
was subject 4 (and subject 2 on `bad days'), and the literature
does not hesitate to label them `decorticate' (Halsey et al.
1968, Deiker and Bruno 1976, Berntson et al. 1983) and to
consider them as necessarily vegetative (Multi-Society Task
Force on PVS 1994a).
The most important differential diagnosis is with `maximal hydrocephalus', in which the cortex is basically intact
though extremely compressed (Sutton et al. 1980, Iinuma et
al. 1989). Refinements of modern neuroimaging make this
distinction less difficult than it used to be. Also, the EEG is
relatively normal in maximal hydrocephalus but virtually flat
in hydranencephaly. In each of our four cases, all diagnostic
information taken together leaves little ground for concern
over possible misdiagnosis of maximal hydrocephalus.
Primarily, these children's consciousness can be inferred
to be mediated subcortically, not because there were
absolutely zero cortical neurons, but because the few that
were present could not plausibly subserve the totality of
their conscious behaviors. That is why parents were invariably told, with complete confidence by relevant specialists,
that their child would unquestionably remain in a vegetative
state for as long as he or she lived. Experienced neurologists,
to whom the authors have shown the CT and MRI scans also
typically predict vegetative state.
This is not to say that the number and distribution of
telencephalic neurons played no role in these children's cognitive repertoire. The two with rudimentary limbic structures (subject 1 and subject 3) were more affective and
sociable than the two with classical hydranencephaly, and
they also had more motor function. Ironically, they also possessed more vision despite total lack of occipital cortex,
when compared with the other two who had little or no
vision despite occipital remnants. It seems as unlikely that
the occipital tissue in the latter two mediated their discriminative affect as that the limbic tissue in the former two mediated their vision. What is functionally common to all
(consciousness per se) is more logically attributable to struc-

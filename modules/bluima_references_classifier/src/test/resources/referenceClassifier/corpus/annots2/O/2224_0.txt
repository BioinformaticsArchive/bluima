Figure 1. Rat forebrain primary culture, established at high density (2.4 x lo5 cells/cm2), 7 d in vitro.A, Immunofluorescence photomicrograph
with the anti-GD3 antibody, visualized with Rh-goat anti-mouse Ig, demonstrating that small, process-bearing cells bind the antibody. B, Phase
contrast photomicrograph of the same field, showing many cells with large, oval nuclei and cytoplasmic processes, closely apposed to the coverslip,
and a number of smaller cells growing on top. The smallcellsareGD3+, while the cells of thebottomlayerare GD3-, but are GFAP+ (not
shown, but see Fig. 2). x 370.

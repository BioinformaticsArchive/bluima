Materials and Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately
250-275 g were caged individually with food and water
available ad libitum for 3 weeks before surgery. The
cages consisted of a stationary wire mesh compartment
8 x 13 x 28 cm and a 34-cm diameter running wheel
that rotated freely in either direction. Rats were
maintained on a 12:12 hour light: dark cycle.

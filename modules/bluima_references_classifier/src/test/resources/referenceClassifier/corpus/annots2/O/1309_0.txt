Experimental brain abscess
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol,
125 mg/kg i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich). The head was secured in a
stereotactic frame (Benchmark; Neurolab, St Louis, MO, USA) and
a 1-cm midline incision was made in the scalp from eye to ear. A 1-mm
diameter burr hole was made 1 mm anterior and 2 mm lateral to the
bregma using a micromotor drill (Foredom, Bethel, CT, USA). A 30-G
needle attached to a gas-tight glass syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV,
USA) was introduced stereotactically through the burr hole to a depth
of 3 mm below the surface of the calvarium (Fig. 1a, top left). Five
microliters of the bead suspension (105 CFU) was infused into the
striatum over 5 min, and 2 min later the needle was slowly removed to
prevent reflux. The burr hole was sealed with sterile bone wax and the
skin was closed with sutures. Control wild-type and AQP4 null mice
received injections of sterile agarose beads. More than 90% of
mice survived the injection procedure. After recovery from anesthesia,
mice were kept at room temperature (22 C) and provided with
standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were examined daily for
clinical signs of illness. Weight and rectal temperature were recorded
daily and global neurological function was assessed.

Dopamine suppresses retinogeniculate excitatory synaptic
transmission

Voltage clamp recordings were obtained from 135 relay neurons in the
rat dLGN. Relay neurons were distinguished by physiological and
morphological criteria (Govindaiah & Cox, 2004b; Hamos et al.,
1985; Pape & McCormick, 1995; Williams et al., 1996; Zhu et al.,
1999). Relay neurons produced a stereotypical voltage-dependent
burst firing response consisting of a few high-frequency
Na+-dependent action potentials riding on a transient depolarizing
wave from activation of transient, low-threshold calcium current
(Steriade & Llina ́s, 1988). The morphology of the recorded neurons
was confirmed by biocytin injections and compared with previously
published morphological criteria (Pape & McCormick, 1995; Williams
et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 1999; Cox & Sherman, 2000; Govindaiah &
Cox, 2004b). These cells had an average resting membrane potential
and input resistance of )67 ± 4 mV and 341 ± 79 MW, respectively.
At a holding potential of )60 mV, optic tract stimulation (25–400 lA,
100 ls duration, single pulse) evoked an early inward current
followed by an outward current (Fig. 1A, control). We pharmacologically isolated the eEPSC by the addition of the GABAA receptor
antagonist (SR95531, 10 lm), which completely attenuated the
evoked IPSC (Fig. 1A, SR95531). The mean amplitude of the
eEPSCs was 463 ± 266 pA at a holding potential of )60 mV. Bath
application of dopamine (2–100 lm) resulted in a robust, reversible
suppression of eEPSC amplitude in 45 of 64 neurons tested (Fig. 1).
Various dopamine concentrations (1, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 lm) were
tested and found to reduce the eEPSC amplitude by 3 ± 2, 16 ± 10,
34 ± 12, 44 ± 8, 46 ± 16 and 47 ± 18% at 1 lm (n = 4), 2 lm
(n = 9), 10 lm (n = 7), 25 lm (n = 6), 50 lm (n = 19) and 100 lm
(n = 11), respectively (Fig. 1C). Based on this concentration
dependence, the IC50 of the suppressive action of dopamine was
calculated using the Boltzmann equation to be 4.9 ± 1.6 lm. Overall,
there was a significant difference in the degree of eEPSC suppression
produced by the different concentrations of dopamine (P < 0.001,
anova). Subsequent analyses indicate that dopamine concentrations
‡ 2 lm differed significantly from 1 lm (P < 0.05, Tukey-Kramer
multiple comparison test) but 1 lm dopamine did not differ significantly from control levels (P > 0.5). The suppressive action of 2 lm
dopamine was significantly different from 25, 50 and 100 lm
dopamine (P < 0.05, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test). The

Neuronostatin is a brain/gut peptide due to its site of production and its ability to induce early response genes c-Fos or c-Jun
in neuronal, anterior pituitary, and gastrointestinal tissues.
Although the observed stimulation of c-Fos and c-Jun expression in these tissues could be due to secondary induction mediated by other hormones, studies using human stomach tumor
KATO-III cells indicated that neuronostatin acts directly on
gastric cells. Somatostatin is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and inhibits the secretion of several pituitary hormones
(29). Somatostatin is also produced in the gastric oxyntic
mucosa (30) and suppresses the secretion of several gastrointestinal peptides including ghrelin in a paracrine fashion (31).
Because neuronostatin is expressed in parietal cells and induces
c-Fos in chief cells, it could also serve as a paracrine hormone.
Similar to somatostatin, neuronostatin is likely expressed in
pancreatic delta cells and neuronostatin could act on alpha cells
in a paracrine manner. Unlike somatostatin, discovered based
on its ability to inhibit GH release, neuronostatin did not modulate basal or hormone-stimulated GH secretion by cultured
anterior pituitary cells. Although the exact physiological roles

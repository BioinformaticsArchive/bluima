Apoptosis and cell addition in adult zebrafish cerebellum

The molecular basis of apoptosis during zebrafish development has
been described by Yamashita (2003). In adult zebrafish, apoptosis has
been previously studied in the olfactory bulbs following the removal
of the olfactory organ (Vankirk & Byrd, 2003). In the present study,
TUNEL-positive cell profiles were mainly included in the granule cell
layer of Va and CCe cerebellum, while the molecular layer, the site of
cell proliferation, showed low apoptotic activity, in agreement with
previous studies in adult gymnotiform cerebellum (Soutschek &
Zupanc, 1996). In contrast, studies in mammals have reported that
apoptosis is prominent in the proliferating neuroepithelium of the
developing rat cerebral cortex and that it is related to the progression
of the cell cycle (Thomaidou et al., 1997). Similarly, in the early
postnatal mammalian cerebellum, apoptosis is thought to regulate the
size of the rapidly expanding population of premigratory cells in the
external granular layer, while the incidence of cell death of postmitotic
granule cells in the internal granular layer is reported as increasing
with age and appears to be linked to the formation of the mature
synaptic circuitry of the developing cerebellar cortex (Lossi et al.,
2002; Lossi & Merighi, 2003). In the adult zebrafish cerebellum,
apoptosis was correlated with the postmitotic granule cells and not the
precursor cells, supporting the hypothesis that apoptosis in adults has a
role in the regulation of the cell density of postmitotic differentiated
areas. In agreement, it is suggested that apoptotic cells appear in
proliferating zones in early in development while at later stages they
are found in postmitotic differentiated areas in the brown trout, Salmo
trutta fario (Candal et al., 2005).
Male and female animals showed similar densities of apoptotic
figures in the present study and the relatively high density of apoptotic
figures found in the granular layer of zebrafish cerebellum is probably
related to the increased addition of new cells, suggesting that the
occurrence of cell death is counteracting it. Indeed, when different
cerebellar regions are compared, the proliferation rate and the addition
of newborn cells parallels the rate of apoptotic cell death; that is, areas
with higher addition of newborn cells exhibit higher apoptotic rates,
e.g. in Val-gr cell death density is higher than in CCe-gr, as is the
density of newborn cells in Val-mol compared to CCe-mol. Interestingly, cell death was low in both LCa-mol and LCa-gr, and did not
show migration of newborn cells. In agreement, programmed cell death
is correlated with high proliferative activity in adult gymnotiform fish
cerebellum, Apteronotus leptorhynchus (Soutschek & Zupanc, 1996;
Zupanc et al., 1998). The observed density of apoptotic cells in the
granular layer of adult zebrafish cerebellum is higher than that reported
in other regions of the adult brown trout teleost brain (Candal et al.,
2005) but is similar to that of cells which have been deafferented for
1 h in the olfactory bulb (Vankirk & Byrd, 2003).
This phenomenon of the close relation between cell birth and cell
death is widely accepted. In the gymnotiform fish cerebellum
(Soutschek & Zupanc, 1996) is has been suggested that the newly
generated cells die, as a possible mechanism for eliminating cells that
do not make the proper connections; this has been proposed for the
establishment of connections during development (Oppenheim, 1991).
Alternatively, in the case of older cells dying, is suggested that these
cells are replaced by newborn ones. Lesion studies in adult brain
suggest the replacement with newly generated cells of cells lost
because of injury (Zupanc & Ott, 1999). In the present study, doublelabelling experiments revealed that only in a few cases was there

of the concepts of cochlear nerve and nu-cleus function that have been derived from
anesthetized (21, 29, 3 1) and brain-reduced
(9, 41) preparations are applicable to the
intact, behaving animal.
A point of practical significance to which
the present findings may be relevant is the
nature of sensations that might be produced
by electrical stimulation of the cochlear
nucleus in humans. The masking results suggest that stimulation of loci in cochlear nu-cleus could generate sensory percepts that
would be temporally discrete, with brisk
onset and offset (as inferred from the temporal aspects of masking), and sharply limited
as to apparent frequency (as inferred from
the frequency characteristics (11) of masking). For the possible development of auditory prostheses, cochlear nucleus stimulation might yield a more useful range of perceptual phenomenon than has been produced
by stimulating thalamic or cortical areas
(7, 28, 36).

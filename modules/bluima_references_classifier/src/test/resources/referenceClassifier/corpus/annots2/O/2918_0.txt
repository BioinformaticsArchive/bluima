Figure 9. Sleep spindle-associated entrainment of network activity may be spatially limited. A1, A2, Two epochs of spatially circumscribed sleep spindle
oscillations. Electrode ch2 was 300 μm deeper (layer V) than electrode ch1 (layer IV). The bottom trace is a high-passed (0.5–5 kHz) derivative of trace
ch2. B, A larger putative pyramidal cell ( pyr) and a smaller putative interneuron (int) were recorded simultaneously. Note a well developed sleep spindle
in layer IV in A1 (vertical dashed line). Note, however, that rhythmicity in layer V neurons is better expressed after rather than during the layer IV spindle
(arrows). Rhythmicity of the interneuron was more often overt than was the rhythmicity of the field potentials (e.g., A2). The pyramidal neuron
occasionally discharged action potentials of decreasing amplitude (complex spike burst in B, pyr). The interneuron fired rhythmic bursts (arrows), often
with a 300 –500 Hz intraburst frequency ( B). C, Fields ch1 and ch2 are spike-triggered averages by the interneuron. D, The autocorrelograms of the
interneuron (int) and pyramidal cell ( pyr) and cross-correlogram between the interneuron and pyramidal cell ( pyr vs int). Note the better phase
correlation of the interneuron with the local spindle ch2 than with activity recorded from ch1. Note also that the discharge of the interneuron (arrow
in pyr vs int) precedes the firing of the pyramidal cell (time 0). Insets, Wide-band (1 Hz–5 kHz) averages of the putative interneuron and pyramidal cell,
respectively. Note the short duration action potential of the interneuron.

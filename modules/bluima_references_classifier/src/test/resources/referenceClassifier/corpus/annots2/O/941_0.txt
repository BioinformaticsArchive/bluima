potent as the agonists U50,488 and 8-CAC in blocking co-caine-induced up-regulation of CCR5 and HIV-1 expression
was surprising to us. Although the basis for this phenomenon
is incompletely understood, this observation suggested to us
that binding of a KOR ligand to microglial cells is sufficient
to inhibit an intracellular signaling pathway involved in
cocaine-induced up-regulation of CCR5. Support for this hy-pothesis was provided by experiments demonstrating that
treatment of microglia with either nor-BNI or U50,488 significantly inhibited cocaine-induced activation of ERK1/2 in
a manner similar to PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2
activation. Moreover, in support of the hypothesis that KOR
ligand-mediated inhibition of cocaine-induced ERK1/2 activation is related to their inhibitory effects on cocaine-en-hanced viral expression, we found that PD98059 also suppressed HIV expression in microglia, as has been previously

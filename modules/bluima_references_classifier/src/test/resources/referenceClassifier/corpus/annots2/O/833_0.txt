Hasewaga et al. describe as monomeric ubiquitinatedsynuclein. However, it is possible that monomeric -synuclein
becomes ubiquitinated at later stages of disease and is detected
in filament preparations. We found that some of the 22–24-kDa
-synuclein is phosphorylated on serine residues, whereas only
a few higher molecular mass forms were positive with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (personal observations). Which
modifications other than phosphorylation could be responsible
for producing a change in pI with a little mass increment is
currently unclear, but acetylation, methylation, or amino-terminal clipping are possible. Interestingly, a small shift in pI
was also detected in recombinant protein. Our data may also
help to explain the absence of extensive ubiquitinated
-synuclein inclusions in transgenic models because ubiquitinconjugation on -synuclein seems to occur only in the presence
of further post-translational modifications. Therefore, this
complex cellular response may represent a disease-specific
pathway which is not fully activated in transgenic models. In
this respect, identification of the relevant ubiquitin-ligase(s)
may provide insights into the cellular response to fibril formation. For example, a 22-kDa glycosylated form of -synuclein
has been reported to be poly-ubiquitinated in vitro by parkin,
an ubiquitin-protein ligase (11). Contrary to the findings of
Shimura et al. (11), we did not detect glycosylation of diseaseassociated -synuclein in extracts from sporadic LB disorders.
It remains possible that a different form of glycosylation occurs
in LB-associated -synuclein. Further purification of the 22–
24-kDa form of -synuclein will allow the characterization of
this species in more detail. More recently, -synuclein has been
shown to be a substrate for ubiquitination by UCH-L1, which,
contrary to the conventional understanding of the ubiquitin
system, acts in an ATP-independent manner (25).
Whether -synuclein is a substrate for the proteasome has
been a subject of debate (15, 16). We have previously shown
that unmodified full-length -synuclein is degraded directly by
the 20S proteasome in an ubiquitin-independent manner (8).
Because -synuclein is a natively unfolded protein, it is feasible
that in vivo, unfolded -synuclein could bypass the need for
ubiquitination and unfolding and enter the 20S proteasome
directly. The above is in accordance with the finding that other
small, relatively unfolded proteins can be degraded by the
proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (26, 27). An
earlier report (28) has shown that proteasome activity is re-duced in the SN of PD patients. Therefore, it is feasible that
accumulation of -synuclein is associated with proteasome dysfunction. However, LB-associated -synuclein is also found outside the SN; therefore, all regions should be investigated. We
found significant reduction in the proteolytic activity of the
proteasome in the SN from PD and DLB cases but not in other
regions with LB such as the cingulate and frontal cortices of
DLB cases. Furthermore, in the cerebral cortex, AD but not LB
pathology was associated with a significant reduction in proteasome function. One possible explanation for the findings in
the SN is that this brain region is more uniformly involved in
-synucleinopathies. On the other hand, in cortex the ratio of
normal to affected cells is greater, thus possibly masking the
reduction of proteasome function in cells with LB. However, the
above is unlikely to be the sole explanation, because the tissue
was taken from early stages of the disease when there was mild
to moderate cell loss. Because the protease-active sites are
buried deep in the core of the proteasome, it is possible that in
vivo regulatory regions on the outside ring, which cannot be
detected with peptidase assays, are primarily damaged. For
example, oxidative stress can lead to covalent modification of
proteasome subunits (29). These alterations may prevent the
assembly and stabilization of the multi-subunit complex or

Figure 1. Effect of oxotremorine-M on glycinergic sIPSCs of
spinal lamina II neurones
A, original tracings of sIPSCs during control, during application of 1, 3,
5 and 10 μM oxotremorine-M (Oxo), and washout in one lamina II cell.
Note that the sIPSCs were abolished by 2 μM strychnine. B, cumulative
probability plot of sIPSCs of the same neurone as in A showing the
distribution of the amplitude and interevent interval of sIPSCs for
control, during application of 3 μM oxotremorine-M, and after
washout. C and D, summary data showing that oxotremorine-M
increased the frequency but not the amplitude of sIPSCs in 16 cells.
Data presented as means ± S.E.M. ∗P < 0.05 compared with the
control.

seems reasonable to conclude that since the H' pump-containing
vesicles do not migrate with the Na'-K' ATPase, they are not
located in the basolateral membrane. Recently, an ATP-driven
proton pump has been found in endocytic vesicles (21-23),
Golgi complex (24), and rough and smooth microsomes (25)
derived from various epithelial and nonepithelial tissues. The
proton pump(s) of intracellular organelles bears many similarities
to the one described here; it is electrogenic, inhibited by NEM

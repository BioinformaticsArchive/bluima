Outlook
There are numerous physiological processes in the embryonic and adult brain in which Cdk5 seems to play a critical
role, including neuronal migration, neurite growth,
neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Cdk5 does not
contribute to normal cell cycle regulation as a typical cyclin
in either the embryonic or adult brain [6]; however, it has
recently been discovered that Cdk5 is crucial in cell cycle
suppression in embryonic postmitotic neurons and neuronal
cell lines. This function of Cdk5 might be unique and specific
to embryonic neurogenesis because current in vivo Cdk5
adult knockout models have failed to detect these effects
[7,8,20â€“22], highlighting the need for more investigation
into these paradoxical findings. For both embryonic and
adult neurogenesis, many lines of evidence support a critical
and similar role for Cdk5 in neuronal migration, neurite
outgrowth and neuronal survival [6,43,82], in contrast to
other factors, such as disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1, that
have opposite effects on neuronal migration during embryonic and adult neurogenesis [39,83]. These similarities and
differences highlight the need to continue to dissect the
fundamental and distinct regulatory mechanisms in
embryonic versus adult neurogenesis, which might be
important for many adult-onset neurological diseases.
Mechanistically, studies continue to identify many
proteins and signaling pathways to which Cdk5 is linked.
As for other key players in cellular signaling, such as
MAPKs, future studies are needed to understand the
cellular circumstances under which certain functions of
Cdk5 become active and important. In the context of adult
neurogenesis, it will be important to identify the targets
that lead to reduced survival and impaired migration or
dendrite extension. This identification is complicated by
the fact that biochemical analysis of knockout cells in vivo
is extremely difficult, given the fact that the relative
number of newborn cells is only a small fraction of the
tissue within the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Therefore,
current approaches only try to phenocopy the effects of Cdk5
inhibition, for example by deletion of DCX or other promising target genes. Furthermore, there is a strong need for
better culturing methods for adult NSCs. Current
approaches using neurosphere or monolayer cultures of
NSCs have been extremely useful in identifying signaling
pathways that regulate adult NSC proliferation or neuronal
differentiation [84], but it is challenging to use these in vitro
approaches to assess neuronal migration, directed neurite
growth or later steps of neurogenesis such as survival or
synapse formation because these processes are highly de-pendent on the integrity of the neurogenic niche. Therefore,
causal linkage of Cdk5 to up- and downstream pathways
requires advanced in vitro models of adult neurogenesis to
mimic the niche of the adult brain and cell-specific manipulations of Cdk5 activity within the adult brain.

Glucose transport activity of Past-A
To determine whether Past-A is a functional sugar transporter,
we measured transport activity of Past-A in the presence of
radiolabeled sugar molecules. Expression of Past-A in COS-7
cells led to a 4.1-fold increase in D-glucose transport activity
compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4 A). Uptake could be
blocked by cytochalasin B, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian
glucose transporter isoforms (data not shown). Transfection with
GLUT4 cDNA as a positive control produced a 6.7-fold increase
in glucose uptake. Expression of Past-A also increased uptake of
galactose but not sucrose and fructose in the same cells. The
expression of Past-A (82 kDa) at the plasma membrane was
confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the
N-terminal peptide of Past-A (Fig. 4 B). Western blotting with
anti-GLUT4 antibody showed a band of 45 kDa, as expected.
To examine the glucose transport activity of Past-A after
changes in extracellular pH, either protonophore, an agent that
collapses the pH gradient across the cell membrane, was used or
cells were incubated in culture medium with an excess of H ,
thus inducing lower pH in the medium. Glucose uptake activity of
Past-A was decreased significantly when the concentration of the
protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCC P) was increased gradually from 1 to 25 M (Fig. 4C),
suggesting that an intact proton gradient was critical for the

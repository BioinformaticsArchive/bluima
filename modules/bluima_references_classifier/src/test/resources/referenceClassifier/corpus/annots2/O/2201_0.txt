centiles of the population of cells generated on a given
developmental day. Therefore, 50% of the radioactively labeled
neurons lie within the cortical positions spanned by the bar.
The upper, solid horizontal bar denotes the GABA-immunoreactive neurons, and the bar with cross-hatching represents the
nonimmunoreactive neurons. The median position of all the
GABA-immunoreactive neurons or nonimmunoreactive neurons generated on each day is represented by the arrowhead on
each horizontal bar. For example, in Figure 6A (neurons generated on E22), 50% of the GABA-immunoreactive neurons
reside in the region between lower layer V and lower layer VI
(width of the bar), and the median laminar position is approximately the middle of upper VI (arrowhead). Also, 50% of the
nonimmunoreactive neurons generated on this day are found
between the middle of lower layer VI and upper white matter,
and the median position is in the white matter.
In looking at the histograms (Fig. 6) across the days of neurogenesis, it is found that GABA-immunoreactive neurons follow an inside-out pattern of cell production similar to that seen
for neurons that are not GABA-immunoreactive. Although there
are slight differences in the laminar distribution between the
GABA-immunoreactive and nonimmunoreactive neurons generated on the same day, the distribution of the 2 subpopulations
generated on most developmental days is fairly similar. However, one difference observed is that the early-generated (E22E30) neurons in layer I and upper layer II-III (which are the
exception to the inside-out pattern) consist almost entirely of
GABA-immunoreactive neurons.
The inside-out gradient of cell production is even more ob-vious when we look at the median positions on different de-velopmental days (arrowheads in Fig. 6). The median positions
of the GABA-immunoreactive neurons are more superficially
located in the cortex, in most cases,than the median positions
of the nonimmunoreactive neurons (7 out of 8). However, the
median positions of the 2 subpopulations are very close in at
least one-half of the animals. Using the median test (Siegel,

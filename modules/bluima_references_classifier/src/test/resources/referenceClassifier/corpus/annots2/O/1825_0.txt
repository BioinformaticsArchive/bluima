Fig. 5. Possible neural coding mechanisms underlying syllable order selectivity. In each row, schematic drawings of simplified amplitude envelopes of
BOS (left column) and its roBOS (middle column) are shown on the bottoms,
and the expected neural responses (PSTHs) to those stimuli are shown on the
top. The degree of syllable order selectivity obtained from the neural responses
is indicated in the right column. BOS stimulus starts with three introductory
notes, which are followed by simplified syllables labeled with lower case
letters. (A) A model with a neural integration time window with fixed
duration. Dotted rectangles represent integration time windows with fixed
duration. Note that a song with syllables longer than the neural integration time
window leads to low syllable order selectivity (top) and vice versa (bottom),
while song with a mixture of syllable lengths is likely to have intermediate
order selectivity (middle). (B) A song that contains similar syllables can also
lead to low order selectivity, regardless of neural integration time.

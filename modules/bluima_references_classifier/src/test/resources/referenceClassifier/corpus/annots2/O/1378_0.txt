Single-labeling immunocytochemistry

TonEBP immunolabeling was performed on 20 m free floating
sections, using a 1/50,000 dilution of a rabbit antiserum raised
against the N-terminal 473 amino acids of TonEBP (Miyakawa et al.,
1999), biotinylated goat IgG anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, USA), avidin– biotin–peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA), and DAB

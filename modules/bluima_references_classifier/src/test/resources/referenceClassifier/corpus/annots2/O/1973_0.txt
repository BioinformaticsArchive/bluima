ASTROCYTIC MEMBRANE
PROPERTIES SUPPORT
NEURONAL PHYSIOLOGY
Although not equipped with the cellular
machinery necessary for generating action
potentials, an astrocyte exhibits changes in
its electrical properties that are essential for
supporting normal neuronal activity. Astrocytes express inward rectifier K+ (Kir) channels
(15), which maintain the astrocytic membrane
potential close to the equilibrium potential
of K+. Thus, when extracellular K+ rises,
K+ ions flow into astrocytes through these
inward rectifiers. Astrocyte-specific knockout
of Kir4.1, the major Kir channel in these glia,
results in seizure activity and premature death
(16). Astrocytes also express Ca2+-activated
potassium channels (BK channels), which
allow for coupling of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling
(discussed below) to the release of K+ from
astrocytic endfeet onto blood vessels (17).
Astrocytes express a number of electrogenic neurotransmitter transporters such as
glutamate (18), GABA (19), and glycine (20).
Not only is the uptake of transmitters necessary for maintaining the fidelity of synaptic

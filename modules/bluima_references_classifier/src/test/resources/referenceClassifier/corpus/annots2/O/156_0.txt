LTP in the DG
The level of potentiation in the HFS group was significantly
different from zero at all the times tested (Fig. 2; 30 min, t(9) =
5.09; p < 0.001; 90 min, t(9) = 5.12; p < 0.001; 150 min, t(9) = 4.5;
p < 0.01; 180 min, t(9) = 5.04; p < 0.001). Because there was a
significant increase in the levels of LTP over time, we included a
non-HFS group that received only test stimulation over the same
duration of time as the HFS group. There was a significant
difference in the level of potentiation between the HFS and the

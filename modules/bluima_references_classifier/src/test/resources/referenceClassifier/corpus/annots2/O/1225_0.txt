disorders or language/reading disabilities.
Stimuli and tasks. The stimuli and tasks were described in detail previously (Booth et al., 2002). In both the spelling and rhyming tasks, three
words were presented sequentially, and the participant had to determine
whether the final word matched either of the two previous words according to a predefined rule. In the spelling task, participants determined
whether the final word had the same rhyme spelling as either of the first
two words. The rhyme included all letters after the first consonant or
consonant cluster (Bowey, 1990). In the rhyming task, participants de-termined whether the final word rhymed with either of the first two
words. Participants indicated their judgment by pressing one of two

trials contained a target word that rhymed and was orthographically
similar to one of the preceding two words [i.e., had the same rhyme (like

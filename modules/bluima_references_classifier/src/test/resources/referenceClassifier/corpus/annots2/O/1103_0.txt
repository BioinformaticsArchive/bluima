Discussion
The potential of CNS OLPs to also generate neurons and/or as-trocytes is a subject of considerable debate (Liu and Rao, 2003;
Noble et al., 2004; Rowitch, 2004). Most studies have focused on
either the spinal cord or optic nerve, and to our knowledge, none
have directly examined the differentiation and self-renewal po-tential of embryonic ventral forebrain PRPs. We demonstrated
that the neurosphere assay is a novel, simple, and useful way of
studying factors that regulate the differentiation and self-renewal
of PRPs. We found that at E14 PRPs are restricted to the MGE;
have the capacity to generate neurons, oligodendrocytes, and as-trocytes; and are distinct from EGF-responsive NSCs in several
respects. The latter conclusion is supported by the observations
that PDGFR and EGFR are expressed by separate populations
within the MGE and that dissociated MGEs cultured in the presence of PDGF plus EGF yields significantly more neurospheres
than either factor alone. Furthermore, when differentiated in
FBS, the progeny of PRPs differentiate into neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas EGF-generated progeny differentiate into
neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes; PRPs are not selfrenewing when passaged into EGF or PDGF (whereas EGF NSCs
are); and the progeny of PRPs are highly motile compared with
EGF-generated progeny.
One of the fundamental findings of this study is that ventral
forebrain PRPs have the potential to generate neurons and that
these neurons arise from a common neuron/oligodendrocyte
precursor that can be induced to undergo neuronal differentiation with BMP-2 and oligodendroglial differentiation with T3.

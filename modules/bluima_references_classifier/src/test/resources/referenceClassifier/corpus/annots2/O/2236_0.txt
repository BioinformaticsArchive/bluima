Fig. 6. (A) and (B) Two clusters of labeled pyramidal cells in lamina V of the somatosensory cortex of
a neonatally brain damaged hamster which received injections of WGA-HRP in the contralateral SC. (C)
A plot of such cells in 4 sections (spaced at 200 Frn) through the somatosensory cortex. All of the labeled
neurons are in lamina V and the dashed lines denote the borders of S-I.

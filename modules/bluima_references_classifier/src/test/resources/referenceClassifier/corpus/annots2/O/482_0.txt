FIG. 3. Correlation between hypocretin-1 levels, wakefulness, SWS, REM
sleep and brain temperature. (a) Mean sleep and brain temperature data of
eight animals were correlated with hypocretin levels measured at 2-h
intervals. Hypocretin levels are clustered to dark (filled symbols) and light
periods (open symbols). Stepwise analysis revealed that brain temperature
level in the dark phase (filled circles) is the only variable that significantly
correlated with hypocretin-1 (P < 0.05), and hypocretin-1 was not
significantly correlated with wakefulness, SWS and REM sleep. This trend
was observed when data for each animal was analysed independently as
well as in one representative animal with 1-h bin sampling (b).

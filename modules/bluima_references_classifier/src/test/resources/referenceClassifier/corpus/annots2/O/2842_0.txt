(Table 1), and the virus isolated from the paralyzed mice was
LDV-C free of LDV-P (data not shown).
The finding that nonneuropathogenic LDVs rapidly outcompeted the neuropathogenic LDVs during a persistent infection
of either ADPM-susceptible or nonsusceptible mice suggested
that the neuropathogenic LDVs are impaired in their ability to
establish a persistent infection. This conclusion has been di-rectly proven by monitoring the time course of replication of
LDV-Câ€“EPD in FVB mice (Fig. 6). The LDV titer in plasma
at 1 day p.i. was as high (109.5 ID/ml) as those observed with all
LDV strains (Fig. 2), but thereafter it decreased much more

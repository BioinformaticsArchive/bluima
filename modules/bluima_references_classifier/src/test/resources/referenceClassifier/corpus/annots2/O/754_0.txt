Introduction

Prolactin (PRL) secretion is tonically inhibited by hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons (1,2), also known as catecholaminergic area A12 (3).
The axon terminals of TIDA neurons are known to project
to the external zone of the median eminence (ME) (4,5),
where dopamine (DA) is released into the hypophysial portal circulation (6). In turn, PRL regulates its own secretion
via a short-loop feedback mechanism (7), as demonstrated
by increased ME DA synthesis (8), turnover (9), and release
(10,11), resulting in increased DA levels in portal plasma
(6), after PRL treatment.
Studies on the TIDA neurons in genetically PRL-deficient animals, such as Ames (df/df; [12]), Snell (dw/dw;
[13]), and Snell-Jackson (dwJ/dwJ; [14]) dwarf mice, have
suggested a role for PRL in the development of the TIDA
neurons (15). All these dwarf mouse types bear recessive

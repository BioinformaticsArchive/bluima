Double in situ hybridization was used to characterize the phenotype of adenosine A receptor mRNA-2A

containing neurons within the striatum, as previously
described by Le Moine and Bloch.47
In the dorsal striatum, a large majority (95–96%)
of the adenosine A receptor mRNA-containing
2A

medium-sized neurons co-expressed preproenkephalin A mRNA and dopamine D receptor mRNA.

In addition we found a few neurons (3–6%) that
co-expressed mRNAs encoding dopamine D recep- 1

tors or substance P (Table 1). Only a minute proportion of the large neurons (0–2%) that expressed
choline acetyltransferase or dopamine D receptor
2

mRNA contained adenosine A receptor mRNA
2A

(Table 2).
In the ventral striatum (i.e. nucleus accumbens and
olfactory tubercle), a large majority (89–92%) of
neurons co-expressed adenosine A receptor
2A

mRNA and preproenkephalin A mRNA (Table 1,
Fig. 6a,a*). An even higher degree of co-localization
was found between adenosine A receptor and
2A

dopamine D receptor mRNAs (93–95%) (Table 1,
2

Fig. 6b,b*). In agreement with the situation in the
dorsal striatum, only a minor subpopulation (5–11%)
of the neurons that contained adenosine A recep-2A

tor mRNA co-expressed dopamine D receptor or
1

substance P mRNAs (Table 1, Fig. 6c,c*,d,d*) and
very few (0–3%) of the large neurons that were
positive for choline acetyltransferase mRNA or
dopamine D receptor mRNA co-expressed adenos- 2

ine A receptor mRNA (Table 2, Fig. 7a,b).
2A

A subpopulation of neurons that was positive for
adenosine A receptor mRNA, but not for pre-2A

proenkephalin A mRNA was found in clusters (4 to
15 neurons) (Fig. 8a). These clusters were confined to
the nucleus accumbens where they were encountered
along the border of both the shell and core parts
(Fig. 8c).
Along the border of the nucleus accumbens and
the olfactory tubercle, a major subpopulation of
neurons expressing preproenkephalin A mRNA, but
not adenosine A receptor mRNA, was found (Fig.
2A

8b,d). It consisted of clusters of 10 to 500 denselypacked neurons. In the nucleus accumbens, but not in
the olfactory tubercle, the individual neurons in these
groups appeared smaller than the surrounding
neurons. Within similar areas, groups of neurons
expressing mRNA for dopamine D receptor and
1

substance P, but not for adenosine A receptors
2A

were also found. However, no large groups of
dopamine D receptor mRNA containing neurons

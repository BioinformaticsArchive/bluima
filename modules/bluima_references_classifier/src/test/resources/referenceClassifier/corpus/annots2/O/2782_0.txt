Figure 9. Desynchronization with reduced network connectivity. Same as
Figure 8, except that Msyn = 30 instead of 60. The network dynamics is
asynchronous, as seen by the scattered distribution of firing rates (A), the
disordered rastergram (C), the small fluctuations of the synaptic field (B),
and flat cross-correlations (D). This asynchronous state is further characterized by small values of kij (E, F), the linear function of the network
averaged k(t) (G), and its flat derivative (H).

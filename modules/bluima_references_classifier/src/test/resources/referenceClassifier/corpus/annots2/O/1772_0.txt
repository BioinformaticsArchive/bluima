Steroid Manipulations of Neonatal Rats

Androgenization of Female Pups. To determine whether the
sex-related differences of i.t. morphine analgesia were the result of
the developmental (organizational) effects of steroids, neonatal rats
were subjected to gonadal ablation during neonatal day 1. As de-scribed previously (Cicero et al., 2002), female pups were randomly
injected s.c. with testosterone propionate dissolved in sesame seed oil
(500 g in 30 l) or 30 l of sesame seed oil itself. At 23 days of age,
the pups were weaned and housed three to a cage until they were
tested as adults (250 –275 g b.wt.).
Neonatal Orchiectomy. As described previously (Cicero et al.,
2002), male pups from a given litter were either castrated or shamoperated. The pups were taken from their mother and put on a glass
plate on top of ice. When they became motionless and pale (around
15–20 min), surgery was done under a dissecting lens with a light
source. A single small skin incision was made just below the abdomen with a small pair of sharp scissors. A blunt pair of forceps was

The relationship between brain beta-adrenergic receptors and adaptation to
stress was studied in rats subjected to repeated restraint stress. The stress was found to
produce a reduction in the density of these receptors in the hypothalamus, cerebral
cortex and brain stem. This change first appeared after 4-7 days and persisted for the
duration of the two-week stress. Adaptation, as judged by resistance to the anorexic
and gastric lesion-inducing effects of the stress, occurred progressively over the full
two-week period. The loss of beta-receptors was found to correlate positively with the
degree of adaptation. The relationship was strongest for the hypothalamus but was
also apparent in the cortex and brain stem. These findings support the hypothesis that
a reduction in the number of brain adrenergic receptors is one of the biochemical
factors underlying adaptation to stress.

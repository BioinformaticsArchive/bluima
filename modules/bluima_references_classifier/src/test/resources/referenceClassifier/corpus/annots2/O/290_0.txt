Relative increases in catalase expression between tissues in transgenic animals as compared to control tissues are as indicated: 0 = no
difference; + = marginal or < 2 fold; ++ = modest or 2 to 5-fold;
+++ = large or >5-fold; nd = not done.
aWestern analyses of spleen from PCAT and NCAT1 mice are not
shown.
bNorthern analysis of NCAT2 mice are not shown.
cThe absence of message in NCAT2 spleen coupled with an increase
in catalase activities in this tissues is likely due to low levels of
transgenic message being efficiently translated into protein.

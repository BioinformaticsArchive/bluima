Figure2. 5-HT and DOI caused inward currents. A, Concentration-response curves were generated by determining the amount of hyperpolarizing
current needed to offset the drug-induced depolarization (inward current). Membrane potential was -65 to -70 mV. S-HT (squaresw)as applied
in the presence of PBD ( 1 PM) to block the hyperpolarization and cocaine (10 PM) to block reuptake. DO1 (circlesw) as applied with no added drugs.
The EC,, values for 5-HT and DO1 were 21 and 2.6 nM, respectively. Data points represent from three to five determinations. Error bars represent
SEM. B, Current-voltage relationship for DOI (solidcircles),as compared with control (opencircles)was determined under voltage clamp. DO1
caused a nonreversing inward current and a slight increase in cell resistance. Holding potential was - 57 mV, with hyperpolarizing and depolarizing
step increments of 10 mV and 500 msec. Current was measured at the end of the step.

14, 27, 29) and are similar to those presented
for cells in the cat's brain stem auditory nuclei
(2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 32). In the primary auditory
cortex of cats at least, neurons demonstrating
summative interactions are the more common, with four independent studies reporting
that such neurons comprise between about 50
and 65% of neurons studied ( 10, 11, 19, 29).
Although the present data on the relative proportions of binaural cell types in the posterior
auditory field must be regarded as preliminary,
the fact that summative neurons were the
more common suggests that this feature of
binaural stimulus processing has been preserved by this field of the cat's auditory cortex.
Similarly, the heterogeneous monaural properties of summative neurons and the manifestations of posterior-field neuron sensitivity
to variations in interaural disparities in time
and intensity are similar to those previously
reported for cells in the primary auditory cortex (6, 27, 29). Thus, sensitivity to interaural
phase delays was demonstrated in periodic,
cycling relations of spike count to interaural
delay, while sensitivity to interaural intensity
disparities was manifested as either a sigmoidal
or peaked relation of spike count to disparity,
with the shape of the function being correlated
with the nature of the inputs from the two
ears. These data suggest that there has been
no major modification of the processing of
static binaural tones of a kind that would distinguish this field from the other two (AI and
A) that have received quantitative study. The
apparently heightened spectral-amplitude se-lectivity of posterior-field neurons seems,
therefore, to have been achieved without cost
to their sensitivity to stimulus laterality.
Coding of interaural time and
intensity disparities
Brugge and his colleagues (5-7) have, in
their studies of the binaural interactions of
central auditory neurons, emphasized the im-portance of the temporal organization of
monaural inputs to binaural neurons in im-parting sensitivity to interaural disparities in
time and intensity. The present data confirm
that view but complement it by indicating the
contribution of the nature of the monaural
inputs (e.g., subthreshold or suprathreshold,
excitatory or inhibitory) to the same sensitivity. This point is perhaps best illustrated in
the case of sensitivity to interaural disparities

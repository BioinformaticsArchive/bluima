Figure 5. Comparison of ephrinA4 –Fc binding and EphA4 mRNA ex-pression in P6 striatum. Adjacent coronal sections were incubated with ephrinA4 –Fc f usion protein ( A) or processed
for in situ hybridization for EphA4
mRNA ( B). A, Bright-field micrograph
showing the binding pattern of ephrinA4 –Fc. B, Dark-field micrograph showing in situ hybridization of EphA4
mRNA. Asterisk s indicate corresponding areas between the two adjacent sections that lack ephrin-A4 –Fc binding
and EphA4 message. a, Anterior commissure. Scale bar, 500 μm.

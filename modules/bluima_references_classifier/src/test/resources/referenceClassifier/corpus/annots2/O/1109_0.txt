INTRODUCTION
Ischemic brain injury often results in complex pathophysiological events including excitotoxicity, peri-infarct
depolarizations, inflammation, and programmed cell
death, ultimately leading to the detrimental loss of
neurons. In transient global ischemia the delayed neuronal death has been observed in selectively vulnerable brain
regions such as the hippocampal CA1 region and caudate
putamen [1]. During reduced cerebral blood flow, a
mismatch between energy requirements and availability
lead to excessive release of the amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate into the extracellular space. Excessive
activation of glutamate receptors such as N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA/kainate receptors, which are
expressed on CNS neurons, leads to massive influx of Na+
and Ca2+ and triggers cell death [2,3]. These sequelae of
events that ultimately lead to neuronal loss in the
vulnerable brain regions is termed excitotoxicity.
An increased understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia
has enabled therapeutic interventions at certain points

Regulatory Pattern of Id2 mRNA Expression
After SCI
Unlike Id1, Id2 mRNA was expressed at a detectable
level in normal or sham spinal cords, and was mostly
restricted to the gray matter of the spinal cord (data not
shown). After injury, Id2 mRNA expression in spinal cord
sections 5 mm distal to the lesion center was upregulated
in a survival time-dependent manner with maximal ex-pression being observed 3 days pci (Figs. 1, 3A). The
number of Id2 mRNA+ cells in spinal cord did not

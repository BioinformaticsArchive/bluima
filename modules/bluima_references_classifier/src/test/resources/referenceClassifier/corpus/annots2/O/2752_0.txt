(1992) and de Vries et al. (1994). It is pertinent to
recall that certain vasoactive substances, like
histamine (Dr6ge et al., 1986) or catecholamines
(Coutinho et al., 1991) were shown to augment
interleukin-2 production and the activation of
cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
Endothelial cells in the brain are capable of
presenting autologous myelin basic protein, an
encephalitogen implicated in the pathogenesis of
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Wilcox
et al., 1989). When microvessels were isolated
(Miyatani et al., 1990) from rats, the presence of
sulphated glucoronyl glycolipid antigens --- reacting
with myelin-associated glycoprotein - - was detected.
The finding has implications to the pathogenesis of
certain neuropathies, in which there are monoclonal
antibodies reacting with myelin-associated glycoprotein. Immunization of rhesus monkeys with a
cerebral endothelial cell-derived membrane fraction
resulted in the development of a chronic or a
relapsing neurological illness resembling multiple
sclerosis (Tsukada et al., 1987, 1988). On the other
hand, Sharief and Thompson (1992) emphasized the
role of cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-a,
in the mediation of BBB disruption. Indeed, adhesion
of lymphocytes to mouse brain endothelial cells were
seen (Hughes et al., 1988; Goodall et al.. 1992;
Waldschmidt et al., 1991) to be modulated by the
class II major histocompatibility molecules and by
ICAM-1. Moreover, it is important to mention that
activated CEC can be lysed by CD4-positive, myelin
basic protein-specific encephalitogenic T cell line
(McCarron et al., 1991a).
The A I D S virus was shown (Barnes, 1986) to be
selective for endothelial cells in the brain, whereas
endothelial cells elsewhere in the body were not
infected. This finding may be relevant in the
pathogenesis of brain damage evoked by the AIDS
virus.
Unique features of CECs to endothelial cells of
other organs are summarized in Table 2.

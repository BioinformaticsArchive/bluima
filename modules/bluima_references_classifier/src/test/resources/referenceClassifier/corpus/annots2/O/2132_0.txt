into these areas occurring after lesions of cholinergic pathways
(Crutcher, 1987).
Despite the well-established presence of NGF and NGF-R in
the adult brain, it is not clear whether NGF is required for the
maintenance and function of developed forebrain cholinergic
neurons. However, it has been shown that exogenously administered NGF is able to affect forebrain cholinergic neurons trophically after axonal injury. During the past years, we have
studied the effects of intraventricular administration of NGF to
adult rats with partial transections of the fimbria, which result
in a partial lesion of the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway.
This pathway was chosen because it represents the best characterized part of the ascending cholinergic projections from the
basal forebrain and because the axons are easily accessible for
lesioning in the fimbria. Partial, rather than complete, lesions
of this pathway were chosen so as to be able to study the effects
of NGF on neuronal cell bodies in the septum as well as the
effects on surviving axons in the hippocampus. Furthermore,
partial lesions also leave a natural bridge between septum and
hippocampus through which severed axons might regenerate.
Initial observations revealed that intraventricular injections of
NGF to such animals elevate both hippocampal and septal ChAT
activity (Hefti et al., 1984; Will and Hefti, 1985). Later, we
found that the partial fimbrial transections resulted in a retrograde degeneration of part of the group of septal cholinergic
neurons projecting to the hippocampus and that chronic in-traventricular injections of NGF prevented this lesion-induced
degeneration (Hefti, 1986). Similar findings were obtained in
animals with complete transection of the fimbria (Kramer, 1986;
Williams et al., 1986).
Since our initial reports, antibodies against NGF-R have be-come available (Chandler et al., 1984), permitting direct visualization of NGF-responsive cells by immunohistochemical
procedures. These antibodies were used to establish that NGF
directly affects cholinergic neurons. The initial studies, in which
cholinergic neurons were identified with acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) histochemistry, did not exclude the possibility that NGF
treatment did not improve survival of the cells, but only upregulated the expression of AChE. This question was addressed in
the present study by giving NGF after an interval of time sufficient to result in the disappearance of both cholinergic marker
enzymes, ChAT and AChE, and by testing whether the delayed
treatment induced the reappearance of the cells. We also as-sessed whether chronic application of NGF was required for the
rescue of cholinergic cells or whether initial treatment of NGF
after lesioning was just as effective. Furthermore, we analyzed
whether NGF treatment resulted in permanent survival of cholinergic neurons; additionally, we tested whether NGF affects
GABAergic septohippocampal neurons.

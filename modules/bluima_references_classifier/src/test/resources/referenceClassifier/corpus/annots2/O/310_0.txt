chronic alcohol intoxication damages the brain (Crews,
1999; Hunt and Nixon, 1993; Sullivan et al., 2000). Human
studies that use computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of human brain repeatedly have shown en-largement of the cerebral ventricles and sulci in most alcoholics (Crews, 1999). The enlargement of the ventricles and
sulci essentially reflects a shrinking of the brain mass. This
is consistent with studies on postmortem brain tissue,
where alcoholics have a reduction in total brain weight
(Harper and Kril, 1993). Animal studies have found that
long-term ethanol intoxication is not necessary to cause
brain damage. Studies have shown that as little as a few
days of intoxication can lead to neuronal loss in several
brain areas of adult rats (Collins et al., 1996). These findings are consistent with recent human studies that report
damage to entorhinal cortex (Ibanez et al., 1995) and significant hippocampal shrinkage in alcoholics (Harding et
al., 1997). Animal studies have indicated that chronic
ethanol-induced hippocampal damage correlates with deficits in spatial learning and memory (Franke et al., 1997).
Essentially all of these studies have been done in adults.
Human adolescents are consuming alcohol, and there is
virtually no information on alcohol neurotoxicity in adolescents nor are there studies that compare adolescent to
adult alcohol-induced brain damage.
In this study we used a binge model of alcohol treatment
previously characterized to cause physical dependence,
gene induction, and alcohol-induced brain damage (Collins
et al., 1998; Knapp and Crews, 1999; Majchrowicz, 1975).
Heavy alcohol consumption is common among regular al-cohol abusers and alcoholics. A blood level of 400 to 500
mg/dl is very sedating and can be lethal to na√Øve ethanol
users; however, heavy alcohol abusers and alcoholics regularly achieve very high blood alcohol levels. One patient's
history of blood levels from multiple police reports ranged

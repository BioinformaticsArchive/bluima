was developed to provide further control over the experimental conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) and to avoid
metabolism of the test substance during transfer across
the BBB. Compared with single or multipassage methods, permeability coefficients can be measured accurately over a 104-fold range (Takasato et al., 1984) making this method 100-fold more sensitive. Therefore,
measurements of brain uptake of poorly penetrating
compounds (P 10 8 to 10 7 cm s 1) or rapidly penetrating compounds (P 10 4 cm s 1) can be determined allowing for the characterization of carrier-mediated transport at the BBB (Smith et al., 1984). The
involvement of complex surgery and the requirement of
mathematical models are the main disadvantages of the
perfusion models (Takasato et al., 1984; Enting et al.,
1998)
Although a number of experimental approaches have
been developed to quantify transport of compounds from
the blood into the CSF, many of these methodologies
have proven to be inaccurate or do not produce useful
data. In addition, the experimental procedure is quite
complex and requires a certain amount of surgical skill
and experience. The more common methodologies in-clude the CNS deconvolution technique (van Bree et al.,
1989) and the in situ CP model (Ames et al., 1964). The
CNS deconvolution technique is based on serial sampling of the CSF and numerical deconvolution of data to
determine a transport profile of the drug in a single
living animal. The in situ CP model replaces the endogenous CSF with oil such as ethyl iodophenylundecylate,
which allows the CP to be easily visualized. The fluid
droplets that are formed on the surface are collected and
a steady-state clearance fraction of the drug can be
determined (Ames et al., 1964).

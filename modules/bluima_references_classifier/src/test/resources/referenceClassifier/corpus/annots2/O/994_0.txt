tive of each response type. The chopping behavior and time
course of initial depolarization is clearly evident. Examples of
single intracellular traces to CF tones, as well as peristimulus
time histograms (PSTHs) with CV measures (Fig. 1, A2–C2),
show that these cells' response characteristics are consistent
with previous intracellular descriptions and PSTH-based classification of VCN stellate cells (Blackburn and Sachs 1989;
Palmer et al. 2003; Paolini and Clark 1999; Rhode and Smith
1986; Rhode et al. 1983; Smith and Rhode 1989; Young et al.
1988). As expected, the latency of depolarization and the first
AP decreased with increasing tone SPL in individual cells. The
dynamic range of the latency of depolarization was lowest for
O neurons and was associated with a narrow depolarization
C

band for the first evoked AP (Fig. 1C). Although O neurons
C

had higher thresholds, both neuron types (C and O ) had
S/T C
similar latencies for depolarization across a range of SPLs
when tones were presented at CF (Fig. 1, D, F, and H). This
was also reflected in AP generation (Fig. 1, E, G, and I).
However, when referenced to CF threshold, O neurons
C

showed significantly faster average depolarization latencies
than C neurons at 0 and 10 dB above threshold (respectively,
S/T
t 3.2 and t 2.17, P 0.05; Fig. 1J). There was also a
24 25
tendency for O neurons to have faster initial AP latencies than
C

C neurons at all SPLs; however, a significant difference was
S/T
only observed at 30 dB above threshold (t 2.1, P 0.05).

In response to CF tones, the activation threshold for O cells
C

is elevated relative to C cells (Fig. 1, D–G, vertical dashed
S/T
lines), but similar depolarization and first AP latencies occur in
both cell types (Fig. 1, H and I). Thus at CF, inhibition would
arrive after the first AP in C cells because there is a short
S/T
synaptic delay. However, we would predict that the relative
timing of inhibition and excitation would be different to off-CF
tonal frequencies because D stellate neurons are broadly tuned.
At frequencies removed from CF, O cell activation threshold
C

would be lower than T stellate cells with similar CFs. In this
situation, it would be possible for D stellate cells to inhibit T
stellate cells before initiation of their first AP.
This expectation was confirmed by examination of the in-tracellular traces and contour plots depicting regions of hyperpolarization and depolarization in C neurons to off-CF
S/T
tones. In the two neurons shown in Fig. 2, A–H, fast, shortduration inhibition is apparent at frequencies removed from CF
and occurs before generation of the first spike. Inhibition of
this type at frequencies removed from CF was observed in 60%
(12/20) of T stellate cells tested at 80 dB SPL. Figure 2E shows
that, if inhibition arrives during depolarization in response to
an off-CF tone, the course of depolarization is altered (asterisk)
and it takes longer for the cell to reach AP firing threshold
(arrow); that is, the first AP is delayed. The time course of this
inhibition precisely matched that previously described for D
stellate inhibition produced by contralateral click stimulation
(Fig. 2D, top, red trace) (Needham and Paolini 2003). In these
same two cells, a long time base reveals an additional long
latency, slow and sustained hyperpolarization to off-CF tones
(Fig. 2, I and J, top and middle). Sustained hyperpolarization of
this type was observed in all T stellate cells in which fast
inhibition was also observed. In addition, it was sometimes
observed in the absence of fast, short-duration inhibition (Fig.
2, I and J, bottom). These two hyperpolarization events have
different latencies and time courses, and this is particularly

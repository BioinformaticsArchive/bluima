MATERIALS AND METHODS
Optic Nerve Transection in the Rat

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 –10 weeks old, 300 g) were deeply
anesthetized (50 mg/kg xylazine and 35 mg/kg ketamine), and their left
optic nerves were exposed by lateral canthotomy. The conjuctivae were
incised lateral to the cornea, and the retractor bulbus muscles were
separated. Through a small opening in the menings ( 200 m), the
nerve fibers were completely transected at a distance of 2–3 mm from
the globe. The procedure was performed without damage to the nerve
vasculature and optic nerve blood supply and with minimal damage to
the meninges by the use of a specially designed glass dissector with a
200- m tip and a smooth blunt edge (45). The injury was unilateral in
all animals, and the other eye served as a control.

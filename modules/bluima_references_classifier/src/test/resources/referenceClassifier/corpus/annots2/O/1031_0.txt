by the Fenton reaction (Liu et al., 2004). These observations
are in line with the concept that declining O2 concentrations
trigger the hypoxia response as a result of decreased ROS
intermediate production. The NAD(P)H oxidase as the major
donor of ROS would at the centre of this model convert PO·
to a redox signal. How this signal is transduced to HIF- is not
known. While ROS clearly affect the redox state of the cell and
thus thioredoxin and Ref-1 function (see above), it is of interest
to analyze whether ROS signaling in these settings interfaces
with PHD function. Interestingly, ROS have, for example, been
shown to interfere with mitochondrial function, affecting
enzymes of the Krebs cycle at the level of -ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase (KGDH) and SDH (Nulton-Persson and
Szweda, 2001), which may influence 2-oxoglutarate levels (see
above).
In contrast, during hypoxic events, mitochondria have been
suggested to be the major source of ROS formation at complex
III (Chandel et al., 1998) aiding HIF- stabilization (Chandel
et al., 2000; Hirota and Semenza, 2001). The issue of
mitochondrial ROS formation is controversial, however, as
other groups have reported that the decreasing mitochondrial
membrane potential is associated with a reduction in
mitochondrial ROS formation (Lee et al., 2001; Jones et al.,
2000). Other reports have shown a general ROS decrease in
hypoxia (Görlach et al., 2003) and further documented that a
functioning mitochondrial respiratory chain may not be
necessary for HIF- regulation (Vaux et al., 2001; Srinivas et
al., 2001). In addition, hypoxic signal transduction may require
kinase/phosphatase activity in certain cell types (Wang et al.,
1995b; Zundel et al., 2000; Mottet et al., 2003; however,
contrast Alvarez-Tejado et al., 2002). Up to now, the putative
corresponding phosphorylation targets such as HIF- ,
transcriptional coactivators or the presented mediators of the
oxygen-sensing pathway, have not been identified.
It is worth mentioning that not all ROS-mediated pathways
on HIF activity are part of an oxygen-signaling response, but
rather expression of a delicate integration of oxygen-sensing
mechanisms into major signaling pathways. Extracellular
signals like growth factors and cytokines have been shown to
increase NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated ROS formation (Görlach
et al., 2000a), with subsequent HIF stabilization under
normoxic conditions (Richard et al., 2000; Haddad and Land,
2001). However, this mode of activation seems to be cellspecific.

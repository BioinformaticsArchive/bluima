Administration of drugs
Anaesthesia was induced and maintained by administration of a
single dose of urethane; it was very unusual for supplementary
urethane to be required following induction. Neurophysiological
recording did not commence until at least 2 h following this initial
anaesthetic dose. After a period of recording under urethane
anaesthesia alone, Etomidate (HypnomidateTM; Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium) was incrementally administered by i.p.
injection to give sequential doses of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg. These
doses were administered at 500-s intervals because early experiments
suggested that this time interval was sufficiently short to provide
incremental increases in dose but sufficiently long to allow the effects
of each new dose to reach a plateau. The effect of increasing
administration of Etomidate on evoked responses by cells in the
dorsal column pathway, and on cortical mass responses, was
measured. This range of doses of Etomidate was chosen because,
while Janssen et al. (1975) showed that intravenous injection of
Etomidate had an ED50 of 0·57 mg/kg in rats, Linton & Price (1983)
found that the effective intrarectal dose of Etomidate was » 10 times
this value. Thus we measured the susceptibility of afferent
transmission to Etomidate across a range of concentrations which
previous studies have shown to be effective in altering the behaviour
of conscious rats.
In order to discount the possibility of its having an effect, in some
experiments we administered 35% propylene glycol in water at an
equivalent dose to that contained in the vehicle for injection of 10 mg/
kg Etomidate.

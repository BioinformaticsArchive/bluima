During arousal states typical of information processing, electroencephalographic activity is characterized by low-amplitude fast
activity, called activation, which contrasts with the largeamplitude regular and slow activity typical of quiescent states
(Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949). Activation is produced by the
release of several neuromodulators in the thalamus and cortex.
For instance, during arousal, cells in the brainstem laterodorsal
tegmentum increase their firing rates (Steriade et al., 1990),
releasing acetylcholine in the thalamus (Williams et al., 1994),
which depolarizes thalamocortical neurons (McCormick, 1992),
increasing their spontaneous firing rates in the tonic firing mode
and enhancing the transmission of low-frequency sensory inputs
through the thalamus (Steriade, 1969; Singer, 1977; Steriade et
al., 1997; Sherman and Guillery, 2001). The postsynaptic depolarization of thalamocortical neurons during arousal also strongly
facilitates the transmission of high-frequency sensory inputs
through the thalamus (C astro-Alamancos, 2002a,b), which are
normally filtered during quiescent states. In addition, the in-creased firing rate of thalamocortical neurons during arousal
leads to the activity-dependent depression of thalamocortical
synapses producing thalamocortical sensory suppression (CastroAlamancos and Oldford, 2002). Thus, during aroused states,

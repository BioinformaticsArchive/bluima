tion of CD4+ cells and the development of opportunistic in-fections or lesions typically observed in SIV-infected macaques
(26, 28, 29). In contrast, opportunistic infections and giant-cell
inflammation were shown to occur less frequently in the in-fected rhesus macaques (Table 2). The development of disease
in these animals was not dependent upon the origin of virus
(CSF versus MLN), suggesting that both viruses were highly
pathogenic. All animals were tested for the presence of STLV
by nested-PCR amplification of genomic DNA according to
published methodologies (30), and all were determined to be
negative (data not shown). DNA isolated from the lymph node
of FGb was used as a positive control.
As observed with the initial transfusion animals, the pigtailed macaques in this second cohort developed disease more
rapidly than the rhesus macaques, with the mean time to sacrifice being 4.8 months for the pig-tailed macaques and 16.5
months for the rhesus macaques. Evidence for the differential
levels of development of disease was observed by monitoring
the CD4+ cell levels in these animals (Fig. 2). By comparing
levels between rhesus (Fig. 2A) and pig-tailed (Fig. 2B) ma-caques, it can be seen that the depletion of CD4+ cells oc-curred much more rapidly in the pig-tailed macaques. This was
similar to the results observed with the initial transfusion co-hort (data not shown), reaffirming that the pig-tailed macaques
appear to be more sensitive to disease development with these
viruses.
Neurologic involvement. Clinical evidence of neurologic disease was observed in the last month of life for three of the six
pig-tailed macaques in this second cohort. However, neurologic signs were not observed in any of the six rhesus macaques.
Neurologic signs included head tilt, tremors, incoordination,
and behavioral abnormalities such as cowering and unresponsiveness.
To investigate the extent of SIV infection in the lymphoid
tissues and in the CNSs of these macaques, samples of lymphoid and brain tissue were used for histopathological studies.
In situ hybridization was used to determine the presence of
viral RNA in the lymph nodes and brains of all infected ma-caques. Results of these analyses are depicted in Fig. 3, which
shows representative sections of lymph node and brain following hybridization with antisense SIV riboprobe. All macaques
were examined in this manner; however, due to space constraints, the results from two rhesus and two pig-tailed ma-

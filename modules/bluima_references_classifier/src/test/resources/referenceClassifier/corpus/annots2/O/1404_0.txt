Intact animals

Prior to surgery, all animals were anesthetized by injecting 50 mmol
(1–3 mL) magnesium chloride (MgCl2) into the foot musculature.
Once injected, MgCl2 immediately paralysed the foot musculature.
Each animal was then placed on a dissection tray with its foot facing
downwards. Tentacles were pinned down to the bottom of a dissection
dish and the shell was pulled backwards. A dorsal midline incision
was made to expose the central ring ganglia. Using a fine, fire-polished
glass pipette, the central ring ganglia were exposed and a pair of fine
forceps was used to crush the axon of interest. As shown in Fig. 1A,
crushes were made either between the right pleural and parietal
ganglia (the experimental), or at the left parietal–pleural connective
(the control). In subsequent experiments, a sharp glass microelectrode
was used to remove selectively the RPeD1 somata, whereas in control
experiments we selectively killed left pedal dorsal 1 (LPeD1). It is
important to note that the size, position, location and axonal
projections of LPeD1 are mirror images of RPeD1 (Kyrikides et al.,
1989); however, it does not participate directly in the respiratory
behavior (Syed, 1988; N. I. Syed and W. Winlow, unpublished data).
No suture was considered necessary and the animals were returned to
well-aerated tanks and allowed to recover from surgery.

their distal dendrites could be observed clearly (Fig. 6 A). They
had round somata ;15 μm (10 –30 μm) in diameter. They usually
had three to six primary dendrites, which often branched close to
the soma and formed bushy structures. The extremely fine dendrites were 50 –250 μm long and were beaded with large varicosities (Fig. 6 B). In two cells, the axon was visible and provided
evidence that the type I cells project to lMAN. In one DLM
neuron, the axon exited the anterior border of DL M and could be
followed approximately half the distance to lMAN. The axon of
another DL M cell coursed anteriorly, traversing a portion of
DL M, but left the plane of the slice before crossing the border
of DL M. Because this axon did not make prof use local collater-

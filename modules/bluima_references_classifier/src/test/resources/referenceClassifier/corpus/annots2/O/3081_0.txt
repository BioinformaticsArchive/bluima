lesions centered on area 2 in rats results in an increase in IgG
immunoreactivity in the vicinity of the lesions 7 d after surgery.
Microglia immunopositive for IgG and ED-1 are, however, dramatically reduced around the lesions in the treated hemisphere.
Furthermore, pyramidal neurons that would normally shrink,
die, or disintegrate were maintained, as determined by MAP2
immunocytochemistry and Nissl staining. These survival efects
were often found in both hemispheres. The results suggest that
this peptide operates by difusion to regulate the immune re-sponse and thereby rescue neurons that would usually degenerate after cortical lesions. The phosphatase activity of this
molecule also suggests the potential for direct neuron survivalpromoting efects.

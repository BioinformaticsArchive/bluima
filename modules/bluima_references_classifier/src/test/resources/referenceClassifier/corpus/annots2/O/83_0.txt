agent (Cormet et al., 1995). These previous observations suggest that at least some of the new quinolones are transported
by P-gp. Therefore, we suspected that the low distribution of
HSR-903 to the brain might be at least partly due to active
efflux via P-gp.
In the present study, we studied the brain distribution of
HSR-903 using various in vivo and in vitro methods to clarify
the mechanism(s) underlying the low permeation of HSR-903
into the brain, focusing on brain-to-blood transport.

In the median eminence, a strong staining was observed in the
external layer over the entire length of the structure (Fig. 3). The
immunoreactivity was confined to nerve fibers endowed with
large swellings. The fibers were located mainly around the portal
capillaries.
A medium-strong immunoreactivity was observed in fibers
throughout the suprachiasmatic nucleus (Fig. 2 B). No stained
perikarya were detected in this structure. Single perikarya and
nerve fibers were occasionally observed scattered in the cortex
and hypothalamus (Fig. 2 D).

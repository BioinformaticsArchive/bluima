NIH3T3 cells together with a reporter gene (pNloxZ), in which
the expression of β-galactosidase depended on recombination
mediated by Cre recombinase. We selected several stable transformants with little β-galactosidase expression. Treatment of
these cells with synthetic steroids Org 31806 and Org 31376
(Bakker et al., 1990; Vegeto et al., 1992) induced the expression
of β-galactosidase, indicating that the Cre recombinase activity of
the constructed f usion protein is inducible by these antiprogestins
(Fig. 1 B).
We chose the 5' region of the GluRe3 subunit gene to express
Cre recombinase selectively in cerebellar granule cells. Figure 2 A
schematically shows the mouse GluRe3 gene (Nagasawa et al.,
1996). The 5' upstream region contains consensus sequences of
Sp1 and EGR-1 binding motifs and some repetitive sequences.
The coding sequence of CrePR protein was inserted into the
translational initiation codon of the mouse GluRe3 gene. We
injected the CrePR gene under the control of the 10 kb 5' region
of the GluRe3 gene (ECP expression vector) into eggs of
C57BL /6 strain. Among 19 transgenic lines, two lines showed
strong signals in RT-PCR analysis of cerebellar RNA, and six
lines exhibited weak signals. RNA blot hybridization analysis
showed that one line (EC P25) strongly expressed the CrePR
mRNA in the cerebellum (Fig. 2 B). The size of the major RNA
species (;3.3 kb) is as expected for the CrePR mRNA. There was
no detectable expression in the forebrain. Southern blot hybridization analysis showed that the ECP25 line contained approximately three copies of intact EC P vector (12.5 kb) in the genome
(Fig. 2C). The integrated vector DNA in the EC P25 line was
stable for at least three generations.

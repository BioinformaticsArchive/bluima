SDF-1 expression was selectively increased in endothelial
cells of penumbral blood vessels and decreased in endothelial
cells of nonlesioned brain areas. In the penumbra, SDF-1
upregulation was associated with a concomitant infiltration of
CXCR4-expressing peripheral blood cells, including macrophages. Neuronal SDF-1 was transiently downregulated and
neuronal CXCR4 was transiently upregulated in the nonlesioned cerebral cortex in response to ischemia. Although en-dothelial SDF-1 may control cerebral infiltration of CXCR4carrying leukocytes during cerebral ischemia, the neuronal
SDF-1 /CXCR4 system may contribute to ischemia-induced
neuronal plasticity. Thus, the isoform-specific regulation of
SDF-1 expression modulates neurotransmission and cerebral
infiltration via distinct CXCR4-dependent pathways.

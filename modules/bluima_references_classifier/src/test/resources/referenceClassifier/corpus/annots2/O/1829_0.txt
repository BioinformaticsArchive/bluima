Introduction
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are defined by their ability to self-renew
and give rise to mature progenitors of neural lineages. The ability
of NSCs to migrate to diseased areas of the brain (Snyder and
Macklis, 1995; Aboody et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2003; Shah et al.,
2005) and their capacity to differentiate into all neural and glial
phenotypes (Gage, 2000) provides a powerful tool for targeting
the treatment of both diffuse and localized neurologic disorders.
Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of NSC transplantation in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, in-cluding spinal cord injury and brain tumors (Snyder and Macklis,
1995; Ehtesham et al., 2002; Lindvall et al., 2004; Hofstetter et al.,
2005; Iwanami et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2005). Taking advantage of
their homing properties, NSCs have also been modified to deliver
selective anti-neoplastic proteins (Ehtesham et al., 2002; Shah et
al., 2005), but with mixed results. Although these studies demonstrate the feasibility of NSC-based therapy, cellular delivery of

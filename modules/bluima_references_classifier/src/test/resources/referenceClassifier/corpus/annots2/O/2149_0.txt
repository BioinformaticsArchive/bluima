Fig. 4. Discharges of two individual nucleus Z neurones with a tendon-organ-like pattern
of discharge. Responses were recorded during muscle contraction soleuss) in response to
single shocks and tetanic trains of stimuli (80 pulses/s) applied to the combined L7 and
S1 ventral roots. Upper trace neuronal discharges, lower trace tension. In A is shown
the response to a twitch, in B to submaximal tetanic stimulation. Note that the two
smaller action potentials of the second cell seen in A are absent in B. Maximum tetanic
stimulation (C) recruits activity from both cells and there is no further significant increase
in activity with supramaximal stimulus strengths (D).

features are identified within the overlap region
by performing a normalized cross correlation
within a small search space centered on the
image feature. The translation that best spatially matches up the feature correspondences
for the maximum number of features from each
pair of images in the mosaic is calculated. The
set of the best alignment translations is then
used for determining the position of each
image within the mosaic. The assembled
images are then combined into one full-scale
color mosaic image (Figs. 1 and 3). As shown
in Fig. 4, the accuracy of the alignment and
normalization routines results in the nearly
seamless stitching of adjacent tiles. For 3D
imaging, the process is repeated for each widefield image plane in Z.
The stitching algorithms currently run on
Wintel PCs, equipped with a little over 2 GB of
RAM, and 2–3 Ghz processors. Stitching takes
approx 0.4 s/pair of images. A 50 × 50 mosaic
requires approx 30 min for assembly. The
largest dataset we have processed to date is

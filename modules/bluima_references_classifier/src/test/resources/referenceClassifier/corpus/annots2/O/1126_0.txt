IKHT contribution to spike waveform is frequency dependent
The ability of IKHT to function primarily in the high-frequency
range of the Fâ€“I relationship resulted from a frequencydependent contribution of IKHT to spike parameters. At low frequencies, the removal of IKHT had a relatively small effect on
spike parameters, whereas at higher frequencies the impact was
much larger. The difference in contribution that becomes appar-

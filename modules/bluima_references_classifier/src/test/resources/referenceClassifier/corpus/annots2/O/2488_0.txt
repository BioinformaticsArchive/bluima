In some experiments a pair of stimulating
electrodes was inserted approximately 2 mm into
the head of the caudate nucleus under visual
control.
All stimuli were rectangular pulses of 0.1 ms
duration, applied through photoisolated constantcurrent stimulators. During searching, current
was passed through the six electrodes of each
array (thalamic and collicular) connected in
parallel to the cathode, with the anode connected
to a silver wire wrapped in saline-soaked gauze
and inserted into the mouth or embedded in the
dorsal neck muscles. During testing, each collicular and thalamic electrode was connected
sequentially to the cathode for monopolar stimulation, and stimulus intensities did not exceed
300 @A. In two experiments, test stimuli were
applied bipolarly between adjacent collicular or
thalamic electrodes.

procedures and analysis
Recording electrodes were glass micropipettes
filled with 2 M potassium acetate saturated with
fast green dye (Matheson, Coleman, and Bell).
They were inserted at an angle of 30-45‚Äù from
the sagittal plane, and most recording was extracellular. Extracellularly recorded action potentials considered to be of somatodendritic origin
were initially of negative or negative-positive
configuration, but with prolonged recording they
sometimes increased in amplitude and had an
initial positivity , presumably as the electrode tip
was in close approximation to the cell membrane
(see Fig. 3). In the latter instances, action potentials at some point showed an A-B inflection.
Signals were amplified by conventional methods
and recorded on kymographic flm, and amplitude
and latency were measured from the projected film.
Criteria fur untidromic activation
Neurons activated antidromically from thalamic
or collicular sites of stimulation were identified
by the following criteria: I) action potentials
followed each stimulus of a train applied at frequencies of 3001s or higher; 2) action potentials
showed a latency variation of less than 0,2 ms
(often no measurable variation) when the stimulus
intensity was reduced to a value that straddled
threshold; 3) when spontaneous activity was
present, a stimulus-evoked response occurred
only if the stimulus followed a spontaneously
occurring spike at an interval equal to or greater
than the evoked (presumed antidromic) spike
latency plus some time for a refractory period.
In agreement with the data presented by Fuller
and Schlag (16), this minimum spontaneous
stimulus interval usually was slightly less than
the sum of the antidromic latency and the re-fractory period when the refractory period was

Similarly, more upstream in the signal flow, the desired
force FiD is also calculated as the algebraic sum of two
signals: (1) the premotor signal .i which is the desired
D


velocity .D with the appropriate sign (see below); and (2)
the output signals QGi issued from the side-circuit which
computes an approximate inverse function of Gi.
The input signal received by the internal model Gi* is
an internal estimate FiD* of the desired force which acts on
Gi itself. It is calculated by adding QGi and .i , the desired
D


angular velocity of the movement of the articulation.

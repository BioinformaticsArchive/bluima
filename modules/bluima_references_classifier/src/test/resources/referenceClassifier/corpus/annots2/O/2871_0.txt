The feline Sg seems to be a thalamic nucleus with
unique multisensory properties. It contains cells re-sponsive to changes in visual, somatosensory, auditory and noxious sensory circumstances in a rather
large receptive field. The sensory properties of the Sg
show a high level of similarity to those reported
either in the associative areas in the ventral bank of
the AES and in the insula4–6,9,26,33,34,37,38,46,47 as well
as in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior
colliculus,13,31,43–45 i.e. in the main input and output
structure of the Sg, respectively. The physiological
role of Sg thus can be formulated in a way that it
could be a thalamic relay or processing nucleus in the
tecto-thalamo-AES/insular pathway, a sensory route
that runs parallel and independently of the primary
sensory pathways. The finding that a structure
with rather definite input and output properties is
committed to the processing of several sensory
modalities can be explained by the concept on the
action-oriented mechanisms proposed originally by
Trevarthen48 and reintroduced recently by Goodale
and Milner.12

detected by anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (1:10,000) in 5% BSA. Peroxidase activity was visualized by
means of chemiluminescence. Blots were exposed to FUJI medical x-ray
film (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Band intensity was obtained by
scanning autoradiograms on a DC-120 digital camera (Eastman Kodak,
Rochester, NY) with a 3 diopter lens and analyzing the image using the
Kodak 1D gel analysis program. Immunoblots were quantitatively analyzed by taking the ratio of the optical density (OD) of the phosphoERK2 band to the OD of the total ERK2 band. That ratio was used to
calculate the percentage of change in ERK2 activation of IGF-I versus
vehicle-treated HYP slices run on the same gel.
Radioligand binding assays. To provide sufficient material for Scatchard
analysis, tissue from two rats given identical hormone injections and drug
treatments was combined. POA and HYP samples were homogenized
separately in 5 ml of ice-cold Tris-MgCl2 buffer (50 mM Tris HCl and 10
mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) using a Polytron at speed 5–6 for 20 sec. The
homogenates were centrif uged for 10 min at 20,000 g, the supernatant
was discarded, and the pellet containing the membrane fraction was
frozen at 70°C until assay. Freezing of the crude membrane fraction
does not result in a measurable loss of any NE receptor subtype (Etgen
and Karkanias, 1990).
The radioligand 3H-prazosin (87 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear) was
used to measure total 1-adrenoceptor binding in brain membranes. To
distinguish 1A and 1B-adrenoceptor subtypes, chlorethylclonidine
(CEC; Research Biochemicals), a selective, irreversible inactivator of the
1B-adrenoceptor, was used. Frozen membranes were resuspended in 6
ml of Na-HEPES buffer and split into two equal fractions. Each fraction
was preincubated for 10 min at 37°C with vehicle or with 10 M CEC.
Reactions were stopped by addition of 6 ml of ice-cold Na-H EPES buffer
and centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 g. The supernatant was
discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of Tris-MgCl2 buffer.
For Scatchard analysis, duplicate 200 l aliquots were incubated for 20
min at 37°C with 0.05–5 nM 3H-prazosin with and without a 2000-fold
excess of phentolamine to assess nonspecific binding. Specific 3H-prazosin binding after CEC inactivation reflects the 1A-adrenergic
receptor population. The 1B-adrenoceptor population was determined
by subtracting the binding of 3H-prazosin after CEC inactivation from
total specific 3H-prazosin binding. Bound and free 3H-prazosin were
separated by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (FPB-148 Whatman GF/B) on a Brandel (Gaithersburg, MD) cell harvester as described
previously (Petitti et al., 1992). Ligand affinities (Kd), apparent receptor
numbers (Bmax), and Hill coefficients were calculated using the EBDA
ligand program (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Experiments used
tissue from OVX control and EB-primed female rats infused chronically
with either saline or JB-1 and were repeated four times.
LH radioimmunoassay. Concentration of LH in serum was determined
using primary antibody for rat LH (1:30,000; National Hormone and
Pituitary Program) and 125I-LH (3000–5000 cpm/100 l; Covance Laboratories, Inc., Vienna, VA). Secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG,
was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Concentration of rat LH was
expressed as ng RP-3 per ml, provided by the National Hormone and
Pituitary Program. Animals were maintained on a reverse 14:10 light/
dark cycle with the lights off at 11:00 A.M. Trunk blood samples were
collected when the animals were decapitated at 8:00 P.M., allowed to clot
overnight at 4°C, then centrif uged at 2000 g for 30 min. Serum was
decanted into polypropylene tubes and frozen at 20°C until analysis.
Concentrations of LH in 100 l aliquots of serum were determined in
triplicate. Incubation periods between additions of primary antibody,
radioiodinated hormone, and second antibody were 24 hr at room temperature. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.05 ng/tube, and samples were
run in two separate assays. The intra-assay and inter-assay variances were
6 and 18%, respectively.
Reproductive behavior testing. Animals were maintained on a reverse
14:10 light/dark cycle with the lights off at 11:00 A.M. OVX female rats
were primed with EB for 48 hr as described previously followed by 500
g of progesterone 4 hr before behavior testing. Animals were tested
once a week for 3 weeks after receiving one of three treatments in
random order: (1) multiple infusions of JB-1 (4 g/1 l) dissolved in
saline, (2) multiple inf usions of 1 l of saline, or (3) multiple inf usions of
JB-1 (4 g /1 l) followed by a single inf usion of 8-bromo-cGM P (1 g /2
l) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) administered 4 hr before behavior
testing. Separate groups of rats received a single acute infusion of JB-1
(4 g/1 l) given either at 12 or 4 hr before testing (12 hr, n 6; 4 hr,
n 4). Experienced stimulus male rats were placed in 20 gallon glass
arenas and allowed to adapt for 10 min. Females were then placed in the

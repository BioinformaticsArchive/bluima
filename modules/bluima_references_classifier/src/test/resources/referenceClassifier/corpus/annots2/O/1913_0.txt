Perfused rat brains were removed, fixed in paraformaldehyde
overnight, sliced coronally, and mounted on Superfrost-plus slides
(Fisher Scientific). In situ hybridization was performed as follows:
Sections were (a) dried on a slide warmer for 30 min at 37 °C, (b)
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)
H2O for 20 min, (c) rinsed with DEPC PBS (2 5 min), (d) deproteinated with proteinase K treatment (50 g/ml; 1 M Tris–HCl at
pH 7.5, and 0.1 M EDTA) for 30 min at 25 °C. After deproteination,
sections were (a) rinsed in DEPC PBS (2 5 min), (b) fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in DEPC H2O for 20 min, (c) briefly rinsed in
DEPC H2O, (d) hybridized in hybridization buffer containing 3
Na ,K -ATPase oligonucleotides (antisense: CGG GAA GAG
CGG CGG ACA GGC TGG TGA GCG GTG GCC GCA GGA;
sense control: GCC CTT CTC GCC GCC TGT CCG ACC ACT
CGC CAC CGG CGT CCT) for 24 h at 37 °C in a humid chamber.
Following hybridizations, sections were washed four times in
0.2 SSC for 20 min each at 47 °C, then subjected to amplification of the labeled probes: (a) sections were blocked in blocking
protein in Tris buffered saline (TBS) for 30 min (PerkinElmer
amplification Kit), (b) incubated in digitoxigenin– horseradish peroxidase in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST; 8
l/ml) for 30 min at 25 °C, (c) rinsed in TBST (3 5 min), (d)
incubated in tyramide solution (1:50 in kit diluent) for 10 min at 25
°C, (e) rinsed in TBST (3 5 min), (f) incubated in streptevidin-F
(1:50) in TNB buffer (0.05 g/ml block protein in Tris-saline) for 30
min. Finally, sections were rinsed in TBST (2 5 min), air dried and
mounted using Vectashield Mounting Media.

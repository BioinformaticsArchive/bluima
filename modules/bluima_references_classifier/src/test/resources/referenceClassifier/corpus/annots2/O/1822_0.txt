The cellular distribution of these receptors varies, with androgen
receptors being heavily expressed in the principle cells, although they
are also found at low levels in glia (Tabori et al., 2005), whereas
estrogen receptors are more common in interneurons and glia of CA1,
but are expressed at high levels in the pyramidal cell layer of CA3 of
the rat brain (Mehra et al., 2005). In the developing human
hippocampus, estrogen receptors are found predominantly in pyramidal neurons as well as radial glia (Gonzalez et al., 2007). Endogenous
androgens are important to the development of the male CA1 and CA3
(Isgor & Sengelaub, 1998, 2003), although, interestingly, the relative
impact of estrogen vs androgen treatment on these parameters is
region specific. For example, CA1 volume is masculinized by T or E2,
but not DHT treatment, whereas CA3 volume is masculinized by T or
DHT, but not E2 (Isgor & Sengelaub, 1998). Our observation that the
number of BrdU+ cells in CA1 was masculinized (increased in
females to that of males) by treatment with T or E2, but less so with
DHT, and that more neurons and more glia were detected only
following T or E2 treatment, respectively, but not DHT, is consistent
with these previous findings. It will be of considerable interest to
determine what percentage of the sex difference in hippocampal
regional volume is contributed by the increased proliferation of
neurons and glia or decreased cell death, vs a potential involvement of
increased dendritic arborization (Isgor & Sengelaub, 2003). Moreover,
whether the steroid-modulated differences in BrdU-labeled cells that
we report in the CA1 are also present in the CA3 region remains to be
determined. We also reported a sex difference in newly born cells in
the DG at 4 days old. Neural stem cells isolated from the fetal DG
express AR and proliferate in response to treatment with an androgen
analog, an effect blocked by FLU (Brannvall et al., 2005).
Taken together, these results suggest that both androgens and
estrogens are responsible for sculpting the sex difference in hippocampal size. Both steroids increase the number of newborn cells, but
androgens preferentially support the emergence of neurons, while
estrogen promotes the presence of glia in the developing hippocampus. We cannot determine whether the effect of the steroids is
predominantly on cell genesis or cell survival, and further experiments
will be required to definitively determine the specific role of both
steroids. Understanding how both types of hormones impact the
developing hippocampus will illuminate the varied roles this brain
structure plays in a myriad behavioral and physiological responses that
are influenced by the sex of the individual.

phate buffer, pH 7.4. Homogenates were used for
determination of total protein15 and measurement of
TH activity. TH activity was determined based on
a modification of the assay as described previously.16
Briefly 25-μl homogenates were analysed in the
presence of 6-MPH4 (1.5 mM) and [3,5 3H] tyrosine
(100 μM: 1 μCi per reaction), in a total volume of
50 μl for 15 min at 37C. Unbound 3H2O was analysed
by scintillation spectrometry (Beckman LS 5000 TD).

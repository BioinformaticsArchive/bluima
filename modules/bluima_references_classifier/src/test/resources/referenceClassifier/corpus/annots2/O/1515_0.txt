Materials and Methods
Drugs. 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was a generous gift from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (Foreigner Investigator Supply
Program, Bethesda, MD). N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716A) was
kindly provided by Sanofi Synthelabo Recherche (Longjumeau, France).
[Amino[(aminophenyl)thio]methylene]2(trifluoromethyl)benezeneacetonitrile (SL327), 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (DL-AP5), picrotoxin, forskolin,
( )-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol (CP55,940), and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-3-dione
(DPCPX) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Avonmouth, UK).
THC was dissolved in ethanol, cremophor, and saline (1:1:18);
SR141716A was dissolved in Tween 80, DMSO, and distilled water (1:2:
7); SL327 was dissolved in DMSO.
Animals and drug treatment. RasGRF / and / mice originating
from the leading strain described by Brambilla et al. (1997) on a C57BL/6
background were housed in a controlled environment at constant temperature and humidity, on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with free access to food
and water. They were chronically treated with THC or its vehicle, subcutaneously administered at the dose of 10 mg/kg twice per day for 4.5 d.
This is a well known chronic treatment protocol inducing tolerance in
mice (Bass and Martin, 2000; Rubino et al., 2004). Bradykinesia and/or
catalepsy were routinely observed during the initial THC exposure. For
chronic studies with SR141716A (3 mg/kg), mice were intraperitoneally
injected 20 min before THC treatment. In chronic SL327 experiments,
mice were administered with 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally of the compound 1 h before every THC injection.
The total number of animals treated with chronic administration of
THC was n 30. The total number of animals injected with vehicle was
n 29. In the experiments using RasGRF1 / mice, the total number
of chronically THC- and vehicle-treated mice was n 16 for each group.
All animal protocols were performed in accordance with the Italian
Ministry of Health guidelines (D.L. 116/92; D.L. 111/94-B) and with the
European Community directives regulating animal research (86/609/
EEC). All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and
their suffering.
Slice preparation. Parasagittal cerebellar slices (250 â€“300 m) were prepared from 40- to 50-d-old mice following an established technique
(Levenes et al., 1998). Mice were decapitated 1 d after the final injection,
and the cerebellar vermis was rapidly removed and chilled in ice-cold
artificial CSF (ACSF) consisting of the following (in mM): 130 NaCl, 3.5
KCl, 1.2 NaH PO , 1.3 MgCl , 2 CaCl , 25 NaHCO , and 11 glucose,
24 2 2 3
saturated with 95% O and 5% CO . Slices were incubated in ACSF at
22
room temperature (RT) for 60 min before recordings. During record-

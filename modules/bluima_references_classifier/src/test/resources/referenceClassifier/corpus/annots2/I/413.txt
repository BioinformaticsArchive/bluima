of delayed-response tasks in normal subjects (Frith and
Dolan, 1996). Conversely, working memory deficits have
been recognized in several disease states and are consistently
associated with decreased functioning of the PFC (Baddeley
et al., 1991; Weinberger and Berman, 1996).
In light of the relationship between PFC neuronal activity
and working memory, positive modulation of AMPA receptors on PFC neurons may be a pharmacological approach
through which encoding of interim memories could be en-hanced. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have
reported that AMPA receptor potentiators (e.g., CX516) im-prove performance in variety of delayed-response tasks, im-plicating an action of these modulators in PFC (Sta ̈ ubli et al.,
1994a,b; Hampson et al., 1998). Similarly, recent behavioral
studies have shown that LY392098, a structural analog of
LY404187, enhances performance of rodents in a delayedresponse water maze task at doses (e.g., 10 μg/kg) that en-hance the probability of evoked discharge of PFC neurons in
vivo (Kimball et al., 2000; Baumbarger et al., 2001). Consistent with these experimental data, clinical studies have
shown that administration of potentiators can improve cognitive function in normal subjects, as well as in some disease
states (Dimond et al., 1979; Oepen et al., 1985; Ingvar et al.,
1997). The high potency of LY404187, in conjunction with its
central activity and efficacy in mnemonic models, suggests
that biarylpropylsulfonamides may be therapeutically effective as nootropic agents. At the very least, a growing body of
experimental and clinical evidence is providing proof of concept for the use of AMPA receptor potentiators in the treatment of certain forms of cognitive dysfunction.

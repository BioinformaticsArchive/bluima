Materials and Methods
Mice. Fourteen male transgenic mice, six mice harboring FAD-linked
human wild-type PS1 and eight mice harboring FAD-linked human
PS1 E9, were used in this study. Male transgenic mice harboring FADlinked PS1HWT [line S8-4 (Thinakaran et al., 1996)] or human PS1 E9
[line S9 (Lee et al., 1997)] were used at 4 –5 months of age. All mice were
heterozygous for the transgene. The background strain for these mice is
[C3H/HeJ C57BL/6J F3] C57BL/6J n1 (Lee et al., 1997).
Perforant pathway transection. Perforant pathway lesion have been de-scribed previously (Lazarov et al., 2002). Briefly, mice were placed on a
Kopf stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) after
anesthesia. An opening in the scalp at coordinates (in mm): anteroposterior, 4.6; mediolateral, 3.3; dorsoventral, 4.5 to 3.5 (from
dura), with the nose bar set at 3.5, was performed using electric drill, and
the dura was exposed. A wire knife assembly was used for precision
perforant pathway lesion. The assembly was set to the ventral extent of
the lesion ( 4.5 mm). After penetration, the knife was extended to form
a hook that extends medially for 2 mm, the assembly was raised to the
dorsal extent of the lesion (3.5 mm), and the knife was retracted, reextended, and again lowered to the ventral extent. The knife hook was
raised and lowered five times to verify complete transection of the perforant pathway; each retraction and reextension was performed to ensure
that any flexible axons stretched by the knife hook were cut. To verify the
accuracy of the lesion, crystals of the fluorescent dye Fluoro-Ruby (In-vitrogen, San Diego, CA) were dissolved in saline and introduced into the
injury site concomitantly with knife penetration.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Two weeks after perforant pathway transection, mice were perfused transcardially under deep anesthesia
with a saline solution, followed by fixative solution composed of 4%
paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.
The brains were removed and kept in fixative overnight, followed by
equilibration in 30% sucrose solution. Brains were sectioned horizontally (50 m) using a frozen-stage equipped microtome and then placed
at 20°C in cryoprotectant solution (glycerol and ethylene glycol-based
PBS). Every sixth tissue section was subject to immunocytochemistry, as
described below, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Free-floating
horizontal brain sections (50 m) were rinsed three times for 10 min
each in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), blocked using blocking–permeabilizing solution (5% donkey serum and 0.25% Triton X-100) for 1–3 h, and
incubated with mouse anti-neuronal-specific nuclear protein (antiNeuN; 1:500; mAB377; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit anticalbindin-D (1:1000; CB38; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) for 72 h
28k
at 4°C. Tissues were then rinsed in blocking solution for 2 h. Sections
were then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 2 h. Sections were
then washed three times for 10 min each in TBS and mounted on gelatincoated slides using polyvinyl alcohol–1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) mounting solution (Peterson, 2004).
Imaging and design-based stereology. Brain sections were visualized and
imaged using an Olympus (Melville, NY) Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope. Images at each wavelength were collected separately
using a separate and specific excitation filter. Image collection settings
were approximately equivalent for all specimens and were taken and
recorded using a Fluoview 2.1 program. Collection of samples for stereology was performed using the StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT). For quantitative design-based stereology

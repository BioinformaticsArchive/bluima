neurologically normal person, with a 3-3 Apolipoprotein-E (ApoE)
genotype. A: Section immunostained for ApoE. Numerous ApoE-negative neurons (arrowheads) appear surrounded by an ApoE immunopositive neuropil. (4×). B: Section nearly adjacent to the one shown
in A, immunoreacted with AT-8. Arrows point to AT-8-positive neurofibrillary tangles. (4×). C–E: Transentorhinal cortex. Comparison
between immuno-staining with AT-8 (C,E) and anti-ApoE (D) antibodies, in three sections counterstained with thionin. C: Most of the
AT-8-positive neurofibrillary tangles are seen in Pre neurons (arrows)
(4×). D: Only some extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (arrows) are
ApoE-positive. ApoE-negative neurons (stars). (25×). E: Extracellular

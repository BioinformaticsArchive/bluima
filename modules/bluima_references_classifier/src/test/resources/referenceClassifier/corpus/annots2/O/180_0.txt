Fig. 2. Distribution of growth associated
protein 43 (GAP-43) immunoreactivity
(IR) in the dorsal hippocampus of sham
and fimbria-fornix (FF) lesioned rats.
GAP-IR in sham animals (A). The inner
molecular layer and stratum lacunosum
display dense immunostaining, while
strata radiatum and oriens are lighter
stained. Note a decrease immunoreactivity in stratum oriens, stratum radiatum,
and molecular layer 2 days after the le-sion (B). Seven days (C) after the lesion,
a small recovery of staining in the stratum radiatum and the inner molecular
layer was observed, with a decrease in
stratum lacunosum. Twenty-one days
postinjury, a recovery in stratum lacunosum was detected (D). At 1 month (E)
postinjury, the GAP-43 staining be-comes maximal within the stratum lacunosum and in the stratum radiatum. Four
months (F) after the lesion, immunoreactivity for GAP-43 was lower than in
sham animals. asterisk, s. lacunosum; ar-row, inner molecular layer; r, s. radiatum; h, hilus. Scale bar for A–F = 150

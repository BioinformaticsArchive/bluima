suggestthat supraspinal control is necessary
to produce a normal pattern (27). Our earlier
results indicate that, at least in the case of
lumbar neurons, different levels of activity in
the brain stem can lead to differences in the
distribution of the directions of responsevectors(33).Thismayalsobethecaseforcervical
neurons. If propriospinal neurons are indeed
premotor neurons, their contribution to the
generation of responsevectors in motoneurons
would clearly be modulated by such descending bias. Further experiments are required to
investigate the connectivity of propriospinal
neurons, and to evaluate the relative role of
spinal and supraspinal pathways in producing
the tonic neck reflex.

latency of onset; a rapid rise in impulse frequency; a persistence of impulse firing
during the plateau of the pulse; and an abrupt termination of the discharge which is
correlated with the termination of the pulse.
In this study we have usually restricted ourselves to relatively brief pulses of up
to 3 sec. During this time the impulse discharge characteristically builds up to
a peak and then rapidly falls off to a lower level. The peak frequencies ranged from
10 to 20 impulses/sec and declined to 1-4 impulses/sec. One can therefore identify
this as a phasic response property of the olfactory receptor. The subsequent adaptive
properties of the receptors during longer duration pulses will be described in the
following paper.
A second main result of this study is that there is a clear and relatively stereotyped
relationship between the receptor response and odour concentration. In general,
impulse firing frequency increases with increasing odour concentration. The firing
frequency ranges from approximately 1-3 impulses/sec at threshold, up to 20 im-pulses/sec at the highest concentration.
Units differed in the concentration range to which they were sensitive. Some units
showed response changes, from threshold to near maximum, over a concentration
range as small as 0 5 log units. Other units were sensitive over a range of as much as
4 log units. Thus, it appears that the majority of individual receptors transmit
information about stimulus concentration. This information appears to be encoded
in the initial period of the impulse response to an applied odour, and different
receptors vary in their sensitivity and dynamic range.
An interesting finding was that with increasing concentration the onset latency
of the response typically decreased. This property, however, varied considerably
for the whole population of units. In some units the latency change was limited to
about 300 msec, while in others a change of 1-2 sec could occur. The concentration
range over which these changes took place also varied, being as narrow as 0*5 log
units or as wide as 4 log units. This could be seen in the very steep or very flat curves,
in which latency was plotted against concentration (see Fig. 10). In a few receptors,
the latency of onset was very brief, from 20 to 125 msec.
Thresholds also varied for different units for different stimuli, from as low as
3.5 x 10-10 M for guaiacol to as high as 3-7 x 10-5 M for n-butanol. These ranges for
threshold values are similar to those previously reported for frog olfactory receptors (Getchell, 1974a). The thresholds of different units to the same stimulus, or of
different stimuli to the same unit, could vary by as much as 4 log units. The variation
in threshold may reflect in part the different numbers of molecular receptors for
a given odour on the membrane of different receptor cells (Getchell, 1974; Getchell
& Getchell, 1974). It should be noted that this is the concentration calculated from
the flow dilution within the calibrated olfactometer, and we have no direct information about the actual concentration within the mucosa or at the mucus-receptor
membrane interface. The physicochemical factors which may directly influence
concentration gradients of olfactory molecules in the mucus have been discussed
elsewhere (Getchell & Getchell, 1977; Hornung & Mozell, 1977). The present values
are of added significance in being obtained under precisely controlled stimulus
conditions.
A characteristic finding was the abrupt termination of the discharge. In the main

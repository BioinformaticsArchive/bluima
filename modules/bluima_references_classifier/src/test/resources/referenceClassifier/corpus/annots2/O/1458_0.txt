time had a significant effect on the number of observed doubleinfected neurons, both as a function of the survival time after
PRV-152 as well as the PRV-BaBlu injections (Fig. 5).
To determine the relative contribution of each region to
sympatho-motor control, cell counts from each area were di-vided by the total number of double-infected cells detected in

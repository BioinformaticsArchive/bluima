Figure 3. Recall of real versus imaginary memories. Sagittal (a) and axial (b) images from a `glass brain', showing that anterior medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10) and
posterior parietal cortex, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, are preferentially engaged by the recall of real memories (D. Hassabis, D. Kumaran and
E.A. Maguire, unpublished). (c) These activations can be seen on a sagittal section of an averaged structural MRI scan.

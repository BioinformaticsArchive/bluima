METHODS

Cats weighing between 3 and 3-5 kg were used. A detailed description was
previously given in this Journal of the methods used for (a) perfusion from a lateral
cerebral ventricle to cisterna magna (Feldberg et al. 1970), (b) collection of samples of
cisternal c.s.f., (c assaying them for prostaglandin activity on the rat fundic preparation, (d) submitting them to thin layer chromatography, (e) recording rectal tempera.
ture and (f) dissolving paracetamol and indomethacin prior to their intraperitoneal
injections (Feldberg et al. 1973).
For injections of 0. 15-0.3 ml. 0- 9 % NaCl solution, or of artificial c.s.f. into the
lateral ventricle, different methods were used. The Collison cannula, implanted into
the lateral ventricle under aseptic conditions in pentobarbitone sodium anaesthesia,
had a shaft of I1I mm instead of the usual length of 12.5 mm in order to avoid injury
to the caudate nucleus. Or, to avoid injury and subsequent chronic inflammation
of the ventricular walls by the implantation, a shaftless Collison cannula was used,
and screwed into the skull at the same point at which the cannula with a shaft would
have been implanted. The injections were then made through the cannula with a
hollow needle 24 mmn long so that its tip entered the lateral ventricle. The results
were the same with these different methods. In most experiments a cannula with a
shaft of I11 mm was implanted and the cannula was flushed with 0- 3 ml. 0- 9 % NaCl
solution every second or third day and always on the day before the experiment.
For the experiment itself the injection was made through a fine hollow needle
inserted through the length of the cannula shaft, but not beyond it. For this purpose
the cap of the cannula was exchanged for a freshly sterilized one with the hollow
needle already inserted for part of its length through the rubber diaphragm of the
cap. The needle was attached to a syringe with a polyethylene tube and filled with
the salt solution to be injected,

RESULTS

Intravenous injection of nitroglycerin caused a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in arterial pressure in both the
sham-operated control dogs and in the dogs with denervated. hearts (Fig. 1). Arterial pressure in the shamoperated group fell from 109 t 8 to 74 t 6 mmHg (P <
0.05) in response to the nitroglycerin, whereas the cardisc-denervated group exhibited a decrease from 101 t
5 to 62 t 5 mmHg (P < 0.05). Heart rate of the shamoperated dogs increased from a control value of 92 t 8 to
142 t 6 beats/min (P < 0.05) in response to the hypotension (Fig. 2). The cardiac-denervated dogs, however,
showed no significant change in heart rate (99 t 7 to 102
t 7 beats/min) after nitroglycerin injection.
In response to the hemorrhage while conscious, average heart rate of the sham-operated dogs increased from
91+ 10 to 111 t 16 beats/min (P < 0.05), while the heart
rateof the cardiac-denervated group went from 105 t 4
to 108 t 5 beats/min (not significant) as illustrated in
Fig. 3. Arterial pressure in the sham-operated groups
decreased from 87 t 3 to 79 t 6 mmHg (NS) and in the
cardiac-denervated dogs from 91 t 3 to 87 t 3 mmHg as
shown in Fig. 4.

patients with NVC of the RVLM (28 –30). Venous catecholamines, however, constitute only insensitive measures of
sympathetic activity that are influenced by many factors, such
as efferent neural activity, synaptic transmitter release, re-uptake mechanisms, and regional blood flow (30,31). Furthermore, sympathetic outflow to all organs is not uniform, and
local, organ-specific increases and decreases in sympathetic
activity can occur with different reflexes and in different disease states. Venous norepinephrine levels merely represent the
algebraic sum of these changes and thus convey rather imprecise physiologic information.
Therefore, to gain more precise, quantitative, and reproducible information on sympathetic activity (32), we used the
microneurographic approach of directly recording sympathetic
outflow to muscle vascular beds— that is, a district where
peripheral vascular resistance is largely determined. We also
performed measurements of cardiac sympathovagal balance by
spectral analysis of heart rate variability. The results were
unequivocal: sympathetic nerve activity to muscle was almost
twice as high in patients with hypertension with NVC than in
those without NVC. Furthermore, resting levels of heart rate
and the LF/HF heart rate variability ratio tended to be higher in
the NVC group as well, indicating that enhancement of
central sympathetic outflow in these patients is not solely
restricted to the peripheral resistance vessels but might be
directed to the heart, too. Although this measure of sympathovagal balance in cardiac regulation did not reach significance
in our study, it is in line with the results of another group (27).
Because MSNA responses to lower-body negative pressure
were not different between the two groups, the higher level of
resting sympathetic activity in the NVC patients cannot be
explained by a decrease in cardiopulmonary baroreflex sensitivity. This finding most likely rules out the hypothesis of an
NVC-induced blockage of cardiac vagal C-fibers with resulting

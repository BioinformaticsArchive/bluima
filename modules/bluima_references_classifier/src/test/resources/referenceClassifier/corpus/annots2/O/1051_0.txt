rhythmic behaviour in mammals (Anden et al., 1970; Taylor et al.,
1994).
In the present study, we first establish for one group of animals that
l-DOPA injections can be used to elevate locomotory activity. We
then explore for another set of eels the possibility that their recovery
from spinal cord transection can be influenced by l-DOPA-induced
activity. We also track axonal growth, because we have shown
previously for the eel (Doyle et al., 2001; Dervan & Roberts, 2003)
that the striking spontaneous behavioural recovery that follows
complete spinal cord transection depends on the passage of axons
into the denervated cord.

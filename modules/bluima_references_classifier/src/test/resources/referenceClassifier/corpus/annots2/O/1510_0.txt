bath application (10 lm, 3 min) was cessation of firing and change
in membrane potential (DV). We studied the effects of muscimol at
two time points: acutely, i.e. within 10 s of the first sign of a
muscimol effect (cessation of firing), and at 60–110 s. In males,
there were no significant changes in the membrane potential at 10 s,
but a sustained depolarization (DV = +6 ± 1.48 mV, one neuron per
rat, paired t-test, P ≤ 0.005) was noted in 11 / 12 neurons, at 60–
110 s. In females, muscimol produced a transient, brief early
hyperpolarization in 6 / 8 SNC neurons (DV = )4.1 ± 1.5 mV),
which was significantly different from the resting membrane
potential prior to muscimol application (paired t-test, P = 0.01). At
60–110 s, the membrane potential returned to baseline or was

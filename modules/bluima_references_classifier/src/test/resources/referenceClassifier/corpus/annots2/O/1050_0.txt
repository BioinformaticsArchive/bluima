Non-operated rats displayed a high density of c-fos immunoreactive nuclei, localized in
the caudal area postrema and the dorsolateral and dorsomedial aspects of the nucleus of
the tractus solitarius (NTS), following the injection of CCK (Fig. 1). On the co-ordinates
of Paxinos & Watson (1986) the nuclear staining present in the AP extended from
Interaural -5*30 caudally to Interaural -4*40 rostrally. The most densely stained region
of the NTS was the medial nucleus (defined by Shapiro & Miselis, 1985), an area where
gastric vagal afferent fibres are known to terminate (Kalia & Sullivan, 1982). Minimal
staining was evident in the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract in non-operated rats.
None of the rats showed any nuclear staining in either the NTS or AP following saline
injection. Sections from sham-operated rats injected with CCK displayed striking
nuclear staining in the AP and NTS, indistinguishable from that observed in nonoperated controls injected with CCK (Fig. 1). Capsaicin treatment (30 min) either
completely ablated (n = 4) CCK-induced c-fos expression or markedly reduced it to a

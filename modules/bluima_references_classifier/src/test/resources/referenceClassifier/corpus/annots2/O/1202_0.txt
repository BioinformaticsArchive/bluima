Fig. 2. Inflammatory reaction and cGMP accumulation in eEAE rats. (A) Semithin longitudinal section of a control immersion-fixed optic nerve showing axons
(one indicated by white arrow), glia (one indicated by small arrow) and a blood vessel (bv). (B) Nerve from an eEAE rat, displaying normal axonal and glial
morphology in spite of extensive inflammatory cuff formation around the blood vessel (demarcated by small arrows). The long arrow points to an invading
macrophage; the short white arrow indicates an astrocyte. (C) Control nerve immunostained for OX42, showing resting microglia. (D) Optic nerve from an eEAE
rat showing activated microglia. (E) T-cell immunostaining (OX34+) in longitudinal frozen section from an eEAE rat. Positively stained cells are seen both around
the blood vessel and in the parenchyma. (F) Macrophage and / or microglia staining (OX42+) around a blood vessel and in the parenchema in eEAE optic nerve.
(G) iNOS staining in eEAE optic nerve. (H) Confocal microscopic image from an eEAE optic nerve incubated (60 min) in the presence of IBMX (1 mm) and
l-arginine (100 lm) and costained for iNOS (green) and cGMP (red). (I) Normal optic nerve incubated with IBMX (1 mm) and l-arginine (100 lm) and exposed
to 1 mm DETA-NO (60 min), stained for cGMP. The inset shows a normal nerve incubated without DETA-NO. Scale bar (in I), 17 lm (A and B), 19 lm (C and D),
51 lm (Eâ€“G), 10 lm (H,I).

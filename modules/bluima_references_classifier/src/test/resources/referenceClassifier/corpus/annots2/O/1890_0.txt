neurons were intensely stained. In the basal ganglia,
small neurons in the caudate nucleus (Fig. 3e) and the
putamen and large neurons in the globus pallidus were
immunoreactive (Fig. 30. In the thalamus, various
groups of moderate-sized neurons were immunostained
(Fig. 3g). In the hippocampus, pyramidal cells and their
processes were densely stained (Fig. 3h). The most
intense immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was seen in
CA3 and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. In the amygdaloid complex, intensely immunoreactive large multipolar
cells were found (Fig. 3i). In the cerebellum, immunoreactivity was found in all 4 major cell types (Fig. 3j) and
in the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cells showed the most
intense immunoreactivity; their dendrites and axons were
also immunoreactive (Fig. 3k). In the midbrain, immunoreactivity was recognized in large cells in the red
nucleus (Fig. 31) and the pontine nuclei, medium-sized
cells of the substantia nigra (Fig. 3m), and small cells in
the quadrigeminal plate and reticular formation. In the
brainstem many distinctive groups of immunoreactive
neurons were found. Intense immunoreactivity in the
brainstem was seen in motor neurons of the cranial
nerves (Figs. 2c and 3n), large neurons in the olivary
nucleus (Fig. 3o), and sensory neurons in the trigeminal
nerves.
In the spinal cord, various types of neurons were
immunoreactive. Large neurons in the anterior horn
exhibited the most concentrated immunoreactivity (Fig.
3p). Axons in the white matter were also immunoreactive
(Fig. 3q).
Glial cells were also immunoreactive in the brain and
spinal cord. Some astrocytes were immunoreactive with
W61C and W63N. The immunoreactivity with both
W61C and W63N was distributed in the cytoplasm and
cell processes, and was more homogeneous than that in
the neurons (Figs. 3q and 4a-d). Occasionally their
processes formed vascular feet (Fig. 4d). There were
W61C and W63N positive cells arranged in rows between
fascicules of white matter in the brain and spinal cord
(Fig. 4e, f), which had round nuclei smaller than
astrocytes and small cell bodies. These were considered
to be interfascicular oligodendroglia. Ependymal cells
around the ventricles and central canal also showed
positive immunoreactivity of W61C and W63N (Fig. 4d,
g).
In the peripheral nervous system, ganglion cells
showed the most intense immunoreactivity (Fig. 4h, i).
There were two types of immunoreactivity, i.e. stronglystained small cells and weakly-stained large cells. Their
processes were also reactive, and they were surrounded
by immunoreactive mantle cells (Fig. 4j). In the peripheral nerves, axons were immunoreactive (Fig. 4k-n).
Immunoreactivity of axons was apparent with W63N but

Selectivityin the reinnervation of denervated postsynaptic sites in the adult rat
septal nuclei has been studied by both light and electron microscopic degeneration
techniques after lesions of the fimbria and stria terminalis. In the mid-rostrocaudal
septum the ventral border of the lateral septal nucleus is coextensive with the dorsal
border of the strial bed nucleus. In the normal rat, fimbrial axons establish synapses
throughout the lateral septal nucleus of the same side, and also in the dorsal part of the
lateral septal nucleus on the opposite side. The stria terminalis establishes synapses in
the ipsilateral but not in the contralateral bed nucleus at this level.
Both the fimbria and the stria terminalis were completely severed on the left side,
and after adequate survival for the removal of all degeneration, the distribution of the
remaining fimbria was plotted. Interesting changes were found on the side contralateral to the second lesion, where the fimbria both increases the number of its synaptic
terminals within its proper contralateral territory (the dorsal part of the lateral septal
nucleus) and also extends its distribution into the ventral part of the lateral septal
nucleus -- the territory normally reserved for the ipsilateral fimbria. Although
completely surrounding the strial bed nucleus, fimbrial axons fail to invade the bed
nucleus, and fimbrial terminals are therefore unable to reinnervate denervated strial
postsynaptic sites. Since there are no obvious structural barriers between the neuropil
of the lateral septal nucleus and that of the strial bed nucleus it is suggested that this
failure is most likely to be due either to some biochemical incompatibility between
fimbrial axons and strial postsynaptic sites, or to the fact that the fimbrial axons are
denied access because some other (unidentified) axonal system forms new presynaptic
terminals which effectively pre-empt the sites in the strial bed nucleus.

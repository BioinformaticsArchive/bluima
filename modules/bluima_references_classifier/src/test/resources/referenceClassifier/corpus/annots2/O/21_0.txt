were showing weight loss and hypolocomotor ac-tivity revealed severe morphological abnormalities.
In addition to the reactive astrocytosis as detected by
the enhanced GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig. 2A, B),
there was a substantial decrease in the staining for the
presynaptic markers, synaptophysin and synapsin
and the dendritic marker, MAP-2 (Fig. 2) in all
cortical areas, but most profoundly in the frontal
(Fig. 2A) and the entorhinal cortices and in the
hippocampus (Fig. 2B). In the cortex, the decrease in
synapsin and synaptophysin immunostaining was
evident in all cortical layers (Fig. 2A, panels b and f;
c and g) while in the hippocampus this loss was
evident throughout all the hippocampal fields, but
most profound in the polymorphic layer (hilus) of the
dentate gyrus and CA3 region (Fig. 2B, panels b and
f; c and g). There was a substantial decrease in
MAP-2 immunoreactivity in both the cortex, es-pecially in layer 1 (Fig. 2A, panels d and h) and
hippocampus (Fig. 2B, panels d and h) of APP-null
mice. In the cortex, the decrease in MAP-2 was
evident in all cortical layers, as was the loss of the
long apical dendrites originating from the large pyramidal neurons in layer V which give rise to long
axons that leave the cortex to innervate the basal
ganglia, the brain stem and spinal cord. A significant
loss of MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus
of APP-null mice was seen in the stratum radiatum,
stratum lacunosum moleculare, the molecular layer
and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and CA3 region.
The loss of MAP-2 staining here may reflect a loss of
CA3 pyramidal cell dendrites which receive inputs
from the dentate granule cell axons (mossy fibres).
Overall, the branching of dendrites of both cortical
and hippocampal neurons of the APP-null mice was
much less extensive than that seen in the wild-type
mice. The loss of MAP-2-immunoreactive dendrites
in the hippocampus resulted in an accumulation of
MAP-2 in cell bodies which was clearly evident in the
CA1 pyramidal cells and the dentate granule cells
(Fig. 2B, panel h). Despite these presynaptic and
dendritic changes in the cortex and hippocampus,
detailed stereological analysis of these mice did not
show any loss of cells in the cortex or hippocampus
(data not shown).

Malformations of cortical development commonly are
identified as causes of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental
deficits. The classification of neuronal migrational disorders is in a state of evolution and currently is based largely
on MRI features [1]. Band heterotopias are an example of
generalized neuronal migrational disorders that may be
present in patients with mild epilepsy and normal intellect
[1-3] or a minor degree of cognitive impairment [1]. Some
authors have reported greater neurologic involvement
depending on the overlying cortex, which may be normal
or associated with pachygyria, and on the thickness of the
band [1,3]. It is increasingly becoming evident that this
disorder is caused mainly by mutations in the doublecortin
gene in Xq22.3, causing band heterotopia in females and

NCC27, and p64H1 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) to immunoprecipitation by
either p64H1 antibody or C UMC29. The p64H1 antibody precipitated p64H1, but not p64 or NCC27 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). In contrast,
the original affinity-purified C UMC29 precipitated p64H1, p64 to
a lesser extent, and very little NCC27 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Therefore,
the p64H1 antibody was used in all subsequent experiments.

p64H1 is expressed abundantly in the nervous system
A Northern blot was performed to determine the tissue distribution of p64H1. The probe was a 32P-labeled DNA fragment
encoding the C -terminal coding region and the 3'-untranslated
region of bovine p64H1. A single ;5 kb transcript was detected in
total RNA isolated from many bovine tissues. High levels of
p64H1 messenger were found in heart, lung, retina, and brain
(Fig. 3, top panel ). Equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded as
judged by the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel before blotting (Fig. 3, inset). The same RNA blot then was stripped and
reprobed with full-length clones of bovine p64 (Fig. 3, middle
panel ) and human NCC27 (Fig. 3, bottom panel ). A ;6 kb
transcript of p64 was expressed at high levels in heart and lung,
and a ;1.7 kb transcript of NCC27 was expressed at high levels in
kidney, lung, and spleen. The probing of CLIC2 was omitted,
because a previous report showed that CLIC2 was expressed at
low levels in some tissues such as fetal liver and adult skeletal
muscle; these signals are only detectable by RT-PCR, but not by
Northern blot assay (Rogner et al., 1996). The unique transcript
size of each of these p64 homologs was in agreement with that
reported previously. Minor variability is seen in the relative
expression levels among different tissues. However, p64 and
NCC27 consistently were found to be expressed at relatively low
levels in the brain, where p64H1 is in high abundance. The
enriched expression of p64H1 in both brain and retina indicated
that p64H1 may be involved f unctionally in the C NS.

The cellular and subcellular localizations of p64H1 in
the rat brain
To gain insight into the f unctions of p64H1, we examined the
cellular and subcellular distribution of p64H1 immunoreactivity
in rat brain. Light microscopic examination of the brain revealed
intense p64H1-immunoreactive processes in several “limbic” ar-eas, including the hippocampal formation (Fig. 4 A), the septum
(Fig. 4C,D), the amygdala (Fig. 4 E,F ), and the hypothalamus
(Fig. 4 E,G). In addition, certain areas in the cortex (Fig. 4 H) and
the cerebellum (data not shown) were also p64H1-positive. In
these regions, p64H1 immunoreactivity was associated mainly
with fibers that had several different appearances. In the hippocampal formation a dense plexus of p64H1-immunoreactive
processes was detected in the inner molecular layer of the dentate
gyrus. Large, punctate p64H1-labeled processes were found in
the mossy fiber pathway in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and
stratum lucidum of the CA3 region (Fig. 4 A). In the central
amygdala the p64H1 immunoreactivity was in fibers that formed
baskets outlining the somata (Fig. 4 F). On the other hand, p64H1
labeling in the cortex regions was located mainly on single, large
varicose fibers (Fig. 4 H). In addition to processes, p64H1-labeled
somata were observed in the lateral septal nuclei (Fig. 4 D) and
the lateral hypothalamic nuclei (Fig. 4G). All labeling was specific

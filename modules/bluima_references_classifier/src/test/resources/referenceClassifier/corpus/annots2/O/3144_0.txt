(P<0.05) in cortical ChAT activity than did the
37- or 74-day LPS infusions.
Chronic infusion of LPS for 14 days (1.8 μg/h), 37,
74 or 112 days (0.25 μg/h) produced a dense distribution of GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes (Fig.
3A, B). Chronic infusion of LPS for 37, 74 or
112 days (0.25 μg/h) produced a decline in the
number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons (Fig. 3C,
D) throughout the NBM. In rats exposed to LPS for
112 days, GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes were
also seen scattered throughout the BF region, as well
as in the overlying neocortex and hippocampus.
Chronic infusion of LPS for 14, 37 or 112 days
produced a dense distribution of OX-6-positive
reactive microglia within the BF and throughout
nearby brain regions (Fig. 4A), as compared to
rats chronically infused with aCSF (Fig. 4B). Chronic
infusion of LPS (0.25 μg/h) for 112 days also
produced a decline in the number of p75immunoreactive neurons (Fig. 4C) within the NBM,
as compared to rats chronically infused with aCSF
(Fig. 4D). In contrast, chronic infusion of aCSF for
112 days produced only a modest increase in gliosis
near the site of the injection.

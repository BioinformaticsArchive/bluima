fore either exogenous p29 or the GFP-tagged p29 increased D2
activity in astrocytes. This finding is consistent with prior work
showing that a ;60-kDa, cAMP-induced protein was required
to produce a catalytically active enzyme (37) and suggests that
composition of D2 is more complex than that of the other
deiodinases. Both its short biological half-life and steady-state
kinetic analysis confirmed that the enhanced D2 activity present in p29GFP-expressing cells was identical to that of the
native enzyme in vivo, and that overexpression of p29GFP fu-sion protein directly increased D2 activity in the cerebral cortex
of neonatal rats locally infected with a replication-deficient
adenovirus carrying the p29GFP fusion protein cDNA. This is
the first demonstration of an increase in functional D2 activity
in the brain resulting from the expression of a exogenous cDNA
encoding a D2 subunit. The ability of the p29 cDNA to directly
increase brain D2 activity, together with the properties of the
D2 activity generated by expression of exogenous p29 in cAMPstimulated astrocytes confirms that this cDNA encodes an es-sential subunit of native D2 in rodents.
The identification and molecular characterization of D2 has
been a goal of many laboratories, because of its key role in
maintaining levels of T3 in the brain. In 1995, the cloning of a
propylthiouracil-insensitive selenodeiodinase from frog skin
(29) and the subsequent cloning of mammalian homologs (30,
31, 58) served as a turning point and shifted focus away from
the BrAcT4-labeled p29 subunit of D2 (14, 15, 37, 38, 46, 57). 2 Stachelek, S. J., Kowalik, F. A., Farwell, A. P., and Leonard, J. L.

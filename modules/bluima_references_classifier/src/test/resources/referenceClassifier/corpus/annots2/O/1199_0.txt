CNS DYSFUNCTION IN PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDERS

In the Zellweger central nervous system, there is disordered neuronal migration leading to characteristic cytoarchitectonic abnormalities involving the cerebral
hemispheres, the cerebellum and the inferior olivary complex (Evrard et al 1978; Volpe
and Adams 1972). The malformation of the cerebral cortex is most severe and
reproducibly results in gyral abnormalities centred around the Sylvian fissure, with
a stereotypic medial pachygyria (large gyri, reduced in number) and lateral
polymicrogyria (small gyri, increased in number). These gyral abnormalities reflect
a reduced neuronal population in the cortex and large numbers of subcortical
heterotopic neurons. These architectonic features, encountered postnatally as well
as in pathological studies on Zellweger fetuses (Powers et al 1985, 1989), indicate
that this malformation results from a developmental disturbance in the migration
of neuroblasts to form the cerebral cortical plate throughout much or all of the
cytogenetic epoch. In the cerebellum, one finds heterotopic Purkinje cells in the white
matter, subjacent to intact Purkinje and granule cell laminae, or combinations of
abnormally arranged Purkinje cells and granule cells (heterotaxias). Dysplastic
changes of the principal olivary nucleus and dentate nucleus are seen, with a
simplification in the normal serpiginous course, laminar discontinuities and condensation of neurons around the periphery of the nuclear islands.

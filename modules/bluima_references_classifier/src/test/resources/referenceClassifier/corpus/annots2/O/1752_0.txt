and the IGL, EGL and PC of cerebellum (Roy and Sabherwal,
1998). The calculation is: the number of cell/mm3 the number of
cell in the counting frame/[5 10 3 mm (section thickness) 1/
100 mm2 (area of counting frame)].
Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using treatment and
brain region as two between subject factors, followed by LSD. The
following one-way ANOVA using treatment as between subject
factor was computed to analyze the treatment effect within a given
brain region. Significance is defined as P 0.05.

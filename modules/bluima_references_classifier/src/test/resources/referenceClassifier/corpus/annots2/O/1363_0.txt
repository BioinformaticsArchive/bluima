characterized by the presence of two types of estrogen
receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) (Shughrue and Merchenthaler, 2001; Merchenthaler et al., 2004), of androgen
receptors (AR) (Simerly et al., 1990) and of progesterone
receptors (PR) (Lauber et al., 1991). Only a few studies
have, however, detailed the co-expression of nNOS (or
NADPH-diaphorase activity) with these receptors.
In particular, in the female guinea-pig, quantitative
analysis showed that approximately 16% of the nNOS-IR
cells in the rostral preoptic area and 55% of nNOS-IR cells
in the ventrolateral nucleus displayed PR immunoreactivity
(Warembourg et al., 1999), a similar distribution was ob-served also in the ewe (Dufourny and Skinner, 2002).
In male and female rats, ERalpha co-localize with
NADPH-diaphorase elements in the VMH (Okamura et al.,
1994b), whereas AR co-localize with nNOS-IR cells in the
premamillary nucleus of the male rats (Yokosuka and Ha-yashi, 1996; Yokosuka et al., 1997). A recent study (Sato
et al., 2005) detailed in a greater detail the co-localization
of ERalpha and AR with nNOS-IR cells in male rat preoptic
and anterior hypothalamic regions. In particular, in the
anteroventral periventricular nucleus ERalpha co-localizes
with 77% and AR with 60% of nNOS cells, in the MPOM
ERalpha co-localizes with the 53% and AR with 52% of
nNOS cells.
In male mouse, ERalpha co-localizes with 90% of
nNOS cells in the MPA and 50% of nNOS cells in the
medial amygdala (MeA), whereas a more limited number
of nNOS cells co-localize in the BST (16%) or in the PVN
(10%) (Scordalakes et al., 2002). AR co-localize with a
more limited number of nNOS cells in the same nuclei
(e.g.: 20% in MPA, 6% in BST, 20% in MeA, 10% in PVN)
(Scordalakes et al., 2002).
These results indicate that in all the investigated mammalian species a relationship between gonadal steroids'
receptors and nNOS or NADPH-diaphorase is present.
However, species-specific differences have been detected
in the proportion of the colocalization.
The regionally specific distribution of nNOS-IR elements and their co-existence with gonadal hormones' re-ceptors suggest the existence of significant neuroendocrine relationships. Therefore, several studies investigated
the role played by gonadal hormones in the regulation of
the nNOS system. In mammals, sex steroids control the
expression of nNOS in the preoptic-hypothalamic region.
In the male, castration decreases the number of nNOS-IR
neurons in the rat (Du and Hull, 1999) and the hamster
(Hadeishi and Wood, 1996) MPA. In the female, E2 in-creases, the NADPH-diaphorase staining in the guinea-pig
ventrolateral nucleus (Warembourg et al., 1999) and in the
rat PVN (Sanchez et al., 1998), and MPA (Okamura et al.,
1994a). It increases also the nNOS mRNA in the ventrolateral subdivision of the rat VMH (Ceccatelli et al., 1996).
However, effects of hormonal manipulations are not univocal; in fact other studies demonstrated either no effects of
castration or an increase of mRNA for nNOS in the hypothalamus of male rat (Shi et al., 1998; Singh et al., 2000).
A recent study evidenced an E2-induced decrease, mediated by the ERbeta, in the number of nNOS-positive neu-

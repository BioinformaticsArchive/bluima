Fig. 1. Administration of kainic acid to rats produces an animal model of hippocampal sclerosis. Left, Section from the human hippocampus surgically resected because of medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (hematoxylin-eosin stain). Note the loss of pyramidal cells in areas CA1
and CA3 and of interneurons in the dentate hilus (H), with relative sparing of granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and pyramidal cells in the
resistant zone (R; area CA2 and a portion of area CA3a). Photomicrograph kindly provided by Dr. B. J. Crain. Right, Section of the ipsilateral
rat hippocampus after intracerebroventricular administration of kainic acid (1.1 g) (cresyl violet stain). The pattern of hippocampal cell loss
closely resembles that observed in human patients.

FIG. 2. Representative samples of types of antidromic spikes in central gray cells elicited by medullary
stimulation. Shown in A and B are fast spikes with short spike duration. Induction of notch (arrow, upper
trace ofB) by paired stimuli indicates that the recording was made from the neuronal soma. However, no fractionation of initial segment (IS) and somatodendritic (SD) spikes occurred in this type of cell even with reduction of
the inter-pulse interval into the relative refractory period (lower trace ofB). Examples of slow spikes are shown in
C and D. Spikes of slow cells had longer durations. Failure or delay of antidromic invasion was almost always
induced by paired pulse stimulation (0). Calibrations are 1 ms and 1 mV (A and C), or 5 ms and 1 mV (B andD).
These two types of cells also differed in their distribution of antidromic spike latencies (E and F). In this and
following oscillograph traces, upward deflection is positive. Photographs of some traces were retouched to
enhance contrast.

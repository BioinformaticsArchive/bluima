Drosophila G&like protein differs (underlined) by 2 residues
from the Gila! and Gi2a! peptide (KNNLKQIGLF). No AS-immunoreactive proteins were detected in Drosophila head
membranes (Fig. 1b, lane 3) under conditions which allow ready
detection of Gicuproteins in bovine brain membranes (Fig. la,
lane 3). LD antibodies were generated to a sequence of Gila
(Goldsmith et al., 1988a) which is totally conserved in the Drosophila Gicuhomolog (Table 1) (Provost et al., 1988). Again, no
LD-immunoreactive proteins were observed in Drosophila (Fig.
1b, lane 4) under conditions which allow the detection of the
41 kDa Gilol protein in bovine brain (Fig. la, lane 4). In ad-dition, no AS- or LD-immunoreactive proteins were observed
in nonmembrane fractions prepared from Drosophila heads (data
not shown). Other antisera generated to peptides specific for
vertebrate Gi3a and Gza! also failed to recognize Drosophila
neuronal proteins (data not shown).
In order to demonstrate that the LD antibodies recognize
DrosophilaGicu,GicuproteinwasexpressedinE.coliasafusion
protein with the bacteriophage T7 major capsid protein as de-scribed in the Materials and Methods. The resulting Drosophila
Gia! protein contains an amino-terminal extension of 17 residues
relative to the native protein. As shown in Figure 2, lane 2, cell
extracts prepared from E. coli expressing this fusion protein
contain a single major LD-immunoreactive protein of appropriate molecular weight. Lower-molecular-weight immunoreactive bands are likely to represent proteolytic fragments of the
main Gicu fusion protein. This protein is not present in extracts
prepared from cells containing Gicu-coding sequences in the re-verse orientation (Fig. 2, lane 1). The specific binding of the LD
antibodies to this fusion protein was abolished by preincubation
of the antibodies with LD peptide (Fig. 2, lane 3). No reaction
is seen when the LD antibody is omitted (Fig. 2, lane 4).

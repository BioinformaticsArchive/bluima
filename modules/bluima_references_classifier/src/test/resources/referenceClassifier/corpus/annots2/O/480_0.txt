than by altering respiratory muscle tone. These data
also suggest that AZ-induced respiratory response is
independent of the inputs elicited by active contraction
of respiratory muscles. Our finding is consistent with
the previous observation that ablation of the whole
cerebellum or selective destruction of FNr neurons
significantly attenuated the respiratory response to
hypercapnia in cats, rats, and dogs (21, 30, 32). There
is accumulating evidence in both clinical and basic
investigations that support the FNr involvement in
respiratory chemoreflexes. It has been reported that
FN neuronal activity was significantly lower in pa-tients with congenital central hypoventilation syndromes and that the situation exaggerated during hy-percapnia (12). Recently, investigators, using the
perforated patch-clamp approach, have found that
some cultured cerebellar neurons from postnatal rats
exhibit CO2/H+ responsiveness (27). These observations suggest the presence of cerebellar chemosensitive
neurons, although it is uncertain whether these chemosensitive neurons are involved in respiratory chemoreflexes. Two important points have been raised by
these authors: 1) the population of cerebellar neurons
having chemosensitivity is lower compared with puta-

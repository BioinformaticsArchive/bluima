ACR16 (Sonesson et al., 1997; Waters et al., 2002) were
reported to enhance dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex of the rat in vivo, a key factor in improving cognitive
deficits seen in schizophrenic patients (Abi-Dargham and
Moore, 2003). Together, these findings indicate that the do-pamine D2 receptor stabilizers could be effective in treating
positive as well as negative and cognitive symptoms in
schizophrenia.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid polypeptide with
structural similarity to pancreatic polypeptide (Tatemoto et al.,
1982). This peptide was first isolated from porcine brain (Ta-temoto et al., 1982) and has since been shown to occur in highest
concentration within nervous tissue. Consistent with its wide
distribution (O'Donohue et al., 1985; Chronwall et al., 1986)
a broad spectrum of responses is elicited by the central application of NPY (reviewed by Gray and Morley, 1986). At least
some of these effects may be mediated by NPY's modulation
of the release of various transmitters (Colmers et al., 1987;
Walker et al., 1988). Alternatively, the diversity may depend
on the intrinsic versus efferent connectivities of NPY-containing
neurons or the species of transmitters coreleased with NPY in
different brain regions. Specifically, coexistence of catecholamines with NPY within the brain-stem neurons that project
to forebrain areas, and of GABA, somatostatin, and tachykinins
with NPY within forebrain intemeurons, have already been
demonstrated (reviewed in Allen et al., 1986; Jones et al., 1988).
Ultrastructural immunocytochemical studies suggest that the
diversity in the action of NPY may additionally reflect the different parts of cells that NPY terminals contact (Vincent and
Johansson, 1983; Hendry et al., 1984a; Pelletier et al., 1984;
Vuillet et al., 1989) and the types of neurons that are pre- and
postsynaptic to NPY neurons (Aoki and Pickel, 1988; Kubota
et al., 1988; Massari et al., 1988; Pickel et al., 1989).
In the cerebral cortex and caudate-putamen (CP) nuclei, NPYimmunoreactive neurons consist of approximately l-2% of all
neurons (Vincent et al., 1983; Vincent and Johansson, 1983).
The NPY-immunoreactive neurons are considered to be almost
all intemeurons (Hendry et al., 1984a; Smith and Parent, 1986).
Results using light microscopic immunocytochemistry have
demonstrated that most NPY neurons in the cortex are also
GABAergic (Hendry et al., 1984b; Demeulemeester et al., 1988).
In contrast, cytological and chemical lesion studies suggestthat
most NPY neurons in the CP are not GABAergic (Bolam et al.,
1982; Takagi et al., 1983; Beal et al., 1986b; O'Kusky et al.,
1988). Although dual immunocytochemical studies have not
yet been done to examine CP, previous dual immunocytochemical studies on the ventral striatum are supportive of these findings since co-localization of GABA and NPY was not observed
within terminals. However, this study did not examine GA-

allows comparison of in vivo with in vitro data but also
comparison between compounds that have different systemic
pharmacokinetic properties or in situations where plasma
kinetics has changed. Furthermore, the results obtained on
the basis of in vivo microdialysis in combination with population pharmacokinetic modeling consider the bidirectional
distribution to and from the brain and are, therefore, representative of the process that determines the time course of
the drug effect.

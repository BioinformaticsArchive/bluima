Clinical characteristics
Mean age of disease onset in the affected individuals was
34.2 6 9.0 years in SCA1 (n = 9), 35.4 6 10.0 years in
SCA2 (n = 14) and 41.7 6 14.5 years in SCA3 patients
(n = 18). Disease duration was 8.9 6 7.0 years in SCA1,
9.0 6 4.4 years in SCA2 and 7.9 6 4.8 years in SCA3 patients.
There were no significant differences between the groups.
All patients presented with a cerebellar syndrome. Severity
of ataxia of gait, stance and lower limbs was similar in all
groups. However, ataxia of upper limbs (P < 0.001), action
tremor (P < 0.01), dysarthria (P < 0.01) and dysdiadochokinesis (P < 0.05) were more severe in SCA2 compared with
SCA3. Dysarthria was more severe in SCA1 compared with
SCA3 (P < 0.05). Non-cerebellar symptoms, including
decreased or absent ankle reflexes (P < 0.01 versus SCA2,
P < 0.05 versus SCA3) and double vision (P < 0.05 versus
SCA2, P < 0.001 versus SCA3), were less frequent in SCA1
than in SCA2 and SCA3. In contrast, increased ankle reflexes
(P < 0.001 versus SCA2, P < 0.01 versus SCA3), spasticity
(P < 0.01 versus SCA3), pale discs (P < 0.05 versus SCA3)
and dysphagia (P < 0.05 versus SCA2 and SCA3) were more
common in SCA1 (Table 1).

distances and occasionally display regularly spaced beads
along their length. The GAD-immunoreactive neurons
in the Galago have similar characteristics, as shown by
the drawings and photomicrographs in Figures 13 and
14. It must be emphasized that the finer secondary or
tertiary processes of the GAD-immunoreactive neurons
are difficult to draw based on immunocytochemical ma-terial, and that the drawings in Figures 11 and 13 made
no attempt to trace the dendrites to their ultimate termination.
In the cat round clusters containing 5 to more than 20
GAD-immunoreactive terminals are distributed throughout the ventral posterior nucleus as shown in Figure 15A.
Each cluster is typically 1 to 8 ym in diameter. That
these clusters are not seen in the posterior nuclear group
of cat or the ventral posterior nucleus of Galago is shown
by Figure 15, B and C. Examples of terminal clusters are
shown at higher power in Figure 16, A and B. Close
examination of the clusters reveals that they are sprays
of terminals associated with the dendrites of the GADimmunoreactive neurons. Many GAD-immunoreactive

higher susceptibility of this structure to the effects of
ROS caused by the change in diet composition. The
hippocampus, however, showed an opposite profile. We
have observed an increase in antioxidant defense capacity, and, probably associated to that fact, there was no
change in lipoperoxidation. This increase was due, at
least partially, to an increase in the activity of the antioxidant GPx enzyme, that might have been stimulated by
several factors, among them an increase in ROS production itself. The increase in GPx activity was so important as to guarantee protection, even though CAT activity
decreased. GPx appears to play a major role in metabolizing hydrogen peroxide in neural tissue (21,22). We do
not know whether these effects are caused by high circulating levels of ketone bodies or by the lipid components
of a KD.
Ketone bodies are able to affect oxidative stress in
nonneural cells. Cultures of polymorphonuclear leukocytes
and red blood cells from healthy subjects exposed to ketone
bodies presented a reduced production of superoxide (23)
and accumulation of oxidized glutathione, respectively
(24). Acetoacetate, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate, increased
lipid peroxidation in cultured human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (25). Further studies in cultured neural
cells from different brain regions will be useful to detail
our results and to characterize the possible direct effect of
ketone bodies.
Another possibility to explain the differences that we
found would be conceiving that the lipid component of a
KD could change lipid composition of the membranes
and/or cellular antioxidant activity. For example, changes
in fatty acid unsaturation of mitochondria membranes are
accompanied by changes in the susceptibility and generation of reactive oxygen species (26). Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids could play a role by direct control of
gene expression in many neurological diseases involving

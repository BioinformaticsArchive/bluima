Fig. 8. Examples of tachykinin-immunoreactivc bundles from layer III; constituent fibers are in close
apposition to vertically-oriented non-immunoreactive processes. (A) A higher magnification electron
micrograph of a portion of the bundle indicated by an arrow in Fig. 6B. (B) Low magnification electron
micrograph of an immunoreactive process (f). (C) Group of non-immunoreactive processes (arrow) is seen
intermingled with immunoreactive processes, (D) lmmunoreactive processes are seen as “climbing” along
the surface of non-immunoreactive processes. (E) Higher magnification electron micrograph of the
immunoreactive process (f) indicated in B. Notice the lack of synaptic contacts on the non-immunoreactive
process (pr). Scale bars: A = 2.5 pm; B-E = 2 pm; F = 0.5 pm.

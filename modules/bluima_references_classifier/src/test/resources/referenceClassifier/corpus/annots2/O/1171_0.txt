moved from the 3 o'clock position to either the 6, 9, or 12 o'clock
position. Lighting in the recording room was provided by four 15 W
lamps symmetrically oriented on the ceiling. In addition to the cylinder,
a square chamber 69 cm on a side and 51 cm high was also used. A
white card was placed on the wall that corresponded to the normal
position of the card in the cylinder.
Duringtraining,ratswerefood deprivedto approximately80%of
their normal body weight, and maintained that way throughout the
experiment. Each rat was handled once a day for 2 d, and on the third
day was placed in the cylinder for the first time. Food pellets were
scattered on the floor of the cylinder, and rats eventually started to eat
the pellets. Daily training sessions in the cylinder lasted about 15 min
and pellets were dropped in at a rate of three to four per minute. Rats
sampled the entire floor in pursuit of the scattered pellets. After ap-proximately 10 d, rats spent almost all of their time moving in the
chamber. Twenty-five rats were trained in this way. Following training
in the cylinder, 15 of the rats received similar training in the square
chamber, where they quickly adapted. At the end of training, the rats
had received, in total, approximately 15 exposures to the testing chamber over a period of 2 weeks. The rats were intentionally overtrained
in this simple task, so that cells could be examined in the behavioral
steady state, following a presumed initial learning period.
Electrode implantation. Following training, 25 rats were surgically
implanted with a chronic microdrive for recording extracellular action
potentials from single cells (Kubie, 1984). The only modification of the
drive's original design for implanting entorhinal cortex was to make it
several millimeters longer. The drive consisted of a movable bundle of
10 Formvar-insulated wires, each 25 pm in diameter, with tips cut
square and of equal length. Just prior to implantation, the tips were
coated with carbowax to prevent bending. The drive was advanced by
turning three screws attached to the electrode assembly. Surgery was
performed under Nembutal anesthesia (50 mg/kg). Skull coordinates
used to reach entorhinal cortex were as follows: 4.0 mm posterior to
bregma, 5.2 mm lateral to the midline, 30” angled caudally in the sag&al
plane, and 4.5 mm ventral to the surface of the brain. This placed the
tip of the electrode just deep to, and normal with respect to, layer VI of
entorhinal cortex. In addition to the entorhinal electrode array, 10 of
the 25 rats also were implanted with a pair of EEG electrodes (78 pm
in diameter) in the contralateral hippocampus (3.5 mm posterior, 2.0
mm lateral to bregma, 2.5 mm ventral to the dura). Of the remaining
15 rats, 11 had hippocampal electrodes implanted ipsilaterally rather
than contralaterally (coordinates: 3.5 mm posterior to bregma, 2.0 mm
lateral to the midline, 2.25 mm ventral to the dura) to stimulate the
perforant path in the hippocampus in order to backfire projection cells
in the entorhinal cortex. To anchor the electrode, skull screws were
implanted over the cerebellum and in the frontal bone. The feet of the
electrode drive were cemented to the skull using Grip Cement. A topical
antibiotic (Neosporin) was applied around the wound at the end of
surgery. Rats were allowed 1 week to recover before testing for unit
activity.
At the completion ofan experiment, rats were killed with an overdose
of Nembutal and perfused transcardially. Just prior to death, positive
current was passed on one of the wires just to produce an iron deposit
at the electrode tip that could be visualized following reaction with
potassium ferrocyanide (Prussian blue). The brains were removed, cut
into 40 pm frozen sections, and Nissl stained. The positions of cells
encountered throughout the electrode's trajectory were calculated back
from the blue spot. In 8 rats, no blue spot was found because the
electrode was advanced through layer I and out of the brain. For these
rats, the recording journal indicated the point at which no further unit
activity was recorded; this point was taken to be the layer I/II border
(since layer I contains no cell bodies). The assignment of cells to specific
layers is somewhat tentative, as it is known that the wires can move
somewhat when passing through brain. In two rats, no electrode track
or spot was visible in entorhinal cortex, and the data were discarded.

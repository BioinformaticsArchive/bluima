Absolute radial error. In the absolute radial error
data, a significant main effect for group [F(1,24) 33.05;
P 0.0001] revealed that individuals with PD moved to
targets less accurately when they were “Off” their medications. In addition, a significant main effect of condition
[F(3,72) 43.79; P 0.0001] and a group by condition
interaction [F(3,72) 3.19; P 0.05] suggest that accuracy was influenced differentially depending on medication state and condition (Fig. 2). Post hoc analysis re-vealed that regardless of medication state, individuals
with PD moved to targets with less accuracy when proprioception was not available (i.e. wheelchair condition).
In the memory condition (where proprioception was the
only available source of feedback during movement),
both PD groups improved their accuracy, although PD
patients “Off” their medications were unable to use proprioception to improve accuracy to the level of PD “On.”
(Note that although healthy participants were not analyzed within the same ANOVA as patients, accuracy of
healthy participants has been plotted in Figs. 2 and 3.
Interestingly, the performance of PD patients “ON” their
regular medications appears to be nearly identical to
healthy participants.) Furthermore, the addition of the
chest light allowed only the PD “Off” group to improve
accuracy significantly, such that all PD patients demonstrated similar accuracy in this condition. It is most
important to note that post hoc results demonstrate that
all participants improved to their best accuracy with the
concurrent availability of vision and proprioceptive feedback, and that accuracy was not significantly different in

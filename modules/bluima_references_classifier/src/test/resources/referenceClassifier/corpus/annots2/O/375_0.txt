Malignant histiocytosis is a well-documented neoplastic
disorder characterized by proliferation or infiltration of atypical histiocytes in multiple organs, especially the lungs, subcutaneous tissues, spleen, and lymph nodes. In dogs, malignant histiocytosis has been primarily recognized in Bernese
Mountain Dogs10,11 but also has been confirmed in several
other breeds.1,3,7 Involvement of the central nervous system
(CNS) is considered to be one of the systemic lesions as-sociated with this disorder. Malignant histiocytosis with multiple organ involvement, including the lumber epidural
space, was reported in a golden retriever3. Although there
have been a few reports of primary histiocytosis in the hu-man CNS,13 the condition is considered to be extremely un-usual. Recently, primary malignant histiocytosis in the brain
of a Miniature Schnauzer was reported.1 The right parieto
occipital lobe had a poorly demarcated mass formed from a
proliferation of neoplastic histiocytes. The meningeal infiltrates of the histiocytes were described as limited to areas
adjacent to the intraparenchymal tumor mass.1 Here, we de-scribe the morphologic features of widely disseminated leptomeningeal histiocytosis within the brain and spinal cord of
a Tibetan Terrier and discuss the possible differential diagnoses.
On 5 August 1998, an 8-year-old male Tibetan Terrier was
admitted to a private animal hospital with incomplete hind
limb paralysis. Clinical examination revealed cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) abnormalities, 152 cells/μl, composed of mononuclear cells and neutrophils (1 : 1), and a total protein of 95
mg/dl, suggesting meningitis or myelitis. At that time, no
atypical cells were seen in the CSF. The antibody titer
against canine distemper was ×20. Corticosteroid and antibiotic treatment was given, but the clinical signs progressed.
On 25 August, the dog developed astasia and complete pa-ralysis of the fore- and hind-limbs. On 7 October, the dog
exhibited ticlike signs and seizures and developed keratitis
in the right eye. The dog died on 8 October and was necropsied by the veterinary clinician. The brain, spinal cord
(C1 to T10), lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestines, and
pancreas and the CSF samples, which had been stored at 4

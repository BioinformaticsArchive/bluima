pus as well as of some axonal pathways such as corticotectal tracts (Fig. 4A and B). There is also diffuse
but not intense staining of most neocortical areas, with
some laminar nature to the staining and most intense
staining in outer layer 5. Cells in some but not all
hypothalamic nuclei stain (Fig. 4C and D). There is
diffuse staining of the motonuclei in the brainstem,
and on the background of this diffuse staining there is
distinct staining of the plasma membranes of pyramidal-shaped neurons (data not shown). Most of the staining in spinal cord sections is in the neuropil of the
gray matter, outlining the cell bodies of large neurons
(Fig. 5).
35S-labeled probe re- In situ hybridization with a
vealed that most of the OMgp mRNA in the mouse
CNS is in neurons. The labeling in the cerebellum is
predominantly in the Purkinje cells, although there is
some labeling in the white matter (Fig. 6). The lack
of labeling in the molecular and internal granular cell
layers supports the notion that immunohistochemical
staining of this region is attributable to dendrites and
axons of Purkinje cells. Hybridization of the OMgp

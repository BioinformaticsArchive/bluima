birds, and the carcasses were thin and dehydrated.
Multifocal hemorrhages were observed in the mucosa
of the proventriculus (P1307-infected birds) and small
intestine and ceca (P5658-infected birds). At 5 DPI,
gross lesions were observed in the eyelids (edema and
petechial hemorrhages), spleen (small), bursa (very
small), thymus (edema and petechial hemorrhages),
and kidneys (urate deposits). Multifocal hemorrhages
were observed in the mucosa of the proventriculus
(P1307- and P5658-infected chickens) and small in-testine (only P5658-infected chickens). Noninfected
control chickens did not have any gross lesions.

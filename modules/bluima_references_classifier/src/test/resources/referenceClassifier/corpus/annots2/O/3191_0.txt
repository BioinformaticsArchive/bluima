Our results indicate that visual stimulation
regulates the expression of FGF-2, FGFR and their
mRNAs in select brain regions. The cerebral cortex,
which includes the primary and associative visual
areas, showed the greatest changes in FGF-2 in
response to light deprivation and subsequent
re-exposure. There is abundant evidence that the

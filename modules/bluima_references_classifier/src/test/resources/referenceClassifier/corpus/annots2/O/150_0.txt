chiasm in response to netrin secreted from the hypothalamic
midline. However, the bilateral patches of netrin expression in the
optic nerve and the vicinity of the initial optic tract region suggest
that netrin and DCC interactions could mediate some aspects of
RGC or chiasm neuron axon pathway development in the ventral
hypothalamus.

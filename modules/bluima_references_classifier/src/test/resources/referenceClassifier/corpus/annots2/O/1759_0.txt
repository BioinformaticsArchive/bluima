Expression of Alzheimer's Disease–Altered
Proteins: Phosphorylated Tau and APP
Interestingly, a progressive rise in Alzheimer's disease–related proteins occurred in the EC after the DG
damage. In control animals, PHF-1 immunoreactivity
appeared weakly distributed in the neuropil and never
within neuronal cell bodies. The number of PHF-1-positive neurons in the EC after excitotoxic stimuli began
to increase after 1 day (18 6 4.8) and reached its highest
levels after 15 days (34 6 2.3), as can be seen in Figure 6J.
The expression pattern of PHF-1 in the DG revealed an
increase in the neuropil and some positive neuronal bodies
1 day after the lesion (45.8 6 3.2); this increase had
declined by 50% after 7 and 15 days (Fig. 6I).
The presence of APP-positive cells was studied 1,
7, 15, and 30 days after the hippocampal lesion. In both
the dorsal layer of the DG and the EC, APP was
scarcely present 1 day after the lesion. The expression of

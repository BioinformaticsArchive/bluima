suggests that glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes, do not express SHP-2 or express it at levels that
are below the sensitivity of our immunolabelling
technique. Similarly, the absence of labelled processes
in the fibre tracts suggests that axon bundles do not
contain detectable levels of SHP-2 protein. These
areas were consistently non-immunoreactive even
when higher concentrations of SHP-2 antibody were
used (data not shown).

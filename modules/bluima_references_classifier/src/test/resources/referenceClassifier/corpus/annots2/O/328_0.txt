tected in GnRH neurons, regardless of their location within the
migratory pathway. Because NMDA receptors are only involved
in regulating the final stages of GnRH migration, changes in
extracellular glutamate gradients, NMDA receptor composition
(Rossi and Slater, 1993; Monyer et al., 1994), or cooperativity
between NMDA and GABAA receptors (Ben-Ari et al., 1997)
may underlie the regional specificity of NMDA receptor antagonist action.

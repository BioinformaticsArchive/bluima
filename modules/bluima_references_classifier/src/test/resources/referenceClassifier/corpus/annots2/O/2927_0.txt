shown) throughout the α6+/+, α6+/-, and α6-/- brains (Fig.
1). However, there was significantly less [3H]Ro 15–4513
binding to the cerebellar granule cell layer of α6-/- and
α6+/- mice compared with binding to that of α6+/+ mice
(Table 1).
Diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15–4513 binding is considered to be the hallmark of α6 subunit-containing GABAA
receptors (4, 7, 8, 16). Diazepam (100 μM) only partially
displaced [3H]Ro 15–4513 binding from the cerebellar granule cell layer of the α6+/+ and α6+/- mice, whereas the
binding from granule cell layer of α6-/- mice was totally
displaceable (Table 1), as also demonstrated by Jones et al.
(14) and Homanics et al. (15). There was very little diazepaminsensitive binding left in the molecular layer of each mouse
genotype (Table 1). The diazepam-insensitive binding in the
granule cells is also insensitive to the subtype-selective ago-

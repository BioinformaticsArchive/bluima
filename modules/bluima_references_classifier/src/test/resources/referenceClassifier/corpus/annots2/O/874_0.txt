with anti-Fos-B antibody and subsequent incubation with radiolabeled
AP1 probe in the presence or absence of SPD and SPN at 0.5 mM, for
determination of DNA-binding activity. Black arrowheads, AP1 DNA
binding; open arrowheads, supershift. Experiments were repeated at
least three times with similar results. CX, neocortex; HC, hippocampus; MP, medulla-pons; SC, spinal cord.

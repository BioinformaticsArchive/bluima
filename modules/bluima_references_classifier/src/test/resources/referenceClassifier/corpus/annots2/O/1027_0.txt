activation of this kinase. Moreover, inhibition of PKC by
calphostin C or intracellular calcium release by BAPTA also
attenuated cdk5 activation, whereas PKA inhibitor had little
effect (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that SKF83959-mediated activation of cdk5 is mediated via PLC and is dependent on PKC and Ca2 but not on PKA. Phosphorylation of
PLC by PKC has been shown to inhibit PLC activity (Ryu
et al., 1990; Litosch, 1996). We therefore tested whether PKC
activation influences SKF83959-induced cdk5 activation by
preincubated FCX slices with 1 M PMA before stimulating
with SKF83959, carbachol, or NaF. Carbachol and NaF are
known to stimulate the PLC pathway, therefore serving as
positive controls. As expected, both carbachol and NaF stimulated cdk5 activity in FCX slices, whereas activation of PKC
by PMA significantly reduced carbachol- or NaF-stimulated
cdk5 activation (Fig. 3). Likewise, the SKF83959-elicited re-sponse was also inhibited by prior PKC stimulation (Fig. 3).
Taken together, the present data demonstrate that stimulation of the PI-linked D1 dopamine receptor by SKF83959
activates cdk5 through PLC -mediated PKC activation and
elevation in intracellular calcium.
SKF83959 Activates CaMK II Activity in a Time- and
Dose-Dependent Manner. Calcium has been shown to play
an important role in regulating CaMK activity. To study the
effect of SKF83959 on CaMK activity, FCX slices were
treated with SKF83959, and CaMK II and IV activities were
measured in anti-CaMK II or anti-CaMK IV immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, SKF83959 induced a

rons are distinctly different from those of do-paminergic neurons of the pars compacta of
the SN. In the same behavioral situation in
monkeys, dopaminergic neurons show an in-creasein activity during the whole movement
phasewithout obvious relationshipsto detailed
movement parameters and no responsesto
instructive sensory signals(36). In a more di-rect reaction-time paradigm, dopaminergic
neurons respondedstrongly to stimuli that led
to an immediate behavioral reaction (32).
Thus, the considerabledifferencesbetween the
two substructures of SN in terms of cytology,
connectivity, and neurotransmitters are also
representedin their relationships to behavioral
acts. Whereas SNpr cells appear to be part of
specific information transfer and processing
circuits of the basal ganglia, nigral dopaminergic cells may subservea more basic mechanism dealing with behavioral responsiveness(33).

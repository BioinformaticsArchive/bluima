on the surface of kidney cells, we suggest that this interference
may be attributed to steric hindrance (34). Thus, gD5 was
blockable by an extraordinary broad range of nectins. (iv) In
vivo, we found that a BoHV-1 mutant carrying gD5 was almost
equally as virulent as the neurotropic BoHV-5. However, the
replacement of gD5 by gD1 in BoHV-5 did not reduce the
ability of this virus to invade the brain, while the replacement
of gD1 with gD5 in BoHV-1 did not enhance the ability to
infect secondary neurons.
Among all of the different herpesvirus entry mediators
known to date, nectin 1 has been shown to serve as a receptor
for BoHV-1 (9, 10, 16â€“18, 26, 28, 49). In contrast, the potential
receptors for BoHV-5 have not yet been determined. This
study can only partially help to shed light on this issue. However, the successful inhibition of infectivity with soluble nectins
together with our host range studies in vitro suggest that gD5

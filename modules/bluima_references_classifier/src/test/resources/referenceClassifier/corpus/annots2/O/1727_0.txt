cantly blocked the inhibitory effects of DCG-IV on EPSCs
(96.5 3.8%; n 6) in slices from control rats (Fig. 4 A, D). The
action of Cl-IB-MECA was blocked completely by either
MRS1220 (10 M), a selective antagonist of adenosine A3 receptor (Fig. 4 B, D), or Bis-I (1 M) (C,D), suggesting this effect is
mediated by the activation of adenosine A3 receptors and PKCdependent signaling pathway. To better characterize the role of
adenosine A3 receptors in the development of cocaine-induced
impairment of DCG-IV-LTD, MRS1220 (0.5 nmol/side) was bi-lateral intra-mPFC infusion before each of the five daily cocaine
injections. We found that MRS1220 prevents the cocaineinduced impairment of DCG-IV-LTD induction (Fig. 4 F).
DCG-IV induced a stable LTD in mPFC layer V pyramidal neurons in slices from rats treated with cocaine plus MRS1220 for 5 d
to a similar extent as that observed for rats treated with saline plus
MRS1220 for 5 d (Fig. 4 Eâ€“G). These results suggest a role of
adenosine A3 receptor-mediated PKC activation in triggering the
inhibitory effect of repeated cocaine treatment on the induction
of DCG-IV-LTD.
The activation of adenosine A3 receptors could be mediated
via an increase in adenosine subsequent to the rise in cAMP after
D1-like receptor activation. To determine whether the endogenous adenosine tone in the mPFC is upregulated after repeated
cocaine administration, we examined the extent of the increased
baseline EPSCs induced by the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist
DPCPX (0.5 M), a widely used protocol to measure endogenous
adenosine tone in the hippocampus (Fredholm and Dunwiddie,
1988). The EPSCs were augmented by DPCPX (0.5 M), an effect
that was significantly larger in slices from cocaine-injected rats
compared with those from saline-injected rats after 5 d of treatment (saline, 12.3 2.1%, n 5; cocaine, 24.8 3.7%, n 7;
p 0.05) (Fig. 5A), but not from rats treated with a single injection of cocaine (1 d) (saline, 9.8 2.3%, n 4; cocaine, 10.6
2.7%, n 5; p 0.05) (Fig. 5B). An increase in the responsiveness of adenosine A1 receptors is not responsible for the augmented response to DPCPX because the inhibition of EPSCs in-duced by exogenously applied adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-CPA was not changed (supplemental Fig. S6, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The EC50 for inhibition of the EPSCs was 0.17 M in slices from cocaine-treated
rats and was not significantly different in slices from salinetreated rats (0.16 M).
The preceding results point to an involvement of the upregulation in the endogenous adenosine tone in mediating cocaineinduced impairment of DCG-IV-LTD. We next wanted to know
further the source of endogenous adenosine. There are multiple
mechanisms that can lead to an increase in the levels of endogenous adenosine, including an augmented metabolism of cAMP
to adenosine or an inhibition of adenosine uptake (Rosenberg et
al., 1994). To determine whether the metabolism of cAMP is one
primary source of adenosine to mediate the impairment of DCGIV-LTD after repeated cocaine administration, we examined the
induction of DCG-IV-LTD in the presence of the cAMP transporter inhibitor, probenecid, or cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor, RO201724 (Beavo and Reifsnyder, 1990). We
found that, in the presence of either probenecid (200 M) or
RO201724 (200 M), DCG-IV normally induced LTD in mPFC
pyramidal neurons in slices from rats treated with cocaine for 5 d
(probenecid, 76.5 3.7%, n 6; RO201724, 81.4 4.2%, n
6), to a similar extent as that observed for rats treated with saline
for 5 d (probenecid, 72.8 5.1%, n 5; RO201724, 73.6 5.3%,
n 5) (Fig. 6 A--D). Likewise, application of RO201726 also
prevented the forskolin-induced blockade of DCG-IV-LTD (Fig.

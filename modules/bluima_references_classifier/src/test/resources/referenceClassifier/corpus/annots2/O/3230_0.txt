Optic tract
With the same experimental procedure and analysis that were
used in the study of cortical and geniculate neurons, we examined
the responses of 33 retinal ganglion cells recorded in the optic
tract. Similar to the responses of geniculate neurons, some retinal
ganglion cells did respond in a phase-locked manner to luminance
modulation within the RF, but most cells in the optic tract did not
show modulated responses when the light level outside the receptive field was varied. Figure 13 shows the responses of an X-type
ganglion cell to the basic stimulus set. It can be seen in the third
row of this figure that there was a maintained elevation in the
response of the cell to stimulus 1, but the effect of the luminance
change outside the RF is not apparent in the response. The
elevated response might have been caused by the presence of the
static gray center in stimulus 1, because the response was greatly
diminished when the region corresponding to the RF was black
(fourth row).
The relationship between the overall activity and modulation
amplitude of the response to stimulus 1 and stimulus 2 is shown

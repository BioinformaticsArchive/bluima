Fig. 3. Presynaptic inhibition by NE in
presence of barium (postnatal 6 days,
HP = -70 mV). Each trace represents
10 averaged evoked postsynaptic currents (PSCs) obtained from 1 neuron in
different conditions. Evoked EPSCs
were isolated in presence of gabazine (3
μM) and strychnine (10 μM), which
reduced amplitude of control evoked
PSCs. Addition of barium (300 μM)
further decreased amplitude of evoked
EPSCs. Application of NE (30 μM, 4
min) reversibly reduced amplitude of
evoked EPSCs without changing holding current (dotted line). Barium was
present during application of NE and
during its washout.

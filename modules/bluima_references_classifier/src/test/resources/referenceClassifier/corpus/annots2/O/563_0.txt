NOTE. The theoretical unbound, unconjugated bilirubin concentrations were
calculated by applying the corrected unconjugated bilirubin-albumin binding
constants at the given albumin concentrations (from Weisiger30) to the model of 2
independent unconjugated bilirubin binding sites on albumin (from Brodersen29).

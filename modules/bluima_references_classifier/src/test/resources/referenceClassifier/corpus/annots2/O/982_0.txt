at the late stage of infection [3, 7, 40]. In our study, with the progression of AIDS
disease, the latent infection might be broken and the production of the infectious
virus increased in the brain. Establishment of a productive infection in the brain
might result in the neurological lesions in AIDS.
Previous studies showed genetic differences between the viral sequences de-rived from the blood and brain of HIV-1 infected patients [2, 19]. In our study,
based on the sequence encompassing the env V3 region, the infectious viral
population in the brain of the monkey that developed AIDS with encephalitis
was similar to the inoculated virus, while that in the lymphoid tissues genetically
diverged from the inoculated virus. The infectious viruses produced in the brain
at the AIDS stage of infection resulted from the viruses which entered the brain
early after infection and had persisted in the brain without genetic divergence. For
individuals at the AIDS stage, immunological changes might trigger active viral
replication in the brain and then result in neurological defects. Further studies of
the evolution of the virus in different tissues may eventually lead to better methods
for suppressing replication.

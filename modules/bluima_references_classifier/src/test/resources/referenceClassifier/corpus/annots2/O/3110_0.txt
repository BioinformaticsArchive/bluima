There were no significant differences for any measure
for vehicle animals injected at the three different ages so
all control cases were combined. For w3 Hxmazindol binding, the probability of differences between vehicle animals
injected at different ages was P - 0.078 and 0.129 for
rostral and caudal regions, respectively; for w3 HxSCH23390
binding the probability of differences was P - 0.336 and
0.384 for rostral and caudal regions, and for w3 Hxspiroperidol binding, P - 0.447 and 0.337 for rostral and caudal, respectively. The probability of differences between
control animal age groups was P - 0.802 for numbers of
μ-receptor patches.
In order to determine to what degree the intrastriatal
lesions with 6-OHDA were successful, rostral and caudal
striatal sections from each animal were labeled with
w3 Hxmazindol to detect depletion of the DAT as an indicator of DA terminal loss Fig. 1A, E, I, M.. Control animals
showed significant differences in number of w3 Hxmazindol
binding sites between brain regions with a higher level of
binding in the CPu than in the NA, and effects of the IS
6-OHDA were more effective in the CPu than NA. There
were significant losses in all areas of the CPu  P - 0.0001.
examined: 85% loss in rostral dorsal CPu, 78% in rostral
ventral, 88% in caudal dorsal and 80% in caudal ventral
CPu. Fig. 2B, C.. In the NAc, there was a 60% loss
P - 0.0007. and a 48% loss in the NAs  P - 0.007..
Lesions made at P7 resulted in significant reductions of
w3 Hxmazindol binding in the adult that also were greater in
the CPu than the NA. There were significant reductions in
all regions of the CPu  P - 0.0001. but no between region
differences in the amount of loss: 81% loss in rostral
dorsal CPu, 67% in rostral ventral, 71% in caudal dorsal
and 64% in caudal ventral CPu.. Significant losses oc-curred in the NA core 28% loss, P - 0.034., but not in
the NA shell. With P15 IS 6-OHDA lesions, there were
significant losses of DAT sites in the CPu but not in the
NA Fig. 2A.. The significant reduction in the CPu differed between regions  P - 0.0001; Fig. 2B, C.. For the
rostral dorsal CPu, there was a 50% loss  P - 0.0001., for
rostral ventral a 34% loss  P - 0.001., for the caudal
dorsal CPu a 35% loss  P - 0.008. and for caudal ventral
CPu a 25% loss  P - 0.005.. No significant sex differences were observed and there were no significant interactions between the main effects of lesion status and sex.
Damage to the early DA innervation to the striatum
results in a loss of μ-opioid receptors located in the striatal
patch compartment w13,23,24x. Analysis of the binding of
w3 Hxnaloxone Fig. 1B, F, J, N. at the different lesion age
groups indicated a region by lesion status interaction  P -0.0002.. Significant reductions in numbers of μ-receptor
patches were observed in the rostral dorsal CPu after
lesions at P0r1  P - 0.0006, 54% loss. and P7  P -0.0005, 53% loss. Fig. 3.. No effects were observed with
P15 lesions. There was no significant within group differ-

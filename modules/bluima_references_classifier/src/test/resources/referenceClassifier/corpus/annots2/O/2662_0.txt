repression of these three genes. Indeed, c-Fos, Fos B
or Jun B have never been detected in primary afferent
neurons, and are only faintly visible in motoneurons
following either axotomy or sciatic nerve stimulation.21'24'26'2s'3~'36'O4°ne reason for the absence of
Jun B proteins following axotomy could be the
apparent strong translational control over the synthesis of this protein. There are reports of a strong
expression ofjun B mRNA in the normal rat CNS,
and also in the spinal cord following trans-synaptic
stimulation.7'9:7'21'24'27'39'44~6'52H'6o°wever, we could
not detect a similar basal expression of the corresponding Jun B protein in the CNS using our Jun B
antiserum, although we did see the expression of this
protein in spinal neurons after peripheral nerve
stimulation.24'26'27Fos B and Krox-24 show only an

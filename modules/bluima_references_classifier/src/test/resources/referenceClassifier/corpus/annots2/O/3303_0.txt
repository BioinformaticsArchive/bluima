treatment period, HGF/SF still did not promote survival of either
brachial or thoracic M Ns but did significantly increase M N number in the lumbar region (Fig. 2B). Thus, HGF/SF has a specific
effect of only promoting survival of M Ns from the lumbar region
of the spinal cord during the period of their naturally occurring
cell death. Treatment with HGF/SF from E6 to E10 or E12 also
had no effect on cell size (nuclear area) of lumbar M Ns (control = 150 6 25 μm 2 vs HGF = 147 6 12 μm 2; n = 200 cells per
group). Finally, treatment with HGF/SF (5 μg) on E4 and E5,
before the main cell death period of brachial and lumbar M Ns,
was without effect on the number of surviving MNs on E6.5
(brachial control = 15,100 6 861, n = 4 vs brachial HGF/SF =
15,416 6 610, n = 4; lumbar control = 20,293 6 1,019, n = 4 vs
lumbar HGF/SF = 19,875 6 862, n = 4).
Motoneurons were also counted in different rostral – caudal
regions of the lumbar spinal cord to determine whether subsets of
lumbar M Ns have a differential survival response to HGF/SF.
When M N numbers were counted in 10 different equal regions
along the rostral – caudal axis of the lumbar spinal cord on E10
and E12, we observed an increase in the number of MN cell
bodies in the caudalmost two-thirds of the lumbar region,
whereas the rostralmost third of the lumbar region did not have
an increased number of M Ns above that of the saline-treated
controls (data not shown). Finally, daily HGF/SF treatment (5
μg) from E6 to E12 failed to promote the survival of lumbar
sensory neurons in the L3 DRG (10,570 6 1,129, n = 5 vs
control = 11,141 6 1,090, n = 5).

HGF/SF does not promote cranial motor neuron
survival in ovo
We also tested the effects of HGF/SF on cranial MN survival. In
the chick embryo, cranial M N cell death occurs from E9 to E15
(Oppenheim et al., 1993; Johnson et al., 1995). To test the in vivo

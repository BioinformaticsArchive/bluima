Scientific, Springfield, NJ) and air-dried. Sections were deparaffinized
with xylene for 15 min and then rehydrated through a series of descending
ethanol concentrations and washed in 0.1 M Tris. Sections were stained
with 0.5% cresyl violet, dehydrated, and coverslipped in Permount
(Fisher).
Gross brain measurements. Fixed euploid and Ts16 brains were re-moved from the calvarium and measured without paraffin processing.
Calipers calibrated to 0.05 mm (Mitutoyo) were used to make two
measurements: the maximum lateral span between the parietal poles and
the maximum rostral– caudal distance between the olfactory and occipital
poles of the cortex. Four Ts16/euploid littermate pairs were analyzed for
each age in this manner.
Cross-sectional area measurements. Cross-sectional areas of the ventricular/subventricular zones (VZ/SVZ) and the subplate/cortical plate (SP/
CP) were determined using a Metamorph image analysis system (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Measurements were made in matched
Nissl-stained sagittal sections (5 μm thick) from five euploid and Ts16
littermate pairs at E16. The contours of each measured cortical area (see
Fig. 1 A) were traced using a manually driven cursor. Areas were calculated from the digitized data derived from a series of six sections per
animal, the level of which is shown in Figure 2. The data were evaluated
by a nested ANOVA to determine whether there were significant differences between Ts16 and euploid cross-sectional cortical areas.
Measurements of cell density and thickness of cortical layers. Total cell
density measurements were made at the level of the dorsal hippocampus
(or future sensorimotor cortex, caudal aspect) (see Figs. 1 B, 3A–C for
level of section) from coronal sections taken from six littermate pairs
each at E13, E14, E16, and E18. All sections were matched, both within
and between groups, to be at a specific telencephalic level starting from
200 μm caudal to the interventricular foramen and extending for 50 μm
in the caudal direction. All layers of the pallium, including the VZ/SVZ,
IZ, and SP/CP, were counted. Cell density was determined from 5-μm-thick sections counted on a Leitz Ortholux microscope equipped with a
square reticle divided into 10 μm boxes in a 10 × 10 array. Cell counts
were made at a consistent position on the dorsal pallium, midway be-tween the medial and lateral borders of the lateral ventricle. The cortical
area in which cells were counted is demarcated by the rectangle in Figure
3A. All cresyl violet-stained nuclei were counted excluding endothelial
cells, located adjacent to blood vessels and identified by long and tapered
fusiform somata.
The reticle's grid was positioned such that the first row of 10 boxes was
aligned with the ventricular surface. The cells contained within each
successive bin of the entire reticle were counted beginning at the ventricular surface (row 1) up to the pial surface. Cells were considered to be
within a certain row if they were contained by the medial and dorsal lines
of the row but not if they touched the lateral or ventral lines. Endothelial
cells were excluded from these measurements. In cortices thicker than
100 μm, the superficial cells were counted by repositioning the reticle
such that the ventral border of row 1 was aligned with the dorsal border
of the previous row 10. Four alternating sections from each brain were
counted in this manner, and the data were analyzed by ANOVA to
determine the significance of differences between Ts16 and euploid cell

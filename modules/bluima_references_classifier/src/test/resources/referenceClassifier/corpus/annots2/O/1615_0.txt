used an actual reach movement, or possibly because our
figure-of-eight coil delivered a more focal pulse to the right
PPC.
This finding confirms a causal role for left PPC in the
generation of memory-guided reach movements (Smyrnis et al.
2003). In addition, our novel finding for right parietal stimulation agrees with the topography of right PPC (Medendorp et
al. 2003) and may have been missed in previous TMS studies
(Smyrnis et al. 2003) as the result of differences in methodology. In fact, such a pattern of hemispheric asymmetry was also
observed in previous TMS studies that emphasized generally
the importance of the right PPC in visuospatial and visual
attentional tasks (Muri et al. 2002; Rushworth et al. 2001;
Walsh et al. 1999), whereas left PPC played a dominant role in
limb movements (Rushworth et al. 2001; Smyrnis et al. 2003).
Our finding that stimulation of left PPC results in misreaching with the right hand in both ipsi- and contralateral visual
fields corroborates characteristic reaching disorders of patients
with optic ataxia (Perenin and Vighetto 1988). Optic ataxia is
a disorder associated with posterior parietal lobe lesions, in
which visually guided reaching errors typically occur to pe-ripheral targets (for reviews, see Battaglia-Mayer and Caminiti
2002; Rossetti et al. 2003). However, lesions confined to the
right PPC in these patients typically result in misreaching with
one or both hands only in the contralateral visual field (field
effect) (Perenin and Vighetto 1988).
Recent reports described the rare phenomenon of magnetic
misreaching, in which optic ataxia patients with parietal dam-

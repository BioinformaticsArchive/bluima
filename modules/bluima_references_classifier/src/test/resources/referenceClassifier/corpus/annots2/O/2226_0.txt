followed by a variable interval during which they engage in an interfering activity, after
which they have to recall the triad of items. In recall of words that had just been auditorally
presented, the patient recalled few recent items even when told to recall these first, i.e. there
was a reduced recency effect. It was argued that she showed a selective deficit in short-term
phonological storage, i.e. in storing acoustic, or perhaps phonemic, aspects of words. In
contrast, dementing patients who also do badly on the Brown-Peterson task and tests of
immediate memory span seem to have not only an intact phonological store, but also a
normal articulatory loop system. The articulatory loop system is hypothesized to be a
dedicated system that stores and rehearses for short periods the articulatory movements that
generate remembered words. As these two stores are intact, it has been suggested that
reduced capacity in the central executive causes their short-term memory problems [55].
Finally, it has been shown that some patients with short-term failure are impaired at
phonological processing [3]. Appropriate testing therefore reveals that failure on immediate
memory span tests may arise from at least three kinds of functional breakdown. Although it
has been claimed, for some of these patients, that long-term verbal memory is intact, relevant
tests of long-term phonological memory have not been performed.
Disturbances of access to established semantic memories may also appear in several
material-specific forms. Recent research has reinterpreted some aphasic, agnosic and apraxic
syndromes as selective failures of semantic memory storage or access, and argued for specific
breakdowns in arithmetical knowledge [93], knowledge of concrete or abstract words [92],
knowledge about inanimate objects [95J and animate objects [97]. WARRINGTONand
SHALLICE[97] have even proposed that the semantic system is organized along modalityspecific as well as material-specific lines. The issue can probably not be resolved unless it can
be decided whether breakdown is caused by a destruction of part of the store or disturbance
in gaining access to it. Although consistency-and also inconsistency-over time in the
retrieval or failure to retrieve particular items has been noted [19], such observations are
insufficient to decide the issue because some models would predict inconsistent retrieval after
partial destruction of the store. Three major points arise from consideration of these
disorders of previously well-established semantic memory. First, they should decrease
intelligence when the affected kinds of information are being processed. Second, they may be
associated with retrograde amnesia for episodic memories that relate to the inaccessible
material. For example, someone who can remember little about animals may have great
difficulty in retrieving personal experiences that involve them regardless of how long ago the
experiences occurred. Third, the disorders should also be associated with anterograde
amnesia when new learning involves the encoding of kinds of material for which access is
impaired. Acceptance of these points would imply that lesions of the posterior neocortex can
cause anterograde and retrograde amnesias that may be material specific. but which are
associated with reduced intelligence and processing ability, and which compromise both
episodic and semantic memory.
As well as disturbing the ability to initiate and maintain plans [45], frontal lesions have
been associated with several memory problems. First, such lesions impair judgments of item
recency [SO], judgments of item frequency [76] and performance in a self-ordered task [59].
These memory impairments were associated with intact recognition for the items. Second,
there is a currently weakly supported, but general, belief that bilateral frontal lesions impair
the learning of complex material [7,45,73] and that the deficit may be remediated by giving
patients suitable mnemonic strategies [74]. Third, patients forget very rapidly in the
Brown-Peterson task [85]. In this task, material has to be held for periods of a few seconds

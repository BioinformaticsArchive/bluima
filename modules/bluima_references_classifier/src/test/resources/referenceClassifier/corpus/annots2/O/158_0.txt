on activity assays. There are likely to be several factors contributing to this variability and the relatively low values for
specific activity and fold purification: 1) S2/S3 extracts contained other forms of PP1 that were separated by chromatography on size exclusion and ion exchange columns (see Figs. 2
and 6 of Ref. 13). For example, chromatography on Superdex
200 enriches PP1g1 immunoreactivity approximately 10-fold
(see below), but enriches the specific activity of PP1 only #2-fold (Table I). 2) Limited trypsinolysis of the final preparation
resulted in 2–3-fold activation toward phosphorylase a (not
shown), similar to that seen in partially purified samples (see
Fig. 8 in Ref. 13) (see below). 3) The activity of the final
preparation is stimulated 2–3-fold by 1 mM MnCl2. 4) Sodium
thiocyanate elution of the microcystin-agarose column may
denature and irreversibly inactivate some of the PP1. 5) Certain PP2A-like enzymes may contribute to activities measured
in extracts and at early purification steps, despite the presence
of 2.5 nM okadaic acid in the assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). Later chromatographic steps resolve PP2A from PP1
(see also Ref. 13), such that the A and C subunits of PP2A are
not typically detected in the final preparation on silver-stained
SDS-PAGE gels, or by immunoblotting (not shown).
Identification of PP1bps in the PP1A Holoenzyme—PP1bp134
was subjected to endo-Lys-C digestion and three purified peptides were subjected to amino acid sequencing (Fig. 2). A total
of 52 Edman degradation cycles were performed, yielding only
50 residues of PP1bp134 sequence since amino acid assignments were ambiguous for two sequencer cycles. When the
sequences were initially obtained, BLAST analysis revealed no
known mammalian protein sequences with similarities to all
three peptides. However, subsequent data base searches identified two newly added sequences (Fig. 2). The peptides were
100% identical to portions of spinophilin, which was identified
as a PP1bp by yeast two-hybrid analysis (14) and was independently purified as an F-actin-binding protein (17).2 In ad-dition, the peptide sequences were 84% identical to portions of
neurabin, a spinophilin homolog which was purified as an
F-actin-binding protein and cloned (16). The apparent molecular weights of spinophilin and neurabin by SDS-PAGE were
noted to be considerably larger than sizes predicted from their
amino acid sequences (16, 17), but are similar to the apparent
molecular weights of PP1bp134 and PP1bp175, respectively.
While interaction of PP1 with spinophilin was established previously (14), association of PP1 with neurabin has not been
documented. These data show that PP1bp134 is spinophilin
and suggest that PP1bp175 may be neurabin.
To confirm the identity of PP1bp134 and PP1bp175, antibodies were raised to GST fusion proteins containing divergent
regions of spinophilin and neurabin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoblotting of forebrain extracts with anti-spinophilin sera, but not preimmune serum from the same animal
yielded a major band at about 134 kDa, plus several very minor
bands (Fig. 3A). Preincubation of anti-spinophilin serum with

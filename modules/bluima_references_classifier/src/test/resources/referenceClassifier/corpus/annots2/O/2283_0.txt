inhalation of CO2 indicate that a 0.003 increase in Vm
pH would correspond to a 7% reduction in minute ventilation. Thus the 8.5% decrease in V observed with acute
hypertension lies on the stimulus-response curve ob-tained with inhalation of COa.
Ventral Medullary pH and Ventilatory Responsesto
Brain Hypoxia
Carbon monoxide. Inhalation of 1% CO-40% 02 produced a progressive increase in the percentage of HbCO
in arterial blood at an average rate of 9% HbCO/min.
Figure 4 demonstrates a typical response to this type of
brain hypoxia in one cat. Progressive carboxyhemogl .O-binemia elicited first an increase in Vm pH with relatively low HbCO levels (l2-25%) and then a decrease in
Vm pH with greater levels of HbCO. Both of these Vm
pH changes were associated with reductions in V with
the largest reductions in ventilation associated with the
decreased brain pH at the greater HbCO levels. The
greatest amount of ventilatory depression associated
with an alkalotic shift in Vm pH occurred at a mean
HbCO level of 17%. Clear acidotic shifts in Vm pH were
present in all cats when the HbCO level had reached a
mean value of 37% (Table 2). The qualitative nature of
the response in each cat was identical; there was an
initial alkalosis with a small but significant reduction in
ventilation (89 t 4% of base-line ventilation) followed
by brain acidosis (as evidenced by a downward shift in
Vm pH) and further depression of ventilation (72 t 3%
of base-line ventilation). The depression of breathing at
a HbCO of 17% was manifested as a decrease in frequency due predominantly to a prolongation of both

obvious mortality at the prenatal stages. Histological examination of the brain of the fyn transgenic
mice did not reveal any overt abnormalities at the
light microscopic level (Lu et al. 1999). Nevertheless, we found that mice expressing mutant Fyn
were prone to spontaneous death, generally after
weaning. We surveyed the viability of postweaning
F1 offspring for up to 20 weeks (Table 2). We ob-served no difference in the viability between wildtype mice and heterozygotes in the absence of the
transgene. In three out of the six lines that ex-pressed the mutant Fyn (M3, 47, and 84), animals
died within 8, 5, and 15 weeks, respectively. We
detected high levels of transgenic fyn mRNA in line
M84 by ribonuclease protection assay, comparable
to the level in line N92 (data not shown). In the
remaining three lines (M27, 58, and 78), the survival rate was lower than that in native fyn transgenic lines. In these three lines, the survival rate
correlated inversely with the level of mutant Fyn
protein (Fig. 2); survival was higher in line M58
(which shows the lowest level of mutant Fyn protein) than in lines M27 and 78. The sudden death
was observed generally in mice expressing mutant
Fyn when the mice were >4 weeks of age. In these
lines, we have often observed spontaneous running and bouncing fits as well as tonic convulsion
followed by death. By contrast, >88% of transgenic
mice expressing native Fyn survived >20 weeks,
although on rare occasion we also observed seizure in lines N8 and 92.
For further physiological and biochemical
studies we analyzed fyn transgenic mice generated
on wild-type genetic background (Tg+/fyn+/+) with
a comparison of nontransgenic wild-type mice
(Tg-/fyn-/-), and in some experiments with a comparison of fyn knockout mice (Tg-/fyn-/-) .

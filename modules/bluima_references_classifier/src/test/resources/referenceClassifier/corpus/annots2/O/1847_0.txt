Time (ms)

FIG. 5. These peristimulus histograms are examples of responses of
NTS neurons to functional ADN stimulation. Peristimulus histogram
in A was collected over 200 ADN stimulations and is example of longduration (290 ms) excitatory response that began 80 ms after stimulation (arrow). Example of inhibitory effect induced over period of 200
ADN stimulations is shown in peristimulus histogram in B. This effect
had a latency of 30 ms after stimulation (arrow) and lasted for 400 ms.

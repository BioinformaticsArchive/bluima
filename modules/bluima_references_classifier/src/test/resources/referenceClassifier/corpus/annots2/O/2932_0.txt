Antisera to [Met]enkephalin, [Leu]enkephalin and dynorphin A
Antisera to [Met]enkephalin, dynorphin A (1–13) and
[Leu]enkephalin were produced in this laboratory by the
method described by Ho ̈ llt et al.6 The potencies and the
cross-reactivities with other endogenous opioid peptides of
these antisera have been characterized.22 The antiserum or
control rabbit serum was injected intrathecally 60 min be-fore i.c.v. injection of etorphine and antinociception was
measured 10 min after etorphine injection.

turning behavior (1.3 0.2 turns per hr), when the cells have
multiple (3.7 0.1 processes per cell) and short (20.8 2.1 m)
processes. The length of cycle of cell movement and stationary
state is shortest (218 16 min). In the second phase (20 – 40 hr in
vitro), granule cells extend a long and thick leading process-like
process (55.6 3.0 m) and exhibit an elongated cycle (244 13
min) of cell movement and stationary state. The rate of cell
movement is fastest (33.1 2.0 m/hr), whereas the number of
turning is lowest (0.3 0.1 turns per hr). In the third phase
(40 – 60 hr in vitro), granule cells slow down their movement
(25.2 3.2 m / hr), but slightly increase the turning number
(0.5 0.1 turns per hr). The length of cycle of cell movement
f urther increases to 297 21 min. These results demonstrate that
granule cells sequentially alter mode, rate, and direction of mi-gration and morphology in vitro without contacting other neurons
or glial cells.

Existence of intrinsic programs for controlling
migratory behavior of granule cells
If there is a strong intrinsic program for controlling migratory
behavior, isolated granule cells may exhibit similar characteristic
phases of migration in different adhesive substrates and in different concentrations of laminin. Furthermore, granule cells isolated
from different postnatal stages also may undergo the same patterns of changes in migratory behavior. To address these issues,
we determined migratory behavior of isolated granule cells in a
fibronectin (20 g /ml) and in a lower (4 g /ml) or higher (100
g/ml) concentration of laminin. Moreover, we observed sequential changes of granule cell migration in the microexplant cultures
prepared from postnatal 5-d-old mouse cerebella. The results are
presented quantitatively in Figure 10a–g. Although there were
some differences in the rates of cell behavior among the four
different experimental groups, the majority of isolated granule
cells displayed the same patterns of behavioral and morphological
changes during characteristic three phases in isolation as follows:
(1) the rate of cell movement in the second phase was fastest (Fig.
10a), (2) the rate of turning behavior in the first phase was highest
(Fig. 10b), (3) the length of cycle of cell movement systematically
increased as time in vitro increased (Fig. 10c), (4) the length of the
stationary state in the second phase was longest (Fig. 10d), (5) the
number of processes was largest in the first phase (Fig. 10f ), and
(6) the length of process in the third phase was longest (Fig. 10g).
These results demonstrate the existence of intrinsic (inherent)
programs for controlling migratory behavior of granule cells in an
age-dependent manner (or a developmental stage-dependent
manner). These results suggest that such internal programs may
play a crucial role in distinct modes of granule cell migration in
different cortical layers of the developing cerebellum in vivo.

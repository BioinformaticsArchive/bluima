the immunoreactivity was considerably less intense in
relay nuclei such as the ventrobasal thalamus and
lateral geniculate nucleus. Lower levels of PrPc as de-tected on Western blot and by immunohistochemistry
were noted in the brainstem and midbrain (Sale`s et al.,
1998). If the presence of PrPc in a brain region is
related to pathologic changes in TSE, then the relative
abundance of the protein in limbic areas may be a
molecular underpinning for the cognitive deficits that
are reported during TSE in humans (Landis et al.,
1981).
The immunoelectronmicroscopic localization of PrPc
shows the protein to be present both pre- and postsynaptically (present results, Fournier et al., 1995; Sale` s
et al., 1998; see also Haeberle ́ et al., 2000, pages 66 –75,
this issue). The localization of PrPc at the site of neuronal contact suggests a synaptic function for this protein. Thus, alterations in levels of PrPc at the synapse
and/or its transconformation during TSE may be re-sponsible for the synaptic degeneration reported in
prion disease (Clinton et al., 1993). The precise function of PrPc remains elusive. Electrophysiological studies of hippocampal slices from PrP null mice have produced conflicting results. An initial study reported al-tered long-term potentiation and synaptic inhibition in
the hippocampus of PrP null mice (Collinge et al.,
1994). However, others have failed to replicate those
observations (Lle ́do et al., 1996). At a cellular level,
there is evidence from two groups that neuronal calcium-activated potassium currents depend on the normal expression of PrPc (Colling et al., 1996; Herms et
al., 1998) and that copper ion levels in the synaptic cleft
may modulate synaptic membrane characteristics by
binding to PrPc (Brown et al., 1997).
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that PrPc is
synthesized in neuronal cell bodies and conveyed down
the axons to the terminal in the rapid phase of axonal
transport (Borchelt et al., 1994; Rodolfo et al., 1999).
Thus, the PrPc at the presynapse most likely represents the accumulation of anterogradely transported
protein. Postsynaptic PrPc may reflect an accumulation
of the protein present in the dendritic compartment of
the neuron. However, our results showed no obvious
PrPc immunoreactivity in readily identifiable dendrites
such as those of cortical pyramidal cells or cerebellar
Purkinje cells. Alternatively, postsynaptic PrPc may
reflect, in part, an accumulation of PrPc secreted from
the presynapse. Although evidence for interneuronal
transfer at the synapse has not been reported for PrPc,
the transfer of a GPI-linked protein from one cellular
membrane to an adjacent cell membrane can occur in
other systems in vivo (Kooyman et al., 1995). While
further studies are neccessary to examine this possibility, the secretion of PrP from the presynapse and its
uptake at the postsynaptic element may provide a
mechanism for the propagation of infection in TSE
through the neuraxis.
Our results show a similarity in the overall distribution of PrPc in the hippocampus from hamster, ma-caque, baboon, and man (Fig. 1 and Sale`s et al., 1998).
Pyramidal and granule cell bodies contained little or no
PrPc immunoreactivity while the synapse-rich zones in
the oriens and radiatum layers were densely immunoreactive. Interestingly, some species differences in
staining intensity were noted in the dentate gyrus. In

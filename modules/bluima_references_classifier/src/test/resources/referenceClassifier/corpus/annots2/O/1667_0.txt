mice. (a) RT-PCR analysis using primers MBP5' and MBP3' of total
brain RNA from either control mice (lanes 1 through 3) or C7
transgenic littermates (lanes 4 through 6) that were sacrificed at 3
weeks (lanes 1 and 4), 4 weeks (lanes 2 and 5), and 5 weeks (lanes 3
and 6) of age. The position of the 238-bp RT-PCR product is 15.
indicated (arrowhead). (b) Western immunoblot analysis using a
rabbit anti-MBP serum of total brain extracts from either control
mice (lanes 1 and 3) or transgenic littermates (lanes 2 and 4) that 16.
were sacrificed at 3 weeks (lanes 1 and 2) and 20 weeks (lanes 3 and
4) of age. Positions of the abundant MBP components are indicated
(bracket). The molecular weight markers (Mr) used were 92,000, 17.
68,000, 45,000, 30,000, and 12,000.

1994). The system has 18 rings which allows the acquisition
of 35 transaxial images with a slice thickness of 4.25 mm
covering an axial field of view of 15.2 cm. Transmission data
were acquired using a pair of rotating pin sources filled with
68Ge (10 mCi/pin). A filtered back-projection algorithm was
employed for image reconstruction, on a 128×128 matrix with
a pixel size of 1.9 mm, using a Hanning filter in the transaxial
plane (cut-off width 4 mm) and a ramp filter (cut-off 8.5 mm)
in the axial direction. In the stereotaxic standard space, each
voxel was 2×2×4 mm in size. Regional cerebral blood flow
(rCBF) was estimated by recording the distribution of
radioactivity following an intravenous bolus injection of 1110
MBq of 15O-H2O through a forearm cannula placed into the
brachial vein. The integrated counts collected for 70 s, starting
20 s after the injection, were used as an index of rCBF.
At the beginning of the film, specific pre-recorded
instructions were displayed to focus the subjects' attention
and to tell them what task was to be performed. The video
film with action sequences was switched on at the same
moment as the injection time. A 10-min interval was necessary
between each test condition for adequate radioactivity decay.

at the same time (1200-1400 h) and under the same
lighting condition. By this standardization of conditions
the effects of changes in diurnal rhythms and blood sugar
concentration on brain metabolism were minimized.
On the day of the experiment a polyethylene catheter
(0.8 mm OD) for injection of [`“Cl-DG was surgically
inserted into the femoral vein under nembutal anesthesia
(25 mg/kg ip). After surgery the incised wound was
covered with lidocaine jelly, and the animals were suspended with surgical bandage netting (Presnet, Tokyo
Eisai) that minimally restricted their movements. They
could move their extremities freely throughout the 6-h
(minimum) recovery period and the experiment. The
experiment was initiated by intravenous administration
of 10 &i/100 g [14C]-DG (spec act 51.3-52.2 mCi/mol,
New England Nuclear) in 1 ml saline into the femoral
vein through the catheter. Perfusion of the implanted
thermodes, and thus the thermal stimulation of the PO/
AH region, was started with injection of [14C]-DG and
lasted 45 min. Throughout the period of recovery from
anesthesia and the experiment, rectal (T,,), tail skin (T,),
perfused water, and room (T,) temperatures were measured continuously with copper-constantan thermocouple probes. The temperature of the PO/AH region was
not measured directly in this experiment. The 15 animals
used were divided into three experimental groups as
follows: 1) cooling group (n = 6), where thermodes were
perfused with water at 28°C; 2) the control group (n =
4), where thermodes were not perfused, and 3) the warming group (n = 5), where thermodes were perfused with
water at 42°C. Immediately after thermal stimulation for
45 min the animals were decapitated. Their brains were
rapidly removed within 5 min of decapitation, frozen in
Freon chilled with liquid N2 and cut into sections (28 pm
thick) in a cryostat (DAMON/IEC) maintained at
-20°C. These sections were dried on a slide warmer at
6OOC. For autoradiography the sections were then ex-posed to a double-emulsion X-ray film (Sakura Medical-A) in X-ray film cassettes for 10 days, and the film was
then developed.
Adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin and served for histological identification of parts
in the autoradiographs, using rat brain atlas (18,19). For
quantitative comparison optical densities (OD) of the
brain regions and polymer reference sources for standardizing (set for autoradiography CFR-10, Amersham)
in autoradiographs were measured with a microscanning
photometer (Nikon, Vickers, M85) with an aperture setting of 0.15 mm. Before measurement of ODs in selected
brain regions, the photometer had been previously ad-justed so that ODs of the [14C]-DG standards have an
almost linear relationship to the 14C content of those
standards. Five readings of the OD were averaged for the
selected brain regions, and the OD ratios of the various
brain regions to the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and the fornix were calculated. The data were
analyzed for statistical significance by Student's t test
for unpaired data.
Experiment 2. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 240-270 g were used. In each rat Silastic tubing (Dow Corning
602-155, 0.063 cm ID, 0.118 cm OD) for the injection of

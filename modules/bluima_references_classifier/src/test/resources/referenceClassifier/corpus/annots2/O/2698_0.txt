directional selectivity. The PS location associated with the greatest activity was defined as the cell's preferred direction (from
the central fixation point). Individual cells had preferred directions in all quadrants of the work space. Most PM cells showed
unimodal directional selectivity curves in all task periods studied, as reported previously for the delay and premovement pe-riods (Caminiti et al., 1990, 1991; Crammond and Kalaska,
1990, 1991). In PF, we could confirm the spatial selectivity
reported previously in both skeletomotor and oculomotor tasks
(Vaadia et al., 1986; Funahashi et al., 1990).

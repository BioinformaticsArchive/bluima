Figure 5. A model describing the neural circuitries by which the vSub
may modulate DA neuron activity. Stimulation of the vSub by inf usions of
NMDA activates glutamatergic afferents to the NAc. This in turn is
proposed to inhibit the activity of neurons in the V P. As a result, there is
a removal of tonic inhibition of neurons in the V TA. In this model, we
propose that the VPâ€“VTA projection provides sufficient inhibitory
influence to hold a subpopulation of DA neurons in an inactive state.
Thus, inhibition of VP firing would lead to an increase in the number
of VTA DA neurons firing spontaneously. The question mark beside
the VP to VTA path indicates that, although this pathway is known to
be present in the rat, its involvement in this response remains speculative at the present time.

FIG. 1. Optimizing immunoprecipitation conditions. An initial precipitation was conducted of 125I-IbTX-D19Y/
Y36F-labeled membranes with antibodies
raised against different kind of Ca2
channels. A, Alpha-18 directed against
BK subunits in rat, CNC1 against
1C
subunits in rat, CND8 against sub-1D
units in rat, CNA-C1 against subunits
1A
in rat, RCP15 against denaturated Ca2
channel subunits in rat, and CNC
MCA-gly
against subunits in rabbit. For opti-1C
mization of solubilization, 125I-IbTXD19Y/36F-labeled membranes were
treated with different detergents and subsequently precipitated with 5 and 10 l of
CND8 antibodies as depicted in B (n
4 â€“11). The specificity of the immunoreaction was controlled by precipitation
of 125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F-labeled membranes with, respectively, Alpha-18,
CNC1, or CND8 antibodies compared
with the corresponding preimmune se-rum or an early bleed (in the case of
CNC1), demonstrated in C (n 4).

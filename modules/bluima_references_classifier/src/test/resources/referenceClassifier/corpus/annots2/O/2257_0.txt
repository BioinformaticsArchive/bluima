seenafter chronic deafferentation (Fig. 1). Planimetric measurementsindicate no significant shrinkageof the deafferented
lamina II in either the acute or chronic survivors (Table 1).
Stereological analysis
A summary of the stereologicalanalysis of lamina II for the
controlandacuteandchronicdeafferentedgroupsisshownin
Table 2 and Figure 2. After chronic deafferentation, there is a
decreasein the area occupiedby myelinated axons and by terminalscomparedtocontrolvalues.Thereisalsoastatistically
significant increasein areaoccupiedby non-neuronal elements
(primarily glial cytoplasm), which is detectablein both acutely
and chronically deafferented lamina II. This increasein glial
cytoplasm is equivalent to the lossin myelinated axons and
terminals in the deafferented lamina II and accounts for the
absenceof measurableshrinkageandthe maintenanceof normal
laminardimensions.Degenerativedebriswasmostcommonin

The gliosisin lamina II, unlike the argyrophilic degeneration
products, appearsto remain indefinitely. Other componentsof
the neuropil, the unmyelinated axons, and postsynaptic structures show no significant changesfrom control levels. Degenerative debris was never seenin lamina II on the unoperated
control side.No differenceswereseenbetweenunoperatedsides

this animal are not included in the tables.)
Synaptic terminals in lamina I
A summary of the characteristicsof terminals in control and
deafferentedlamina II is shown in Table 3.
Control. Most of the synaptic terminals in control lamina II
contain sphericalvesicles(87%)andmakecontactswith dendritic processes(98%; Table 3). Within this population, it is

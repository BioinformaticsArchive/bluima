FIG.2. Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence for chicken MHC-B. Some of the amino acid consensus sequences (28) of the
MHC are boxed part of the ATP-binding site (amino acids 159-194), part of the actin-binding site (amino acids 661-683), the 2 reactive
cysteines (amino acids 701 and 7111, the proline at the beginning of the a-helical rod (amino acid 843), and the proline terminating the a-helical rod (amino acid 1933). A typical 28-residue repeat characteristic of a-helical coiled coils is indicated by the filled arrowheads (amino
acids857-884).Theopenarrowheadsbetweennucleotides1863and1864(aminoacid621)indicatethelocationofthe63-nucleotideinsertion,
and between nucleotides 633 and 634 (amino acid 211) the 30-nucleotide insertion. Eight regions that show marked identities with respect to
amino acids among the nonsarcomeric MHCs are underlined (see "Discussion").

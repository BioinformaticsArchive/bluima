hibited by adrenergic receptor blockade. After pretreatment with prazosin, an -adrenergic receptor
antagonist, ischemia-reperfusion failed to increase
catalase activity in the heart and brain. However,
propranolol, a -adrenergic receptor antagonist, did
not exert any influence on catalase activity. The catalase activity in the liver was not altered by any intervention (Fig. 7).

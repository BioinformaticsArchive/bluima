Figure 1. Diagram of recording track and position of a rat over the course of a single trial. The
rat begins on one side of the floor surface (A). To initiate a trial, the animal approaches and
ascends the outer wall (B). When the animal reaches the junction between the wall and ceiling,
it pitches backward 90Â° to move across the ceiling (C) in an upside-down orientation. When the
rat reaches the far wall (D), it descends into the reward compartment of the floor (E) for a food
reward. The current floor compartment then becomes the start compartment, and the animal
reverses direction for the next trial.

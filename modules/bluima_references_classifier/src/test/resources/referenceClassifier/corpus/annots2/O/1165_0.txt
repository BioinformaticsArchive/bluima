Introduction
An animal's CNS is inundated with a flood of sensory inputs,
some of which are critical for survival and some of which are
redundant and/or currently irrelevant for ongoing behavior. To
gain control over this potential information overload, several
processes exist to gate sensory input and devote processing re-sources to the most important or relevant stimuli. Disruptions in
these sensory gating and attention mechanisms have been implicated in disorders such as schizophrenia and autism (Ornitz et al.,
1993; McAlonan et al., 2002; Ludewig et al., 2003). Adaptation to
sensory stimulation and resulting behavioral habituation is one
such mechanism that allows filtering of more static, behaviorally
less relevant stimuli (Thompson and Spencer, 1966; Christoffersen, 1997). The neural mechanisms of sensory habituation
have been determined in several invertebrate models (Zucker,
1972; Kandel and Schwartz, 1982; Christoffersen, 1997) but have
been more elusive in the mammalian brain.
In this study, we took advantage of the relative simplicity of
the mammalian olfactory system, and the known circuitry underlying simple olfactory orienting responses, to test a proposed
cortical synaptic mechanism of short-term habituation to odors.
The mammalian olfactory pathway begins within the nose at ol-factory receptor neurons. Olfactory receptors, as receptors in
most sensory systems, can adapt to prolonged stimulation, al-though olfactory receptor adaptation is slow in freely breathing

psychoses is unknown. Speculatively, the model of MK-801induced behavior in rats represents a model where the EAA
dysfunction in psychosis would be due to a malfunctioning of
NMDA receptors. In vitro, MK-801 has very low affinity to
the inactivated state of the receptor, but when the receptor is
activated by agonists and coagonists, MK-801 binds to its site
within the NMDA receptor-associated channel with high af-finity (Kemp et al., 1991). Thus, factors influencing NMDA
receptor activation may also influence MK-801 binding
within the channel, and thereby modify MK-801-induced be-

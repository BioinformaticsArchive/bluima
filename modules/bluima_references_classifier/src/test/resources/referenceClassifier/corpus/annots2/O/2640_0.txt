comparisons were not significantly different at any dose at 2
h postinfusion.
Cumulative water intake-2 h (Fig. 6C). As had been ob-served in the double cannulae animals, NPY infusions of 5.0
and 10.0 #g significantly elevated the amount of water consumed over the 2-h postinfusion period in sham-operated
groups with single 3V or 4V cannulae (ps < 0.05). The low
dose of NPY (2.5 #g) was sufficient to elevate water intake
significantly in the 4V (p < 0.01) but not the 3V (p > 0.05)
sham-treated groups. In the 3V LKC group, 2.5 and 5 #g
(but not 10 #g) of NPY significantly elevated water intake as
compared to the 0-#g dose. However, the amount of water
consumed by 3V LKC rats was significantly lower than that

Radiochemical purity of test compounds. The purity
of radiolabeled albumin was analyzed by gel filtration
and by precipitation of labeled protein with TCA. With
gel filtration the radioactivity in samples of plasma (n =
4) and brain (n = 4) from experimental rats killed 18 h
after intracerebral injection of radiolabeled albumin
chromatographed as a single peak with the same mobility
as the stock albumin solution. A high degree of radiochemical purity of the labeled albumin was also indicated by results with TCA precipitation. For pooled brain
samples from rats killed 1, 4, 18, or 28 h after injection
only 1.4, 1.7, 1.9, and 1.8%, respectively, of the total tissue
radioactivity was unbound. In the stock isotope solution
the value was 1.9% (n = 4). The radiochemical purity of
the two polyethylene glycols-[3H]PEG 900 and [`â€œCl-PEG 4,000-was also assayed by gel filtration. In brain
and CSF from a rat killed 18 h after intracerebral isotope
injection, the radioactivity of both test compounds chromatographed as single peaks with the same mobilities as
radioactivity in the stock injection solution.
Diffusion coefficients. The diffusion coefficient (mean
t SE) for the smaller polyethylene glycol, PEG 900, is
4.0 t 0.3 X 10s6 cm2W1 (n = 4) compared to a value for
albumin of 0.85 x 10e6 cm2s-' (19). In a larger series of
experiments. Dr. Joseph Fenstermacher (personal communication) obtained a value of 4.13 t 0.07 x low6cm20
S -1 (n = 12) for PEG 900. Thus, the polyethylene glycols
and albumin provide an approximately fivefold range in
diffusion coefficient.
Isotope efflux from brain. The accuracy of experimental techniques for microinjecting and recovering isotope
from brain was examined in a series of zero-time controls.
In these control animals, killed immediately prior to
isotope injection and recovery, the mean recovery from

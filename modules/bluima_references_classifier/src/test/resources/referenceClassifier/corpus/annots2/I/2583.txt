or ondansetron at 100 pg/kg (solid circles) before delivering five pairs of theta burst stimulation. LTP is expressed as an increase in the slope of
the field EPSP (means ? SEM); each time point contains the average of 16 consecutive responses per animal. Comparisons of LTP after drug
versus vehicle injection (intrasubject comparisons) were done using the paired t test and revealed that the differences in LTP between the two
conditions were significant at all time points measured (see text for exact values). C, Same experiment as illustrated in B, except that a higher dose
of ondansetron (500 kg/kg) was tested and a different group of six rats used. D and D', Averaged field EPSPs (four per average) from one animal
run in the experiment shown in B, where LTP was induced following injection of vehicle solution (D) or ondansetron at 100 kg/kg (D'). Calibration:
1 mV, 5 msec.

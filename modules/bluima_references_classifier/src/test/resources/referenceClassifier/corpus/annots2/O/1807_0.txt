natal day 14) were used for this study. For the ISH experiments,
animals (n 10) were anesthetized with i.p. injection of urethane
(2 mg/kg body weight) before being perfused with 1/3 volume:
weight cold heparinized saline followed by equal volume:weight
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4. The
spinal cords were harvested, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 1 h at 4 °C, and placed in cryoprotectant consisting of RNAase
free 10% sucrose in 50 mM PB for 2 h at 4 °C. Lumbar segments
of the spinal cord (L4 –L6) were removed and placed in OCT
embedding compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield,
PA, USA) and frozen with dry ice. The tissue block was sectioned
transversely on a Leitz 1720 cryostat (Leica, Bannockburn, IL,
USA) at 10 m and thaw mounted onto glass slides. All slides
were stored at 80 °C until use.

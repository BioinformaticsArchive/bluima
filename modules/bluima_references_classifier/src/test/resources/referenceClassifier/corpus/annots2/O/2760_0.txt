Establishment of an in vitro transcription-primer extension
assay to identify functional cis-acting elements in LAP1. We
have used an in vitro transcription-primer extension system to
localize cis-acting elements within LAP1 (Fig. 1). Our transcription reaction mixtures were standardized by using the
pML.CAT template, which contains the adenovirus type 5 ma-jor late promoter (positions -279 to +33) fused to the bacterial CAT gene. Accurate transcription initiation at the major
late promoter was inferred by the detection of a 76-base primer
extension product using the 18-mer CAT primer (Fig. 2, lane
3). The size of this extension product is consistent with accurate initiation 30 bp downstream of the major late TATA box
element. To test for LAP1 promoter activity in vitro, we used
the pLAP1[-142/+61]CAT template, which contains se-quences from positions -142 to +61 relative to the putative
start site of the 8.3-kb primary LAT (13). Primer extension of
transcripts from the pLAP1[-142/+61]CAT template using
the 18-mer CAT primer yielded a 104-nucleotide extension
product (Fig. 2, lane 8), the 5' end of which mapped to an A
residue 28 nucleotides downstream of the LAP1 TATA box
(Fig. 2, lanes 4 to 7). We also observed a smaller extension
product which could represent an additional start site or an
incomplete primer extension product of the full-length species.
The 104-base extension product was not detected in the presence of low concentrations of Î±-amanitin in the transcription
reaction mixture (Fig. 2, lane 9), indicating that the 104-nucleotide band is an extension product of an RNA polymerase II
transcript. Furthermore, the 104-base extension product is not
detected when pLAP-R, in which LAP1 sequences are in re-

of only six quanta can generate spike output with high temporal
precision.
The rise time distribution of mean quantal waveforms overlapped with the fastest mean stimulus-aligned evoked currents
(Fig. 7C) in control conditions as did the weighted decay distribution of the quantal and control currents (Fig. 7D). Currents in
control conditions with slowest decay kinetics typically exhibited
a noticeable slow spillover-mediated current component (supplemental Fig. 1 Bi,Bii, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). On average MF-evoked EPSCs in control conditions had a decay that could be fit by a two-exponential
function ( 1 0.6 0.4 ms, A1 79 16%; 2 4.4 3.0 ms,
A2 21 16%; n 38). The mean time course of rise-aligned
quantal EPSCs, recorded in low calcium solution, was only marginally faster (20 – 80% rise time 0.16 0.04 ms and a twoexponential decay of 1 0.4 0.1 ms; A1 85 11% and 2
4.2 2.2 ms; A2 15 11%, giving a w 1.1 0.3 ms; n 9)
(Fig. 7E). The similarity of the waveforms suggests that the time
course of quantal release is brief, producing little temporal
“smearing.”
We quantified the release time course under control conditions by deconvolving the mean evoked EPSC waveform with the
mean quantal waveform measured from the same cell (see Materials and Methods) (Sargent et al., 2005). The time course of
quantal release under normal conditions increased and decayed
rapidly (Fig. 7F ). Across cells, the peak release rate was 4.3 1.2
ms 1, and the release function decayed with a time constant of

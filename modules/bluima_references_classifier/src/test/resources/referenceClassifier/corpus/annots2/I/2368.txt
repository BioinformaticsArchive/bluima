be that both forms of inhibition occur simultaneously under many experimental conditions.
The observation that conditioning volleys
which produce PAD had mixed effects on reflex
transmission was unexpected. More needs to be
learned about which motoneurons are active
during reflexes, since we have found that af-ferent volleys produce different combinations
of EPSPs and IPSPs in different motoneurons
(22). It is possible, for example, that inhibitory
interneurons are themselves inhibited during
PAD, resulting in a disinhibition of some
motoneurons. It will be of interest to examine
the monosynaptic EPSPs in motoneurons for
evidence of EPSP depression during PAD to
determine if the afferents responsible for these
monosynaptic EPSPs are subjected to PAD.

Spatiotemporal expression of brevican in
rat cerebellum
With its well defined laminar tissue architecture, developing cerebellum is an excellent system to examine spatiotemporal expression patterns of molecules, especially those involved in cell adhesion and migration. The pattern of cell migration and the
sequence of layer formation during cerebellar histogenesis are
known in considerable detail (for review, see, Altman, 1972).
Also, our initial experiments have shown that, although brevican
is widely expressed in the brain, expression in the cerebellar
cortex is most remarkable in terms of its level and spatial organization. Therefore we expected the cerebellar cortex to provide
information that would be most usef ul for understanding the
biological roles of brevican.
We examined rat cerebella from P7 to P180 by immunoperoxidase staining with RB18 antibodies. Consistent with the immunoblotting results, little brevican immunoreactivity was detected
in P7 (data not shown) and P14 (Fig. 3A) cerebellar sections. At
P21, moderate brevican immunoreactivity is detected in the presumptive white matter (Fig. 3B). The internal granular layer also
shows brevican staining, but it is weaker than that in the presumptive white matter. Significant staining for brevican is first detected
in the granular layer of P28 cerebellum (Fig. 3C,D). At this stage,
migration of granule cells has essentially been completed, and the
external granular layer has disappeared (Altman, 1972). No
brevican immunoreactivity was found in the external granular
layer at any stage we examined. The intensity of the staining in
the internal granular layer increases significantly from P28 to P60
(Fig. 3Eâ€“J ). Even after P35, a stage by which the histogenesis of
cerebellar cortex is all but completed (Altman, 1972), brevican
immunoreactivity still shows a gradual increase in its intensity

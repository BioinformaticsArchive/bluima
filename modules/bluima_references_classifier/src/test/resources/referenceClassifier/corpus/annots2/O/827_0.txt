Fig. 2 | Dorsoventral spinal-cord patterning defects in Gli mutant embryos
can be explained by a gradient model of Gli activator and repressor activity.
(A) Effects of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gli loss-of-function mutations on
patterning of the ventral and intermediate regions of the spinal cord. In
Gli2–/– embryos, the most ventral cell types—the floorplate (FP) and ventral
interneuron 3 (V3) neurons—are absent and there is a concomitant
expansion of the motor neuron (MN) domain. By contrast, in Gli3–/–
mutants, patterning of the intermediate region of the neural tube is
disrupted (see text for details). In comparison with Shh-null mutants,
embryos that lack both Shh and Gli3 function have substantially restored
dorsoventral patterning. Inhibition of all Gli activity by the misexpression
of the dominant-negative protein Gli3R completely suppresses the
formation of all ventral and intermediate neuronal subtypes. (B) According
to the model, Shh-induced, graded Gli activator and repressor transcriptional
activities assign distinct cellular identities along the ventral neural tube.
The ventral-to-dorsal gradient of Shh activity induces a parallel gradient of
Gli activator function, that is, a gradient that is maximal in the ventral
midline and declines in dorsal regions of the neural tube. The gradient of
Gli repressor activity is orientated in the opposite direction to the Shh
gradient because of the antagonistic effect of Shh signalling on Gli repressor
activity. The model proposes partial redundancy of the transcriptional
activity of each Gli protein by the other so that, for example, in the absence
of Gli2, the transcriptional activation function of Gli3 partially
compensates for this. The combined transcriptional activity of the Gli
proteins results in a gradient of transcriptional activation (+) in ventral
regions of the neural tube and repression (–) in intermediate and dorsal
regions. dI, dorsal interneuron; WT, wild type.

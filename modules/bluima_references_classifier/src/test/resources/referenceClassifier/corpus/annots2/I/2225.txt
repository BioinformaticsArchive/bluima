matched to target location. Under natural
conditions, stimuli near the area centralis must
produce simultaneous activity in both superior
colliculi because the anterior poles receive in-put from both ipsilateral and contralateral vi-sual fields (14, 28). Production of accurate
saccades to these targets may depend on a differential signal from the two colliculi, rather
than on the output of one colliculus alone (2).
Thus, the first saccade in an electrically evoked
staircase may appear too large because there
is no accompanying activity in the contralatera1 colliculus. Later saccades could perhaps
be affected by signals travelling ortho- and an-tidromically in the intercollicular projections
that link the anterior parts of the deep tectal
laminae ( 10, 2 1, 23, 36). The ipsilateral visual
field does not project to the rostra1 pole of the
monkey's superior colliculus (8,20, 35), so the
coding of saccades to a paracentral target may
involve only one tectum in these animals, a
situation that might favor a closer agreement
between sensory coordinates and the targets
of electrically evoked saccades.

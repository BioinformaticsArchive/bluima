(Betz, 1993, Schlosshauer, 1993; Plateel et al., 1997; Park
et al., 1999). Increased permeability of cerebral capillary
endothelial cells subjected to a combination of hypoxia/
aglycemia also was described by Abbruscato and Davis
(1999) and Mark and Davis (2002).
The injury of organs and tissues caused by the interruption of oxygen supply (ischemia/hypoxia) results very
likely from oxygen free radicals that are released during the
period of reperfusion. Several researchers have addressed
previously the question of the fundamental mechanisms of
postischemic/hypoxic injury and have suggested that most
tissue injury is associated with admission of oxygen to the
tissue at the time of reperfusion (McCord and Roy, 1982;
Granger, 1988). Vascular consequences of free radical generation include arteriolar dilatation (Kontos et al., 1984),
disturbances of permeability (Olesen, 1987), and direct
injury of vascular endothelium and myointimal cells (Wei
et al., 1985).
The effects of hypoxia and reoxygenation observed
previously in endothelial cells of brain tissue and other
organs by other investigators are numerous. Some of the
effects that have been described are enhanced superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide production, increase of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA levels, in
albumin transport, and in the production of nitric oxide,
elevated release of H O , and a decrease of electrical
22
resistance (Kondo et al., 1996; Kumar et al., 1996; Plateel
et al., 1997). In addition, after prolonged exposure (up to
48 hr) to hypoxic conditions apoptotic cell death occurs
(Stempien-Otero, 1999). Hypoxia alone may cause apoptosis and cell death in umbilical vein endothelial cells

2-fold molar excess as that of 600-fold molar ex-cess. The percentage of specific binding was calculated from the difference between the counts
in the absence and in the presence of unlabeled
RBP. This difference represented 50 per cent of
the total counts bound to PE in the absence
of unlabeled RBP, for a PE concentration of 8
mg. dry weight per milliliter. Results from two
typical experiments are reproduced in Fig. 1.
From analysis of the figure, it is evident that
RBP isolated from the plasma of patients with
the recessive form of RP does not demonstrate
any appreciable difference from normal human
RBP in its capacity to interact with the RBP re-ceptor present on the cell membrane of normal
bovine PE.
Present results seem to definitely demonstrate
that no impairment of RBP function exists in
the most common form of RP. They do not of
course rule out the possibility that the RBP re-ceptor on the plasma membrane of PE maybe
abnormal in this disease.

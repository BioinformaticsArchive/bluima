Abstract: Increased amounts of /3-amyloid (Aj3) peptide
deposits are found in Alzheimer'sdisease brain. These
amyloid deposits have been implicated in the pathophysiology of this common dementing illness. A/li peptides
have been shown to be toxic to neurons in cell culture,
and this toxicity is critically dependent on the aggregation
of the peptide into cross-/li-pleated sheet fibrils. Also, in
vivo and postmortem NMR studies have shown changes
in certain brain membrane phospholipid metabolites in
normal aging and more extensive alterations in patients
with Alzheimer's disease. The finding that membrane
phospholipids affect the aggregation of Ajli suggests that
the abnormalities in membrane metabolism found in Alzheimer'sdisease could affect the deposition of A/li in vivo.
Therefore, we examined the effect of membrane phospholipid metabolites that are altered in Alzheimer'sdisease brain on the aggregation of A/li(1 —40) using a light
scattering method. Certain metabolites (glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, and a-glycerophosphate) augment the aggregation of A/li. Other membrane phospholipid metabolites (phosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, and inositol-1-phosphate) have no
effect. We conclude that increased membrane phospholipid metabolite concentrations may play a role in the
deposition of A/li seen in normal aging and the even
greater deposition of A/li observed in Alzheimer'sdisease.

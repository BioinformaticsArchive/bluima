Figure 16. Physiologically and morphologically characterized ganglion cell types that project to the macaque LGN. Color opponent and nonopponent midget cells project to the parvocellular
layers. Parasol-Y cells project to the magnocellular layers. Small bistratified blue-ON cells may project to the koniocellular layers. The target of the smooth-Y cell is unknown but high achromatic
contrast and temporal sensitivity and Y-cell signature suggest a termination in the magnocellular or possibly koniocellular layers. The target of the melanopsin-containing luminance cells is also
unknown but S-cone input to these cells suggests a projection to the koniocellular layers.

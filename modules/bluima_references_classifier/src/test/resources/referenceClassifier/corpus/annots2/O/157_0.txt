The mechanisms involved in the interaction of PP2A
with microtubules was investigated in vitro using purified
proteins. Initial experiments tested the ability of purified
PP2A to bind directly to microtubules. Increasing concentrations of multimeric PP2A and individual PP2A subunits
were incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules. The
amount of bound PP2A was determined by co-sedimentation with microtubules and immunoblotting. Only a low
level of the AC-R2 Î± heterotrimer co-sedimented under
these conditions Fig. 2A.. The amount bound represented
a small fraction less than 1%. of the total PP2A added.
No detectable amounts of the His -tagged A subunit co- 6

sedimented with microtubules while a low level of the free
catalytic subunit associated directly with microtubules not
shown.. The direct binding of PP2A to microtubules did

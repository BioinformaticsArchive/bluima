neuron input resistance (Ri,) are plotted as functions of the
injected current. The resistance measurements in these
plots represent the slope of the current-voltage curve at
each point for the corresponding value of injected current.
These responses show the strong dependence of input resistance on membrane potential that has been reported to be
characteristic of the majority neostriatal neurons (e.g., Kita
et al. 1984). The base-line membrane potential and input
resistances are indicated by the intersection of these curves
with the dotted vertical line. Base-line membrane potenGals and the input resistance (measured with 0.2-nA hy-

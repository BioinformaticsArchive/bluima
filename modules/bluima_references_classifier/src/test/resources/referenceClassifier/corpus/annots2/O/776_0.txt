decrease with age [110,210]. Firing rates of nigrostriatal
neurons increase gradually [167,212]. Dopamine D1 and D2
receptor density increases in a linear fashion during the first
4 weeks of life and reach their adult-like density at this stage
[159,163,176].
During the periadolescent period, the second wave of
neuronal rearrangements occurs. This wave witnesses a
tremendous overshoot of synapses and receptors during
periadolescence, followed by their pruning or competitive
elimination. (For a comparison of ages and stages of rat
versus human developmental periods, see Fig. 2.) This
fundamental developmental strategy is common to most
regions of the mammalian central nervous system and has
been observed in humans [72,98,190], primates [138,175,
179], and rats [13,71,209]. Between 7 and 15 years of age in
humans, synaptic density in the frontal cortex decreases by
approximately 40% [98,174]. Comparable changes occur in
the human receptors for dopamine [190], glutamate [20],
and neurotensin [147].
Huttenlocher [98] was the first to demonstrate that the
timing of synaptic production and elimination of the
postnatal human brain differed across different regions of
the cortex. The density of synapses in the primary visual

their response to acoustic stimuli (Paton and Nottebohm, 1984). In
the present study, birds were killed either 30 or 60 days after the
last [3H]thymidine injection, allowing as much or more time for the
new neurons to form their afferent and efferent connections. Another
argument is based on known rates of axonal elongation. To be
incorporated into existing neural circuitry, new cells must migrate
from the ventricular zone into HVc (Goldman and Nottebohm, 1983)
differentiate into neurons, and extend axons to their normal targets.
From previous work we know that thymidine-labeled neurons can
be seen in HVc as early as 15 days after the onset of [3H]thymidine
treatment (F. Nottebohm, unpublished observation). A conservative
estimate of axonal growth in viva would be approximately 10 pm/hr
(see Jacobson, 1978, pp. 131-132). At this rate, axons should
extend the 4 mm from HVc to area X in another 16 days, for a total
of 31 days from neurogenesis to full axonal elongation. In our
experiments, either 44 or 74 days elapsed between the initial thymidine injection and the HRP injections, allowing the new neurons
more than enough time to form connections.
There are precedents for the suggestion that neurons born late in
development or even in adulthood are interneurons. Altman (1970)
noted that in all cases known to him involving late developing
structures, such as cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb,
the newly recruited neurons were microneurons that acted as local
interneurons. More recent observations consistent with this pattern
have been catalogued by Jacobson (1978, pp. 58-60). Our findings
agree with these previous cases, with the exception that the cells
we have tentatively identified as interneurons are not the smallest
neurons present.

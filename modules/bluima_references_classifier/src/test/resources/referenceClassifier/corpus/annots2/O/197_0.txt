We investigated the effect of six receptor antagonists on the
propagation of depolarization in the presence of 10 mM TTX
to shed light on mechanisms that regulate the permeability of
gap junction channels in the SCN (Table 3). Among them,
only bicuculline significantly affected the propagation. Bicuculline at a dose of 100 mM increased the spread, and the
effect of bicuculline was not observed when the culture was
pretreated with 10 mM muscimol [96 15% (n Âˆ 6)].
The administration of muscimol to the SCN culture
remarkably decreased the propagation (Fig. 2E, F) and the
effect of muscimol was dose dependent (Table 4). This indicated that the propagation of depolarization between SCN
cells was inhibited by GABAA receptor activation. There
were two possible explanations for this result. First, GABA

collection period, blood could be sampled in only four out of nine
nitroprusside-stimulated rats. However, measures of arterial O2
and CO2 levels confirmed that rats were normo-capnic and maintained close to 100% O2 saturation throughout the observation
period. The temporal profile of portal plasma levels of CART-ir is
shown in Fig. 3. During sodium nitroprusside-induced arterial
hypotension, CART levels remained elevated, whereas CART
levels in saline-infused rats gradually declined to significantly
lower levels than start sample. Thus, in vehicle-treated rats, portal
plasma concentrations of immunoreactive CART gradually decreased with time (t300: 1123  336; t030: 1018  288; t3060:
702  225; t6090: 521  70 pmol/l, mean  SEM, n = 7â€“8) with
a significant drop between samples t3060 and t6090 (P = 0.02,
paired Student's t-test). in the second sampling period (t3060),
baseline concentrations of portal plasma CART-ir had dropped
significantly to 0.63 of prestimulatory levels. Between treatment
group differences were analysed by ANOVA followed by Scheffe's
post-hoc analysis and significantly higher portal plasma levels of
CART-ir were seen in the sodium nitroprusside treated group
throughout the infusion period.

RESULTS
Extracellular Levels of NE
KRP was perfused through a microdialysis probe
located in the BNST, and following a stabilization period,
5 min samples were collected to obtain NE extracellular
levels. As shown in Table I, perfusion of 2 or 10 Î¼M
desipramine through the microdialysis probe produced a
concentration-dependent increase in NE extracellular levels.

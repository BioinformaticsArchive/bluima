primary somatosensory area have demonstrated a critical role of
TCAs in the differentiation of barrels, a functional grouping
unique to this area (for review, see Woolsey, 1990; Schlaggar and
O'Leary, 1993). Transplant experiments have shown that pieces
of embryonic neocortex grafted heterotopically to a different
neocortical area can acquire the area-specific architecture and
connections characteristic of the new area (O'Leary and Stanfield, 1989; Schlaggar and O'Leary, 1991). In addition, reductions
in TCAs arising from the lateral geniculate nucleus have been
correlated with a corresponding reduction in the extent of the
neocortex that differentiates the architecture characteristic of
primary visual cortex, the target area of that thalamic nucleus
(Dehay et al., 1989, 1991; Rakic et al., 1991). The influence of
TCAs on areal plasticity, and by inference on normal arealization,
could be caused in part by its control of differential gene expression in the developing C P.
Recent reports have described the differential expression of
several EphA receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A li-gands in the CP before the arrival of TCAs. In embryonic
monkeys, the receptors EphA3, A4, A6, and A7 are expressed in
graded or areal patterns before TCAs reach the cortex (Donoghue and Rakic, 1999). On the other hand, the receptor EphA5
and the ligands ephrin-A2, A3, and A5, which are graded or areal
at later stages, are either not expressed when TCAs arrive or their
expression is uniform. In rodents, EphA5 and ephrin-A5 also
exhibit substantial differences in their expression patterns before
and after TCAs arrive in the cortex (Zhang et al., 1997; Mackarehtschian et al., 1999).
Although both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to
the process of arealization (O'Leary et al., 1994; Chenn et al.,
1997; Levitt et al., 1997), little is known about how these mechanisms cooperate to establish area-specific properties. The pur-

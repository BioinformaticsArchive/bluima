pocampus of a second independent line of PGC-1 -deficient an-imals (Leone et al., 2005). We found significant differences
among genotypes in both PGC-1 (F(2,22) 75.52, p 1.40
10 10) and PV (F(2,22) 9.23, p 0.001) transcript expression.
Again, expression of PGC-1 and PV was significantly different
among all genotypes (two-tailed t tests, p 0.05), indicating a
dose-dependent relationship between PGC-1 and PV transcript
expression in this region (Fig. 2 B).

the control shRNA did not alter the protein levels of expressed Cdh1, regardless of
the Cdh1 cDNA coexpressed (wild type or
mutant) (Fig. 2 A). However, Cdh1 shRNA

We next investigated the function of
Cdh1 in postmitotic neurons. To achieve
this without affecting any potential effect
on axonal growth (Konishi et al., 2004),
transfections with Cdh1 shRNA were performed after 4 DIV (i.e., when cells displayed a neuronal phenotype). This was
evident from the appearance of characteristic long axonal processes (Fig. 1 A) and
very low cyclin B1 protein levels (Fig. 1C).
Neurons expressing Cdh1 shRNA, identified as GFP cells, were analyzed 3 d later.
Examination by fluorescence microscopy
revealed that GFP neurons displayed
neurite disintegration and cell-body condensation (Fig. 2 B), suggesting apoptotic
cell death. To confirm this, we used flow
cytometry and TUNEL assay to quantify
cell death more accurately. Flowcytometric analyses of postmitotic neurons showed a significant and dramatic de- Figure 3. Characterization of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells subjected to terminal differentiation and effect of Cdh1 depletion

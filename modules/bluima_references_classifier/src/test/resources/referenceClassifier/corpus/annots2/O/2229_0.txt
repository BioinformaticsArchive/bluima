inhibitor or the presence of either captopril
(1 aM) or thiorphan (1 jiM) for 60 min at
37'C in a total volume of 0.5 ml (Table 2).
In contrast to the results obtained with a total
homogenate, however, when [Met5]
enkephalin was incubated with an ileal
membrane fraction, a free Tyr peak was only
slightly decreased by puromycin (1 mM) but
completely disappeared by treatment with
amastatin (1 ,oM) (Table 2). Additionally,
the degree of the free Tyr production in the
presence of puromycin in a membrane
fraction was significantly higher than that in
a total homogenate (Tables 1 and 2),
indicating that the aminopeptidase in a total
homogenate was more susceptible to puro
mycin than that in a membrane fraction.
Moreover, a Tyr-Gly peak could not be
detected when [Met5] -enkephalin was
incubated with a membrane fraction even
in the presence of either amastatin alone, two
peptidase inhibitors, amastatin, and captopril,
or three peptidase inhibitors, amastatin,
captopril, and thiorphan (Table 2), indicating
that in contrast to a total homogenate, an
ileal membrane fraction did not significantly
contain the enzyme releasing the Tyr-Gly
fragment from [Met5]-enkephalin. Further
more, the magnitude of the Tyr-Gly-Gly
generation in the presence of amastatin in a
membrane fraction was significantly higher
than that in a total homogenate (Tables 1 and

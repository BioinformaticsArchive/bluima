the virus occupied by sialyllactose, the virus can no longer bind
to its host receptor tightly enough to induce endocytosis. The
location of the sialic acid binding site is consistent with the
positions of residues which impact virus replication and its
ability to induce a demyelinating persistent infection in the
mouse CNS. For instance, the major sequence variation be-tween persistence and nonpersistent virus strains were located
at VP2 position 2162 and VP2 positions 2171 to 2173, both of

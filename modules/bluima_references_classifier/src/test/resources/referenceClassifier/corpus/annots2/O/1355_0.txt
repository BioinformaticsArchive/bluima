Seven horse heads were perfused immediately after slaughter
with 0.9% physiological saline through the internal carotid
artery for cleaning of the vascular system. Next, 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3,
was injected as fixative through the same route. The brains
were removed and the choroid plexuses collected, cut into
small fragments and immersed in the same fixative. The
material was then washed three times in 0.1 m sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 10 min each, and post-fixed in
1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 4 C. The material
was again washed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3
(three times for 5 min each) and then in distilled water (two
times for 5 min each), dehydrated in an increasing alcohol
series, and dried to the critical point. The samples were
mounted in metal base, sputtered with gold in an Emitech K
550 Sputter apparatus, analysed and photographed under
LEO 435 VP and JEOL JSM 6100 scanning electron microscopes at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechny
and the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, respectively, Sa~ o
Paulo University.

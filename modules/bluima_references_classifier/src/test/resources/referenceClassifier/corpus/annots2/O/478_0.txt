Figure 1. TH protein and mRNA in a
mouse OB. A, Immunoreactivity for
TH protein is restricted to periglomerular cells of the glomerular ( gl )
layer and a few cells in the mitral ( m)
cell layer (arrows, B) and in the accessory olfactory bulb (arrowheads, A).
The inset in B shows periglomerular
cells at higher magnification; filled ar-rowheads show a cell and its dendrite
ramif ying in a glomerulus; the open ar-rowhead indicates an interglomerular
process, presumably an axon. The
boxed area delineates the region shown
in the inset. C, D, TH mRNA is found in
the glomerular, mitral, and superficial
granule ( gr) cell layers. The RMS does
not display either TH protein or
mRNA. CT X, Cortex; g, glomerulus.
Scale bars: A, C, 650 m; B, D, 100 m;
inset, 35 m.

ages were incubated for 72 hr with recombinant murine IL-l.
After incubation with recombinant murine IL-l, we observed
increased numbers of GFAP( +) astroglia in all embryonic stages
tested with E-20 cells, showing a 7-fold elevation in the cell
number (Table 2). rhIL-lcu also stimulated the proliferation of
GFAP(+) astroglia 5-8-fold in E-20 cultures (Fig. 4). Cultures
treated with rhIL- la showed that about 70% of E-20 GFAP( +)
astroglia had incorporated high concentrations of 3H-thymidine
(Fig. 4) while less than 20% of cells in control cultures were
labeled. In agreement with earlier reports (Giulian and Lachman, 1985; Giulian et al., 1986a), neither type of recombinant
IL- 1 altered the number of cultured galactocerebroside( +) oligodendroglia or Dil-ac-LDL( +) microglia (data not shown). We
did not assess the effects of IL-1 upon GFAP(-) or GC(-)
precursor cells.
Discussion
By employing in vitro techniques and selective destruction of
cells, we identify ameboid microglia as a principal source of
IL-l in the CNS during the perinatal period. Based on these
observations, coupled with the fact that IL- 1 serves as a mitogen
for GFAP(+) astroglia, we propose that ameboid microglia,
upon stimulation, help to regulate astroglial growth within specific sites of the normally developing brain. The mechanisms
that activate microglia remain uncertain. Perhaps debris associated with cell death and extraneous axonal projections (In-

tivity. injection of picrotoxin after CgA resulted in activity which
statistically did not differ from activity after saline injection into
the ventral tegmental area and the accumbens [Fig. 3, SAL +
SAL versus CGA + PTX, t(l3) = 0.46, NS] and signi~c~tly
differed from picrotoxin-induced activity with saline preinjection
in the nucleus accumbens [SAL + PTX vs. CGA + FTX,
t(13) = 2.92, p < 0.011. Cobalt chloride had similar effect on
activity. Injection of cobalt into the accumbens prior to picrotoxin
prevented the induction of activity by picrotoxin. Activity after
picrotoxin with cobalt preinjection did not differ from activity
after saline alone [Fig. 3, SAL + SAL vs. CO3 + PTX, $13) =
0.36, NS] and si~~fic~~y differed from picrotoxin-induced ac-tivity with saline preinjection [SAL + PTX vs. COB t FIX,
r( 13) = 4.09, p < O.OOl].The effects of CgA and cobalt chloride
were similar and did not differ statistically from each other [COB
+ FIX versus CGA + I-TX, t(13) = 1.14, NS].

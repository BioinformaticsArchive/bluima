MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals—NMRI mice were used for the preparation of RNA. The day
a vaginal plug was observed was designated embryonic day 0 (E0), and
the day of birth was designated postnatal day 0 (P0). All animals were
raised in the animal facility of the University of Heidelberg (INF 345;
Heidelberg, Germany).
Amplification of Tenascin-C Fragments by Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—For the amplification of two
FNIII domain fragments of TN-C, RNA from mouse brain tissues of
different ages was reverse-transcribed using hexameric random primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 4 μg of total RNA and 200 ng of
random primer in a total volume of 13 μl were incubated at 70 °C for 10
min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. After the addition of
4 μl of 5× First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 μl of 0.1 M
dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of 10 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, the
reactions were heated to 37 °C, and 1 μl of SuperScriptTM reverse
transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. The reactions were
incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, 15 min at 40 °C, 15 min at 42 °C, 15 min
at 45 °C, and 15 min at 50 °C. Finally, the reverse polymerase was heat
denatured during a 5-min incubation at 95 °C. The reactions were
diluted with 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mM
EDTA). 0.5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was used per 25 μl
of PCR reaction with 10 pmol of the appropriate sense and antisense
primers (see Table I). The primers were designed to hybridize to the 5'
and 3' ends of the respective domains. The reaction conditions were as
follows: 60 mM Tris/HCl, 15 mM (NH ) SO , 2 mM MgCl , 0.2 mM
42 4 2
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (AGS
GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) per reaction. Cycling was performed
using a robocycler (Stratagene) starting with a 3-min denaturation step
at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 90 s at
72 °C and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min.
For the amplification of isoform-specific TN-C fragments, RNA from
mouse brain tissues of different ages and oligonucleotides hybridizing
to the 5' end of the fifth and the 3' end of the sixth conserved FNIII
domain of mouse TN-C were used (see Table I, primers 5forw and 6rev).
Before reverse transcription, 5 μg of RNA were denatured at 85 °C for
10 min in the presence of 40 pmol of 6rev in a volume of 7 μl. TN-C-

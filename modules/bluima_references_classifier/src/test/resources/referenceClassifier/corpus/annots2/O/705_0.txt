al., 2001aâ€“ c, 2002a) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and
2% BSA overnight at room temperature. After three 10 min
washes with PBS, sections were incubated sequentially, in goat
anti-rabbit or horse anti-goat IgG (Vector, Bulingame, CA) and
streptavidin (Vector), diluted 1:200 in the same solution as the
primary antiserum. Between incubations, the tissues were
washed with PBS three times for 10 min each. Sections were
visualized with 3,3 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 0.1 M Tris
buffer and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Immunoreactions
were observed under the Axioscope microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany). To establish the specificity of the immunostaining, a negative control test was carried out with preimmune
serum instead of primary antibody. The negative control produced no immunoreactivity in any of the structures examined.

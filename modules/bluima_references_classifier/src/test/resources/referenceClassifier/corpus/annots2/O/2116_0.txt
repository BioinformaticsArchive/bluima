discrete bursting and quiescence seen in other nerves in the
previous preparations. A D3-D6 preparation displayed 3 bursts
of activity in the D6 nerve in response to stimulation of a site
in the rostral-pocket transition zone (Fig. 5F, see Robertson et
al., 1985, for control transition zone responses). Whether this
sensory stimulation activated the rostra1 or pocket generator or
both cannot be determined by the D6 nerve recording. There
are still some rhythmogenic capabilities within the spinal cord
anterior to segment D7.
What is the minimal extent of spinal cord that is sufficient to
produce a pocket scratch motor pattern? Figure 6, a composite
from 5 turtles, illustrates responses elicited in reduced preparations containing 5 segments or less. Figure 6, A and B show
pocket motor patterns produced in preparations consisting of 5
and 4 segments, respectively. Segments D3-D5 are not necessary for the production of a pocket motor pattern. Two different
3-segment preparations are illustrated in Figure 6, C, D, for
comparison. The D6-D8 preparation in Figure 6C produced 3
cycles of motor activity in response to pocket receptive field
stimulation. AM-KE showed a pocket-specific timing, beginning
near VP-HP onset and continuing past VP-HP offset (cf. Fig. 6,
B, C). One change that was seen occasionally at this time was
a decrease in the quiescent period of AM-KE. In the first cycle
in Figure 6C, AM-IE activity never ended, but just decreased
its frequency and amplitude prior to the onset of the next VP-

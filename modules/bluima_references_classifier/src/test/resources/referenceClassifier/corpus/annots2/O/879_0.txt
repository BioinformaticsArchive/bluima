phosphorylation, which targets -catenin for degradation by
the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway, we next assessed the levels
of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated -catenin, immunoprecipitated by anti- -catenin antibody from wild type and mutant
cytosolic extracts. Detection of immunoblots with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 3B) revealed that multiple bands of ubiquitinated -catenin are immunoprecipitated from wild type
striatal cell cytosolic extracts, whereas the -catenin band pre-

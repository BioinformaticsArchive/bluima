Eye movements evoked by microstimulation
Single-pulse electrical stimulation of the vestibular nu-cleus (descending octaval nucleus) and nerve produced ab-ducting movement of the ipsilateral eye and abducting
movement of the contralateral eye. Latencies for the initiation of movement from vestibular nerve stimulation were
around 12 and 14 ms, respectively ( -2 ms shorter from the
descending octaval nucleus). About 6 ms is required for the
transduction of head movements into afferent spikes in the
vestibular nerve (Lisberger and Pavelko 1986; Pastor et al.
1992)) and, when added to 12 and 14 ms, the resultant 18
and 20 ms corresponds well to the earliest latency found for
eye velocity alterations.
A well-delineated area was found in the goldfish vestibulocerebellum where electrical stimulation produced horizontal movement of both eyes toward the ipsilateral side.
The amplitude, rise time, and latency were always larger for
the abducting eye. The latency of eye movements evoked
by vestibulocerebellar stimulation was - 35 ms for both
eyes. This value is more comparable with the 39 ms found
in rabbits after stimulation of the horizontal microzone of
the flocculus (Nagao 1989; see also Sato et al. 1988), in-cluding the variable 8-48 ms reported by Van der Steen et
al. ( 199 1) than the 20-ms latency observed in the monkey
(Belknap and Noda 1987) and 50 ms in the cat (Sato and
Kawasaki 1984).

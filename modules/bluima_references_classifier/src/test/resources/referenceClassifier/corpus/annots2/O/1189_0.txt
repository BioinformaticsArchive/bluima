5 -TG-3 -interacting factor or transforming growth factor
beta (TGF- )-induced factor (TGIF) is a member of the evolutionarily conserved three-amino-acid loop extension (TALE)
superclass of atypical homeodomain proteins (4). The Drosophila genome contains two tandomly repeated TGIF-like
genes, achintya and vismay (2). Loss of both achintya and
vismay results in male infertility due to defects in spermatogenesis (2, 48). These two genes have redundant functions,
because either achintya or vismay can rescue the phenotype
(48). While the homology of human TGIF and Drosophila
TGIF-like proteins is restricted to the TALE homeodomain,
the entire genomic region of TGIF is highly conserved in mammals. The genomic exon and intron organization of TGIF is
identical in humans and mice. Furthermore, human and mouse
TGIF are 82% and 90% identical at the mRNA and protein
levels, respectively. Since mammalian TGIF and Drosophila
TGIF-like genes are very different outside of the homeodomain, it suggests that mammalian TGIF may have unique functions.
Although Drosophila achintya and vismay are transcriptional
activators (20), mammalian TGIF has been implicated as a
transcriptional repressor and corepressor based on in vitro
studies (32, 50). TGIF exhibits several different modes of re-

localization, in a prospective analysis, using different seizure
groupings as each others' controls. This enabled us to assess
the extent to which clinical seizure patterns predict results
of investigations and therefore estimate their localizing value.
In addition, a retrospective analysis of clinical manifestations
associated with pure temporal and frontal lobe lesions was
performed, which gave strong independent support to the
results of the cluster analysis and provided an indication of
those manifestations that are predictably associated with one
or other lobe.
These methods differ significantly from those of most
previous investigators who attempt to resolve the problems
of case selection by describing a cohort of patients where
seizures remitted after similar cortical resections (Rasmussen,
1963, 1983; Delgado-Escueta and Walsh, 1985; Quesney and
Olivier, 1988; Engel et al., 1990; Salanova et al., 1995),
which represent highly selected and uncontrolled case series.
In these series pre-operative investigations are generally
assessed by the extent to which they predict post-operative
remission. In generalizing from patients who have undergone
surgical resection, several questions need to be answered. In
what way do those patients who are not surgical candidates
differ from those who are and do they have different seizure
patterns? If their seizure patterns are the same, of what value
is the seizure pattern in defining the region of onset of
epilepsy by this method? In addition, those patients with
apparently similar electroclinical characteristics, yet not
rendered seizure-free by the same resective surgery are rarely

binant Pax6 proteins corresponding to both forms were tested
in EMSA with the ZPE sequence. As a control a different
binding sequence, 5aCon (7), representing an in vitro binding
site for Pax6-5a, was used (Fig. 1c). While both proteins bound
5aCon efficiently, the ZPE sequence bound only canonical
Pax6.
MARE site. A promoter construct truncated immediately 5'
to the ZPE/Pax6 (-206 to +70) was tested for activity in
lens-derived N/N1003A cells. The promoter was active but only
at about fivefold the activity of the promoterless plasmid control (Fig. 2a). Earlier DNase I footprinting studies (38) showed
no obvious protection upstream of the ZPE by lens cell ex-tracts, although nonlens extract (fibroblast) protected a region
from -245 to -210, which was designated the upstream box
(UB). This suggested the presence of a nonlens, negative element at this site but did not immediately suggest the presence
of a positive element in the lens. However, when sequences
upstream of the Pax6 site (-229 to +70) were included in ·
promoter constructs, the reporter activity increased almost 20-fold over that of the -206 to +70 construct, reaching a level
similar to that of the “full-length” -756 to +70 construct (Fig.
2a).
This result demonstrated that a binding site for a positive
factor for the lens is present in the UB region, although it was
not revealed by footprinting. As an alternative approach,
EMSA of the -229 to -188 fragment was used. This gave
similar complexes with nuclear extracts of N/N1003A rabbit
lens-derived cells and protein extracts of rat lens fiber cells and
rat lens epithelial cells (Fig. 2b). N/N1003A extract, in particular, gave a prominent complex, which was designated UB-A.
Other minor complexes were also apparent, including one designated UB-B, which appeared to be more variable in abundance and apparent stability. In contrast, mouse brain extract
gave different complexes and lacked UB-A and UB-B. Self
competition eliminated the formation of the UB-A and UB-B

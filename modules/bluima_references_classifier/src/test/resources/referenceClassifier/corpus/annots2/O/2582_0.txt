Surgical procedures
General. Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of 400
mgikg of chloral hydrate (Sigma) dissolved in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl)
when electrolvtic lesions were to be made. For ibotenic acid or NMDAinduced excitbtoxic lesions, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of 50 mg/kg of Nembutal (Abbott). Cortical aspirations were
made under Halothane anesthesia to permit quick recovery after decortications. Rats were placed in a Kopf stereotaxic instrument equipped
with blunt earbars, an incision of the skin overlying the skull was made,
and small burr holes were drilled through the skull to allow penetration
of electrodes or injectors. Bilateral lesions were performed in all ex-periments. Following the surgical procedures, the scalp incision was
closed with surgical stainless steel clips, and rats were kept warm and
under observation until recovery from anesthesia. They were subsequently housed two per cage to minimize isolation stress.
Electrolytic lesions. Electrolytic lesions were made with stainless
steel electrodes (0.25 mm in diameter) insulated except for 0.5 mm of
the tip. A constant current source generated DC anodal current for all

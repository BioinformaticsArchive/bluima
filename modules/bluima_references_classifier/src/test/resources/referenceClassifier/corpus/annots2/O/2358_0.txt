For determination of enzyme activities, brain samples
obtained from the other hemisphere of the same rat were
thawed and homogenized I:20 (w/v) in deionized water by
ultrasonication. The homogenates were divided into two
aliquots. One aliquot was used immediately for the determination of glutamic acid de~arboxylase (GAD); the other
aliquot was frozen (- 80°C) and used for determination of
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity which was performed within 48 h.
Glutamate decarboxylase. This was determined by the
method of Roberts and Simonsen.45 Brain homogenates
were diluted with deionized Nz-saturated water to a final
concentration of 1: 100 and centrifuged at 15,OOOg for
10min. The incubation mixture contained 100~1 of the
tissue homogenate, 0. I M imidazole-HCI buffer, pH 7.1.
0.5 mM pyridoxal phosphate (Sigma) and 4mM
[`4C]glutamic acid (0.1 mCi/mmol, Amersham), saturated
with N, at a final volume of 200~1. The incubation was
performed in polycarbonate tubes covered with a rubber
stopper top (Kontes, New Jersey), exposing a small plastic
basket in which a small piece of filter paper (90 x 11mm)
soaked with 100,~l hyamine hydroxide (Packard) was carried. The vials were incubated at 37°C for 1h. The reaction
was stopped by putting the tubes on ice and injecting 0.5 ml
0.3 M perchloric acid through the rubber cap. The vials were
incubated once more at 37°C for 1h to allow [`4C]CO?to
develop and to be trapped on the filter paper. Finally, the
filter papers were transferred to polyethylene vials containin8 8 ml scintillation fluid (Rotiszint 22, Carl Roth, G.F.R.)
and SO~1 5 M acetic acid.
Choline acefylrran$eruse. This was determined according
to the method of Fonnum. ” The tissue homogenate was
diluted with 1OmM EDTA, 0.5'+0Triton X-100, 30mM
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to yield a final dilution of
I: IS0 (v+/v).-An aliquot -of this homogenate (40~1) was
incubated with 30 mM NaCI. 20 mM EGTA. 8 mM choline
chloride, 0.2 mM [`%Z]acetyl coenzyme A (0.8 mCi:mmol,
Amersham) and sodium phosphate buffer. pH 7.4 (final
volume 13Opl), at 37°C for 30min. The reaction was
stopped by adding 5 ml ice cold 10mM sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4, and placing the tubes on ice. Labelled
acetylcholine formed during the reaction was extracted with
I ml heptanon-3 containing I?/, tetraphenylbo~te. After
vigorous shaking, the tubes were centrifuged (at 5OOOg,
7 min) and 500~1 aliquots of the organic phase were
transferred to counting vials and processed for liquid scintillation counting.

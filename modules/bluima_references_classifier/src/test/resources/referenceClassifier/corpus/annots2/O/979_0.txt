RESULTS
Duplicate arrays containing 1,150 human brainenriched genes were hybridized with labeled cRNAs synthesized from DLPFC total RNA from each of four to five
monkeys in the two treatment groups (Fig. 1). The replication values for the duplicate arrays averaged over 97%.
Forty genes were altered by twofold or more by estrogen
treatment (Table I). We identified five genes encoding

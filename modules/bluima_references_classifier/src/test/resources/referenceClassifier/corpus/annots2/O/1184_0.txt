pulse-field gel electrophoresis as described previously (Serizawa et al.,
2000), and injected into fertilized mouse eggs.
The EGFP fluorescence on the whole-mount OB was imaged by a
fluorescence microscope (model SZX12; Olympus Optical) and photographed with a cooled CCD camera (model C4742-95-12ERG;
Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan).
DiI retrograde labeling. Three-week-old mice (C57BL/6) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (2.5 mg/animal) and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The olfactory tissues (OE and
OB) were dissected out and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS. The skull was removed, and the surface of the OB was marked
with a felt-tip pen. The tissues were then embedded in 4% agarose gel in
PBS, and the lateral view of the OB was photographed. The posterior
portion of the OB was sliced off with a microslicer (model PRO7; Douhan EM, Kyoto, Japan) until the sliced surface reached the target spot for
labeling. The sliced surface was stained with trypan blue to visualize the
glomerular structure. DiI crystal (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was
precisely placed on the glomerular layer, and samples were covered with
4% agarose gel. The lateral view of the OB was photographed to identify
the DiI location on the previously photographed OB picture. Using the
previously marked spots with a felt-tip pen as positional markers, locations of DiI crystals were plotted on the schematic diagram of the OB.
Samples were then incubated for 2–3 weeks at 37°C to allow the diffusion
of DiI through nicked axon termini to the OSN cell bodies in the OE.
Tissues were decalcified by incubating in PBS with 0.5 M EDTA at 4°C for
24 h and placed in PBS containing 30% sucrose for 24 h. The tissues were
removed from the gel, and the OB was detached from the OE. Keeping
the OE–OB boundary horizontal, the OE was embedded in OCT compound
(Tissue-Tek, Miles, Torrance, CA). OE sections (16 m thick) were prepared with a cryostat (model CM3050S; Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and
analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (model IX70; Olympus Optical),
coupled with a cooled CCD camera [C4742-95-12ERG (Hamamatsu Photonics) or VB-6010 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan)]. The DiI staining in the OE for
each experiment, along with endoturbinate II and ectoturbinate 2 , is represented by one of the different colors in the color gradation diagram (see Fig.
4A). This OE region includes all zones from 1 to 4 and is reproducibly stained
with DiI from any point on the lateral OB.

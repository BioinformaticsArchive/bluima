Figure 4. Detailed mapping of oblique surround suppression. A, Another
example of suppression arising from an oblique region of the surround,
plotted in the same format as Figures 2 and 3. E, End; S, side. B, Diagram
illustrating the modified reverse correlation method used to obtain a map
of the CRF and the suppressive surround. An optimal drifting (conditioning) grating is displayed on one monitor for the duration of the entire
block of stimuli (23 sec). During this time, stationary square wave gratings
(probe) are presented for 39.5 msec on the other CRT monitor and
optically superimposed with the optimal stimulus. The spatial position for
each probe grating presentation is randomly chosen from 144 grid locations covering the entire CRF and surround. The spatial phase of the
stationary grating is randomly chosen from one of four phases that are
multiples of 90°. After all 576 stimuli (144 × 4) have been presented, there
is a period of ;3 sec in which data are stored to a file and the next
presentation sequence queued. This process is repeated 100 times. The

3.1. Cloning and analysis of hGlyT2 cDNA
In order to clone the human type 2 glycine transporter,
PCR was performed on a human whole-brain cDNA library
using oligonucleotides based on the rat GlyT2 sequence and
directed against regions of high homology (transmembrane
domains 1 and 8 respectively) in the NaÂ‡/Cl3-dependent
transporter family. This produced a fragment of expected
size (1045 bp) which, when cloned and sequenced, was found
to be highly homologous (91%) to the corresponding rat
GlyT2 sequence. The polypeptide encoded by this fragment
is 98.8% homologous to the corresponding rat GlyT2 se-quence with all four amino acid residue substitutions being

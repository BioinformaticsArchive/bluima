Type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'D-II)1 catalyzes the
metabolism of T4 to its active metabolite, T3, in the brain (1, 2).
In astrocytes, 5'D-II is a multimeric protein with marked mo-lecular asymmetry and has an apparent molecular mass of
;200 kDa (3). 5'D-II-like catalytic activity has also been re-ported in the pituitary and brown adipose tissue (1); however,
the hydrodynamic properties of the responsible protein(s) are
unknown. One unique feature of brain 5'D-II is the rapid,

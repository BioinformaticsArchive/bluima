with intracellular [H+] as the reference. Since the intracellular milieu is better buffered than the extracellular
milieu, increases in PcpB or extracellular [H+] would
both be appreciated as acidosis. However, since the lactate produced during hypoxia is derived from the cells
themselves, the gradient may be reversed. Alternatively,
if acid sensitivity is a function of the pH at a protected
extracellular location, for example, within the synapse
as suggested by Loeschcke (ZO), then the fixed acid of
hypoxia may be more restricted in access to this site
than C02. In support of this idea, it has been shown that
the ventilatory response to a change in Vm pH produced
by fixed acid infusion is smaller than that produced by
inhalation of COz (35). This arrangement could also
explain why CO2 inhalation in the presence of hypoxic
brain acidosis can elicit a ventilatory response. However,
it was not clear from the studies of Kiwull-Schone and
Kiwull (18) whether the ventilatory response to COz in
the presence of brain acidosis is equivalent in magnitude
to the response in the absence of brain acidosis. Thus it
is not yet apparent whether hypoxic acidosis per se lacks
the ability to stimulate central chemoreceptors or
whether hypoxia renders the chemosensitive cells less
sensitive.
One last observation to be made from these studies 1s
th at the pattern of breathing assoc.iated with ventilato rY
depression appeared to be dependent on the form of the
experimental brain hypoxia. Progressive carboxyhemoglobinemia resulted in a reduction in ventilation primarily by a decline in respiratory frequency, whereas reductions in arterial O2 tensions caused a decrease in tidal
volume. This difference between carboxyhemoglobinemia and hypoxic hypoxia may suggest that different
mechanisms are involved in the ventilatory responses to
brain hypoxia. There is some evidence in support of a
difference between the metabolic effects of CO and hy-poxic hypoxia in the brain with regard to regional vulnerability of metabolism. In contrast to the absence of
regional differences in metabolic vulnerability during
hypoxic hypoxia (9, 23), there are selective subcortical
regions that have a lower resistance to metabolic alterations during CO inhalation (22). Furthermore, effects
mediated in subcortical suprapontine areas have been
implicated in modulating respiratory frequency during
brain hypoxia (34). Thus it seemspossible the suprapontine respiratory rate modulating regions are more sensitive to the metabolic effects of carboxyhemoglobinemia
than to a reduced Po2 in arterial blood.

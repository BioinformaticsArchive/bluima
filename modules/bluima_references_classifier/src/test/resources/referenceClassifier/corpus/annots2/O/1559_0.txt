Retinal-derived neuregulin is required
for normal optic nerve OPC appearance
Neuregulin-1 has been implicated in OPC
development and is expressed by RGCs
(Bermingham-McDonogh et al., 1996;
Vartanian et al., 1999; Fernandez et al.,
2000). To determine whether retinal in-duction of OPCs is dependent on NRG, we
tested the effect of function-blocking antiNRG antibody. Retinal conditioned me-dium induced a fourfold to fivefold in-crease in spinal cord cultures, and this
induction was inhibited significantly by
the addition of anti-NRG antibody (Fig.
7A–F,G), suggesting that retinal-derived
neuregulin contributed to the appearance
of OPCs. To determine whether neuregulin was involved in vivo, we assayed its ex-pression in the third ventricle floor and
associated optic chiasm region in normal
and eyeless animals by ISH and Western
blot analyses. NRG mRNA was not de-tected in the floor of the third ventricle and
optic chiasmal region when we used a fulllength chicken pro-ARIA probe (Loeb et
al., 1999). In contrast, Western blot analyses showed that in normal animals the
NRG protein was expressed strongly at
stage 29 (E6), and this expression was re-duced significantly in eyeless embryos
(Fig. 7J ), suggesting that retinal axons are
the source of NRG expression in this re-gion. To determine whether NRG is re-quired for optic nerve OPC appearance in
vivo, we injected function-blocking antiNRG antibody into chick embryos daily
from stage 21 to stage 29 (E3–E6). Quantification of OPCs at stage 31 (E7) demonstrated a significant reduction of OPCs in
anti-NRG antibody-treated animals, consistent with a requirement for NRG in op-tic nerve OPC development (Fig. 7 I, J ).

FIG. 1. Attachment of S. mansoni schistosomula to ECs. (A) Live and glutaraldehyde-fixed schistosomula attach to monolayers of MLE. Schistosomula (200/well)
were incubated with confluent cultures of MLE for various periods; then cultured wells were washed, and the remaining adherent parasites were counted. p, P < 0.05
compared to live schistosomula. (B) Schistosomula attach more rapidly to MLE than to epithelioid cells (HeLa), fibroblasts (3T3), and cell-free wells (gelatin). p, P <
0.05 compared to HeLa cells. (C) Attachment of schistosomula to MLE requires cell metabolism and actin microfilament function. Confluent MLE were incubated
with glutaraldehyde (0.1% in PBS) or with cytochalasin D (0.5 μM), nocodazole (10 μM), and colchicine (2 μM) for 30 min and then exposed with schistosomula for
18 h. p, P < 0.05 compared to unstimulated cells (medium). Values for percent attachment represent arithmetic mean values 6 SD (bars) for five separate experiments
performed in triplicate.

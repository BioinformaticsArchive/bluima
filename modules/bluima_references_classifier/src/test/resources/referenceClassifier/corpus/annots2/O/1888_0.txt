Fig. 2. KO of calcyon inhibits N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced AMPA receptor internalization. (A) Wild-type (WT) and Cal) / ) neocortical neurons (14–21
DIV) were pre-labeled with cell-impermeant, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin on ice. Subsequently, cultures were shifted to 37 C, and treated with NMDA (20 lm + TTX) or
NMDA in hypertonic sucrose for 5 or 15 min. Biotinylated proteins remaining on the cell surface of all drug-treated groups were stripped with glutathione. To detect
basal surface levels of GluR1 (Surface) before drug treatment, neurons were maintained on ice for 15 min and not stripped with glutathione. Biotinylated receptors
were recovered from lysates (500 lg) with streptavidin agarose. Total (5% of the lysates) and resin-eluted proteins (60% of each sample) were immunoblotted with
rabbit anti-GluR1 or mouse anti-GluR2 antibodies. Immunoblots were subjected to densitometric analysis using NIH Image J software. The blots shown are
representative of the results obtained in each of three independent experiments. Cell surface GluR1 (B) or GluR2 (D) levels in the WT and Cal) / ) cultures were
determined by normalizing the intensity of the cell surface bands to those of the lysates, and correcting for differences in sample loading. Bar graphs show the mean,
and error bars the SEM of three independent experiments performed on different cell culture preparations. No significant differences were detected for either GluR1
or GluR2 surface levels (P ‡ 0.05, t-test). Average time course of GluR1 (C) and GluR2 (E) internalization in WT (filled squares) and Cal) / ) (open circles) cultures
calculated from the ratio of the band intensities in the treated lanes at 5 and 15 min with that of the cell surface lanes (error bars indicate the SEM) of three

independent experiments. Agonist-stimulated internalization of both GluR1 and GluR2 significantly differed in WT and Cal neurons (genotype, F1,4 = 59.1 and
21.8, for GluR1 and GluR2, respectively, P ≤ 0.01), suggesting deletion of calcyon strongly impacts agonist-dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis.

kDa. Figs. 5 and 6.. Moreover, SBP-1 was shown to be
expressed on plasma membranes of isolated granule neurons in culture when the cells were not made permeable
with a detergent and in the nuclei after detergent treatment

amphoterin by live staining and also by electron mi-croscopy of rat brain cells and N18 neuroblastoma has

During early development of cerebellum, SGC is ex-pressed on at least five major glycoproteins, predominantly
on three N-CAMs and on two glycolipids w1,44x. In the
adult cerebellum, the expression of SGC on glycoproteins
is very low and it is mainly expressed as SGGLs, localized
particularly in PC dendrites and in their axon terminals in
deep cerebellar nuclei w44x. During neonatal development,
our immunocytochemical results show that SGC was not
expressed on granule neurons of the EGCL or migrating
neurons through the ML, similar to N-CAM 180 kDa.
w40,43x. SGC, however, was expressed strongly in the
IGCL on granule neurons' plasma membranes and dendrites and in ECM Figs. 5 and 6.. This expression is most
likely due to SGC on N-CAMs, particularly the 180 kDa
subset and SGGLs. Whatever the parent molecule, SGC
was clearly expressed on the plasma membrane of granule
neurons and their dendrites and it co-localized with SBP-1,
suggesting its availability for interaction with SBP-1. The
expression of SGC on granule neuron plasma membranes
was confirmed with isolated cells in culture Fig. 7..
Previously, we have also shown that SGC expression in
granule neurons declined with time in culture analogous to
that in vivo, due to down regulation of a key enzyme
N-acetylgucosaminyl transferase involved in the biosynthesis of SGC, and that restoration of the synthesis of SGC in
these cells promoted dedifferentiation and neurite outgrowth w7x. In addition to the expression of SGC on
granule neurons and ECM, SGC was also expressed on
glial processes in the IGCL w40x. Previously, we have
shown the expression of SGC on cultured astrocytes from
neonatal cerebellum w7x.
Immunoelectron microscopic localization of N-CAM
during development of the mouse cerebellum has shown
that antibodies recognizing the 180 kDa component of
N-CAM stained only the post-migratory granule neurons
in the IGCL, but not granule neurons of the EGCL or
migrating neurons through the ML. This suggested that
N-CAM-180 kDa form was not expressed until stable
granule neurons contacts in the IGCL are formed w43x. Our
data confirmed this observation and showed that both
N-CAM and SGC were not expressed on the mitotic,
postmitotic, premigratory granule neurons in the EGCL of
rat or on migrating neurons through the ML. However,
both were expressed only after the granule neurons mi-grated into the IGCL Fig. 5E and G.. These observations
suggest that newly arriving granule neurons having SBP-1
on their plasma membrane could interact with SGC on the
plasma membranes of the previously settled granule neu-

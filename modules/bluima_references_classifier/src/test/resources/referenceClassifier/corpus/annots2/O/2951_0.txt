infections were reported, with the exception of EBV DNA in
the CSF samples of four AIDS patients. In the latter study,
multiple targets (HSV, CMV, EBV, enterovirus, mumps, measles, and B. burgdorferi) were tested (36).
The pathogenesis of herpesvirus-associated encephalitis re-mains poorly understood. Limited studies with animal models
indicated that both olfactory and trigeminal tracts can provide
a neurological avenue for HSV to reach the CNS (20, 39).
Herpesviruses, such as HSV, EBV, and HHV-6, have a marked
tropism of cells of the peripheral and central nervous system
(15). Several studies have revealed that the molecular basis for
HSV neurotropism may include inverted repeats of the ge-nome and the thymidine kinase gene; these sequences may
convey enhanced neurovirulence. In addition, complex interactions between the virus and host cellular immune responses
may be involved in neurovirulence (6, 8, 18). For example,
interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been suggested to be involved in the
pathogenesis of several diseases in humans, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as lymphoid malignancies (22). In the hyperthermia- and UV light-induced
mouse models, treatment with anti-IL-6 antibodies results in
significantly lower frequencies of ocular reactivation compared
with those in mice treated with a control immunoglobulin (24).
Herpesviruses, including HSV, CMV, EBV, and HHV-6, have
been demonstrated to induce a concomitant release of IL-6,
thereby disturbing immune homeostasis (15, 21, 25). This ef-fect may itself be immunosuppressive, which could allow es-tablishment or reactivation of other infectious agents within
the host, thereby enhancing the occurrence of coinfection in
the CNS.
An important question for the future is whether herpesvirus
coinfection in the CNS influences the clinical features and
disease course of the patient. One patient, who had both EBV
and HSV-1 DNA detected in a CSF specimen, experienced a
protracted recovery (27). Another 8-year-old girl who had both
CMV and EBV detected in the CSF specimen was treated with
acyclovir for 10 days and had an uneven recovery (42). Therapy
with intravenous acyclovir has been proved to be very effective;
the mortality of HSV encephalitis was reduced from 70% to 19
to 30% (40, 46). In the present study, among 30 patients who
had positive HSV DNA detected in their CSF specimens, 22
were clinically diagnosed with viral encephalitis and appropriately treated with acyclovir. In 19 patients who were infected
only with HSV, only 1 died, while 2 of 3 patients with CNS
herpesvirus coinfection (HSV plus HHV-6) confirmed by mo-lecular methods died, although these patients were treated
with acyclovir. The other, who had both HSV and EBV DNA
detected in CSF specimens had prolonged recovery with psychiatric sequelae. Importantly, no deaths occurred in the
control study group (HSV negative). The significance of herpesvirus coinfection in the CNS and associated clinical manifestations requires further investigation.
Detection of viral (microbial) nucleic acid targets in CSF by
PCR has brought a new dimension to the laboratory diagnosis
of CNS infections. The results of our study suggest that a
diagnosis compatible with HSV CNS disease can be confirmed
by specific PCR testing; however, clinical and laboratory recognition and medical management of patients with mixed in-fections will need to be considered further.

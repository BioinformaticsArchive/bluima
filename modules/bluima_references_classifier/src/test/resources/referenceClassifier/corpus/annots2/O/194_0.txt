Previously we have identified several transcripts induced
during nodulation of alfalfa (Medicago sativa; Frugier et
al. 1998). One of these, Mscp17 (renamed Mszpt2-1),
codes for a putative Kru ̈ ppel-like Cys-2/His-2 zinc finger
protein (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis of the complete
Mszpt2-1 cDNA revealed best similarities to Zpt2-3
from petunia (61% identity, 70% homology; Takatsuji et
al. 1994), to Stz and Atzpt2-10 (renamed from Zat10)
from Arabidopsis (53% identity, 65% homology; Lippuner et al. 1996; Meissner and Michael 1997), and to
Scof-1 from soybean (67% identity, 75% homology; Genbank accession no. U68763), indicating that it belongs to
the EPF-type family. These genes code for Kru ̈ ppel transcription factors divergent from SUPERMAN and INDETERMINATE, and contain two canonical Cys2/His2
zinc finger motives (CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H consensus;
Fig. 1A, residues 86–106 and 142–162), carrying the in-variant QALGGH motif (residues 97–102 and 152–157)
specific to plant EPF-type zinc finger proteins (Takatsuji
1998). Mutation in this domain of the homologous EPF-

taminated cultures from true infections by staphylococcus species (30).
Although enterococci and hemolytic streptococci were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF MS, viridans streptococci
and pneumococci revealed too many misidentifications. Seng
et al. found that nearly 50% of S. pneumoniae isolates were
misidentified as Streptococcus parasanguinis because the database included only three S. pneumoniae and two S. parasanguinis reference spectra (27). Therefore, the database also
needs improvement, with more spectra of well-identified streptococcal species. Until then, MALDI-TOF MS is inappropriate
for identification of pneumococci, especially since erroneous
identification has important clinical consequences.
MALDI-TOF MS has performed well for identification of
yeasts in our prospective study, with correct identification of
85% of 61 isolates encompassing 12 different species without
major errors occurring. An extraction method prior to analysis
in the mass spectrometer was shown to be mandatory to obtain
appropriate spectra. During the past decade, the clinical im-pact of severe infections with yeasts and yeast-like fungi has
increased, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Rapid and
reliable species identification is essential for antifungal treatment, for which conventional biochemical methods are too
time-consuming. Additionally, high-resolution DNA-based
molecular techniques, such as 16S or 18S rRNA or internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA sequencing and real-time PCR
assays, are expensive and time-consuming. A recent German
study of 267 clinical isolates and 18 collection strains also
concluded that MALDI-TOF MS is a rapid and reliable tool
for the identification of yeasts and yeast-like fungi, with low
expenditure of consumables, easy interpretation of results, and
a fast turnaround time (18). Misidentifications in our study and
the German study were associated with the use of an incomplete database, such as for C. dubliniensis.
The strengths of our study are the implementation of
MALDI-TOF MS in a routine setting, the comparison of
MALDI-TOF MS with conventional identification systems on
clinical isolates, the use of 16S DNA and ITS sequencing for
analysis of discrepancies, and the inclusion of yeasts. A limitation of our study is the lack of inclusion of sufficient anaerobic bacteria and Gram-positive aerobic rods. During the study
period, anaerobic bacterial species and aerobic Gram-positive
rods were isolated sporadically (n 4 and n 13 isolates,
respectively) and were mostly considered part of a mixed flora
and therefore not identified further. Conventional identification methods for anaerobic bacteria are cumbersome and timeconsuming and require a specific location (e.g., anaerobic
chamber) at the laboratory. MALDI-TOF MS for anaerobic
identification would certainly increase the number of species
identifications since it can be applied directly from bacterial
colonies on the primary culture plates. So far, one study re-ported on MALDI-TOF for routine identification of anaerobic
bacteria (27). Despite the above-mentioned advantages, the
investigators concluded that a more accurate database is re-quired since Fusobacterium nucleatum was not present and
more than 50% of 46 isolates with no identification by
MALDI-TOF MS consisted of anaerobic bacteria. For those
anaerobic species (e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, and Bacteroides uniformis) of which sufficient

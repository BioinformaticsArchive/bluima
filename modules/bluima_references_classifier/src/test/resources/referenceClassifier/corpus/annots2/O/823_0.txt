terminalis, OVLT) to the caudal hindbrain (approximately 1 mm
caudal to the obex) keeping every third section. Free-floating sections
were then exposed to 10% horse serum for 1 h, and incubated overnight
at 4 °C with antiserum (diluted 1 : 500) raised in rabbits against a
synthetic amino acid sequence corresponding to the residues 4–17 of
human Fos (c-fos AB-2, Santa Cruz). The primary antibodies were
then reacted with biotin-labelled antirabbit immunoglobulins and
finally with an avidin–biotin peroxidase complex (Vector, Burlingham,
CA, USA). The peroxidase label was detected using 3-3′-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride as chromagen. Sections were mounted on
gelatin-coated glass slides. In order to test the specificity of the antisera
raised against Fos, some sections were incubated for 0.5 h at 37 °C with
synthetic 4–17 residue of human Fos at 15 μg/mL.
Sections were examined by light microscope and numbers of cells
containing Fos-LI were counted in particular brain regions using a
graticule in the eyepiece to ensure that double-counting of cells was

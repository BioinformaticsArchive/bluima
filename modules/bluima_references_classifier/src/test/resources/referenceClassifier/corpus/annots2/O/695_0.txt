Fig. 3. A: Quantification of neuronal number and volume with the
NeuroZoom software. A disector counting frame of 50 m 50 m was
used. Five rotator test lines can be seen crossing the Betz cell soma,
with dots pointing to their intersections with the soma border. B: For
analysis of Betz cell distribution, we generated high-magnification
Voronoi tessellation maps. C: A view of the corresponding microscopic
field. Betz cells are represented by yellow dots, and the size of the
polygon drawn around them is inversely proportional to their individual
packing density. The smallest polygons, color-coded in red, are zones
wherein clustering occurs. Scale bar (B and C) 100 m.

Tyrosine derivatives in VF
V F contained 0.01– 0.5 μM free diT yr and 3-NO2-T yr, and these
values increased only two- to fivefold with protease digestion.
Free diTyr content increased 3.7-fold in AD VF relative to
normal V F and increased twofold in protein digests (Fig. 5).
3-NO2-T yr content increased in both free and protein digest
fractions (2.3- and 1.4-fold, respectively), although this increase
was not statistically significant (Fig. 5). Protein concentration
within VF was similar between AD and normal groups [0.47 6
0.15 mg /ml (normal) versus 0.41 6 0.03 mg /ml (AD)].

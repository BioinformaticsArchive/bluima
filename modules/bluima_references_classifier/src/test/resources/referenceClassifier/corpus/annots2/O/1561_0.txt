Materials and Methods
Participants. Sixteen healthy individuals (eight women) aged 20 –29
(mean, 23 years) participated in experiment 1, 16 healthy individuals (six
women) aged 20 –29 (mean, 23.8 years) participated in experiment 2, and
16 healthy individuals (10 women) aged 19 –33 (mean, 23.3 years) participated in experiment 3. None of the participants took part in more
than one experiment. All participants were right-handed according to a
standard handedness inventory (Briggs and Nebes, 1975), were native
Italian speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity in both
eyes, and were naive as to the purposes of the experiment.
Information about the experimental hypothesis was provided only
after the experimental tests were completed. Participants gave their written informed consent and were paid 15 € for their participation in the
study. The procedures were approved by the local ethics committee and
were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki. None of the participants had neurological, psychiatric, or other
medical problems or any contraindication to TMS (Wasserman, 1998).
No discomfort or adverse effects during TMS were reported or noticed.
Electromyography recording and transcranial magnetic stimulation.
Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded simultaneously from the
first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles (experiments 1 and 2) and from the FDI and the extensor carpi
radialis (ECR) muscle (experiment 3) of the right hand. It is worth noting
here that the FDI muscle is strongly involved in the execution of pincer
grips; in contrast, the ADM muscle does not play a major role in the
execution of pincer grips but is involved in the execution of gross grasping movements. The ECR muscle does not have any specific role in the
execution of either gross or precision grasping movements. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed through surface Ag/AgCl cup
electrodes (1 cm diameter) placed in a belly tendon montage. Responses
were amplified, bandpass filtered (20 Hz to 3 kHz) and digitized by
means of a Viking IV electromyography equipment (Nicolet Biomedical,
Madison, WI). The sampling rate of the EMG signal was 20 kHz. A
prestimulus recording of 20 ms was used to check for the presence of
EMG activity before the TMS pulse. To further control for the presence of
unwanted background EMG activity before the magnetic pulse, the signal from both muscles was additionally displayed in separate channels set
at high sensitivity (50 V). Moreover, during the preliminary session,
EMG signals were sent to loudspeakers to provide participants with an
auditory feedback of their muscle relaxation.
Focal TMS was performed by means of a 70 mm figure-eight stimulation coil (Magstim polyurethane-coated coil) connected to a Magstim
200 Rapid (The Magstim Company, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK), producing a maximum output of 2 T at the coil surface (pulse duration, 250
s; rise time, 60 s). The coil was placed tangentially on the scalp, with
the handle pointing backward and laterally 45° away from the midline,
approximately perpendicular to the line of the central sulcus. This orientation induced a posterior-anterior current in the brain, which tends to
activate corticospinal neurons indirectly via excitatory synaptic inputs
(Di Lazzaro et al., 1998). We chose it based on the finding that the lowest
motor threshold is achieved when the induced electric current in the
brain is flowing approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus
(Brasil-Neto et al., 1992; Mills et al., 1992).
During the recording session, the coil was positioned over the left
motor cortex in correspondence with the optimal scalp position (OSP),
defined as the position from which MEPs with maximal amplitude were
recorded. The OSP was detected by moving the intersection of the coil in
1 cm steps around the motor hand area of the left motor cortex and by
delivering TMS pulses with constant intensity. Participants wore a tightly
fitting bathing cap on which the scalp positions for stimulation were
marked. The coil was held by hand, and its position, with respect to the
marks, was checked continuously. We chose to hold the coil by hand to

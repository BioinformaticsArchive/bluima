Fig. 6. Intraventricular CB1954 induces cell death in the dentate animals demonstrated increase in silver deposition within the dorsal
gyrus and cerebellum. Prodrug injection (2 mg/ml) of P5 rats for 2 blade of the dentate gyrus (B). Occasional silver deposition is seen in
consecutive days results in cells labeled by cupric-silver degeneration the hilar region (arrows in B). Intraventricular injection at this dose
stain. Nonspecific toxicity is minimally observed from the prodrug elicits some cell damage (arrows in D) in the cerebellum of tg (+)
regimen in WT dentate gyrus (A) and cerebellum (C). Transgenic rats (D) that is likely caused by CSF circulation.

Figure 3. In vivo bioluminescence rhythms persist in the OBs of SCNX rats. Representative
bioluminescence recordings from the in vivo OB of SCN-lesioned rats that received luciferin
injections every 4 h (A, B) or that were intraperitoneally implanted with luciferin-filled miniosmotic pumps (Câ€“F ) are shown. All of these OB recordings were scored as rhythmic by COSOPT
(A, 0.27, p 0.007; C, 0.16, p 0.033; D, 0.14, p 0.009; E, 0.12, p
0.01; F, 0.18, p 0.015) with the exception of B, which was scored as arrhythmic by
COSOPT ( 0.12; p 0.052). Values were normalized to the peak emission for each rat over
the 48 h of imaging.

Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting

Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gels)
and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were
blocked with bovine serum albumin (3%) before incubation with mAb
22C11 (1:3000) or mAb 7H5 (1:1000) for 3 h at room temperature.
Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature with anti-mouse IgG
coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:10000), blots were developed for 15
min with Fast Red (3 mg/ml) and naphthol (0.2 mg/ml) in 100 mM NaCl,
5 mM MgCl , and 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Quantitation of APP on
2

protein blots were determined by reflectance analysis as described by
Bush et al. (51).

Functional considerations

It is clear from our present results that the intrinsic
membrane properties of the medial vestibular nuclei
neurons (MVNn)49'5Â°'52and those of the NGCn5254
are very similar. Both neuronal populations (the
MVNn and NGCn) can be segregated, in slices, in
the same two major classes, type A and B neurons.
In the isolated and perfused guinea-pig brain, intracellular recordings in both regions indicated that type
A neurons are characterized by a regular spontaneous
discharge and type B neurons by an irregular one;52'53
this is significant since, in vivo, the MVNn can also be
segregated into regular and irregular neurons55'56and
the regularity of their discharges can be used as a
marker of the dynamic of their responses to the
vestibular afferents. Besides, in vivo, NGCn can also
be segregated into regular and irregular neurons
although their dynamic properties have not been
studied in d e t a i l . 58"59"62"66
These results lead us to speculate that the
similarities of the intrinsic membrane properties in
between NGC and MVN neurons might not be
fortuitous. The functional relevance of the segregation in type A and B neurons remains to be
elucidated. Three possibilities can be proposed:

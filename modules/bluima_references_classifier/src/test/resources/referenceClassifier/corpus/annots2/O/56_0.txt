by the pallidum subspecies and those caused by the various
other pathogenic treponemes.
The finding that the Haiti B strain, which is reportedly a T.
pallidum subsp. pertenue strain, shows sequence identity with
the pallidum subspecies and not with the nonsyphilis strains
supports the proposal by Centurion-Lara et al. (6) that this
strain was misidentified and should be classified as a T. pallidum subsp. pallidum strain. Similar sequence analyses performed on the tprK (7) and tp92 (4) sequences from the Haiti
B strain further support its identification as a T. pallidum
subsp. pallidum strain.
Homologues of Gpd from other bacterial species also demonstrate remarkable conservation of the amino acid sequence.
The enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae, designated protein
D, is 98% conserved among eight strains (19). The corresponding molecule from the relapsing-fever spirochete Borrelia
hermsii, GlpQ, exhibits a range of 96.5 to 100% amino acid
sequence similarity among 26 B. hermsii isolates (17). Similarly,
results reported here show that Gpd is highly conserved among
12 strains that encompass a total of five pathogenic treponemes. The invariant nature of Gpd, combined with the im-munoprotective capability previously described for this molecule in the experimental syphilis model (2), makes it an
attractive candidate for inclusion in a universal subunit vaccine
against T. pallidum infection.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide se-quences of the gpd genes from the Nichols, Bal-3, Bal-7, Bal
73-1, Sea 81-3, Sea 83-1, Mexico A, Haiti B, Gauthier, Iraq B,
Simian, and Cuniculi A strains have been assigned GenBank
accession no. AF004286 and AF127415 to AF127425, respectively.

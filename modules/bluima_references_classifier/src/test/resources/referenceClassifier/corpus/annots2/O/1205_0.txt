expression even though the amoebae have not been in
contact with the nasal mucosa. Northern blot analysis of
RNA showed that amoebae incubated with mouse brain
cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, or liver cells, but not bacteria (E.
coli or Bacillus subtilis) (data not shown), had a dramatic
increase in gene expression (Fig. 5A). The increase was of
the same magnitude as that induced in fourth-passage amoebae isolated from mouse brain. Thus, all of the induction can
be accounted for by some interaction of amoebae with
several types of mammalian cells in vitro. This induction
does not correlate with a simple change in nutrients or
ingestion of particulate foodstuffs as the inducer of the gene
expression, since amoebae fed on gram-negative bacteria (E.
coli) or gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis) showed no elevation in Nf314 transcript levels.
The Nf435 transcript levels, in contrast, showed a completely different response to coculture of amoebae with
mammalian or bacterial cells. For Nf435 gene expression,

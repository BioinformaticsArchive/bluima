INTRODUCTION
The homeobox gene Hesx1 is a member of the paired-like family of
homeobox proteins and functions as a transcriptional repressor
(Thomas et al., 1995; Hermesz et al., 1996; Dasen et al., 2001).
Hesx1 and its orthologues in other vertebrates (Anf genes) are
expressed in the rostral region of the embryo during gastrulation and
neurulation in all species analysed (Hermesz et al., 1996; Thomas
and Beddington, 1996; Kazanskaya et al., 1997; Knoetgen et al.,
1999). In mouse, Hesx1 expression is very dynamic, and Hesx1
transcripts are detected in anterior regions of the visceral endoderm,
definitive endoderm and neural ectoderm during early development.
Later, Hesx1 expression is restricted to the Rathke's pouch.
Hesx1-deficient embryos show a reduction in anterior forebrain
(AFB) tissue rostral to the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) at 8.5
dpc. The presumptive AFB is initially induced, but this territory is
reduced at a later stage of development in Hesx1–/– mutants.
Chimeric analysis has shown that this forebrain phenotype is a
consequence of the requirement of Hesx1 within the anterior neural
ectoderm, and not due to disturbances in the anterior visceral
endoderm or anterior definitive endoderm (Martinez-Barbera et al.,
2000). Hesx1 mutants also show defects in dorsal forebrain
commissural structures, eye abnormalities and pituitary dysplasia
(Dattani et al., 1998). A comparable phenotype is observed in a
human congenital disorder called septo-optic dysplasia (SOD).
Indeed, mutations in HESX1 are associated with familial cases of
SOD and other forms of hypopituitarism in humans (Dattani et al.,
1998; Dattani, 2004; Sobrier et al., 2006). In Xenopus,
overexpression of the Hesx1 orthologue, Xanf1, results in
enlargement of the neural plate (NP) at the expense of epidermis and
neural crest (NC) (Ermakova et al., 1999). Thus, it is now established
that Hesx1 is essential for normal AFB development in vertebrates.
However, little is known about how Hesx1 performs its function.

Experiments in Xenopus, zebrafish, chick and mammals have
provided compelling evidence indicating that suppression of
posteriorising signals is an essential requisite for the formation of
anterior neural tissue (Kimura et al., 2000; Perea-Gomez et al.,
2001; Kudoh et al., 2002; Wilson and Houart, 2004; Stern, 2005).
Among them, the Wnt/ -catenin pathway plays a key role in
anterior-posterior patterning of the NP [(Yamaguchi, 2001; Wilson
and Houart, 2004; Marikawa, 2006) and references therein]. It is
thought that the action of Wnt signalling inhibitors and activators
create a gradient along the neural ectoderm (high caudally and low
rostrally) that is required for normal anterior-posterior
regionalisation of the NP in distinct subdivisions (Leyns et al.,
1997; Glinka et al., 1998; Hsieh et al., 1999; Kiecker and Niehrs,
2001; Nordstrom et al., 2002). Normal AFB development is
particularly sensitive to Wnt/ -catenin signalling (Fredieu et al.,
1997; van de Water et al., 2001; Houart et al., 2002). For instance,
the zebrafish masterblind mutants, which carry a mutation in
Axin1 that abolishes binding to Gsk3 causing Wnt/ -catenin
signalling overactivation, show a phenotype in which
telencephalon and eyes are reduced or absent, and dorsal
diencephalic fates are expanded rostrally (van de Water et al.,
2001; Heisenberg et al., 2001). Similarly, lack of Tcf3/Headless
repressor function leads to the loss of anterior neural tissue (Kim
et al., 2000). In chick, it has been shown that posterior forebrain
character can be induced in explants, which would normally
acquire an AFB fate, through the direct caudalising activity of Wnt
proteins (Nordstrom et al., 2002). In mouse, both overexpression
of Wnt8 and lack of Wnt/ -catenin antagonists lead to suppression
of anterior neural fates (Popperl et al., 1997; Mukhopadhyay et al.,
2001; Satoh et al., 2004). Therefore, it is now established that
Wnt/ -catenin signalling must be modulated during vertebrate
development to allow normal anterior-posterior patterning of the
NP; in particular, Wnt/ -catenin signalling needs to be suppressed
for the AFB to develop.
The transcriptional repressors Hesx1, Six3 and Rax (Rx) show
overlapping expression patterns in the anterior neural ectoderm
during early mouse development (Oliver et al., 1995; Thomas and
Beddington, 1996; Mathers et al., 1997). Moreover, Six3 and Rax
mutants show defects in the forebrain, such as reduced
telencephalon and eyes, which are very similar to those observed

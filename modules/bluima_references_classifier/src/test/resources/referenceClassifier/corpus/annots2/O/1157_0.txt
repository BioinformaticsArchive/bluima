perpolarization (Beurrier et al., 1999, 2000; Bevan and Wilson,
1999; Bevan et al., 2000; Song et al., 2000). Such intrinsic rebound
properties in STN neurons, which were also found in the present
study on removal of large-amplitude hyperpolarizing current
pulses (Fig. 6 B), might contribute to the postinhibitory (late)
bursting in STN neurons (Fig. 9). Moreover, in accordance with
previous in vitro studies (Bevan et al., 2002b), we found that the
repetitive action potentials that followed large-amplitude IPSPs
impinging on STN neurons were almost exactly in-phase (Fig.
7B), an intrinsic process that would tend to promote coherent
bursting in the STN during absence seizures (Figs. 5B2, 4). The
delayed firing of CSth neurons would provide an additional ex-citatory synaptic mechanism promoting the late STN bursting
during SWDs (Fig. 9).

Retrograde synaptic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) is a recently discovered form of neuromodulation in the
brain. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), endocannabinoid signaling has been implicated in learning and memory, specifically in
extinction of aversive memories. To examine retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in this brain region, BLA neurons were freshly
isolated using an enzyme-free procedure. These isolated neurons retain attached functional excitatory and inhibitory synaptic boutons.
Spontaneous GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs) were isolated from these freshly isolated neurons and a 4 s step of depolarization from 60 to 0
mV produced suppression of sIPSC frequency and amplitude. A similar depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) was
observed in neurons in BLA slices. DSI in the single-cell preparation was abolished by the CB receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5- 1

(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide, and DSI duration was shortened in the presence of
2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine, an mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5) antagonist. The initial decrease in sIPSCs induced
by the DSI procedure was greatly attenuated in recordings with 20 mM BAPTA containing postsynaptic internal solution, but a delayedonset decrease was observed under this recording condition. A CB agonist decreased sIPSC frequency and amplitude, whereas CB
11
antagonists increased these responses. The antagonist-induced increase was abolished in 20 mM BAPTA-filled cells. These data provide
solid evidence for retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the BLA and also indicate that this retrograde signaling requires only a
postsynaptic neuron and attached synaptic boutons.

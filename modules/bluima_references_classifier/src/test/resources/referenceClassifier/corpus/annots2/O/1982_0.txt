common for the yaw axis (8%). In fact,
the percentage of second-harmonic cells
that responded to yaw rotation (14%; p_f1
0.01 and p_f2 0.01) was larger than the
percentage of first-harmonic yaw-responsive
cells (8%; p_f1 0.01) (see Table 2).
As for translation, single harmonic re-sponses to rotation were also more common in the upper than lower bank of the
lateral sulcus. The mean f2/f1 ratios (geometric mean SE) were 0.64 0.26 (n
136) for the upper bank, 0.83 0.24 (n
126) for the tip of the sulcus, and 1.58
0.31 (n 102) for the lower bank. The difference in f2/f1 ratio between the upper and
lower banks was again highly significant
( p 0.001, Wilcoxon rank test). There was
a weak correlation between the f2/f1 ratio
for rotation and cell location along the me-dial–lateral dimension (r 0.13; p
0.05), such that the relative strength of second harmonic responses increases mildly as
one moves laterally within the sulcus. No
such correlation was found for the anterior–
posterior dimension ( p 0.62).
The percentage of cells responding to
both rotation and translation was high.
Among 364 cells tested with both sinusoidal translation and rotation, 255 had
significant responses ( p_f1 0.01 or p_f2
0.01) to either translation or rotation.
Of these 255 cells, approximately half (137/
255, 53%) were convergent, i.e., they
showed significant response modulation
( p_f1 0.01 or p_f2 0.01) during both
rotation and translation. By comparison, Figure 4. Summary of sinusoidal responses. A, B, Distributions of direction preferences for translation (n 185) and rotation

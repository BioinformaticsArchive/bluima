et al., 2003). PKA might exert its regulatory effect by
phosphorylating presynaptic proteins, as PKA substrates
are thought to include various ion channels (Gross et al.,
1990; Li et al., 1992; Shabb, 2001) and several components
of the exocytotic machinery (Fyske et al., 1995; Fyske,
1998; Lonart and Sudhof, 1998; Hilfiker et al., 1999;
Lonart, 2002). If so, the present findings also suggest that
many presynaptic substrates of PKA are maintained normally in a relatively dephosphorylated state, as H-89,
when present alone, did not affect the evoked release.
We were unable to determine if CaMKII normally
regulates glutamatergic release in intact animals, as a cellpermeable activator of CaMKII was not available and
KN-93 had little effect without cochlear lesions (Fig. 5). A
regulatory role in the SOC, however, is suggested by the
capacity of KN-93 to alter the evoked release in those
nuclei after UCA.

Conclusions

Whatever the mechanism involved, we would like to emphasize that
our data strongly suggest that all of the visual effects obtained were
mediated specifically by mGluR5 because, in all those cells studied
using both agonist and antagonist, the effect of CHPG was the
opposite to that obtained with MPEP. This clearly demonstrates a
physiological role for mGluR5 receptors in controlling retinal input

Immunoreactivity for 5-HT in the caudate and
putamen
Quantitative analyses of pixel gray value deciles measured
for 5-HT immunoreactivity in the dorsal striatum revealed
significant group differences in immunolabeling that were
seen only in the left hemisphere. For the left caudate, gray
value deciles in the OVX-E, OVX-P, and OVX-EP groups
were all 15–20% higher than corresponding values from
the controls dorsally, and some 10 –15% higher than controls in the more ventral caudate (Fig. 7). Although ANOVAs did not reveal significant main effects of hormone
replacement, they did identify significant interactions for all
three treatment groups between hormone replacement
and hemisphere (P 0.008 vs. OVX-E; P 0.030 vs.
OVX-P; P 0.032 vs. OVX-EP), and for each of these
groups as well, significant main effects of hormone re-placement emerged for the left but not the right caudate
when the data were evaluated by hemisphere (P 0.033
vs. OVX-E; P 0.044 vs. OVX-P; P 0.0032 vs. OVX-EP).
Permitted post hoc comparisons further revealed that with
the single exception of the OVX-EP group in ventral-most
sector, gray value deciles from the left caudate of the
hormonally replaced cohorts were all significantly different
from those of the OVX controls (Fig. 7).
In the left putamen, OVX-EP deciles were also about
15–20% higher than the corresponding values in the OVX
control group (Fig. 8). The deciles in the OVX-P group
were also about 15% higher than controls in the dorsal
putamen, but were only about 10% higher than controls
more ventrally. For the OVX-E group there was very little
separation (10% or less) between the gray value deciles of
this group and the controls (Fig. 8). Perhaps as a consequence, the only effects identified in the putamen as statistically significant were interactions between hormone
replacement and hemisphere for the OVX-EP group
(P 0.081), with significant main effects of hormone re-placement identified for this group in the left (P 0.0023)
but not the right hemisphere only after hemispheric data
were evaluated separately. Post hoc comparisons, thus
limited to OVX controls vs. OVX-EP groups, revealed that
all gray value deciles for the left putamen in the OVX-EP

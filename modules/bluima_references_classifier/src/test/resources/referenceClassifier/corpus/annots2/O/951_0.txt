where they are targeted and localized to the basolateral membrane at sites of cell-cell contact. The first 65 amino acids of
SAP97 were found to be critical for this targeting (38). Most
interesting, this is the same region of SAP97 that interacts
with the L27N domain of CASK (10). Lee et al. (10) also used a
CASK deletion mutant lacking the GK domain to observe its
effects on SAP97 localization. This dominant negative CASK
construct caused SAP97 to deviate from its normal basolateral
location in MDCK epithelial cells (10). Functional genetic analyses of CASK and SAP97 in Drosophila (39, 40) and Caenorhabditis elegans (12, 41, 42) also implicate these proteins in
targeting and localization in polarized cells. Taken together, it
is apparent that both SAP97 and CASK have functional roles in
the trafficking and targeting of ion channels and receptors.
We expressed a GFP-Kir2.2 construct in MDCK cells and,
like Kir2.3 (16), found the channels to traffic and localize to the
basolateral membrane (Fig. 10, A and D). Expression of GFPKir2.2 3 construct lacking the PDZ-binding motif displayed a
lack of specific membrane localization with much of the channel expressed intracellularly (Fig. 10, G and J). This suggests
that the PDZ-binding motif of Kir2.2 plays a role in targeting or
stabilization of the channels in the basolateral membrane. To
examine the possible role of CASK, the central linking protein
in this Kir2 complex, we co-expressed a dominant negative
CASK construct in MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-Kir2.2.
This experiment resulted in the mislocalization and redistribution of Kir2.2 from the basolateral membrane to intracellular
and apical locations. Thus, it appears that the proper assembly
of Kir2.2 with CASK-containing complexes is required for ap-propriate subcellular trafficking Kir2 channels.
We anticipate that the CASK-Veli-Mint1 complex functions
in conjunction with SAP97 as a unit in trafficking of Kir2
channels. CASK may be involved in targeting the complex,
Mint1 tethering the complex to motor proteins, and Veli stabilizing the complex at the plasma membrane. Data from other
receptors and channels support this role of the complex. In C.
elegans, the CASK/Veli/Mint1 homologs Lin-2/Lin-7/Lin-10 are
essential proteins in the basolateral targeting and localization
for the Let-23 tyrosine kinase receptor (12) and GLR-1 glutamate receptor in vulval epithelial cells (42) as well as serving a
key role in vulval development (43). Involvement of Mint1 in
trafficking has been demonstrated in neurons by Setou et al.
(15), who identified the kinesin motor protein KIF17 as a
binding partner for Mint1, showed association of KIF17, Mint1,
CASK, Veli, and NMDA receptor, and demonstrated that vesicles containing NMDA receptors could be transported along
microtubules by KIF17. Additionally, Veli has been shown to
facilitate the retention of the -aminobutyric acid transporter
at the basolateral surface of epithelial cells (36), and recent

Autoradiography

Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250 –300 g) were anesthetized and
killed and the brains were removed and frozen in isopentane
previously immersed in dry ice. Sagittal tissue sections (30 μm) of
the brain were cut on a Riechert-Jung Cryocut 1800 cryostat and
mounted on microscope slides previously cleaned in chromic acid.
Tissue sections were then stored at -20°C until required.

fected cells. Furthermore, there is no signal in cells transfected
with any of the other (closely related) SK/IK channels, demonstrating that the antibody recognition is subunit specific. As ex-pected, there are some differences in the subcellular distributions
of these SK channel subunits. For example, SK3 tends to produce
a stronger signal toward the edge of the cell at, or close to, the cell
membrane, whereas the SK1 and SK2 subunits are usually distributed more widely across the cell interior (Fig. 1 Bâ€“D). The
subcellular distributions for SK1, 2, and 3 shown in Figure 1 are
consistent with previous observations made by our group and by
others using antibodies to different SK channel epitopes and thus
confirm that there are important differences in subunit trafficking (Cingolani et al., 2002; Benton et al., 2003; D'hoedt et al.,
2004).

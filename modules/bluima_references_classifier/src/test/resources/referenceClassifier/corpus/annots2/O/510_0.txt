Animals (280^300 g) were anaesthetised with chloral hydrate
(7%, 400 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic
frame. A glass micropipette containing a 10% solution of tetramethylrhodamine-dextran 3000 MW (Molecular Probes) was
inserted stereotaxically so that its tip (25^40 Wm diameter) was
located within the right Sp5O (anteroposterior 31.5 to 32.0,
mediolateral 3.0, posterior 6.0^7.6 according to Paxinos and
Watson, 1997). Electrophoretic application of tetramethylrhodamine-dextran was made by 10-s pulses of positive direct current
(3^5 WA) applied every 20 s for a period of 10^15 min. The
microelectrode was left in situ for a further 5 min before withdrawal from the brain. Following a post-operative survival of
3^7 days, animals were deeply anaesthetised with chloral
hydrate and perfused intracardially with warm (37‡C) heparinised saline (25 IU heparin/ml) followed by cold (10‡C) phosphate-bu¡ered solution (0.1 M, pH 7.6) containing 4%
paraformaldehyde and 0.03% picric acid for 15 min. Brainstems
were then removed and post-¢xed in the same paraformaldehyde^picric acid solution for 1^2 h before being transferred
into 0.05 M Tris-bu¡ered saline (TBS) containing 30% sucrose
at 4‡C and left overnight. Coronal sections (40 Wm) were cut on
a freezing microtome through the ¢rst cervical segments, the
medulla and the pons and collected as three sets of sections in
TBS. Sections containing the Sp5O of one set were mounted on
gelatine-coated slides, coverslipped using Vectashield (Vector)
and viewed using a Leitz £uorescent microscope. The sections
from animals in which the tetramethylrhodamine-dextran
deposit was con¢ned to the Sp5O were then processed further.
Some animals in which the deposit was made into the trigeminal
tract were also used as control. Sections of the second set were
mounted on gelatine-coated slides, counterstained with Cresyl
Violet and used for delineation of anatomical boundaries.

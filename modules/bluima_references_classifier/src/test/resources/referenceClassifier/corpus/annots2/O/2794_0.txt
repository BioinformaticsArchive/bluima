ecdysone, and their products are assumed to be components of
the exocuticle (4, 12). Furthermore, a relatively strong FTZ-F1
binding sequence (44, 47) is present at 100 and 500 bp up-stream from the transcription start sites of the EDG84A and
EDG78E genes, respectively. These observations suggest that
the EDG84A and EDG78E genes are target candidates for
FTZ-F1.
In the present study, we found that EDG84A mRNA is
induced by premature expression of FTZ-F1 and that the
FTZ-F1 binding site is essential for the expression. These re-sults show that the EDG84A gene is a direct target of FTZ-F1.
Furthermore, we found another regulatory elements for discderived epidermis-specific expression of this gene, suggesting
cooperative regulation of the gene by stage- and tissue-specific
factors.

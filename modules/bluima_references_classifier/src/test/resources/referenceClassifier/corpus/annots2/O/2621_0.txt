Results
A fragment of the rat homolog of the human NET cDNA (Pacholczyk et al., 199 1) was isolated from a rat PC1 2 cDNA library
PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides as described in Materials
and Methods. Northern blot analysis using this PCR fragment
as a specific probe revealed the localization of two rat NET
mRNAs (5.8 and 3.6 kb in length) expressed in PC12 tumor
cells, rat brainstem, and rat adrenal gland (Fig. lA), yet in each
tissue, the larger 5.8 kb species gave a stronger hybridization
signal. Only the 3.6 kb species was detected in forebrain, midbrain, brainstem, and cerebellum RNA. These results are in
agreement with previous studies that used a human NET cDNA
probe to demonstrate the presence of transcripts of the same
size in RNA derived from rat brainstem and adrenal gland
(Pacholcyzk et al., 1991), as well as in RNA from placental
brush border cells (Ramamoorthy et al., 1993). Using the rat
DAT fragment as a probe in a Northern blot assay of RNA
isolated from a variety of rat brain regions, a single RNA species
(3.8 kb in length) was detected in RNA from the midbrain region
(Fig. lB), as described previously (Shimada et al., 1991; Usdin
et al., 1991).
The regional distribution of DAT and NET mRNA expression in rat brain was determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Both DAT and NET mRNA-containing cells were
distributed in accordance with the known distribution of catecholaminergic cell bodies in the adult rat brain, with each transporter showing a unique distribution pattern. In emulsion-coated sections, DAT and NET mRNA-containing cells were
identified by clusters of silver grains over single cells. Labeled
cells were defined as those with labeling that exceeded a 99.9%
Poisson labeling criterion (Arnold, 1980). Both DAT and NET
mRNA appear to be exclusively expressed in neurons since
labeled cells examined at high magnification met the classic
morphological criteria for neurons as they appear in Nissl-stained
material, and very few silver grains were observed over fiber
tracts. This labeling appeared specific because silver grains were
not observed over cells when sections were treated with RNase
A prior to hybridization with an antisense cRNA probe, or when
sections were hybridized with a sense-strand probe. In addition,
thermal stability of RNA:RNA hybrids demonstrated that the
labeling achieved by in situ hybridization is specific because a
significant reduction in the density of the silver grains over
labeled neurons was seen only when the temperature of the final
posthybridization wash exceeded 9O‚ÄùC, whereas background la-beling decreased linearly with increasing temperature. The specificity of the labeling observed is also supported by the unique
and nonoverlapping distribution patterns found for each catecholamine transporter. Thus, DAT mRNA labeling was de-tected only in regions of the brain that contain dopaminergic
cell bodies, and NET cRNA labeling was found only in regions
of the brainstem known to contain norepinephrine cell bodies.
The expression pattern within the three major classes of catecholamine cells was studied by combining immunohistochemistry with in situ hybridization. Catecholaminergic cell bodies

The main function of the thalamus is to relay sensory inputs
to the neocortex. The transfer of high-frequency sensory inputs
may be jeopardized by the depression of lemniscal synapses.
However, sensory relay is functionally relevant during information processing states in which the thalamus is activated due
to the effects of modulators. The main consequence of these
modulators, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, is to
depolarize thalamocortical neurons (McCormick 1992; Steriade et al. 1997). Thus the next experiments explored in slices
how postsynaptic depolarization and synaptic depression interact to relay lemniscal inputs at different frequencies. Intracellular recordings (n 5) were performed using K -acetatefilled electrodes. Figure 5 shows the effect of stimuli applied to
the medial lemniscus at different frequencies for a neuron in
the bursting mode or in the tonic mode. In the bursting mode,

dephosphorylation of pCREB, was not accompanied by an
increase in nuclear CSU-PSP1 IR (M. Koch and H.-W. Korf,
unpublished results). This suggests that the mechanisms that
activate the nuclear CSU-PSP1 and thus participate in
pCREB dephosphorylation are not related to nuclear translocation of CSU-PSP1.
The results of this study provide experimental evidence
for the concept that phosphatases participate in various
signaling pathways and, together with the corresponding
kinases and phosphorylated proteins, form a complex
network that regulates cellular activity in many neuronal
and endocrine cells (for review see Hunter 1995). Future
investigations dealing with the regulation of PSPs in the rat
pineal organ could be of high interest because the activity
of PSP1 is inhibited by the endogenous inhibitors-1 and -2
(I-1; I-2; Huang et al. 1976) when these inhibitors are
phosphorylated by PKA or CaMK II (Aitken et al. 1982;
Foulkes et al. 1983; Elbrecht et al. 1990; Endo et al. 1996).
Expression of the heat-stable inhibitor-1 (I-1) of PSP1 was
found in the rat pineal organ by use of in situ hybridization
and immunoblot technique (Sakagami et al. 1994; Da Cruz
e Silva et al. 1995), and it is a possible scenario that the
PSP activity state is controlled by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of I-1.
In summary, our study with cultured rat pineal organs and
pinealocytes has shown that withdrawal of NE causes rapid
pCREB dephosphorylation within 30 min, but does not
affect ICER protein levels. Withdrawal of the NE stimulus
and pCREB dephosphorylation were followed by decreases
in Aanat mRNA and AANAT protein levels as well as in
melatonin synthesis. Inhibition of pCREB dephosphorylation
by protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors abolished
or attenuated the effects of NE withdrawal on these
parameters. Thus, pCREB dephosphorylation has been
identified as an essential mechanism for acute downregulation of the CRE-carrying Aanat gene.

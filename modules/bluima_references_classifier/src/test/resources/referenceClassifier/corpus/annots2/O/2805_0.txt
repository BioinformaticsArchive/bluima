Retention of [14C]sucrose by pial vessels

The velum interpositum and SMV are filled with
arachnoid membranes, arteries, arterioles, venules
and veins (Fig. 8); the quadrigeminal, ambient and
intrapeduncular cisterns, as well as the rest of the
subarachnoidal system, also contain these same tissues (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). [14C]Sucrose entered these two
velae and labeled the arteries, arterioles, veins and
trabeculae therein in less than 7.5 min (Fig. 2, Fig. 3,
Fig. 6). At 20 min, the blackest spots on the autoradiograms were generally associated with pial ar-teries and arterioles—identifiable in the subarachnoid
space by their thicker, darker walls (Fig. 4, Fig. 5,
Fig. 10). At 2.0–3.5 h, virtually all the radioactivity in
the CSF system was in and around pial arteries and
arterioles.
Weller and co-workers18,20,36,37 have observed that
the pial covering or membranes of the intracranial
perivascular spaces are continuous or complete all
the way from the parenchyma to and through the
subarachnoid space. This implies that pial blood
vessels are not directly exposed to subarachnoidal
CSF but are bathed in ``subpial'' fluid, which may be
some sort of a mixture of interstitial, perivascular
and cerebrospinal fluids. In contrast to the complete
pial ensheathment of arteries and arterioles in both
the parenchyma and surface of the brain, the leptomeningeal covering is discontinuous around the veins
and venules. This implies that the rate of material
exchange across the pial covering is greater in veins
and venules than in arteries and arterioles, and that
pial arteries and arterioles are more ``isolated'' from
subarachnoidal CSF than are pial veins and venules.
Kida and Weller20 have also suggested that the more
complete leptomeningeal ensheathment of arteries
and arterioles produces a conduit for draining fluid
from the parenchyma to the subarachnoid space. The
greater retention of radiolabel by pial arteries and
arterioles relative to veins and venules may thus be
caused by diVerences in the leptomeningeal coverings; it might also be related to the thicker, more
muscular walls of arteries and arterioles.
The idea that the flow of CSF is partly directed to
pial blood vessels via the velum interpositum and
SMV and leads to rapid delivery and sizeable retention of CSF-borne solutes by cisternal arteries and
arterioles is rather novel. Brain tissues adjacent to the
ventricles may thus communicate within minutes
with cisternal blood vessels by way of the ``third
circulation''.

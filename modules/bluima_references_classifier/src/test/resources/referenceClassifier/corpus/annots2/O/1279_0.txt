2. METHODS
(a) Sampling
We collected immature females, immature males and mature
sneaker males of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of age 1 in the
Sawmill River (428 300 N, 748 300 W), a tributary of the
Connecticut River in Western Massachusetts, USA, in
October 2002. All fishes used were collected between 1100
and 1400 of the same day. Electrofishing was used to collect
fishes individually. Each fish was immediately euthanized in
buffered MS-222 (100 mg lK1). Length and mass were then
measured, and the brain was dissected within 5 min after
death and transferred to RNAlater storage solution
(Ambion), which stops RNAse activity. The interval between
collecting and tissue storage was always less than 11 min. Sex
was then determined by dissection.

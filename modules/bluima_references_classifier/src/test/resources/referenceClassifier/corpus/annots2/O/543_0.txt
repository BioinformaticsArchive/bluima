Equal numbers of particles of capsid-modified adenovirus
vectors (AdZF*, AdLF*, AdLF*PB*, or AdZFpK7) or vectors
with wild-type capsids (AdZ and AdL) were injected into the
brains of adult rats (n 4 per group). (AdZF*and AdLF*
contained mutant fiber proteins defective for CAR binding,
AdLF*PB* contained CAR binding-defective fibers and mu-tant penton base proteins defective for integrin binding, and
AdZFpK7 was competent for CAR and integrin binding, but
incorporated an additional polylysine insertion into the fiber
knob.) Three days after the intrastriatal injection, animals were
killed, and the brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
to detect transduction, inflammation, and vector diffusion (Fig.
1). At a dose of 109 vector particles, both AdZ and AdZF*

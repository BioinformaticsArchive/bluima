Repeated amphetamine administration leads to a progressive
augmentation of many behavioral effects of the drug (behavioral
sensitization). Sensitization is of interest as a model for druginduced neuroplasticity in neuronal circuits important for addiction. In rodents, sensitization is observed as a progressive augmentation of locomotor activity that may relate to an increase in
the incentive to obtain drugs (Robinson and Berridge, 1993;
Lorrain et al., 2000). There is also evidence of sensitization in
human drug users (Satel et al., 1991) and normal subjects (Strakowski and Sax, 1998).
Previous studies have shown that amphetamine sensitization is
initiated by drug actions within the ventral tegmental area (V TA;
Kalivas and Weber, 1988; Vezina and Stewart, 1990). The VTA
contains dopamine (DA) neurons, which project to the nucleus
accumbens (NAC) and other corticolimbic regions and are
thought to constitute the anatomical substrate for drugs of abuse.
Glutamate projections to the V TA are important in determining
the activity of VTA DA neurons (White, 1996), and considerable
evidence suggests that sensitization is triggered by changes in
glutamate transmission within the VTA (Wolf, 1998).

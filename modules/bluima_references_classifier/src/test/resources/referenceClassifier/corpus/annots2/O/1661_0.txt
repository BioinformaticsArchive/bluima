Seventy-five adult male Syrian hamsters (2–4 months) were either
bred from hamsters purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN, USA) or purchased directly from Harlan Sprague
Dawley and group-housed in a 14 : 10 h light : dark cycle for a
period of 1–3 weeks. Food and water were available ad libitum, and
the experimental procedures were in accordance with the Kent State
University Animal Care and Use Committee, and the PHS Guide to
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

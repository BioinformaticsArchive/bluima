rats, Abcc6 mRNA levels in murine kidney are considerably lower (Kool et al. 1999; Madon et al. 2000).
We further detected Abcc6 mRNA in murine intestine,
colon, brain, and eye. In agreement with our results,
the presence of Abcc6/ABCC6 mRNA has been re-ported in rat intestine and colon (Madon et al. 2000)
and in human duodenum, jejunum, and colon (Kool et
al. 1999; Taipalensuu et al. 2001). However, in these
studies no Abcc6/ABCC6 mRNA has been detected in
the brain of rats or humans (Kool et al. 1999; Madon
et al. 2000). Moreover, in contrast, our results for RT-PCR on human retina did not detect any ABCC6
mRNA (Bergen et al. 2000).
We identified two differentially polyadenylated species of Abcc6 mRNA. The ratio of these two species
varied among different tissues. The 3 UTR of Abcc6
mRNA does not contain the consensus AATAAA
polyadenylation signal that is found in 90% of
mammalian mRNAs, but considerable variation in
polyadenylation signals has previously been reported
(Beaudoing et al. 2000). The AATAAC hexamer (Figure 1A, shaded box), for example, could serve as a signal for the shorter, “TC2” transcript. However, there
is no apparent second signal that would be responsible
for adding a poly(A) tail to the “TC1” transcript ap-proximately 100 bases downstream. Many genes have
multiple polyadenylation sites (Gautheret et al. 1998;
O'Hare 1995). Differential polyadenylation is considered a major post-transcriptional regulation mechanism in eukaryotes (Wahle and Keller 1996). The use
of multiple poly(A) sites can be tissue-specific and differentially regulated during development (O'Connor
et al. 1988; Jaramillo et al. 1991; Lin et al. 1993;
Oyen et al. 1990; Gautheret et al. 1998). Moreover,
the poly(A) tail plays an important role in message
stability and translational efficiency (reviewed in Ed-walds–Gilbert et al. 1997). Taken together, our results
suggest that not only the amount of Abcc6 mRNA
present in a certain tissue but also the ratio of the two
mRNA species will determine the amount of Abcc6
protein in these tissues.
This study reports the cellular localization of Abcc6
mRNA by ISH in a number of different cell types and
confirms the tissue distribution by immunohistochem-

Generation of TN-R-deficient mice
Using a rat cDNA fragment corresponding to the amino-terminal
region of TN-R, a clone carrying the 5'part of the tn-r gene was
isolated from a mouse 129Sv genomic library. The partial structure of the tn-r gene is shown in Figure 1 A. E xon 1 encodes the
two potential translational start codons followed by the signal
sequence and the cysteine-rich amino-terminal part, and exon 2
codes for all EGF repeats. To inactivate the tn-r gene, a targeting
vector was constructed (Fig. 1 B). This vector contains a 4.2 kb 5'
homologous sequence, a PGK-neo cassette (Soriano et al., 1991)
in opposite direction to the tn-r transcription and replacing the
coding region of exon 1 and part of intron 1, 3.9 kb of the 3'
homologous region including exon 2, and the herpes simplex virus
(HSV) thymidine kinase gene (tk) for selection against random
integration (Mansour et al., 1988). Homologous recombination
with this targeting vector results in an insertional mutation (Fig.
1C) and deletes the region encoding the ribosomal binding site,
the translation initiation codon(s), and the amino terminus in-cluding the signal sequence, which is thus expected to result in a
null mutation.
After electroporation of the linearized targeting vector into
E14 embryonic stem cells (Hooper et al., 1987) and double
selection with FIAU and G418, approximately 1 clone of 100
carried the desired mutation as determined by Southern blot
analysis with the external probe 5'EX (Fig. 2 A). The presence of
a new EcoRI site introduced by insertion of neo into exon 1 of the

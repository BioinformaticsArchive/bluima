Polyhomeotic (Ph), which forms complexes with other Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins, is widely required for maintenance of cell
identity by ensuring differential gene expression patterns in distinct types of cells. Genetic mosaic screens in adult fly brains allow
for recovery of a mutation that simultaneously disrupts the tandemly duplicated Drosophila ph transcriptional units. Distinct clones
of neurons normally acquire different characteristic projection patterns and can be differentially labeled using various subtypespecific drivers in mosaic brains. Such neuronal diversity is lost without Ph. In response to ecdysone, ph mutant neurons are
transformed into cells with unidentifiable projection patterns and indistinguishable gene expression profiles during early
metamorphosis. Some subtype-specific neuronal drivers become constitutively activated, while others are constantly suppressed. By
contrast, loss of other PcG proteins, including Pc and E(z), causes different neuronal developmental defects; and, consistent with
these phenomena, distinct Hox genes are differentially misexpressed in different PcG mutant clones. Taken together, Drosophila Ph
is essential for governing neuronal diversity, especially during steroid hormone signaling.

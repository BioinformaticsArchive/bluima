ition in fatty acid β-oxidations is mediated by psychosine
in brain of twitcher mice, we measured the β-oxidation
activity of lignoceric (Fig. 6A) and palmitic (Fig. 6B)
acids in the mouse brain. Twitcher mice had lower
β-oxidation activity of both lignoceric and palmitic acids
(measured in the brain homogenates) compared with
age-matched normal control animals (Fig. 6A,B). Further, we evaluated the level of plasmalogens by GC in
the brain and found a reduced ratio of all three subspecies of plasmalogens (Fig. 6C–E) in twitcher compared
with control animals. Taken together, these observations
indicate that the activities of peroxisomes in the twitcher
mice are compromised.

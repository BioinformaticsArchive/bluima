Figure IO. The distribution of Fos-like
immunoreactive neurons associated
with type III status in the same animal
presented in Figure 9. With the exception of the parataenial and mediodorsal
thalamic nuclei, and the substantia nigra pars reticularis, each structure that
displays high levels of Y-2-deoxyglucase uptake contains many Fos-like im-munoreactive cells (compare Fig. 9). In
addition to those seen with type II status. Fos-labeled cells are distributed
throughout the ventral dentate gyrus,
the piriform cortex, and the perirhinal
and insular cortical areas in the rhinal
sulcus. The distribution of Fos-like im-munoreactive cells is largely bilateral,
while the pattern of I%-2-deoxyglucose
uptake is mostly unilateral. For abbreviations, see Appendix.

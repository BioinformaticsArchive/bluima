The foregoing assessment of MS biomarkers can be
summarized into two key points. First, of the various
approaches that have been considered, the only methods
that are currently used on a regular basis as outcome
measures in treatment trials are those derived from MR;
the recommendations for surrogate outcome measures
for MS clinical trials are accordingly confined to MR
outcomes. Second, a broad concept has emerged which
characterizes MS into two main pathological processes
or phases: 1) multifocal inflammation, and 2) diffuse
neuroaxonal degeneration (FIG. 1).
The process of multifocal inflammation is most prominent in early relapsing remitting MS and is characterized
clinically by relapses and on MRI by the development of
focal new Gd enhancing and T2 lesions. In addition to
demyelination, a degree of acute axonal injury and loss
occurs because of this acute inflammation and may be
inferred from the evolution to a permanent T1 hypointense lesion or the development of a permanent decrease
in NAA. Focal atrophy from individual lesions is not
readily appreciated in the brain but can be measured in
the anatomically isolated optic nerve and averages 10-15% after an attack of optic neuritis. If the aim of a new
experimental therapy is to prevent relapses, new Gd en-hancing and T2 lesions can be regarded as an appropriate

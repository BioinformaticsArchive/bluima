cDNA (Barthels et al., 1987); 687 bp mouse Otx2 partial cDNA (bp 894-1581 of GenBank accession number NM144841); full-length mouse Fgf8
ORF (Kawauchi et al., 2005); full-length of P1 bacteriophage Cre
recombinase cDNA (Lewandoski et al., 1997); 675 bp mouse p21Cip1

For pulse-fix analysis of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, BrdU
(Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant dams (50 μg/gm body
weight) and embryos collected 30 minutes later. Tissue (12 μm cryosections)
was processed for anti-BrdU immunoreactivity as described (Kawauchi et
al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005). TUNEL (deoxynucleotidyl Transferasemediated dUTP Nick End Label) staining to detect DNA fragmentation in
apoptotic cells was performed as described (Kawauchi et al., 2005), except
that 20 μm cryosections were used.
Explant cultures from E14.5-E15.5 CD-1 mice (Charles River,
Wilmington, MA, USA) were prepared as described (DeHamer et al., 1994;
Wu et al., 2003). Purified recombinant human GDF11 (20 ng/ml; obtained
by agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) was
added at the beginning of the culture period. After 14 hours in vitro, explants
were fixed as described (Wu et al., 2003) and processed for p21Cip1
immunoreactivity using monoclonal mouse anti-p21Cip1 (1:1000;

gic interneurons (McDonald, 1985) and 5-HT receptors anatomically and physiologically involved in GABAergic activation
(Gellman and Aghajanian, 1994; Morales and Bloom, 1997).
Previous work has demonstrated that glutamate activation of L A
neurons can be inhibited by local serotonin release and that this
depends on adrenal glucocorticoid hormones (Stutzmann et al.,
1998). The present study implicates GABAergic neurons in this
inhibition. Iontophoretic application of GABA antagonists attenuated the inhibitory effects of 5-HT, returning glutamate-evoked
neuronal activity to within baseline levels in many LA neurons. It
should be noted that other regulatory mechanisms are likely used
in the L A, because not all neurons inhibited by 5-HT were
reversed by GABA blockade.

Pathways downstream of SynGAP
SynGAP has been shown to regulate the activation of ERKmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) through its role as a
Ras-GAP (Komiyama et al., 2002). Furthermore, the Ras-ERKMAPK pathway has been demonstrated to control numerous de-velopmental processes, including synaptic plasticity, cell prolif-

Respiratory response to DL-hornocysteic acid injections
Injections of small volumes of DLH (0-5-6 nl, 20 mmx, 10-120 pmol) in a discrete
region of the NTS depressed respiratory motor output (phrenic nerve discharge or
diaphragm EMG) in a site-specific and dose-dependent manner. The extent of the
DLH-responsive region is shown in Fig. 2 as a composite of histologically identified
sites. The region extended approximately from 0-1 to 0-6 mm caudal to the obex,
from 0-5 to 0-9 mm lateral to mid-line, and from 0-5 to 0-9 mm ventral to the dorsal
surface. Within individual animals the boundaries circumscribing the region were

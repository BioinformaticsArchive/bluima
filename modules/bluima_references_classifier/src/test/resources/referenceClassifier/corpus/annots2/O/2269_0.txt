D@rentiation of the luteinizing hormone -releasing
hormone system

Although the general sequence of events related to
the invasion of neurosecretory axons into the developing ME is well established (see Results),” only a
few studies attempted to identify these axons according to their hormone content in perinatal animaIs.`5,36
Therefore, further research in this direction is essential to clarify some important points of the establishment of the hypothalamohypophysial functional
relationships, including the hypothalamic control of
gonadotrophic function.
In the present study, sparse LHRH-positive axons
were first seen in the ME at the 18th fetal day,
i.e. earlier than in previous immunohistochemical
studies.r2~i5 Meanwhile, our data are consistent with
the radioimmunological results in the same line.4s
By the 20th fetal day a considerable number of
LHRH fibers grows into the ME and the OVLT,
followed by the establishment of the hypothalamic
control over the pituitary gonadotrophs from the 21st
day of prenatal life.`,' In other words, these data
point to the onset of LHRH release into the hypophysial circulation 2-3 days before birth.
From the 1st postnatal day, the concentration and
distribution of LHRH fibers in the ME and the
OVLT become similar to those of adu1ts.25,35Like the
majority of authors,“,25 we failed to detect LHRH
axons abutting on the external basal lamina although
sometimes they were separated from each other only
by attenuated ghoependymal processes, Up to the
present, Daikoku or ui.' have only succeeded in
demonstrating LHRH axons making contact with the
external basal lamina.
In addition to LHRH fibers projecting to the
external zone of the ME, some penetrate toward the
infundibular and preoptic recesses of the 3rd ventricle
in neonates. Although nobody has yet demonstrated
LHRH axons inside the ventricles with the electron
microscope. these axons were observed in the vicinity

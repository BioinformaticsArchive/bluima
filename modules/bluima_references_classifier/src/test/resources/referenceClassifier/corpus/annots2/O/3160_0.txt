l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine experiments
Forepaw adjusting steps were assessed in both the MFB
and striatal lesion experiments immediately before and 1 h
after administration of L-DOPA methyl ester (6.25 mg/kg,
i.p.) and benserazide (50 mg/kg, i.p.) to block peripheral
conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine. The L-DOPA test was
performed four weeks after the 6-OHDA in the MFB lesion
experiments and two weeks after the 6-OHDA in the striatal
lesion experiments.

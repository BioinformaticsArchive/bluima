question may be raised why CAMS completely
blocked AOB-induced excitation of TI arcuate
neurons when NMDA-mediated responses are still
available if GAMS is a non-NMDA an~gonist.
Likewise for APS when non-NMDA-m~iated
responses are available. Further experiments will be
necessary to answer this question.
Intra-stria terminalis infusions of lignocaine
completely abolished the AOB-induced excitation of
all the TI arcuate neurons tested, indicating that the
excitatory transmission from the AOB to TI arcuate
neurons is mediated entirely via the stria terminalis.
This conclusion is substantiated by the finding that TI
arcuate neurons responding to AOB stimulation also
responded with a shorter latency to stria terminalis
stimulations

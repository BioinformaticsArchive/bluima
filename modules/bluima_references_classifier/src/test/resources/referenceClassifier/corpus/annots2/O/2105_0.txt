AChR purified from human muscleby affinity chromatography
usingotBgt(Tumbull et al., 1985)or mAbs (Momoi and Lennon,
1982)hasbeenreportedtocontain,respectively,4or5polypeptide chains of apparent molecular weights ranging from
44,000 to 66,000. The 44,000-molecular-weight polypeptides
are identified as (Ysubunitsby affinity labeling, but the other
polypeptidesarenot identified. In thesepreparations,only AChR
monomersare observedon sucrosegradients.

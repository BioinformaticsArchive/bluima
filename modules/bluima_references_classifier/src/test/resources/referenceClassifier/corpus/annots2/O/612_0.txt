depletion as adapted to mice (Triguero et al., 1990; Gutierrez et
al., 1993). CD-1 male mice anesthetized with i.p. urethane re-ceived an i.v. tracer injection of 0.2 ml of LR-BSA and 105 cpm of
an I-ghrelin. At either 2 or 10 min after i.v. injection, blood from
the abdominal aorta was collected. The thorax was opened, the
descending aorta clamped, the jugular veins severed, and the
vascular space of the brain washed free of blood by perfusing 20 ml
of LR-BSA through the left ventricle of the heart. The cerebral
cortex was removed, weighed, and emulsified with a glass homogenizer (10 strokes) in 0.8 ml of physiological buffer (10 mM
HEPES, 141 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4,
1 mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM D-glucose adjusted to pH 7.4). Dextran solution (1.6 ml of a 26% solution) was added to the homogenate, which was thoroughly mixed, and homogenized again (3
strokes). Homogenization was performed at 4°C in less than 1
min. An aliquot of the homogenate was centrifuged at 5400g for 15
min at 4°C in a Beckman Allegra 21R centrifuge with a swinging
bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The pellet
containing the brain vasculature and the supernatant containing
the brain parenchyma were carefully separated, and the level of
131I determined in a gamma counter. The fractions were expressed
as volumes of distribution in microliters per gram.
Mouse Brain Perfusion. Mice were anesthetized with i.p. urethane, the thorax was opened, and the heart was exposed (Banks et
al., 2000). Both jugular veins were severed, and the descending
thoracic aorta was clamped. A 26-gauge butterfly needle was in-serted into the left ventricle of the heart and Zlokovic's buffer (7.19
g/l NaCl, 0.3 g/l KCl, 0.28 g/l CaCl2, 2.1 g/l NaHCO3, 0.16 g/l
KH2PO4, 0.17 g/l anhydrous MgCl2, 0.99 g/l D-glucose, and 10 g/l
bovine serum albumin added the day of perfusion) containing m-ghrelin infused at a rate of 2 ml/min for 5 min. After perfusion, the
needle was removed, and the mouse was decapitated. Brain/perfusion ratios were calculated by dividing the counts per minute/brain
by the weight in grams of the brain and by the counts per minute in
1 l of perfusion fluid to yield units of microliters per gram. The
perfused brain remains viable for about 7 h (Krieglstein et al., 1972),
and the BBB remains intact until about 12 h after death (Broman,
1950; Gro ̈ntoft, 1954).
Measurement of Brain-to-Blood efflux. A method previously de-scribed that accurately quantifies efflux rates was used (Banks and
Kastin, 1989). Mice were anesthetized with i.p. urethane, the scalp
removed, and a hole made through the cranium 1.0 mm lateral and 1.0
mm posterior to the bregma with a 26-gauge needle. Tubing covered all
but the terminal 2.5 to 3.0 mm of the needle so that the tip of the needle
penetrated the brain tissue forming the roof of the lateral ventricle but
did not penetrate its floor. One microliter of LR-BSA containing 5000
cpm of ghrelin was injected into the lateral ventricle with a 1- l Hamilton syringe. To determine the rate of efflux, three mice were decapitated at each time of 2, 5, 10, and 20 min, and the residual radioactivity
in the brain was determined. The amount of radioactivity in the brain
at t 0 was estimated as previously described in mice (n 3) that had
been overdosed with urethane. The log of the percentage of injected
counts remaining in the whole brain was plotted against time and the
slope used to calculate the half-time disappearance rate. To determine
whether there was a saturable component to the retention of ghrelins
by brain after i.c.v. injection, other mice received an i.c.v. injection
containing a combination of radioactive and unlabeled ghrelins so that
between 0.35 and 12.5 g/mouse of ghrelin was injected. The mice were
decapitated 10 min after injection, and the residual radioactivity was
expressed as the percentage of the injection remaining in brain.
Statistics. Means are reported with their standard errors and
were compared by analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls
range test. Regression lines were computed by the least-squares
method and compared statistically with the Prism 3.0 program
(GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA).

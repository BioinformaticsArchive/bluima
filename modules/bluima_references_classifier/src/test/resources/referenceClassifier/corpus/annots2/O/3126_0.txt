MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. NCAM-180 mutant mice (CF-1 background) described previously (Tomasiewicz et al., 1993) and NCAM null mutant mice on a
C57Bl/6 background (Cremer et al., 1994) were used for immunocytochemical and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine
perchlorate (DiI) studies. E14 and E15 embryos were perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, were postfixed overnight at 4°C, and were processed for immunocytochemistry
(E15) or DiI injection (E14). Timed pregnant C57Bl /6 mice obtained
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were used in endo N
experiments and were analyzed further with LHRH immunohistochemistry and DiI injections into the VNO.
Enzymatic removal of PSA in vivo. Pregnant C57Bl/6 mice at E12 of
gestation were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of Avertin
(0.02 ml /gm body weight). Under aseptic conditions, an abdominal incision was made, and the embryos were exposed. Endo N (0.5 μl) or
heat-inactivated endo N (Ono et al., 1994) was microinjected into two
embryos from each litter. The wound was then closed with sterile sutures
and staples, and the animal was allowed to recover. Three days later, the
mice were anesthetized again, and the E15 embryos were perfused with
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PB, pH 7.4. The heads were post-fixed
overnight and were placed into 0.1 M PB until processing for immunohistochemistry or DiI injection. Endo N injected into live embryos results
in removal of PSA in <1 day, lasting up to 6 weeks (Landmesser et al.,
1990; Shen et al., 1997). Endo N efficacy was assessed by immunostaining
lateral sagittal sections through the head with antibodies to PSA-NCAM
(see below).
Immunohistochemistry. Heads from 4% paraformaldehyde-perfused
C57Bl/6 wild-type, NCAM-180 mutant, and NCAM null mutant mouse
embryos were mounted in 5% agarose, and 70 μm sagittal sections were
cut using a vibratome. The sections were placed in 25 mm net wells
(Corning, Corning, NY), kept at 4°C, and pretreated in the following
manner: 15 min in 0.01 M sodium-m-periodate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
solution; three 10 min washes in 0.05 M PBS, pH 7.4; 15 min in 0.5%
sodium borohydride; three 10 min washes in PBS; and 30 min in 3%
NGS–1% H2O2–PBS and 15 min in 5% NGS in PBS with 0.3% Triton
X-100. The sections were incubated at 4°C for 18 –22 hr on a rotating
table in antibodies to LHRH, TAG-1, and PSA-NCAM and diluted in
0.1% Triton X-100 –1% BSA–PBS. The sections were then washed for 1
hr with four changes of 0.02% Triton–1% NGS–PBS at room temperature. The sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) di-luted at 1:200 in 1% NGS – 0.32% Triton X-100 –PBS for 2 hr and washed
for 1 hr in four changes of 0.02% Triton–PBS. After incubation in ABC
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hr, the sections were
washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5, and developed with
diaminobenzidine solution in TBS. The sections were then washed with
PBS, placed on slides, dehydrated, and mounted with Permount (Fisher
Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). Slides were coded to ensure unbiased assessment of the LHRH cell population from the different groups of mice.
LHRH cells were counted in three compartments (nose, brain, and OB)
in sagittal sections at 400× magnification using an Axioplan (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) microscope.
Antibodies. For the immunohistochemical analyses, LHRH neurons
were labeled using the LR1 anti-LHRH antibody, a generous gift from
Dr. Robert Benoit (Montreal General Hospital, Montreal, C anada). To
detect PSA-NCAM, the 5A5 monoclonal antibody was used (Acheson et
al., 1991). For the investigation concerning the TAG-1 adhesion molecule, the 4D7 monoclonal antibody was used (Yamamoto et al., 1986).
RO25, the IgG fraction of a polyclonal rabbit antibody to NCAM, was
used for Western blotting procedures. RO25 was made against rat
NCAM purified from neonatal brain membranes by immunoaffinity
isolation using the 3F4 monoclonal antibody (Shen et al., 1997). In
immunoblots of SDS-PAGE fractionated mouse brain membrane proteins (NP-40 extract), it specifically recognizes the three major NCAM
isoforms (180, 140, and 120).
DiI labeling of V NN. DiI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a lipophilic
fluorescent dye, was used to label V N N fibers. To investigate the effect
of endo N on VNN fibers, DiI crystals were placed in the VNO of endo
N-treated, heat-inactivated endo N-treated, and littermate control E15
mice. DiI was also used to label the VNN in NCAM-180-deficient and
NCAM null mutant mice at E14, as well as E14 C57/Bl6 mice for use as
wild-type controls. The VNOs of 4% paraformaldehyde-perfused mice
were exposed ventrally by dissecting through the soft palate. A crystal of
DiI on the tip of a pulled capillary pipette was placed into each VNO.

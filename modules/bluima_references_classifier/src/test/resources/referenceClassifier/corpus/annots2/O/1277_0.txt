multiple ionotropic glutamate receptors subtypes, as both
kainate (Marin et al., 1993; Kendrick et al., 1996) and
NMDA (Marin et al., 1993; East et al., 1996; Kendrick et al.,
1996; Iravani et al., 1998) elevate striatal NO levels in in
vivo and in vitro preparations.
Furthermore, while previous studies show that cortical
afferents modulate dorsal striatal NO (O'Donnell and
Grace, 1997), it seems that PFC does not modulate the
NO/cGMP pathway in the rat striatum (Consolo et al.,
1999), although this work also investigated the dorsal
rather than the ventral striatum, it is in agreement with our
finding that the hippocampus but not the PFC may provide
the synaptic input to NOS immunoreactive cells. Such
selectivity of afferents to a population of local circuit neurons is not unexpected given the targeting by amygdalar
afferents of parvalbumin but not calretinin containing neurons in the striatum (Sadikot et al., 1996).

The complete model was applied to measured brain and CSF concentrations of Johanson and Woodbury (lo), whereas a partial model
(ks = 0) was applied to measured brain concentrations of Reed and
Woodbury (26). Equation I7 was fit by nonlinear least squares to brain
concentration data to provide values for transfer constants. The Bi and
Pi that were employed for data column 1 are given in Fig. 2. X1 and h2
were calculated by Eq. A8 (APPENDIX), and (t& and (t1,2)b2y Eq. 13.
Grain/Cpla;sma,,, is defined by Eq. 26. * Initial condition.

of the “acoustical axis” (24) of the contralateral
pinna, and two attempts to locate a neural
map of auditory space,of the kind described
for the owl (16), have been unsuccessful(20,
33). It seemslikely, therefore, that while the
independent evolution of the owl and the cat
has resulted in both speciesshowing neural
and behavioral sensitivity to temporal and in-tensive disparities and in neurons showing
spatially restricted auditory receptive fields,
the peripheral and neural mechanisms im-parting thoseproperties may be quite different.

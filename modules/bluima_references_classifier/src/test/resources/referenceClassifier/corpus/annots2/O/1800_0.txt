The anarchic hand
Our patient with chronic right-sided AH had an extensive lesion of the corpus callosum
(CC) and the fronto-mesial cortex on both sides. It is reasonable to think that the
supplementary motor area (SMA) was more likely to be compromised on the left, given the
larger mesial lesion on that side. The activities of the right hand were considered by the
patient to be unwanted, and this feeling did not change with time. The autonomous
movements were correct from the praxic viewpoint, they were neither aimless nor ataxic, not
identifiable as dyskinesias. The patient disavowed the movements carried out by the right
hand even when they fit the requirements of the tasks carried out. This behaviour cannot be
interpreted as the consequence of hemispheric cognitive incompetence for some responses of
the right hand, as was considered to be the case for LORING et al.? case J.M. [32].
G.C. never considered that the AH that she could not control was not really hers; in fact, as
in most cases in the literature, she always recognized the arm as hers. We agree with
GOLDBERG [23] that the term `alien hand' is less appropriate than the term `wayward hand'
or, in view of the complete autonomy of the arm and its disruptive effect on the daily activities
of patients who have one, perhaps the best would be `anarchic hand'.
The interpretation of AH is made complicated even by linguistic misunderstanding. This
same term has been used to describe phenomena that have little in common. BOGEN[9], for
example, defined AH as a hand that `behaves in a way which the patient finds foreign or at
least uncooperative' (p. 313) and, with almost imperceptible shades of meaning, differentiates this from `intermanual conflict' (p. 312), defined as a situation in which one hand `is
acting at cross purposes to the other', sometimes to the point of engaging in a real struggle

closely related to the dominant frequency and the power spectrum
of the TAN in the pair but not to the pallidal cell. Synchronized
oscillations could stem from recording two independent oscillatory
processes over a finite time. However, it is unlikely that this is the
case for many of the synchronized oscillations that we encountered
in this study. First, in some cases the autocorrelograms of the two
cells composing a synchronized pair were not oscillatory, and the
correlation between the power spectra of the cross-correlogram
and autocorrelograms was low. Second, the phase distribution was
also diferent from the flat distribution expected for two independent processes. The phase-shift distribution of pairs with GPe cells
was diferent from that of pairs with GPi cells, suggesting that GPe
is more than a relay station between the striatum and GPi (Chesselet and Delfs, 1996).
The fact that the synchronized activity is closer to the oscillatory activity of the TANs than to that of pallidal cells may be a
result of the different oscillation patterns of the two groups. TANs
oscillations are usually the result of rhythmic single spiking (Raz
et al., 1996), whereas pallidal oscillations are the result of rhythmic bursting (Raz et al., 2000). Because the frequencies of oscil-

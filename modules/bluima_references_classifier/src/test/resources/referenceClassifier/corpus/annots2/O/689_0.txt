perpnea was longer in this group than in the animals
with intact vagi, but it should be noted that the degree
of hypocapnia was also less.
In some of the cats with intact vagi, deep sighing
breaths occurred at regular intervals despite both hypocapnia and bilaterally cut carotid sinus nerves. Some of
these sighs occurred during the early recovery period
after cessation of stimulation; a striking finding was
thatthe very deep inspiration did not significantly interfere with the slowly declining recovery pattern of respiration. In the example in Fig. 4, the large sigh is 3 times
the magnitude of adjacent breaths. While it does appear
to have some effect on end-expiratory level, it does not

versus low demand trials revealed brain regions with activation
that was modulated on the basis of demand for temporal-order
retrieval. Multiple lateral prefrontal regions including the middle
and inferior lateral prefrontal cortex were prominently activated.
Activation was also observed in the anterior prefrontal cortex
and the medial temporal cortex, regions well documented to be
related to memory retrieval in general. The modulation of brain
activity in these regions suggests a detailed pathway that is
engaged during recency judgment.

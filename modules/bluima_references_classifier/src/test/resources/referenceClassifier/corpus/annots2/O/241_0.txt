Release of the neurotransmitter contained in presynaptic vesicles
is triggered by a rise of intracellular Ca ([Ca2+]i) within the
presynaptic terminal (Katz and Miledi, 1967; Augustine et al.,
1985; Mintz et al., 1995). Abundant evidence (Adler et al., 1991;
Mintz et al., 1995; Borst and Sakmann, 1996; Neher, 1998) in-dicates that influx through voltage-dependent C a channels
(VDCCs) located near vesicle-docking sites can provide the Ca
influx needed to evoke synaptic transmission. However, activation
of presynaptic neurotransmitter receptors that are permeable to
Ca may also enable a sufficient rise in intracellular Ca to trigger
transmitter release. This hypothesis is supported by studies of
axon terminals that contain presynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors
(nAChRs) that are highly permeable to C a (Vernino et al., 1992;
Rathouz and Berg, 1994; Gray et al., 1996). Application of exogenous nicotine enhanced the frequency of glutamatergic spontaneous EPSC by acting on presynaptic nAChRs in chick medial
habenula and interpeduncular nuclei (McGehee et al., 1995).
Similar results were found in rat when nicotine applied to mossy
fiber synapses in the hippocampus increased the frequency of
miniature glutamatergic EPSPs (Gray et al., 1996), an effect that
persists after blockade of VDCCs with cadmium.
In the olfactory bulb presynaptic granule cell spines contain
f unctional NMDA receptors (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998;
Schoppa et al., 1998) that are critically involved in triggering
exocytosis of GABA (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998). These
dendritic spines form reciprocal synapses with the secondary

An excitatory response to DHPG was obtained in 100% of
neurons tested (n 169). In current-clamp recordings, rapid
applications of DHPG (10 M, 15 s) depolarized septohippocampal cholinergic neurons tested (Fig. 1A), producing a
mean depolarization of 11.8 5.1 mV (n 4). In voltageclamp recordings, the excitatory response to DHPG was ob-served as a 79.5 5 pA inward current (range:10 –300 pA;
n 164) at a holding potential of –65 mV (Fig. 1, B and C).

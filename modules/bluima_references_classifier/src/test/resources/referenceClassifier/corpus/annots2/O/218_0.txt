Four tissue sections per rostro-caudal area from each animal were
analyzed (16 slices per animal) for each receptor subtype. For quantitative analysis of autoradiographic grain density, a computer-assisted
quantitative system (Densirag computerized program; Biocom, Les Ulis,
France) interfaced to an Axiophot microscope (60× epiillumination
dark-field objective; Carl Zeiss, Go ̈ ttingen, Germany) was used. During
a first analysis, the grain density corresponding to GalR1 or GalR2
mRNA levels was quantified in non-POMC cells. Cells were identified
as labeled with the GalR1 or GalR2 probe if the silver grain optical
density over the perikaryon was at least three times higher than the
background. During a second analysis, POMC neurons were analyzed
for the expression of GalR1 or GalR2 mRNA. POMC mRNA-expressing
cells were first isolated under bright-field illumination, and the density
of grains atop all POMC neurons was determined. Two types of analysis
were applied, giving complementary information. The first approach
consisted of counting the grain density over all POMC neurons of each
area and calculating the labeling ratio in each neuron. The labeling ratio
was defined as the ratio of the total grain density over the POMC neuron
to the background measured in a cell-sized region nearby (density of
silver grains caused by hybridization/mean background density of silver grains). The data were expressed as frequency distribution of GalR1
or GalR2 mRNA labeling in POMC neurons. This approach which
avoided determining an arbitrary threshold might be more representative of the total number of double-labeled POMC neurons. This type
of approach has been previously reported for analysis of double-labeled
neurons (2). The second approach consisted of analyzing the POMC
neurons having a number of silver grains over the perikaryon at least
three times higher than the background. The mean cellular GalR1 or
GalR2 mRNA content in POMC neurons was thus determined. In this
approach, statistical analysis could be performed.

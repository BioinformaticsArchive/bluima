1. Although the physical nature of sigma (a) receptors have not yet been fully defined, several classes of
selective ligands have been character&d, demonstrating a plethora of physiological actions. In the
present review, the authors have set out to highlight two important aspects of the biological activities of
o ligands, their neuroprotective and anti-amnesic effects.
2. The o ligands present a therapeutic potential as neuroprotective agents in brain ischemia. The
neuroprotective activity of many non-selective o ligands is primarily a result of their affinity for the
NMDA receptor complex. However, selective o ligands am also neuroprotective, possibly by inhibition
of the ischemic-induced presynaptic release of excitotoxic amino acids.
3. The u, ligands prevent the experimental amnesia induced by muscarinic cholinergic antagonists at either
the learning, consolidation or retention phase of the mnesic process. This effect involves a potentation
of acetylcholine release induced by u, ligands selectively in the hippccampal formation and cortex.
4. The o, receptor ligands also attenuate the learning impairment induced by dizocilpine, a non-competitive
antagonist of the NMDA receptor, and may relate to the potentiating effect of o, ligands on several
NMDA receptor-mediated responses previously described in vitro and in vivo in the hippocampus. This
effect is shared by NPY- and CGRP-related peptides and by neuroactive steroids, confirrnng the in
vitro evidences of functional interactions between the o, receptors and these different systems.
5. Additional amnesia models also seem to be alleviated by (T_l,igands, such as phencyclidine-induced
cognitive dysfunctions, and amnesia induced by the calaum channel blocker nimodipine, or by
exposure to carbon monoxide. Furthermore, a preliminary study in an animal model of age-related
memory deficits, the senescence-accelerated mouse, strengthened the therapeutic potentials of selective
o, receptor ligands in aging-related pathologies,

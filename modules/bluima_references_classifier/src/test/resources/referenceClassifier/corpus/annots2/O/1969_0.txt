Light / dark box test
The light / dark box test was performed according to a previously
published method, with some modifications (Chen et al., 2006). The
test apparatus was a rectangular Plexiglas box divided by a partition
into two compartments. One compartment (17 × 28 × 28 cm) was left
dark (< 10 lux), and another was lit with an overhead light
(> 120 lux). The compartments were connected by an opening
(7.5 × 7.5 cm) located at floor level in the center of the partition.
The subject (n = 18 for each genotype) was placed into the light
compartment and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. The time spent
with all four paws in each compartment was measured.

develops an MGC in the AL innervated by the AN from the
grafted antenna (Schneiderman et al., 1982; Hildebrand, 1985).
Such transplantation experiments have revealed that development of the MGC depends upon direct innervation of the
AL by male-specific antenna1 axons. Thus, the MGC does not
develop if the male AN fails to contact the brain or does so at
sites other than the AL. This requirement for intimate interaction between the AN and the AL raises the possibility that
one or more nondiffusible substances, synthesized in male an-tennal sensory neurons and transported along their axons, may
influence the formation of the MGC. Likely candidates for this
role would be polypeptides unique to, or highly enriched in,
male ANs. We have pursued this possibility by comparing the
total and axonally transported polypeptides in ANs of developing male and female M. sexta by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). A preliminary account of some of these results
appeared previously (Kingan and Hildebrand, 1983).

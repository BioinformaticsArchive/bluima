Fig. 5. Photomicrographs showing the closely matched distribution of both RCP-IR and CGRP-IR profiles in some regions of the brainstem (A and
B) and in the spinal dorsal horn (C and D). RCP-IR neurons were seen in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and gracile nucleus (GR) (A). CGRP-IR
axons were also observed in these regions (B). In the spinal dorsal horn (C), numerous RCP-IR neurons were localized in the superficial laminae as
well as in the deeper laminae, but most concentrated in laminae I and II. RCP-IR axons were predominantly localized in laminae I and II. More intensely
RCP-IR axons were present in the lateral portion of dorsal horn. The localization of RCP-IR neurons in the spinal dorsal horn matches well with that
of CGRP-IR axons (D) which were primarily distributed in laminae I, II and V, but sparsely seen in other laminae. Both RCP-IR (E) and CGRP-IR (F)
were localized in the motoneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. CGRP-IR in some motoneurons was in a reticular pattern. Scale bar 100 m
for Aâ€“D; 75 m for E and F.

to the perfusion line and achieved their maximal response
within 5 min. If a neuron had not responded within 5 min
it was considered to be unresponsive. Only those neurons
which were excited (depolarization in current-clamp or
inward current in voltage-clamp) or inhibited (hyperpolarization in current-clamp or outward current in voltageclamp) by carbachol are considered further here.

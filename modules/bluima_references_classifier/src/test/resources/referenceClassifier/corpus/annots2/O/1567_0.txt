The links between ampakines, BDNF and LTP raise a
further set of questions about how pharmacologically
induced changes in plasticity rules will affect cognitive
structures. Once induced, LTP passes through a
30–60 min period during which it becomes increasingly
stable or `consolidated' [68], an aspect of the potentiation
effect that accords with a memory phenomenon known
since the 19th century. Kossel et al. [63] demonstrated
that BDNF antagonists impair consolidation when infused
within a narrow time window surrounding LTP induction,
and we have recently found them to be effective when
applied immediately after theta-burst stimulation
(G. Lynch and C.M. Gall, unpublished). Other work shows
that adenosine applied or released during this period
produces the opposite effect to BDNF: it completely blocks
the stabilization of potentiation [69,70]. These results
point to the possibility of competition between positive
(e.g. BDNF) and negative (e.g. adenosine) modulatory
factors for control of the consolidation process in the
minutes following LTP induction. Because BDNF and
adenosine are both released by afferent firing patterns
that are known to occur during and after learning, we
can reasonably assume that the outcome of the competition
determines what is, or is not, encoded into memory.
A limited set of experimental results supports this idea.
Studies using brain slices show that single stimulation
pulses delivered at the theta frequency (4–8 Hz) block LTP
when delivered early in the consolidation period [70].
Similar effects are reported for LTP in freely moving rats
in which the theta rhythm is triggered by behavior [71].
Other work demonstrates that sharp waves, which are
irregular oscillations with a mean frequency at the lower
end of the theta range, also partially disrupt LTP,

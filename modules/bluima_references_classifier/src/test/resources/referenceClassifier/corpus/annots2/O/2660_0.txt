FIG. 8. LAR expression in cultured cells. Poly(A)RNAwas
isolated from the indicated cultured cells, and2 pg was loaded/lane.
As a control for RNA loading, the same blot was probed with cyclophilin riboprobe. A, primary neuronsandastrocytes from cortex;
PC12, undifferentiated rat pheochromocytoma cells; L9, rat glioma
cells; FB3T3, immortalized mouse fibroblasts;andmouse C2C12
myoblasts. B, control undifferentiated PC12 cells and PC12 cells
bearing neurite-like processes after 3 days of NGFexposure.Two
separate Northern blots performed with two separate preparations
each of control and NGF-inducedRNA are shown. C, RNA was
harvested from fibroblasts a t 50%confluence and 1day after reaching
100%confluence.

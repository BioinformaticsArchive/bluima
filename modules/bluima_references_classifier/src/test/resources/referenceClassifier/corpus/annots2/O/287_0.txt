directions. Figure 5a shows a projection of these computed
trajectories onto a T2-weighted amplitude image of the
brain at the level of the selected ROI. Figure 5b shows a 3D
rendering of the computed trajectories with T2-weighted
amplitude images displayed at slices below the ROI. Fiber
trajectories within the body of the corpus callosum are
consistent with the known anatomy of this structure. Fiber
trajectories continuing beyond the external margins of the
lateral ventricles appear to follow anatomically defined
tracts (external capsule and pathways projecting to the
occipital lobe); however, establishing if the apparent continuity of callosal fibers into these tracts is a true anatomical feature requires validation by histological techniques.
Figure 6a also shows a 3D rendering of computed trajectories from human DT-MRI data. In this figure we map long
projection pathways by launching trajectories from ROIs
positioned in the internal capsule at the level of the globus
pallidum, in the pyramidal tract at the level of the cerebral
peduncles and the pons, and in the ascending sensory
fibers (lemniscus medialis) at the level of the pons. Tracts
are followed in both directions. Only regions within the
imaging volume for which the lattice anisotropy index is
greater than 0.3 are used. This is to ensure that fiber tracts
are launched from regions of coherently organized white
matter. Figure 6b shows a projection of these computed
trajectories. This figure is obtained from the previous one

This study demonstrates that at least one
species of the Acrasieae, or cellular slime molds,
is capable of completing its whole life cycle (vegetative growth and multiplication, aggregation,
and fructification) in the absence of any bacteria
or bacterial products. Cell populations kept for
over 125 generations in their vegetative state by
:serial transfers are still able to fruit when re-moved to an appropriate environment, thus confirming quantitatively the results obtained earlier
by Raper (1940) for Dictyostelium discoideum and
other species grown on living bacteria in conventional agar-plate cultures.

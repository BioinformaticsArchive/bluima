one involves spontaneous expression of IEGs under
constant conditions, and the other a rhythm of
sensitivity to the gene-regulating eVects of light
exposure. Moreover, these two programs are
expressed in diVerent regions of the SCN, dorsomedial and ventrolateral, supporting the idea of a
functional compartmentalization of the SCN into
two major subdivisions. Many other functional and
anatomical diVerences have been noted between
these regions, including receptor populations
and sensitivities to neurotransmitters and their
antagonists.1,15,25,32,50,61,62,64,65
Photic induction of the IEGs NGFI-A, c-fos and
junB after 248 h DD is restricted to the subjective
night and early subjective day, which our parallel
behavioral studies demonstrate are the only phases at
which light can also shift the clock. Induction of c-fos
expression in the SCN is also correlated with phase
shifts of a non-behavioral rhythm, that of pineal
N-acetyltransferase activity, which is controlled by
the SCN.58 This temporal correlation between induction and phase shifting is reinforced by evidence that
antisense oligonucleotides to c-Fos and JunB can
prevent photically induced phase shifts in rats.63
However, the eVects of light are not uniform across
this sensitive phase, nor for all IEGs studied. As
reported previously for c-Fos,39 many fewer cells
show expression of these IEGs in response to light
during the early subjective night, and these are confined largely to the ventrolateral SCN. Light exposure during the second half of the night stimulates
IEG expression in much larger numbers of cells,
spread throughout the nucleus. This rhythm of sensitivity is also evident in the fact that very brief light
pulses are virtually ineVective in the early subjective
night and responses increase for pulse durations up
to 30 min, while later in the night, even brief exposures are eVective and responses are saturated by
5-min light pulses.34
Our previous demonstration in Syrian hamsters of
a circadian rhythm of spontaneous expression of
junB in DD confined to the dorsomedial SCN12â€“14
has been extended to the expression of c-fos mRNA
and c-Fos protein in hamsters, although it appears to
be less confined to the dorsomedial SCN. In contrast
to both of these IEGs, NGFI-A mRNA is not
expressed spontaneously in the SCN at any circadian
phase, and its expression is related only to photic
input, peaking in response to light around ZT 20.
Expression of another IEG, fosB, resembles that of
NGFI-A in some respects: its mRNA is not detectable
and does not oscillate in any part of the SCN in
constant darkness, but it is increased sharply by
nocturnal light pulses,13 as are the levels of FosB
protein.36 FosB-like immunoreactivity is, however,
also found constitutively in the SCN at all circadian
phases;9,36 whether NGFI-A protein is regulated
similarly to FosB has not yet been reported.
Photic regulation of fosB mRNA levels also
resembles that of NGFI-A in that there is a mono-

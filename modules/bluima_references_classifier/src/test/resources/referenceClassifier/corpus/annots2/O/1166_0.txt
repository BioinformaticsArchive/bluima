The effect of 6 weeks of testosterone treatment on the
volumes of RA and area X was investigated using
repeated 3D MEMRI (coronal 3D, spin echo, T1-weighted, FOV 25 mm in all directions, image matrix
265  256  256, acquisition time 90 min, 7 T system) in
cannulated female starlings. A clear but non-significant
volume increase (50.2 and 19.6% for RA and area X
respectively) was observed in testosterone-treated birds.
It was, however, paralleled by a volume decrease in
controls (25.6 and 5.7% for RA and area X respectively;
Fig. 4), possibly related to spontaneous seasonal changes
or to the mild but chronic stress induced by captivity.
Independent of the origin of this decrease in controls,
these results illustrate the power of repeated imaging by
MEMRI to analyze brain plasticity. Effects of testosterone were indeed superimposed to the effects of a nonidentified phenomenon leading to a substantial although
not significant volume decrease in controls. As a consequence, the two-way ANOVA analyzing these results
detected no effect of the two main factors (the endocrine
condition of the birds and the two repeated measures
before and after treatment), but identified a significant
interaction between these two variables, indicating that
testosterone indeed had a significant effect. The identification of this interaction was only made possible by the
use of birds as their own controls and a parallel control
group so that we could analyze volumes before and after a
period of treatment with or without the steroid. This
procedure detected effects of testosterone that would
have gone unnoticed in a single histological measure.
This clearly illustrates the value of repeated MEMRI as a
tool for the study of brain plasticity over time.

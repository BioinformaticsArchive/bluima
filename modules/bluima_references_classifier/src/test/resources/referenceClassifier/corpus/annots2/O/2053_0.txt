Methodological considerations

Projections of serotonin neurons have been well studied using
conventional tract-tracing methods, which have shown an ordered,
albeit complex, topography of projection patterns (reviewed by
Vasudeva et al., 2011; Waselus et al., 2011). However, conventional
tract tracing is limited by the location and variability of injection sites,
which may not map to functional groups, as well as the potential
uptake of tract tracer by neurochemically heterogeneous cell types.
The current methods are unique in identifying distinct groups of

derlying learning and memory, BDNF may be involved in memory
processes The water maze learning was impaired in BDNF mutant
mice (Linnarsson et al., 1997) or in rats that had received an
intracerebroventricular inf usion of anti-BDN F antibody (Mu et al.,
1999). A relation between BDNF mRNA expression and memory
was shown in the passive avoidance test (Ma et al., 1998) and in the
water maze test (Kesslak et al., 1998). It should be noted, however,
that the behavioral tests used so far to investigate the role of BDNF
in learning and memory are negatively motivated stressful paradigms and that various stresses and sensory stimulation affect
BDNF expression (Ernfors et al., 1991; Nibuya et al., 1995; Smith
et al., 1995).
Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical gas with a role in synaptic
plasticity, including learning and memory (Garthwaite and Boulton, 1995; Yamada and Nabeshima, 1998). A brain NO synthase
(NOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) inhibited the spatial learning of rats (Z ou et al., 1998a). Notably, X iong et al. (1999) have
demonstrated a mutual regulation of NO and BDNF synthesis in
vitro and in vivo.
In the present study, we investigated the role of BDN F in
learning and memory using a less stressful eight-arm radial arm
maze test. We examined whether spatial memory formation is
associated with changes in the level of BDNF mRNA in the brain.
We also studied the changes in BDN F mRNA level when spatial
learning is inhibited by treatment with 7-NI. Furthermore, to
clarify the causal relation between BDNF expression and memory
formation, we investigated the effects of BDNF antisense treatment on spatial learning and memory.

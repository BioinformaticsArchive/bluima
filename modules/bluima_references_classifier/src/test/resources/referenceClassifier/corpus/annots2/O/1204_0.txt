Figure 10. Example of three neurons with head-centered, intermediate, and eye-centered
encoding of auditory spatial information. The left column shows the RF locations determined
while the monkey fixated either 10° to the left (black RF; fixation position indicated by the black
cross) or 10° to the right (white RF; fixation position indicated by the white cross). The RFs are
plotted in a head-centered reference frame. In the right column, the very same RFs are plotted
in eye-centered coordinates (fixation position indicated by the gray cross). The first cell (first
row) could be described best as encoding space in a head-centered coordinate system. The
second cell (second row) fitted best an intermediate encoding scheme, whereas the third cell
(third row) encoded auditory information in an eye-centered reference frame (see Results for
details).

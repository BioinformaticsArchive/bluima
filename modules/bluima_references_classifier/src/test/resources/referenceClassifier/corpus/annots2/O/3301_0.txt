and phase correction. The area of the NMR
spectrum lines of CH3 of NAA at 2.0 ppm,
N-CH3 of Cr at 3.0 ppm and (N-CH3)3 of Cho at
3.2 ppm was determined using the area integration method supplied with the spectroscopy
software of the MR imager.
The standard CP body coil was used for
imaging of the liver, spleen, muscle and fat of
patients and control subjects. MRI was carried
out using the CPMG sequence (TR52000 ms,
TE520 ms+n* 15 ms, n50–15, three slices with
10 mm slice thickness, 192×256 matrix size,
500 mm FOV, 1 acquisition). The T2 values
were measured from the liver (four areas),
spleen (one area), subcutaneous fat (one area)
and muscle (one area) using the ROI method.
After 17 months, the T2 measurements of the
liver and brain of Patients 2 and 3 were repeated
and the livers of these patients were biopsied on
the following day. Patient 1 was examined three
times; before the start of D penicillamine as well
as 10 months and 21 months after the start of the
treatment.
A two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyse
the significance of the difference between the
mean values of the T2 of white matter, putamen,
thalamus and globus pallidus and between the
mean values of the ratios of N-acetylaspartate/
choline (NAA/Cho), NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr for the
left and right side of the brain of patients and
control subjects. The same test was applied to the
T2 values of the liver, spleen, muscle and fat. The
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
replication was applied to the T2 values for four
regions of the liver.

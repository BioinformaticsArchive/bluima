MATERIALS AND METHODS
Psychophysics. The method for behavioral investigation has been de-scribed previously (Nieder and Wagner, 1999). Briefly, a barn owl was
trained using a two-alternative choice paradigm to discriminate depth
stimuli displayed on a computer monitor by pecking on one of two keys.
Presentation of stereoscopic stimuli is described below.
In the baseline task, square-sized (7 × 7°), binocularly correlated RDS
(c-RDS) with eighteen different disparity values (nine positive and nine
negative disparities) were presented on a random-dot background (0°
disparity) that covered the entire monitor. Nine different disparity values
for the near (crossed) and far (uncrossed) stimulus configuration were
chosen to ensure that the owl generalized depth information into the
categories “near” versus “far” rather that discriminating defined disparity values. For each stimulus presentation, the dot pattern of the static
RDS (with identical stimulus features as used for physiology) was newly
randomized to avoid local discrimination cues. Baseline stimuli were
displayed in pseudorandom order with a probability of p = 0.5 for both
the near (negative disparity) and far (positive disparity) configurations.
Errors were followed by correction trials. For the well trained bird, the
rate of reward was reduced to 85% to habituate the bird to the occasional
absence of a reward after correct response to probe stimuli in transfer
tests.
In transfer tests, anticorrelated RDS (a-RDS) with a disparity of -0.3
and +0.3° were presented with a probability of p = 0.1. a-RDS were
identical to c-RDS except for the opposite contrast of the dot pattern in
one eye relative to the other. Independent of the owl's response, a-RDS
were randomly rewarded at p = 0.5. No correction trials were applied for
a-RDS stimuli. Performance was evaluated using a binomial test based
on 50 observations for each stimulus.
Electrophyisological recordings. The method for single-unit recordings
in behaving barn owls has been described previously (Nieder and Wagner, 1999, 2000). Owls were perched in front of a computer monitor and
were trained to perform a visual fixation task. Gaze orientation was
detected automatically by means of an infrared photoelectric device in
combination with a reflective foil attached to the birds head. A trial was
interrupted whenever the birds made head movements larger than 61.5°.
During the training, owls learned to avoid head movements while fixating, which was monitored by observing the gaze and eyes under infrared
illumination. Eye movements were not measured because they are virtually absent in owls (Steinbach and Money, 1973; Pettigrew and Konishi,
1976). In addition, tuning curves were analyzed to confirm that data were
not contaminated by vergence (Nieder and Wagner, 2000).
Microdrives supplied with one or two tungsten microelectrodes (10
MV; Frederick Haer Co., Bowdoinham, ME) were chronically implanted
under general anesthesia to record from the hyperstriatum accessorium
of the visual Wulst (Pettigrew, 1979). A custom-built miniature frequency modulation stereo radio transmitter (Nieder, 2000) attached to
the skull transmitted neuronal activity. After filtering and amplification,
the waveforms of the signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 32 kHz
and stored to disk using a personal computer-based recording system
(Discovery; DataWave Technologies, Minneapolis, MN). Preliminary
cluster cutting was performed on-line, and definitive single-unit isolation
was repeated off-line. C are and treatment of the owls were in accordance
with the guidelines for animal experimentation as approved by the
Regierungspr ̈asidium Ko ̈ln (Germany).
Visual stimulation. Visual stimulation was performed by means of a
Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, CA) workstation. After receptive
fields had been determined, graphics were switched to stereo mode with
a spatial resolution of 1280 × 496 pixels and a refresh rate of 120 Hz (60
frames per second for each eye). Stereoscopic presentation was accomplished using a liquid crystal polarizer (model SGS17S; NuVision, Beaverton, OR) placed in front of the display. The polarizer allowed alternate transmission of images to the left and right eye with opposite light
polarization in synchrony with the refresh rate of the monitor. Interocular cross talk was 11%. Owls wore glasses filtering polarized light to allow
the passage of the image of the right eye to the right eye but blocking it
for the left eye and vice versa.
Static RDS covering the entire screen of the monitor (except the
fixation target) were flashed for 500 msec on a gray background. All

inexperienced male rats showed impaired sexual behaviour
(based on frequency of mount, intromission, ejaculation)
compared with mock-injected male rats. Both male and
females neonates born from dams that had been orally fed
with ethinyl E2 had significantly increased granulin
expression compared with same gender neonates whose
mother had been treated with vehicle. Thus, testicular
androgens stimulate granulin expression after aromatization
to oestrogens.
The relative contribution of ovarian steroids to the
complete development of the female brain is still controversial (Carrer & Cambiasso, 2002). Studies in animals
showed that ovarian hormones exert powerful effects on
brain function (summarized in Smith et al., 2002, 2003). In
birds, ovarian oestrogens act early during development to
demasculinize or feminize neural circuits involved in
copulatory behaviour (Schlinger et al., 2001). The sexually
dimorphic neural song system of songbirds develops in
males, but not in females, because the amount of E2
synthesized de novo from cholesterol, as opposed to aromatization of gonadal-derived androgens, is greater in the male
brain compared with the female brain (Holloway & Clayton,
2001). Oestradiol increases neuron excitability by increasing
the activity of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. In contrast, upon metabolization to
the neuroactive compounds termed neurosteroids, progesterone binds to the a-subunit of the c-aminobutyric acid
(GABAA) receptor increasing its activity in response to
GABA binding in a fashion analogous to the action of
benzodiazepine sedatives and anxiolytics, thus resulting in
reduced neuronal excitability.
As summarized recently by Dolci et al. (2003), knock-out
(KO) mice have shown that the oestrogen signalling plays a
role on sexual behaviour. Compared with wild-type females,
oestrogen receptor-a (ERa) KO female mice do not show
lordosis behaviour, whereas ERb female KO mice show a
prolonged lordosis behaviour. Compared with wild-type
males, ERa KO male mice perform fewer copulatory
intromissions and do not ejaculate. The masculine behaviour
is abrogated in the double knock-out male mice (ERa/ERb
KO). However, data in human males born congenitally
deficient in oestrogens (because of either oestrogen resistance
or aromatase deficiency) have normal sexual function (libido,
erection, ejaculation), normal gender identity and normal
psychosexual orientation (Smith et al., 1994; Morishima
et al., 1995; Carani et al., 1997, 1999, 2005; Rochira et al.,
2003). However, spermatogenesis is reduced.
Interestingly, an isoform dualism similar to the aforementioned ERa and ERb exists for the isoforms a1 and b of
the thyroid hormone receptor (TRa1 and TRb) (Dolci
et al., 2003). Indeed, ablation of TRa1 in TRa1 KO female
mice causes a reduced lordosis, while the opposite occurs in
TRb KO female mice. Oxytocin positive nerve cells in the
paraventricular nuclei are reduced in TRa1 KO female mice
but increased in TRb KO female mice.

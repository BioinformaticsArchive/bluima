Fig. 7. Summary diagram to illustrate the subsynaptic localization of
GABAA and GABAB receptors relative to symmetric and asymmetric
synaptic contacts on dendrites of STN neurons in the monkey. See
Discussion for details.

drites ( 1.0 m) presented a significantly (KruskalWallis 51.6, P 0.0001) higher level of intracellular labeling
than small- and medium-sized dendrites (Fig. 2G).

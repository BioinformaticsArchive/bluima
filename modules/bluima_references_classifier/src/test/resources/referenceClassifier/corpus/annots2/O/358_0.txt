ABSTRACT Located along the ventral midline of the neural tube, the floor plate (FP) performs
an essential role in central nervous system development, especially in the patterning of the ventral
region of the neural tube and axonal guidance. Several studies have been directed to the identification of molecules mediating some of the functions of the FP. Most of the models proposed for floor
plate actions involve contact-mediated- and/or gradients of diffusible-signals acting throughout the
nervous tissue. This report presents and discusses findings showing that the FP cells secrete a novel
compound, which is recognized by antisera raised against secretory products of the subcommissural
organ (SCO). This immunoreactive compound appears to be very similar to one of the glycoproteins
secreted by the SCO. This immunoreactivity is expressed transiently during central nervous system
development, and its rostro-caudal extension along the anterior-posterior axis of the FP displays
some species variations. However, a constant feature in all species investigated is that this
immunoreactive compound is highly expressed in the FP located in the mesencephalic-metencephalic boundary. The distribution of this compound is compatible with basal and apical pathways
of release from FP cells. The former might participate in the formation of some brain commissures.
The latter might involve the use of the cerebrospinal fluid as a route for performing actions on
distant targets, a pathway somehow disregarded by most models accounting for morphogen actions.

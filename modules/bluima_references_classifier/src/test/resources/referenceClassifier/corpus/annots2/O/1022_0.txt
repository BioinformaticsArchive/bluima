Figure 4. Experiments to determine if attenuation of I, by c-UFA and
PE are produced by PKC activation. Top, The attenuation of I, produced by PE in both granule and Purkinje cells is not produced by
application of an inert PE (la-PDB) and is blocked by coapplication of
RO-31-8220 (RO), a PKC inhibitor. Application of PE and c-UFA
together did not produce an additive effect on I, attenuation in either
cell type. Bottom, Attenuation of I, produced in Purkinje cells by a c-UFA is not produced by an inert c-UFA, OAME, and is blocked by
coapplication of RO-31-8220 (RO). Each bar represents the mean -C
SD of six separate observations.

host factors for in vitro mRNA synthesis of VSV. Recently, a
reconstituted VSV transcription system was created using ge-nome RNA encapsidated with nucleocapsid protein (N) and
recombinant L and P proteins (58). In those studies, it was
revealed that phosphorylation of P protein with cellular casein
kinase II (59) and the association of L protein with protein
synthesis elongation factor EF-1 (60) are essential for mRNA
synthesis of VSV, and these host factors are packaged within
the viral particles. Therefore, to elucidate precise functions of
the host factors for transcription of SeV, it is important to
develop a transcription system reconstituted with highly purified viral proteins and host factors.
Identification of a host factor as PGK will be helpful for
understanding not only the regulatory mechanisms of SeV
RNA synthesis but also the precise replication site of SeV in the
cell. Since PGK is abundant and ubiquitous in cytoplasm of
eukaryotic cells, its usage as a transcription factor seems to be
feasible for the cytoplasmic replication of SeV. It is important
to note that PGK was also identified as a subunit of primer
recognition proteins, which are cofactors of DNA polymerase Î±
and may have a role in lagging strand DNA replication in
nuclei (61, 62). These observations including the involvement of
PGK in cellular DNA replication and in viral transcription
have suggested that PGK may contribute to regulation of multiple cellular as well as viral processes in addition to glycolysis.
In this regard, a detailed study along the precise function of
PGK and other host factors for SeV multiplication should lead
to better understanding of host-virus interaction processes.
Bacterially expressed recombinant PGK will make it possible
to map the domain(s) of PGK required for the SeV transcription
through site-directed mutational analysis. Experiments are in
progress to address the significance of these interactions by
delineating the role of PGK and BS20 in SeV transcription
using a reconstituted RNA synthesizing system.

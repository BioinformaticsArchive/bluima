EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Animals—All animal experiments were performed in compliance
with the institutional guidelines for Animal Experiments of RIKEN and
Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. The procedures
involving animals and their care conformed to the international guidelines set out in Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (National Institutes of Health publication no. 85–23, revised 1985). APP transgenic mice with a heterozygous neprilysin-deficient background
(NEP / APP ) were produced by cross-breeding APP23 mice, which
overexpress human-type APP carrying double mutations (K670N/
M671L) (32), and homozygous neprilysin-deficient mice (NEP / ) (33).
NEP / APP and NEP / APP littermates were produced by breeding NEP / APP and NEP / APP mice. All mice were on the same
genetic background (C57BL/6J). In all experiments mice were analyzed
at the age of 13–16 weeks. They were housed in plastic cages, received
food (CE2, Clea Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and water ad libitum, and
were maintained on a 12/12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 09:00, off at
21:00).
Western Blotting—The cerebral hemispheres were homogenized in 3
volumes (w/v) of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM
NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Diagnostics)
supplemented with 0.7 g/ml pepstatin A (Peptide Institute, Osaka,
Japan). The homogenates were centrifuged at 200,000 g and 4 °C for
20 min using an Optima TL ultracentrifuge and a TLA100.4 rotor
(Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The clear supernatants were used for analyzing levels of secreted forms of APP (sAPP). The pellet (membrane fraction) was suspended with the above buffer and used for analyzing levels
of murine and human full-length APPs. Protein concentrations were
determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). We separated equivalent amounts of protein of the membrane or supernatant fraction in
each lane by 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred them electrophoretically to polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes (HybondTM-P, Amersham Biosciences). To detect fulllength APP, sAPP (N-terminal fragments) and C-terminal fragments of
APP (CTF- , - , and - / ), we probed the blots with 22C11 (0.2 g/ml;
Chemicon, Temecula, CA), 6E10 (1.0 g/ml; Signet Laboratories, Inc.,
Dedham, MA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide
CISEVNL, the 5 C-terminal amino acids of APP Swedish ( NL; 1.0
g/ml), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal of APP
(A8717, Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). An immunoreactive
band on the membrane was visualized with an ECLplus kit (Amersham
Biosciences), and the band intensity was determined with a densitometer, LAS3000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) using Science Lab 97
Image Gauge software (Version 3.0.1; Fuji Photo Film). Immunoreactive
protein content in each sample was calculated based on a standard curve

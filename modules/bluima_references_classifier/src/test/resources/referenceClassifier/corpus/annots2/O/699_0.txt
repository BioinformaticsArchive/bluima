6C). The selective 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazocin
(Bylund et al., 1994; 1 M) was without significant effect
against dopamine (11.4 5.4% inhibition, n 11; Fig. 6D),
as was the non-selective -adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (Bylund et al., 1994; 10 M; 9.7 17.8% inhibition,
n 3; Fig. 6E). Ritanserin (1, 10 M), the 5-HT2 receptor
antagonist (Baxter et al., 1995), reduced the dopamine
excitation by a mean of 43.6 9.7% (n 19), which was
also significant at P 0.05, even though in 6/19 cells the
dopamine excitation was reduced by 10%.

Fig. 2. Regional distribution of PDE7B mRNA in rat brain. Film autoradiograms from rat rostral to caudal sections are presented, showing the
hybridization pattern obtained with the 33P-labeled rPDE7B/2 oligonucleotide. Note the intense hybridization signal observed in the olfactory tubercle
(Tu), caudate-putamen (CPu), CA1 field and dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, and some thalamic nuclei. Scale bar 2 mm.

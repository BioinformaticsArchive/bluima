as in the brain. Astrocytes and oligodendroglia in the
tract and ependymal cells in the central canal were also
reactive. In peripheral nerves, immunoreactivity of ganglion cells was strong and of two types. Instead of the
glial cells seen in the central nervous system, Schwann
cells and mantle cells were immunoreactive. Immunoreactivity of APP in rat sciatic nerve axons was demonstrated by Koo et al. using anti-APP polyclonal antibody
against fusion protein (anti-Fd-PreA4) 1°. They showed
that precursor of amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease
undergoes fast anterograde axonal transport. The intense
immunoreactivity of the spinal ganglion in our study was
consistent with their hypothesis that ganglion neurons
were the source of APP in peripheral nerves. They also
detected immunoreactivity by immunoblotting in nerves
which had undergone Wallerian degeneration due to
transection, and speculated on the existence of APP
derived from a non-neural source. From our study
Schwann cells are suggested. However, immunoreactivity
of axons with W63N was stronger than that with W61C
in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This
difference was not recognized in perikarya. One possibility for this discrepancy may be the existence of
secreted formsTM within neuronal processes.
Though the function of APP remains unclear, broad
distribution of APP mRNA H and the high degree of
conservation in amino sequence 17"23 suggest that this
protein may be involved in a basic biological process. The
mRNA of APP695 is only abundant in the brain, and that
of APP751 and APPT70 is abundant in all tissues except the
brain. There may be a difference in the function between
APP with and without Kunitz type protease inhibitor
domain6. In the brain APP has been suggested to be
related to cell-to-cell contact ~7 and that APP may be a
neuronal trophic factor15. APP with a protease inhibitor
is assumed to play a role in cellular differentiation in
sperm development ~9. On the other hand, reactive
astrocytes expressed APP following neuronal damage by
theinjectionofkainicacid2°.ThisglialexpressionofAPP
during pathological states and following abnormal processing may result in the accumulation of fl/A4 protein.
Our study showed the wide distribution of mouse APP
at the protein level throughout the nervous system.
Investigation into the change of APP in aging and
neuronal damage may therefore provide insight into the
formation of brain amyloid.

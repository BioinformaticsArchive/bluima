which enduring synaptic depression did occur when the pathway
was primed by a previous high-frequency stimulation (HFS) (Li
et al., 1998). In the present study, we show the first evidence that
LTD occurs in the na ̈ıve amygdala slices that is homosynaptic and
pathway-specific. We further investigate the mechanisms underlying the induction and expression of LTD.

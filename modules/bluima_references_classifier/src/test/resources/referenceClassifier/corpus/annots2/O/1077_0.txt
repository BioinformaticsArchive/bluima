while the Marmoset was transferred into a stereotaxic frame on top of
a heating device (37 C). A laminectomy was performed at the
thoracic segment 8 using a dental drill, the dura mater was opened, and
lidocaine gel was applied onto the spinal cord to avoid movements
during the transection. A partial hemisection mainly targeting the
lateral funiculus with the CST was performed using a microblade. The
back muscles and skin were then sutured in layers.

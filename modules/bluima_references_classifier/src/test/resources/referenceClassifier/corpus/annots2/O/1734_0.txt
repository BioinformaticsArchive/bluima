Abstract—A common method for identifying collateral projections is to inject different retrograde tracers into two targets and examine labeled cells for the presence of both
tracers. Double-labeled cells are considered to have collateral projections to the two injection sites. This method is
widely considered to underestimate the extent of collaterals.
To test the efficiency of double-labeling, we mixed equal
volumes of two tracers, injected them into one site in a
guinea-pig brain, and counted the resulting labeled cells.
Ideally, the tracers would have precisely overlapping injection sites and all labeled cells would contain both tracers.
We tested several combinations of tracers: 1) Fast Blue
and fluorescein dextran; 2) fluorescein dextran and FluoroGold; 3) fluorescein dextran and FluoroRuby; 4) FluoroGold
and green beads; 5) FluoroGold and red beads; 6) FluoroRuby and green beads; and, 7) green beads and red
beads. For each combination, a mixture was injected into the
left inferior colliculus. After 1 week to allow for transport,
labeled cells were counted in the right inferior colliculus and
the left temporal cortex. For each mixture, the results were
similar for the two areas. The percentage of cells that were
double-labeled varied from 0% to 100%, depending on tracer
combination. The highest efficiencies (>96%) were observed
with red beads and green beads or with FluoroRuby and
fluorescein dextran. The limited efficiency of other mixtures
could be accounted for only in part by incomplete overlap of
the two tracers at the injection site. The results indicate that
the specific combination of tracers used to search for collateral projections can greatly affect the findings. © 2007 IBRO.

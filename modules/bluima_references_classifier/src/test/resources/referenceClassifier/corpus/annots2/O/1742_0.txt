Fig. 1. (A) Changes in prodynorphin mRNA levels in the
hypothalamus of rats chronically treated (7 d) with saline
(CONTR; 2 mL/kg), morphine (MORPH; 10 mg/kg) or
tramadol (TRA; 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg). Values are prodynorphin/β-actin mRNAs optical density ratios expressed as
percentage of saline control (100%) for each tissue
(n = 6–10). * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs controls. (B) Northern
blot analysis of hybridization to prodynorphin and β-actin
mRNAs in the hypothalamus of rats subjected to treatment
is reported under the bars. A representative autoradiograph
from a single experiment is shown.

The mean age of infants at the time of the study was
4.63 months (corrected postnatal age, 4 months); 28
(52.83%) of 53 infants were premature, with 32.25 3.25
weeks mean gestation and a gestation range of 27 to 37
weeks. With auditory brainstem responses, 33 (62.26%)
infants presented normal results, whereas the others ex-hibited an abnormal outcome. Of these, 8 (15.09%) had
mild alterations, 8 (15.09%) moderate, and 4 (7.54%)
severe alterations. The outcome with auditory steady-state
responses revealed that only 17 (32.0%) were normal
whereas 36 (67.9%) infants had abnormal results. Alterations were bilateral in 27 (50.9%) infants and unilateral in
9 (16.9%) infants. Of the latter, four were on the left side
and five on the right side. Abnormalities were mild in 21
(39.6%) infants; moderate alterations were evident in 10
(18.9%), and 5 (9.4%) infants presented severe hearing
loss. The auditory steady-state responses of one patient
with moderate hearing loss in the left side are illustrated in
Figure 1.
When the auditory steady-state responses were compared with auditory brainstem responses (gold standard),
the outcome yielded 100% sensitivity, 51.51% specificity,
55.55% positive predictive value, and 100% negative
predictive value. All these data resulted with 37.74%
hearing loss prevalence in auditory brainstem responses.
Infants with mild hearing loss in auditory steady-state
responses exhibited alterations in one or two frequencies;
500 Hz was the most affected frequency in this subgroup,
60% on the left side and 70% on the right. On the contrary,
2000 Hz was the least affected frequency; only 10% on the
left side and 25% on the right side. The 1000-Hz frequency was also scarcely affected, being 15% on the right
side and 30% on the left. The 4000-Hz frequency occupied
an intermediate position, with 15% on the right side and
35% on the left.
In the group with moderate hearing loss, all frequencies
were affected, but the alterations were only between 10 to
20 dB above normal threshold. In the group with severe
hearing loss, the threshold was 30 or more dB above
normal threshold and undetected frequencies ranged from
one to all of the aforementioned ones. The 500-Hz

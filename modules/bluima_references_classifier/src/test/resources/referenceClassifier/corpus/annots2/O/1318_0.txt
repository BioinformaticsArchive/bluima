and decreases anxiety levels (Binder et al., 2004). Here we show that
voluntarily exercise results in a significant decrease in the number of
P(Ser10)-H3+ neurons in the dentate gyrus (Fig. 2b), which is in line
with the reported stress-alleviating action of long-term voluntary
exercise (Droste et al., 2003; Lancel et al., 2003; Binder et al.,
2004).

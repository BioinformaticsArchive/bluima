in a markedly ataxic breathing pattern in unanaesthetized
animals, accompanied by abnormal arterial PJ and PCJ
(Gray et al. 2001). These studies argue strongly for a
necessary role of the preBotC in the generation of a normal
breathing rhythm. Other in vitro studies have demonstrated
that medullary slices including this region are sufficient for
the generation of a basic respiratory rhythm (Smith et al.
1991; Funk et al. 1993; Johnson et al. 2001).

The purpose of the present study was to examine
the cellular localization of the IFN-cR at the light and
electron microscopic level and relate its pattern of distribution to that of neuronal NOS (nNOS) as well as
certain receptors involved in eliciting nociception
(Coggeshall & Carlton, 1997), the substance P receptor
(NK1), and the amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor (ionotropic glutamate receptor). In addition, the possible contribution
of primary afferents and projections from supraspinal
regions to IFN-cR immunoreactive structures in the
superficial parts of the dorsal horn and the LSpN was
analyzed.

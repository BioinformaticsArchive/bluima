Figure 8. Comparison of responses to 3 and 7 d of whisker pairing after
standard cage rearing with responses in animals reared from weaning to
P90 in an enriched and social environment. Enriched rearing significantly
increased the responses of D2 barrel neurons after 3 d of whisker pairing
in PAE animals but did not induce surround whisker plasticity. D1 is the
intact whisker, and D3 is the cut whisker. Enriched rearing did produce a
significant ( p < 0.002) D1 (intact)/ D3 (cut) shift at 7 d in PAE animals,
when the standard reared animals showed no surround plasticity. Note
that in control animals the enriched rearing accelerated the peak increase
in the D2 whisker response from 7 to 3 d of whisker pairing.

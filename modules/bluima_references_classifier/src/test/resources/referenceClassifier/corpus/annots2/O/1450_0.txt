then conducted an experiment in which
WT–EGFP–NPs were grafted onto WT
slices (all from CD1 mice) that were in-jected with TNF –IFN- . First, we found
that endogenous CD11b /F4/80 microglia and macrophages were present at the
site of the inflammatory stimulus and displayed small round or spindle shapes (Fig.
8 A ,B D ,E ). Second, grafted EGFPexpressing cells migrated toward the site of
the inflammatory stimulus (Fig.
8 B ,C ,E , green). Third, no CD11b /F4/
80 macrophage cells colocalized with
EGFP cells (Fig. 8 E , merged image). This
indicates that EGFP-expressing cells ob-served at inflammatory sites were actually
transplanted EGFP–NPs that had mi-grated in response to inflammation and
not migrating macrophages that had taken
up fluorescent debris.
Activation of microglia and astrocytes
should be accompanied by upregulation of
chemokine synthesis. Indeed, we observed
a several fold increase in chemokine levels
[e.g., MCP-1, interferon- inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell ex-pressed and secreted), and KC (the mouse
growth-related oncogene GRO- ) and
also in levels of the cytokine interleukin-6
(IL-6), in slices treated with TNF- –
IFN- (Table 1). Similar increases were
observed with HIV-1– gp120, LPS, and

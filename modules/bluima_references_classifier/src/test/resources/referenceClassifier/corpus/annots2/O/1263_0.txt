Fig. 4. Electron micrographs showing asymmetric and symmetric synapses formed by peroxidase-labeled biotinylated dextran amine axon terminals (BDA-t)
originating from the paraventricular nucleus and gold-silver labeling (arrowheads) for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in dendrites (TH-D) in the locus coeruleus.
(A) A peroxidase-labeled BDA-t forms an asymmetric synapse (arrow) with a TH-D. (B) BDA-t forms a symmetric synapse (curved arrow) with a TH-D. TH-D
contains immunogold-silver labeling (arrowheads). dcv, dense core vesicle; m, mitochondrion.

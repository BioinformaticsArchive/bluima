Immunocytochemical characterization of
migrating neurons
We used immunocytochemistry in slices prepared from E15 and
E16 rats to characterize further the DiI-labeled cells that originate in the MGE. In these slices we found, in agreement with
previous reports (Van Eden et al., 1989; De Diego et al., 1994),
that GABA immunoreactivity is restricted for the most part in
the MZ, in the SP, and in the lower part of the I Z. Doublelabeling experiments showed that a number of the DiI-labeled
cells in the MZ and the IZ contained GABA (Fig. 4B,E).
Immunolabeling of slices for CR revealed staining of cells and
their processes in the MZ and the SP. However, despite extensive
search, none of the DiI-labeled cells were immunoreactive for this
calcium binding protein; these cells were seen intermixed with
CR-containing neurons in the MZ and I Z (Fig. 4 A).
Immunocytochemistry with an antibody against Lhx6 in slices
cut from E15 and E16 embryos showed labeling to be restricted in
three bands. These bands corresponded to the MZ, the SP, and
the lower I Z. A small number of labeled cells were also seen
scattered in the C P. Double-labeling experiments indicated that a
number of cells that had migrated from the MGE into the MZ
and IZ expressed this transcription factor (Fig. 4D,F). We also
examined the localization of the CR-50 antigen that is associated
specifically with Cajal-Retzius cells in the developing neocortex
(Ogawa et al., 1995). We found that this antigen is expressed
extensively in the MZ of the neocortex in the cultured slices,
including cells that originated in the MGE as indicated by the
presence of DiI (Fig. 4C).

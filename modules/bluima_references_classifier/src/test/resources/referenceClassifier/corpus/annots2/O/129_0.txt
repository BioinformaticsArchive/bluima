lateral projections of AGRP in the forebrain were prominent and
closely paralleled the rostral and lateral POMC projections (Fig.
1). Within the same fields, POMC projections were more broadly
distributed. AGRP-immunoreactive fibers appeared to be thinner
and to have more varicosities than POMC fibers. AGRP terminals
were densely packed to form compact immunoreactive patches in
some forebrain regions, such as the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis, ventral division, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus,
the arcuate nucleus, the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the perifornical nucleus and lateral hypothalamus (Figs.
1, 2, 3Eâ€“H ). These findings of the distribution of AGRP immunoreactivity were consistent with the recent reports as described
in the mouse, diestrous rat, and fasted monkey (Broberger et al.,
1998; Haskell-L uevano et al., 1999). In the caudal projections to
the brainstem and spinal cord, POMC innervation was much
heavier and broader than that of AGRP, as shown in Table 1.
AGRP was greatly reduced or absent from many POMC -

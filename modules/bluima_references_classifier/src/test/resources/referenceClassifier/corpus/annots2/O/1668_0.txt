GTP Hydrolysis Associated with Tubulin Assembly
The GTPase activity was detected by using the PiPer phosphate assay kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Briefly,
inorganic phosphate is combined with maltose to give glucose
1-phosphate and glucose. Then glucose oxidase converts glucose to gluconolactone and H O . Finally horseradish peroxi-22
dase converts Amplex Red to Resorufin in the presence of
hydrogen peroxide. Resorufin can be detected by measuring the
increase in fluorescence or absorbance of the solution. Tubulin
was polymerized at 37 Â°C in the conditions indicated above,

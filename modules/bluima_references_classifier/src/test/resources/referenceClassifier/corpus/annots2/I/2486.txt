in kittens, hypoxia produces episodes of depressed respiration during NREM sleep and wakefulness that are
reserved during REM sleep (2).
REM sleep apneas were rare in these studies. An
analysis of 8 h of REM records from the present animals
showed that the duration of apneas totaled only 88 s or
less than 0.3% of the time. There were 19 apneas averaging 4.98 s in duration. This is mentioned because in
human studies reports of apnea during REM sleep are
common (10) and might give the erroneous impression
that apneas constituted a major unacknowledged feature
of breathing during REM sleep in the present study.
In conclusion, the association between the activity of
respiratory neurons and the incidence of PGO waves is
evidence that respiratory activity in REM sleep covaries
with nonrespiratory REM activity. There is no evidence
that PGO activity causes the increase in respiratory
activity. This covariance of functionally unrelated systerns (the PGO waves were recorded in a part of the
visual system!) indicates that breathing in REM sleep
involves physiological relationships that are unknown in
conventional respiration physiology, and it is the basis
for the assertion that the respiratory activity of the
medulla in REM sleep derives in part from processes
peculiar to that state. The entity common to the density
of PGO waves and covarying respiratory activity is the
state of REM sleep. Variations in inspiratory and expiratory medullary activity during REM sleep, resulting at
times in the culminant irregularities of breathing in that
state, are part of an organized waxing and waning of
central nervous activity. To complete this explanation,
the central source of the respiratory influences must be
identified. This involves no less than the elucidation of
the neural basis of REM sleep.

MR scan in 2004–2005. Complete demographic and clinical
data was available for 30 of the 31 subjects who received
three evaluations and scans. At time of the 1997–1999 evaluation, 28 of the 30 subjects were diagnosed as cognitively normal and two were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI). In the period between the 1997–1999 and 2005 evaluations, seven subjects converted to dementia, 10 converted to
MCI, and 11 remained normal. None of the 30 subjects had
a history of stroke prior to the 1997–1999 visit or incident
stroke between the 1997–1999 and 2005 evaluations. Infarcts
were apparent on 8 of the 30 1997–1999 scans; however, no
additional infarcts were seen on 2002–2004 or 2005 scans.
A comparison of the 389 CHS Cognition Study subjects who
received at least the 1997–1999 clinical evaluation and MR
scan, and the 30 subjects with 3 evaluations, 3 MR scans,
and complete clinical data, is shown in Table 1, including the
results of two-sided t-tests for the numeric variables. All data
items were measured during the 1997–1999 visit. Mean age
and mean Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores were not
significantly different between the groups. However, mean
Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score was significantly higher in the group with three scans and evaluations,
and mean Hachinski ischemic scale and unified Parkinson
disease rating scale scores were significantly lower in the
group with three scans and evaluations.

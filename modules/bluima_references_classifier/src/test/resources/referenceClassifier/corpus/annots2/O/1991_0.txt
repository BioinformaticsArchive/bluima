Sensory-Evoked Firing Rate of LC Neurons

Figure 2 shows the sensory-evoked firing rate of LC neurons
in adult and young rats in response to administration of
PAR in different doses; these results parallel the findings
shown in Figure 1 for spontaneous firing rate. The findings
are similar to those shown in Figure 1. Again, effects
in adult rats are shown in the left half of the figure.
PAR administration to adult rats produced, in relation to
vehicle, only significant decreases in sensory-evoked firing
rate; when significant decreases were not seen, smaller
decreases or no effect on sensory-evoked firing was
observed. Regarding statistical analysis, a one-way ANOVA
performed at each duration of drug administration revealed
a statistically significant effect of group (ie, dose of drug)
for durations of 2 (F(4, 245) = 10.8, p<0.001), 4
(F(4, 245) = 20.7, p<0.001), 8 (F(4, 245) = 28.3, p<0.001),
and 14 (F(4, 245) = 32.5, p<0.001) days. Subsequent comparisons at each duration of administration of each dose to
the vehicle condition (by Dunnett's test) indicated that
sensory-evoked firing rates were significantly decreased
with doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day at 2 days, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day
at 4 days, and 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day at 8 and 14 days of
PAR administration.
Effects seen in young rats are shown in the right half of
Figure 2. Again, in contrast to what was seen in adult rats,
relative to vehicle, significant increases in sensory-evoked
firing rate of LC neurons were seen with administration of
lower doses of PAR (ie, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day) for the

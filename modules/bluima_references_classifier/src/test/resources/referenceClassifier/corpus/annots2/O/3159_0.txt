An intrathecal injection of colchicine (Sigma; 100 μg in
10 μl saline) was given to transected and sham-operated rats
24 h before perfusion in order to block axoplasmic transport. At 10 days after spinal surgery, animals were perfused
transcardially under deep sodium pentobarbital anesthesia
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buVer (pH 7.4). The L and L
45
segments of the spinal cord were removed, postfixed in the
same fixative overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose in
phosphate-buVered saline for one to three days for cryoprotection. Tissue sections (30 μm) were cut with a cryostat
at "20)C and processed for immunocytochemistry. Sections were treated with 0.75% Triton X-100 and non-specific
staining was blocked with 3% normal goat serum. Sections
were successively incubated in the dynorphin specific primary antiserum (1:5000) as described,24 or enkephalin
specific primary antiserum (1:12,000; Immuno Nuclear
Corp., Stillwater, MN), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antiserum (Vector Labs Inc., Burlingame, CA), and
avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex
(Vector Labs Inc.). The reaction product was developed in
0.05% 3,3*-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma)
containing 0.01% H O in 0.1 M phosphate buVer. Sections
22
were mounted on slides, cleared and coverslipped.
Camera lucida composit plots were done on three 30-μm
sections from the L lumbar segment of the dorsal horn,

marking the dynorphin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons.
Stereological methods were not used.

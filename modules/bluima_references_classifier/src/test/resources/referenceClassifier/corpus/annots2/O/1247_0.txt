ORN target neurons in the olfactory
bulb die after excitotoxic lesion
A number of studies have highlighted the
inter-relationship between afferent ORN
stimulation, olfactory learning, and the
regulation of apoptosis and neurogenesis
in both the OE and the OB (Cummings et
al., 1997; Rochefort et al., 2002; Carleton
et al., 2003). Despite its usefulness in stimulating widespread ORN degeneration
and subsequent regeneration, the olfactory bulbectomy is not just a target deprivation but also an axotomy and, therefore,
has limited usefulness in examining the
initiation of synaptic apoptosis. To investigate whether postsynaptic target neurons in the olfactory bulb may directly regulate ORN survival signaling at the
glomerular synapse of mature ORNs, we
took advantage of the fact that ORNs use
an NMDA receptor-containing synapse.
The ORN postsynaptic targets (mitral and
tufted cells) contain combinations of both
NMDA and metabotropic glutamate re-ceptors (Ennis et al., 1998; Montague and
Greer, 1999; Salin et al., 2001) and are
therefore susceptible to undergo excitotoxic cell death at high levels of stimulation. We first used immunocytochemistry
and reverse transcription-PCR for the
NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor to
rule out expression of NMDA receptors
on ORNs themselves (data not shown).
When NMDA was infused unilaterally
into the olfactory bulb, TUNEL detection
of apoptotic nuclei indicated that, as early
as 24 h after NMDA administration, many
mitral and tufted cells in the lesioned ol-factory bulb had been stimulated to un-dergo apoptosis (Fig. 3 A, B). NeuN staining revealed that neuronal populations
within the unlesioned olfactory bulb
maintained their concentric layered structure, whereas neuronal layering was disrupted by NMDA infusion already at 24 h
(Fig. 3 E, F ). By 4 d after lesion, TUNEL
positivity appeared restricted primarily to
the granule and periglomerular cell layers,
and NeuN immunohistochemistry re-vealed that many different olfactory bulb
neurons had been lost by this time (Fig.
3G,H ). Holes were apparent where mitral
cell bodies had died (Fig. 3 D, H ), and
sampling every eighth section through the
olfactory bulb revealed that 89 â€“95% of
mitral cells were lost by 4 d after NMDA
lesion, with the lower percentages at the
most rostral and caudal tips of the bulb.
Twenty-four hours after NMDA treatment, there was no corresponding in-crease in TUNEL-positive ORNs in the OE
projecting to the NMDA-lesioned bulb
(Fig. 3 I, J ). However, at 4 d, there were

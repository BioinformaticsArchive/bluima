This inhibition could either take the form of desensitizing cells to all sensory inputs or switching their
coding priorities away from detecting cues from
males to some other social or non-social object
that the female is highly motivated to seek out. We
have previously shown evidence that such switching
of coding priorities can occur in the zona incerta of
sheep where cells which normally respond preferentially to the sight of foods when the animal is
hungry will switch to respond to the sight of salt
when it has an appetite for salt.37 Similarly in the
olfactory system, many mitral cells in the olfactory
bulb respond to the smell of food and none to lamb
odours prior to an animal giving birth but after
birth many cells respond to lamb odours and fewer

antiserum at dilutions of 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, and
1:128.
Tissue culture cell lines including human embryonic kidney and WI-38 were infected with the following viruses: coxsackievirus type B5, echovirus type
4, adenovirus (untyped), and varicella-zoster. These
cells were then harvested and affixed to microscope
slides for testing with the HSV antiserum (1:64) plus
conjugate (1:40). None of the infected cells showed
any fluorescence. Absorbed antiserum was stored in
0.2-ml volumes at -20 C.
The conjugate, rabbit antiserum to guinea pig 7S
gamma globulin, was obtained from Hyland Laboratories (lot no. 2130X001A1). Before use, it was ab-sorbed with WI-38 cells in the following manner.
Tube cultures of WI-38 cells were washed with PBS
and all the fluid was removed. A volume of 0.2 ml of
conjugate was added to each washed tube. Each tube
was shaken at 37 C for 2 h and then allowed to
refrigerate overnight. The conjugate was then centrifuged lightly to remove any free cells. The conjugate was then diluted in a 1:200 dilution of rhodamine in PBS. Noninfected tissue cultures including
WI-38 and human embryonic kidney were harvested
and affixed to slides. These cells were then tested
with the conjugate, and no fluorescence was seen at
a dilution of 1:20 or greater. Only minimal nonspecific fluorescence was seen at 1:5 or 1:10 dilutions of
the conjugate. To determine the appropriate dilutions in PBS of antiserum and conjugate for testing
of specimens, grid titrations were performed using
cover slip preparations of WI-38 cells that had been
infected with a type 1 strain of HSV. The highest
dilutions of the antiserum (1:64) and conjugate (1:40)
that gave a 4 + apple green fluorescence, which was
readily distinguishable from the nonspecific fluorescence seen at the lower dilutions, were the dilutions
chosen for the testing of clinical specimens. Normal
guinea pig serum that lacked complement-fixing
and neutralizing antibody against HSV was used
along with the conjugate in the same manner as the
HSV antiserum as a further determination of any
nonspecific fluorescence, since this normal serum
was used as a control for each clinical specimen
tested.
IFA testing. Slides for IFA tests were placed in a
tray lined with wet paper towels. Each specimen
was covered with antiserum. The tray was then
covered with foil and placed in an incubator at 37 C
for 30 min. Specimens were washed three times for
10 min each with PBS (pH 7.4), followed by one
quick wash with distilled water. The slides were airdried, and the specimens were covered with conjugate diluted 1:40 in a 1:200 dilution of rhodamine in
PBS. The slides were incubated for 30 min, and the
washing procedure was repeated. After air drying,
the slides were covered with buffered glycerol and
examined for fluorescence. Control slides were prepared with each set of specimens, using normal
guinea pig serum that lacked complement-fixing
and neutralizing antibody against HSV.
All slides were examined for fluorescence, em-ploying a Leitz Ortholux microscope with a Ploem
illuminator, by at least two of us, and one of us (FB)
examined the slides without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis.

The K -stimulated release of [3H]GABA was determined as the
amount of radioactivity above baseline value expected in the peak
fraction following application of the K challenge. Baseline values
were calculated by extrapolation of the amount of radioactivity
released during the period immediately preceding each K stimulus (Rowell et al., 1987). The ratio of the second stimulus (S2) to
the drug-free first stimulus (S1) was used to assess the effects of
drugs or other treatments present during the second stimulus.
Statistical analyses were calculated using Instat software
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with
means S.E.M. indicated. Statistically significant differences were
reported at P 0.05 with Student's t-test between groups and
one-way analysis of variance among groups with Neuman-Keuls
posthoc analysis.

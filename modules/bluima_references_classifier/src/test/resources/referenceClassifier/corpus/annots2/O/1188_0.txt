Operation. The tumor mass was exposed
following a left parietal craniotomy. It was situated in
the superficial layers of the parietal lobe, occupying
a 2.5 cm2-area of the precentral gyrus. The tumor was
encapsulated, well demarcated and had the
appearance of an abscess. The abscess was drained
with a brain needle and 10 ml of pus was aspirated.

Transport of Tacrine in LLC-PK1 Cells in the Presence of
Organic Cations. In a preliminary study, the amount of tacrine
transported to the receiving compartment was approximately 10% that
of the donor compartment throughout the study. In addition, the
temporal profile of substrate accumulation in the receiving compartment was proportional to the time of incubation. Collectively, these
observations indicate that a sink condition was reasonably maintained
in the LLC-PK1 cell study. Since it was indicated that the expression
of OCT2 in LLC-PK1 cells is on the basal side (Sweet et al., 2000),
tacrine transport from the basal side to the apical side of the cell
monolayer was examined. The transport of tacrine (1 M) was inhibited by the addition of choline (500 M, 23% inhibition after 30-min
transport), MPP (500 M, 54% inhibition after 30-min transport), and
TEA (500 M, 43% inhibition after 30-min transport) (Fig. 5), suggesting that the tacrine transport system shares a common transport
mechanism with choline, MPP, and TEA. This observation is consistent with the inhibition of the uptake of these organic cations in the
presence of tacrine in MBEC4 cells (Fig. 3).
Since the subcellular localization of OCTN2 was reported to be
the brush border membrane of placental epithelial cells (Lahjouji et
al., 2004), apical to basal transport of tacrine (1 M) was examined
for potential involvement of OCTN2 in the transport in LLC-PK1
cells. The addition of carnitine at the concentration of 500 M led
to a diminishment in the apical to basal transport (20% reduction;
Fig. 5) of tacrine, consistent with the inhibition of the uptake of
carnitine in the presence of tacrine in MBEC4 cells (Fig. 3).
Therefore, these observations indicate that the transport of carni-

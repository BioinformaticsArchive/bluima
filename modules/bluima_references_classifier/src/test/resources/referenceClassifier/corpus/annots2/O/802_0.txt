ity, and limited capacity. Scatchard analysis of the
binding data gives a linear plot in the range of
0.025â€“1.4 nM [125I]-VIP, suggesting binding to a single
class of binding sites with high affinity (K = 0.23 nM)
d

and low capacity (the maximum number of binding
sites ~20 fmol/mg protein). The calculated affinity
of [125I]-VIP for its receptor binding sites in the chick
cerebrum is in agreement with a low nanomolar
range of affinity of this radioligand reported for
receptors in other tissues, including hen hypothalamus (preoptic area and median eminence; Gonzales et al., 1995), chick pineal gland (Meunier et al.,
1991), and chick liver (Pineau et al., 2001). On the
other hand, the maximum number of binding sites
labeled by [125I]-VIP in chick cerebral cortex is
markedly lower than those reported for chick pineal
gland (98 fmol/mg protein; Meunier et al., 1991)
and hen preoptic area and median eminence
(167 fmol/mg protein and 133 fmol/mg protein,
respectively; Gonzales et al., 1995), and higher than
that found in chick liver (5 fmol/mg protein; Pineau
et al., 2001), an observation possibly reflecting a difference in the receptor density among different tissues. Based on an autoradiographic analysis, a highly

Fig. 2. Western analysis of cannabinoid-induced changes in the expression of MRG1 and GK proteins in rat brain. A, Western blots show MRG1,
GK, and actin immunoreactivity after treatment with vehicle (V), R( )-WIN 55,212-2 (Win), or 9THC (THC). B, bar graphs show the relative
optical density of the MRG1 and GK bands under each treatment condition. Values were normalized to the optical density of the actin band and
were expressed as a percentage of optical density in vehicle-treated mice.
Data shown are means S.D. from three experiments.

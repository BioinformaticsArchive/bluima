In this study, sciatic nerve ligation resulted in the
development of long-lasting mechanical hyperalgesia that
could be temporarily suppressed by systemic administration of the NMDA open channel blocker MK-801 28–34
days after nerve ligation. The elimination half life of
MK-801 after systemic administration in the rat has been
reported to be 1.65 h w8x, and it has been previously
reported that an equivalent dosage regimen to that used in
this study produces motor and behavioural deficits lasting
a maximum of 5 h w32x. Therefore, it is unlikely that the
suppression of hyperalgesia observed in this study 24 h
following the final dose of MK-801 reflects non-specific
motor impairment or sedation.
This reversible attenuation of hyperalgesia compares
favourably with the relief of thermal hyperalgesia reported
following systemic administration of the NMDA channel
blocker dextromethorphan at day 7 after CCI w33x. Furthermore, both MK-801 w38x and dextromethorphan w33x have
been reported to temporarily suppress hyperalgesia after
intrathecal administration on day 7 or 11 after surgery in
the CCI model. Together, these data suggest that once
established, hyperalgesia in the CCI model is maintained,
at least until the 35 day time point, by mechanisms involving NMDA receptor activation at a spinal level.
As in the accompanying paper w23x, both CCI and sham
operation resulted in complex patterns of Fos expression in
laminae 3–4 and 5–10 of the lumbar enlargement of the
spinal cord. Several previous studies w5,6,16,21,22x have
similarly documented that nerve injury is associated with
the long term expression of Fos within the spinal cord both
ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of injury. However,
this and the accompanying study w23x are the first in which
a highly significant correlation between Fos expression
and behaviour has been demonstrated using the CCI model
of neuropathic pain.
Sham operation also induced quantitatively similar ex-pression of Fos in equivalent laminae of the spinal cord. In
these animals, no such correlation was evident as sham
operated animals did not develop hyperalgesia. In the
absence of nerve injury, chronic inflammation may induce
morphologically similar patterns of persisting Fos expression within the spinal cord w1x and we have previously

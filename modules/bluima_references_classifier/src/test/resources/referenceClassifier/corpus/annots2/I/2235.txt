causeany dendritic GARchannelswould have
experienced a similar voltage. In addition, the
theoretical voltage distribution along the
equivalent dendritic cable becomesvery close
to the steady-state voltage distribution within
0.5 passivemembrane time constants following a somatic voltage step (e.g., within 5 ms
for a typical Betz cell) ascalculated using Betz
cell passive parameters in Eqs. 4.39-4.42 of
Ref. 37. This latter calculation suggeststhat
the measuredtime constantsof GARactivation
reflect channel properties predominantly
rather than passivechargeredistribution in the
dendritic tree.

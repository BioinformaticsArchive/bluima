appears that the binding site of TRPV1 for anandamide
faces the intracellular side of the membrane (De Petrocellis et al., 2001). Co-expression and dual action of CB1
and TRPV1 have been reported in primary sensory
neurons of rat (Ahluwalia et al., 2000, 2003). Thus,
endocannabinoids act at both metabotropic (CB1) and
ionotropic receptors (TRPV1) in the nervous system,
a symmetry consistent with many other transmitter
systems. CB1 receptors and CB1-mediated effects
have been reported for goldfish cones and bipolar
cells (Yazulla et al., 2000; Fan et al., 2003). In addition,
goldfish cones also show 3H-anandamide uptake and
degradation by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
(Glaser et al., 2002). Thus, it seemed possible that
anandamide could activate the extracellular binding
site of the metabotropic CB1 receptor, and following membrane transport, activate the intracellular
binding site of the ionotropic TRPV1 receptor before
being broken down by FAAH. In order to evaluate
the presence of such a complementary system, we
determined the distribution of TRPV1 antibody at
the electron-microscopical level in the goldfish retina.

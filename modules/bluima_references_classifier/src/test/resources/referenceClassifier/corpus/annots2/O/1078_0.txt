Figure 2. Synaptic plasticity outcome as a function of the resting membrane potential ( A),
the initial EPSP amplitude ( B), the level of postsynaptic depolarization ( C), the magnitude of
postsynaptic depolarization ( D), the change in input resistance (R ) ( E), and the age of the
in
animal from which the slices were obtained ( F). Crosshair symbols represent the ratio of average EPSP postpairing to prepairing amplitude responses (ordinate) and the value of the indicated parameter (abscissa) for each cell (n 110) subjected to pairing. The mean SD values
for the relative change in the EPSP peak amplitudes for the three plasticity outcome groups
plotted along the ordinate are 1.89 0.21 for the LTP group, 1.06 0.09 for the no change
group, and 0.61 0.09 for the LTD group. A, Resting membrane potential was calculated as a
mean voltage during 1 sec of recording (collected 5 sec after each 0.1 Hz afferent stimulation)
averaged for 30 consecutive interstimulus intervals within the period between the 5th and 10th
min of recording before pairing and for the 30 consecutive interstimulus intervals between the
25th and 30th min after pairing. The mean membrane potentials SD 69.8 3.1 mV
(LTP group; n 48; upward triangle), 68.6 3.2 mV (NC group; n 23; circle), and
70.0 3.1 mV (LTD group; n 39; downward triangle). No groups were significantly
different from the others ( p 0.1). B, Initial EPSP amplitudes were measured as a difference
between baseline and peak and averaged for 30 consecutive synaptic responses during the last
5 min of recording before pairing. The means SD for the initial EPSP amplitudes 9.0 1.3
mV (LTP group; n 48; upward triangle), 8.8 1.1 mV (no change group; n 23; circle), and
9.1 1.1 mV (LTD group; n 39; downward triangle). No groups were significantly different
from the others ( p 0.1). C, Level of depolarization was determined as a mean voltage of a
steady state achieved in each depolarizing pulse (usually the last 10 –15 msec of the pulse) and
averaged between all 60 responses of a given cell to pairings. The means SD for the level of
postsynaptic depolarization 7.8 6.0 mV (LTP group; n 48; upward triangle),
5.4 7.0 mV (no change group; n 23; circle), and 8.2 5.8 mV (LTD group; n 39;
downward triangle). No groups were significantly different from the others ( p 0.1). D,
Depolarization amplitude was calculated as a difference between the resting membrane potential and the depolarization level in each given cell. The means SD for the depolarization
amplitudes 60.8 5.4 mV (LTP group; n 48; upward triangle), 61.7 7.2 mV (no change
group; n 23; circle), and 60.2 5.6 mV (LTD group; n 39; downward triangle). No groups
were significantly different from the others ( p 0.1). E, The input resistance change was
calculated as the ratio of R 25–30 min after pairing over that during the 5 min period before
in
pairing. The calculation of each R value was obtained from Ohm's law based on the measurein
ment of the level of steady-state membrane hyperpolarization at the end of a 180 msec, 0.2
nA current pulse applied 1 sec after the afferent stimulus. The means SD for the R
in
changes 5.21 5.43% (LTP group; n 48; upward triangle), 4.51 5.13% (no
change group; n 23; circle), and 3.44 6.14% (LTD group; n 39; downward triangle). No
groups were significantly different from the others ( p 0.1). F, The animals' ages were expressed in
postnatal days (PND). The means SD for the animals' ages 8.46 1.88 d (LTP group; n 48;
upward triangle), 8.43 1.85 d (no change group; n 23; circle), and 8.23 1.84 d (LTD group;
n 39; downward triangle). No groups were significantly different from the others ( p 0.1).

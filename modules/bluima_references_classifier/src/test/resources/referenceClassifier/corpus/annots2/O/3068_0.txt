DISCUSSION

These results demonstrate that long-term (28 day) chronic nicotine administration
decreased MBH POMC mRNA concentrations in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, and
that this suppression persisted for at least 3 but less than 7 days following nicotine
removal. Since POMC is the biosynthetic precursor for bEND and other opiomelanocortins, this suggests that chronic nicotine suppressed forebrain opiomelanocortin
biosynthesis. This suppression of POMC gene expression is thus consistent with previous
evidence (Rosecrans et al., 1985) that 30 days of daily nicotine administration reduced
mouse hypothalamic bEND content, and that this reduction of bEND content persisted
for 1 but not 2 weeks following nicotine withdrawal.
Although our results suggest that chronic nicotine inhibited POMC gene expression and
thus, probably, biosynthesis of bEND and other opiomelanocortins, other evidence

activates Rac and Cdc42 to promote neurite outgrowth.
Wild-type RhoG is capable of inducing neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells independent of NGF stimulation
and enhances outgrowth in its presence in a Rac1- and
Cdc42-dependent manner. In support of this, DN mu-tants of Rac1 and Cdc42 interfere with RhoG-induced
neurite outgrowth, CA RhoG elevates endogenous Rac1
and Cdc42 activities, and DN RhoG experiments show
that interfering with RhoG function suppresses outgrowth, including that induced by activated Ras (Katoh
et al. 2000). RhoG activity is further regulated by the
RhoGEF Trio, which contains two RhoGEF domains;
GEFD1, which activates Rac through RhoG; and GEFD2,
which activates RhoA. Human Trio induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a GEFD1-dependent manner
through RhoG (Estrach et al. 2002), indicating that neurite outgrowth involves Trio/RhoG/Rac1-Cdc42 signaling. A recent study suggests that RhoG also interacts
with Elmo in a GTP-dependent manner and forms a ternary complex with Dock180 to activate Rac1. Coexpression of CA RhoG with Elmo and Dock180 promotes re-localization of Elmo and Dock180 from the cytosol to
the plasma membrane, and increases Dock180 and
Elmo-mediated activation of Rac1. In addition, DN
RhoG, and Dock180 and Elmo mutants, are all able to
prevent NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells
(Katoh and Negishi 2003). Another RhoG-interacting
protein, kinectin, is a regulator of microtubule-dependent kinesin activity. Kinectin selectively binds GTPbound RhoG, inhibition of RhoG activity leads to relocalization of both kinectin and RhoG from the cell pe-riphery to a perinuclear distribution, and changes in the
activity of both proteins influence microtubule transport
of lysosomes in nonneuronal cells (Vignal et al. 2001).
Thus kinectin's ability to link RhoG to microtubuledependent transport in cells may prove important for
neuronal differentiation. Together, these studies show
that RhoG acts downstream of Ras and Trio, and may act
in concert with Elmo and Dock180, to activate Rac and
Cdc42 in order to promote neurite formation. Furthermore, RhoG could potentially regulate microtubule-de-pendent transport necessary for the growth of neuronal
processes.
Rnd proteins, which include Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3
(also known as RhoE), are relatively new members of the
Rho family of GTPases that have low intrinsic GTPase
activity and are thought to be CA (Foster et al. 1996;
Guasch et al. 1998; Nobes et al. 1998). In general, Rnd1
and Rnd3 prevent stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (Guasch et al. 1998; Nobes et al. 1998), suggesting
that they function in part by antagonizing the RhoA signaling pathway. In line with this, Rnd1 causes the formation of numerous neurites that contain microtubules
but little filamentous actin and neurofilaments in PC12
cells, and the formation of these processes by Rnd1 is
inhibited by DN Rac1, suggesting that Rnd1 induces
Rac-dependent neurite formation by disrupting cortical
actin filaments (Aoki et al. 2000). More recent studies
provide direct evidence for Rnd inhibition of RhoA signaling in nonneuronal cells, where Rnd proteins regulate

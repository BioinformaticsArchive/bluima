Fig. 2. Immunohistochemical staining for ChAT in comparable regions of the horizontal nucleus of the
diagonal band and substantia innominata in (A, B) young adult (six months) and (C, D) aged (30 months)
rats. Note that there are fewer neurons stained in the aged rat, that the neurons are smaller in size, and
that some neurons are more lightly stained. Scale bars = 180 μm (A, C); 15 μm (B, D).

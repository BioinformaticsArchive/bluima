To determine the impact of forebrain-specific GlyT1 disruption on
GlyT1 and NMDAR protein expression, crude synaptosomal
membranes derived from two behaviorally naive 8 week old male
mutant and two control mice per experiment were re-suspended at
a protein concentration of about 2 mg/ml, supplemented with an
equal volume of 125 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.002%
Bromphenol Blue, 10% -mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS and incubated for 15 min at 60 °C. Aliquots with increasing protein content
(2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 g) were subjected to SDS-PAGE
using 7.5% mini-gels (Mini protean II, Bio-Rad) and resolved
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a
trans Blot Mini Cell (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The blots were
blocked for 1–2 h in TBST (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 0.15 M NaCl,
0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk at room temperature, followed by incubation with affinity-purified GlyT1 antiserum
(1:1000) (Gabernet et al., 2005) together with a monoclonal antibody directed against the NMDA-NR1 subunit (1:1000, Affinty
BioReagents, Rockford, IL, USA) and a monoclonal antibody di-rected against -actin (1:40,000, Chemicon International, Zug,
Switzerland) overnight at 4 °C in TBST/5% blocker. The blots were
washed once with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 60 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA,
0.4% SDS, 0.4% Triton-X 100, 0.4% deoxycholate and three times
with TBST. Incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies was carried out for 1 h at room temperature.
Following extensive washing immunoreactivity was detected by
the enhanced chemoluminescence method (Super Signal West
Pico chemoluminescence, Pierce, Lausanne, Switzerland). Im-ages were captured using a Fuji Film LAS-1000 Plus Gel Documentation System, and immunoreactive bands were quantified
with the AIDA software (Version 3.25, Raytest, Pforzheim, Germany). Actin immunoreactivity was used to monitor equal sample
loading.

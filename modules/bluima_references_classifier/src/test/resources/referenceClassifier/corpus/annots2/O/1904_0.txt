SNI. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane. The sciatic
nerve and its three terminal branches, the sural, common peroneal and tibial nerves, were exposed at low-thigh level. The common peroneal and tibial nerves were tightly ligated with 6 – 0 silk.
The nerve distal to the ligature was sectioned and 2– 4 mm of the
nerve stump was removed. Great care was taken to avoid any
contact with or stretching of the intact sural nerve. For suppressing
spontaneous afferent activity in injured sciatic nerve, both severed
nerve branches and the more proximal area before the sciatic
nerve divides were completely and evenly covered with 200 mg
bupivacaine OH powder immediately after the sciatic nerve was
injured. This procedure has previously been demonstrated to
reduce transmission of sensory signals for 3 4 days (Xie et al.,
2005). In experiments to control for possible systemic effects of
the bupivacaine OH powder, the same procedure was used to
make the SNI model, but the bupivacaine OH powder was deposited between the gluteus superficialis and biceps femoris muscles,
which are located at the right lateral surface of the rat hind leg, and
have no contact with the sciatic nerve.
SNL. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane. An incision was
made on the back between L2 and S1. The L4 spinal nerve was
exposed and tightly ligated with 6 – 0 silk and cut about 5 mm distal
to the ligature. L4 was chosen for ligation instead of L5 because it
was anatomically more accessible for local perfusion. An osmotic
pump filled with tetrodotoxin (TTX, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (250
g/ml, flow rate: 1 l/h for 7 days) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(ACSF, vehicle) was implanted to perfuse the axotomized DRG

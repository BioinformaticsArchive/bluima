Myelination in disorders of ketogenesis

Knowledge of cerebral KB metabolism is relevant for inborn errors of KB metabolism
and for use of the ketogenic diet. Given the importance of KBs as substrates for
myelination, one might expect disorders of ketogenesis to be associated with cerebral
white-matter abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging has, indeed, shown diffuse
mildly increased signal in the white matter of patients with HMG-CoA lyase (EC
4.1.3.4) deficiency (McKusick 246450) (van der Knaap et al 1998). Superimposed
on this are foci of more abnormal signal (Ozand et al 1991; van der Knaap et al
1998). In most cases, multiple lesions have been present, varying in size from a
few millimetres to large confluent areas; as well as in the cerebral hemispheres, they
have been reported in the internal capsule and brainstem but not in the corpus
callosum or cerebellar white matter. Despite the imaging abnormalities, most patients
have had no neurological problems and normal or slightly below average intelligence.
The findings would be compatible with hypomyelination, caused by the lack of KB.

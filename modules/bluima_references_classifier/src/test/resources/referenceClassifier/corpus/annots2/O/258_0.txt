and DEN-2 virus-challenged mice. At day 5 after challenge,
prM- and E-specific CD8 T cells (1 of 30 CD8 T cells; 2.2 Ã— 105
per spleen) were readily detected in the spleens of these mice
(Fig. 5). We found no responses after stimulation of the spleen
cells with A20 cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant
expressing the DEN-2 virus NS3 protein (Fig. 5). The DEN-2
virus NS3 protein was not encoded by the chimeric YF/DEN
virus used for immunization, and potential NS3-specific re-sponses after the challenge would therefore represent primary
responses. Thus, the absence of DEN-2 virus NS3-specific re-sponses after the challenge suggests that the vaccine-primed
(secondary) prM- and E-specific T-cell response was dominant. This experiment (i.e., using the vaccinia virus recombinant expressing NS3) also serves as a control for the prM and

Fig. 3. Photomicrographs of brain coronal sections (10 mm) showing the effect of (B) d-dendrotoxin (35 pmol) 24 hr after injection into the
CA1 hippocampal area in a rat bearing a monolateral surgical lesion of the Schaffer collaterals (Bagetta et al. 1994a for details) ipsilateral
to the side of toxin injection (T). Note the lack of bilateral pyramidal cell loss typically observed in the CA1 area 24 hr after d-dendrotoxin
injection (see panel B to fig. 1 for comparison). Note in (A, T) that per se the monolateral surgical lesion of the Schaffer collaterals does
not cause any apparent damage or cell loss in the hippocampus of a control rat (Bagetta et al. 1994a).

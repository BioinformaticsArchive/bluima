Fig. 1. Effects of leptin and CCK on 30-min Ensure intake. A:
mean 6 SE intake in response to individual or combined leptin (10 μg
icv) and CCK (1 nmol/kg ip) administration compared with control.
LEP, leptin; VEH, saline vehicle. * P < 0.05 vs. VEH/VEH baseline
condition. § P < 0.05 vs. CCK/VEH condition. B: mean 6 SE percent
intake suppression in response to 1 nmol/kg peripheral CCK with 0,
3.5, or 10 μg leptin administered into 3rd cerebral ventricle. * P <
0.01 vs. 0 leptin dose condition. § P < 0.05 vs. CCK + 3.5 μg leptin
condition.

Numerical data were expressed as mean S.E.M. Statistical tests
were performed on an IBM-compatible personal computer using
SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA, USA).
EC50 (concentration producing 50% maximal depolarization) was
calculated for each neuron using the KaleidaGraph curve-fitting
program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA) on a Macintosh
computer. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the equation y ax/(x b) where y is the magnitude of drug effect, a is the
maximum drug effect, x is the concentration of the drug and b is
the EC50. Data from all neurons were then averaged to yield a
mean EC50. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures and t-test
were used to test statistical significance. Differences were considered significant when P 0.05.

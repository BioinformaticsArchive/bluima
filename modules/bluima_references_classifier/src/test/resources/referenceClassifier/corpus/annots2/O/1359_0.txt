One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test of k-values obtained from
VTA slices (F2,54 = 11.68, p < 0.001) showed ***p < 0.001 difference
from wild-type and p < 0.05 difference from SERT-KO. One-way
ANOVA of k-values obtained from SNc slices (F2,47 = 22.93, p < 0.01)
showed **p < 0.01 difference from wild type and §p < 0.001 difference
from DAT-KO. One-way ANOVA of k-values obtained from SNr slices
(F2,71 = 10.43, p < 0.001) shows ***p < 0.001 difference from wild
type and ¶p < 0.05 difference from DAT-KO. All other comparisons
showed no significant difference (p > 0.05).

case.
SNr recordings (Figs 8a–c) were affected by monoamine
transporter deletions whereby significant differences were
seen between wild-type and SERT-KO k-values, and between

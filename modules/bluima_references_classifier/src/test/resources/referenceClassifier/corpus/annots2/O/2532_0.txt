Fig. 1. Influence of intracisternal (ic) injection of a vehicle control
(Veh), rat pancreatic polypeptide (rPP), the thyrotropin-releasing
hormone (TRH) analogue RX-77368, or bovine PP (bPP) on %gastric
emptying. Data are means + SE; doses listed at bottom are in
picomoles. The highest dose of rPP (256 pmol) caused 72 + 6% of the
test meal to be emptied in 20 min, which was significantly greater than
controls (P < 0.05). An injection of an equal dose of RX-77368 (256
pmol) caused 75 + 4% of the meal to empty. This result was significant
compared with control animals (P < 0.05); however, the amount of
emptying following the TRH analogue was not different from rPP at
an equal dose. Rats treated with bPP at either dose demonstrated
emptying responses that were not different compared with controls.

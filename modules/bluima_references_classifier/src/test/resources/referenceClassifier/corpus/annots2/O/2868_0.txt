Behavioral results
Comparable spontaneous orienting and habituation were evident
in all groups of rats (Fig. 6). The primary data of interest in this
experiment are shown in Figure 7a. The occurrence of conditioned orienting to the light differed for the unpaired group and
the group with symmetrical CN/ST lidocaine treatment (Mann–
Whitney U test, p < 0.05). In contrast, the rats with asymmetrical
CN/ST lidocaine did not differ from the unpaired group during
the sessions of training under lidocaine treatment. Note, however,
that conditioned orienting was evident in rats with asymmetrical
CN/ST treatment when lidocaine infusion was terminated (Friedman test, χ 2(1) $ 7.36, p < 0.01 comparing block 5 with block 4)
but did not increase further with subsequent training (Friedman
test, χ 2(2) = 0.17, not significant), indicating that dorsal striatum
is essential for the expression of the conditioned orienting re-sponse. These results further support the conclusion of experiment 1 that conditioned orienting depends on an amygdalonigrostriatal pathway. Also in agreement with the results of
experiment 1, inactivation did not affect the development of
another conditioned response that was concurrently monitored.
Whereas unpaired presentations of the CS and US did not support the development of conditioned food-cup responses (Friedman test, χ 2(6) = 3.48, not significant), this conditioned behavior
emerged equivalently in the groups that received paired CS/ US
trials (Friedman test, χ 2(6) $ 48.3, p < 0.01; see Figure 7b),
regardless of lidocaine treatment.
The results of this experiment are consistent with the interpretation that the dorsolateral striatum is essential for the expression
of the conditioned orienting response. During inactivation sessions, the occurrence of this behavior in the ASYM-paired group
did not differ from the unpaired group. The results also indicate

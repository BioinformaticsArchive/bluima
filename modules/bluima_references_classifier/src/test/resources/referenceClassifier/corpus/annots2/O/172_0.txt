MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adeno-associated viral vectors, production, and purification
EGFP-N1 (C lontech, C ambridge, UK) and 97Q-GFP constructs were
cloned into the multiple cloning site of the AAV vector including the
AAV-145 bp inverted terminal repeats flanking the cytomegalovirus
immediate early enhancer and promoter, a multiple cloning site, and
β-globin poly-adenylation signal (Snyder et al., 1997). PolyQ-GFP constructs were made by PCR amplification of CAG tracts and accompanying poly proline sequences from H D exon 1 encoding 13Q or 97Q and
fusing these in frame onto the eGFP open reading frame. An arginine
residue at position 42 of the long 97Q tract has recently been characterized. However, the remaining contiguous 41Q and 55Q tracts are within
the range of known pathogenic tracts.
Recombinant AAV vectors were produced by a modified transient
plasmid transfection protocol of the recombinant AAV plasmid along
with the helper plasmid pAAV/Ad into human 293 (hk293) cells on 150
mm tissue culture dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) (Zhou et al., 1994).
Seven hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh
IMDM (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with adenovirus deletion mutant 312. Sixty-six hours after infection, cells were harvested, lysed, and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by two rounds of cesium chloride equilibrium density gradients.
Positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH
7.4, and heat-treated at 56°C for 60 min to destroy residual adenoviruses.
Titer and the absence of contaminating adenoviruses were determined by
infection of hk293 cells and observing GFP fluorescence and cytopathic
effects.

aberrant growth and the creation of new
synapses by mossy fibers that has been
observed in patients with TLE, is another
consequence of seizures produced by
kainic acid administration in mature an-imals. Following kainate-induced status
epilepticus in adult rats, new mossy fiber
collaterals can be found in two regions,
CA3 [Ben-Ari and Represa, 1990;
Represa and Ben-Ari, 1992] and the su-pragranular layer of the dentate gyrus, the
region containing the dendrite of the
dentate granule cells [Babb et al., 1988;
Sutula et al., 1988]. In humans, only su-pragranular sprouting has been detected
in hippocampi removed from epileptic
patients [Sutula et al., 1989]. This discussion will focus on results pertaining to
supragranular sprouting and not CA3
sprouting. The creation of mossy fiber to
granule cells synapses can create a path
whereby the granule cell output recurrently innervates the granule cells and
causes feedback excitation. These synaptic rearrangements, however, are not
clearly responsible for epileptogenesis.
Blocking mossy fiber sprouting with cy-cloheximide, a general inhibitor of protein synthesis, did not prevent the longterm development of recurrent seizures
following systemic or intrahippocampal
kainate administration [Longo and
Mello, 1997; Longo and Mello, 1998].
Fifteen-day-old rats appear to be
resistant to synaptic changes induced by
kainic acid or lithium-pilocarpine seizures [Sperber et al., 1991b] despite the
fact that seizures are more severe than
those in mature animals [Sperber et al.,
1991a]. In the extreme case of immature
animals exposed to 15 daily generalized
convulsions for 15 days, it has been possible to induce mossy fiber sprouting as
early as days 1 to 15 of life [Holmes et al.,
1999]. The mechanism of the resistance
of the immature brain to seizures is un-known, but Holmes and McCabe [1999]
hypothesized that mossy fiber sprouting
and synaptogenesis requires mature
mossy fiber innervation defined by the
presence of an adult pattern of mossy
fiber innervation and adult levels of
GAP-43 expression. This hypothesis is
consistent with evidence from Ribak and
Navetta [1994] that the adult pattern of
mossy fiber innervation is reached be-tween days 21 and 25 of life and with
evidence that GAP-43 expression reaches
adult levels by day 25 of life [Holmes and
McCabe, 1999]. Holmes et al. [1999]
have presented evidence, however, that
the normal adult mossy fiber pattern is
present by day 10 of life; when mossy
fiber sprouting is not seen. Thus, the
mechanism of resistance against seizure-

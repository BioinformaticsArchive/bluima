Another factor influencing the local fluid balance is cellular
swelling at sites of activity. Astrocytes make contact with both
blood vessels and neurons and play a role in providing
metabolites to neurons and in maintaining the extracellular
concentration of glutamate.19-21 As a result, these cells have
been shown to play an important role in effective neuronal
signaling.22,23 When glutamate is released from vesicles in the
axon terminal and travels across the synaptic cleft to trigger the
depolarization of the adjoining neuron, the remaining glutamate
is rapidly absorbed by astrocytes by means of high-affinity
sodium-dependent transporters.22 When glutamate is actively
taken up by astrocytes, each molecule is accompanied by 3
Na+ and 1 H+ transported into the cell and 1 K+ transported
out. This ionic exchange is also accompanied by water
co-transport into the cells.22 In addition, astrocytes have been
shown to be depolarized during neuronal activity as a result
of potassium uptake in proportion to the number of active
neurons in the vicinity and the frequency at which they fire.20
The flux of potassium across the astrocyte plasma membrane
is coupled with water transport via specific channels known
as aquaporins (specifically Aqp4).24 These channels exist
throughout the brain but are concentrated in the membranes
of astrocyte end-feet, which face blood vessels. There is
strong evidence that these end-feet promote the exchange of
water between the brain and blood or CSF. As a result of these
effects, the extracellular/intracellular volume ratio has been
shown to change significantly in isolated tissue samples of rat
spinal cord tissue during and following neuronal
stimulation.25,26

riedo et al., 1996). NO and superoxide combine by a
diffusion-limited reaction to form the much stronger and
more toxic oxidant peroxynitrite (PN) (Colye et al., 1993;
Raff et al., 1993; Urushitani et al., 1998). PN stimulates
apoptosis of PC12 cells and cortical neurons in culture
(Este ́vez et al., 1995; Troy et al., 1996) and is a substrate
for superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes the ni-tration of tyrosines on other proteins (Ischiropoulos et al.,
1992). SOD-catalyzed tyrosine nitration has been suggested to be important in contributing to neuronal injury
in ALS (Beckman et al., 1993; Abe et al., 1995). Thus,
excitotoxic and oxidative stress may be related to each
other in the mechanism of neuronal death. The apoptotic
role of each toxic species such as glutamate, NO or PN in
rat spinal neuron death, however, has not been fully
studied.
Although it is difficult to measure PN in tissues or
organs owing to its short half-life, nitrotyrosine (NT), a
reaction product of PN and tyrosine, can be readily measured and is considered to be a marker for PN-induced
tissue damage (Vilet et al., 1994). Members of ICE

ration. However, when a similar long hyperpolarization pe-riod was applied to cells that were not exposed to ZD 7288
(Fig. lOB), no change in Ih amplitude was observed, indicating that prolonged hyperpolarization per se did not activate
any further inward current or indeed inactivate &.
For comparison, the effect of hyperpolarization on the
blocking action of 5 mM external Cs+ ions on Ih was also
tested (Fig. 1OC). From a holding potential of about -60
mV the cell was stepped to about - 100 mV and held at this
potential for 2 min during Ih block by Cs+ . No change in
inward holding current was seen, in contrast with the gradual
increase in inward current observed during blockade of Ih

Introduction
Seasonal plasticity of the brain has been demonstrated in every
class of vertebrate, but only in species that breed at high latitudes
(Nottebohm, 1981; Tramontin and Brenowitz, 2000). This plasticity mediates the expression of seasonally appropriate behaviors
(Tramontin and Brenowitz, 2000) and is highly synchronous
both within and among populations as a result of the ubiquitous
nature of photoperiod, the primary initial predictive environmental cue for breeding in these high-latitude species (Wingfield
and Kenagy, 1991). The majority of vertebrate species, however,
live at tropical latitudes (up to 80% of passerine bird species)
(Stutchbury and Morton, 2001) and therefore experience little
seasonal change in day length. Breeding in these tropical animals
is often seasonal and associated with annual patterns of temperature, rainfall, and/or food availability (Wikelski et al., 2000,
2003; Hau, 2001; Stutchbury and Morton, 2001). Such environmental cues can show pronounced variability in occurrence over
even short geographic distances in the tropics (Bendix and
Rafiqpoor, 2001). No studies have described seasonal plasticity in

neurons, Purkinje cells, and the choroid plexus. As seen in Fig.
6, A.1 and A.2, anti LR7/8B antibody produces a distinct punctate signal close to the cell membrane in large neurons of the
brain stem and Purkinje cells, which is compatible with the
staining of endocytic vesicles. Significantly, the signal obtained
with anti-LRP antibody in the same area of the brain stem as
seen in Fig. 6A.1 is clearly different from that obtained with
anti-LR7/8B. It outlines the cell membrane of the neurons
without exhibiting a punctate staining within the cells (Fig.
6B.1). Most significantly, areas surrounding the cell bodies of
the neurons (arrows) exhibit prominent staining. RAP however, which is an ER-resident protein and interacts with both
receptors (12, 27), is expressed in all neurons and their dendrites (Fig. 6C.1).
As mentioned above, anti-LR7/8B antibody also stains dendrites extending from the Purkinje cells into the stratum mo-leculare of the cerebellum (Fig. 6A.2). In sharp contrast to RAP
(Fig. 6C.2), which is expressed throughout the dendritic trees of
the Purkinje cells, expression of LR7/8B seems to be restricted
to the proximal part of the dendrites. The molecular layer and
the granular layer do not show any significant expression of
LR7/8B. Again, the anti-LRP antibody produces a completely
different pattern in the cerebellum (Fig. 6B.2). Expression of
LRP within the Purkinje cells is much weaker than that of
LR7/8B and RAP. The most intense staining with anti-LRP
antibody can be seen in distinct areas of the granular layer. As
evidenced by the nuclear staining with hematoxylin, these
areas correspond to cerebellar glomeruli, acellular spaces
within the granular layer, which is densely packed with small
neurons (granule cells). Within glomeruli, these cells form complex synaptic contacts with the bulbous expansions of afferent
fibers. Together with the intense staining surrounding large
neurons, this pattern suggests that LRP is strongly expressed
in synaptic regions of the brain.
Finally, we have studied the expression of LR7/8B, LRP, and
RAP in the choroid plexus. As seen in Fig. 6A.3, expression of
LR7/8B is restricted to the apical side of the epithelial cells. In
sharp contrast, LRP is also found on the baso-lateral side of
these cells (Fig. 6B.3), whereas RAP is uniformly distributed in
the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (Fig. 6C.3).
To confirm the neuronal and dendritic staining seen in the
cytohistochemical studies with anti-LR7/8B, we cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons (26) and stained these cells
with anti-LR7/8B. Neurons cultured for 18 days, which are
characterized by fully developed dendrites, show an intense
staining of the cell body and dendrites (Fig. 7A). Obviously, the
signal elicited by the antibody extends to the very ends of the
dendrites without loosing intensity, suggesting a uniform ex-pression of the receptor over the whole length of the outgrowing
dendrites. This staining is specific, because control experiments without the first antibody completely abolished the signal (Fig. 7B). LR7/8B is already expressed to a similar extent in
the cell body and outgrowing dendrites at day 11 when dendrites become first visible (data not shown). Double immunostaining of these cells with anti-LR7/8B and anti-MAP 2, a
dendritic marker (28), in conjunction with confocal microscopy
revealed that both proteins are indeed colocalized in dendrites
(Fig. 7C). Moreover, accentuation of immunoreactivity on the
surface of dendrites (Fig. 7A) indicates expression on the cell
surface.
Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel Î±2M re-ceptor with a distinct expression pattern different from that of
LRP.

The LMP-1 strains were investigated by PCR-Southern Blot analysis using primers and specific biotinylated
probes for the C-terminus LMP-1 gene as previously
reported [Vasef et al., 1995]. Briefly, the reaction was
performed as follows: after initial denaturation for 5 min
a 94°C, 40 cycles were performed, 94°C for 1 min, 59°C
for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min with a final extension at 72°C
for 7 min.
Southern Blotting of LMP-1 PCR products was
performed as previously described [Correa et al., 2004].

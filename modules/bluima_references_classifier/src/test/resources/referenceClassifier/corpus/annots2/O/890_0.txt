In the present study, electrical activation of the DPAG
evoked decreases in TI and TE. GABAA-mediated inhibition of
LPBN neurons markedly attenuated DPAG-evoked changes in
respiratory timing. Bilateral blockade of glutamatergic input to
the LPBN also attenuated DPAG-evoked responses, but the
magnitude of the reduction was less. These findings are the first
to demonstrate that the LPBN is an important relay in mediating DPAG-evoked changes in respiration. Furthermore, our
results suggest that descending input from the DPAG involved
in modulating respiratory timing is mediated in part through
activation of glutamate receptors in the LPBN. However, the
site of breath timing control in the medullary respiratory neural
circuit onto which the LPBN mediates DPAG-evoked changes
in respiratory timing changes remains unknown.
Effect of DPAG stimulation on cardiorespiratory response.
In the present investigation, electrical stimulation was chosen
over chemical stimulation as the preferred method for DPAG
activation on the basis of the consistency of the response over
time. Indeed, when the effects of DPAG stimulation were
tested over the course of 1 h (aCSF-microinjected animals),
there was remarkably little degradation of the evoked response.
The use of electrical stimulation also affords precise identification of stimulus onset and offset times, which facilitates

host strains or in animals with various immune deficiencies, testing immune-stimulatory or proinflammatory
approaches has been difficult.
Using the CNS-1 glioma model we tested the gene
therapy efficacy of a cytokine, i.e., hsFlt3L, which exerts a
powerful differentiation factor for monocyte-derived cells
to become DCs. The brain, in its naive or unstimulated
state, is believed to be naive of bona fide DCs although
some reports have detected DCs in the inflamed brain [17].
Also, the brain contains a large number of local tissue
macrophages called microglial cells that are downregulated in the normal brain, but can be activated by various
stimuli. We hypothesized that hsFlt3L would have a
proinflammatory and/or immune-stimulatory effect that
could induce the elimination of brain gliomas. RAdhsFlt3L
was indeed effective in inducing brain inflammation and

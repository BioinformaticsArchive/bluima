Figure I (Box 2). Schematics of six possible fMRI responses across three conditions (C0,C1,C2) within two regions (R1,R2) to illustrate the notion of a `qualitative difference'
in brain activity. C1 and C2 are conditions of interest, C0 is some form of baseline. The y-axis represents level of fMRI activity. (a) shows a situation where C1 is reliably
greater than C0 in Region R1 but not in R2, whereas C2 is reliably greater than C0 in Region R2 but not in R1; a common result when thresholding statistical tests performed
independently for each voxel. The pattern of reliability is reflected in the different error bars, which represent the estimation error in the contrast of C1 and C2 relative to C0:
large error bars are the cause of `null results' for C2–C0 in R1 and C1–C0 in R2. (b) shows a reliable interaction between conditions C1 and C2 and regions R1 and R2 (indicated
by the asterix), which overcomes the problem of null results. However, the inverse pattern across conditions C0 to C2 for the two regions could reflect a quantitative
difference across the conditions in a single cognitive process, which happens to activate R1 but deactivate R2. (c) shows another reliable interaction, but in this case R2 is
not differentially activated by any of the conditions, preventing a clear interpretation. These three panels therefore do not constitute qualitative differences. (d) and (e) do
constitute qualitative differences: both regions are differentially activated by at least one of the conditions, and show a crossover interaction with C1 and C2 (d), or a noncrossover interaction (e). Nonetheless, the patterns in (d) and (e) rely on equivalent mappings from neural to haemodynamic activity in regions R1 and R2 (otherwise
differences in the shape of this mapping could cause the haemodynamic differences despite no qualitative differences in neural activity). (f) shows a crossover interaction
between C1/C2 and R1/R2, plus a difference between C1/C2 compared with C0 that is in the same direction (Cve) for R1 and R2. This pattern of association plus dissociation
overcomes any differences in the neural–haemodynamic mapping in the two regions (assuming only that the mapping is monotonic in both).

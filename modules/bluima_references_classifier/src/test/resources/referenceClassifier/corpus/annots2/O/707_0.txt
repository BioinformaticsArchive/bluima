nals with synaptic contacts onto Merkel cells. Osmiophilic
granules, of approximately 60 nm in diameter, are concentrated in the cytoplasm adjacent to the nerve terminals.
The tarsometatarsal and digital regions of the skin have
keratin scales. Below these scales, Merkel nerve endings,
twin groups (Fig. 14), as well as accumulations of up to 12
Merkel cells are found forming corpuscle-like structures in
the superficial layer of the dermis. Their appearance is

1960s, the existence of autonomic nerves supplying the
gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder that were neither
adrenergic nor cholinergic was proposed.18 32 33 98 In the
years that followed, strenuous efforts were made to identify
the transmitter in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves
supplying the gut and the urinary bladder. Perhaps surprisingly, the substance that most satisfied the criteria accepted
at that time for establishing a transmitter54 was ATP,34 and
the word `purinergic' was coined and purinergic transmission proposed.19
Implicit in the concept of purinergic transmission was
the existence of postjunctional receptors for ATP, although
there was considerable confusion in the literature about the
variable effects of adenosine nucleotides and nucleosides
on a wide variety of tissues.20 However, a step forward was
taken in 1978 when, from a detailed analysis of the literature
and some preliminary experiments, it was proposed21 that
purinoceptors could be subdivided into P1 (adenosine)
receptors, which were mediated by adenylate cyclase and
competitively antagonized by low concentrations of methylxanthines, and P2 receptors, which were activated preferentially by ATP and ADP. Two of the most important
implications of this purinoceptor subdivision were: (1) the

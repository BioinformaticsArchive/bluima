ventricle (1,2), and massive IVH. In the present case, the
migrating clot was small, similar in size to other reported
intraventricular migrants such as a calculus (3) or fragment of adipose tissue (4). Except for rare cases of
hemorrhage from a cyst (5) or tumor (6), IVH without
intracerebral hematoma originates from the choroid
plexus or other intraventricular vessels. The high-density
area seen in the left foramen of Monro indicates that the
bleeding occurred in the choroid plexus. In their review
of nontraumatic primary IVH, Angelopoulos et al. (7)
listed risk factors as hypertension, aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), coagulopathy, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Miyasaka et al. (8) reported that
among 24 AVM involving the choroid plexus, 11 were
plexiform AVM predominantly located in the lateral
ventricle; most of these patients presented with IVH.
Tamaki et al. (9) reported a vascular malformation of
the choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle, emphasizing
that such lesions should always be considered in cases of
primary IVH of unknown origin. Although neuroimaging
did not identify the bleeding source in the present cases,
occult AVM of the choroid plexus in the foramen of
Monro is most strongly suspected. The acute onset of
the headache, generally unusual in hydrocephalus, is
more characteristic for intracranial hemorrhage.
The remaining possibile etiology is minor head
trauma. However, LeRoux et al. (10) found IVH confined to the ventricles in only 2 of 43 cases of traumatic
IVH with the others being associated with superficial

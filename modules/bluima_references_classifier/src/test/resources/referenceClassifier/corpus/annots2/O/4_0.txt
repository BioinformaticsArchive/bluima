stimulation of basal adenylyl cyclase activity caused by the
opioid receptor agonist Leu-enk. The net stimulation elicited by 1 Î¼M Leu-enk was reduced by 48 6 4% in the
presence of QEHA peptide (opioid-stimulated enzyme ac-tivities, expressed as pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg protein 6
SEM, were: control 44.1 6 1.5, QEHA, 23.0 6 1.0, P <
0.01). Moreover, the peptide increased the EC50 of Leu-enk
from 65 6 6 to 183 6 11 nM (P < 0.01). At the
concentration used, the peptide failed to reduce either basal
adenylyl cyclase activity or the enzyme stimulation elicited
by 1-isoproterenol (Fig. 1).

Cells in this group were commonest in the middle
and medial portions of the marginal zone, and a few
were located in the lateral third (Fig. 1B). Perikarya
looked triangular in any viewing plane (Figs 5, 6)
though rather elongated rostrocaudally in longitudinal sections (Figs 5A-D, 6). Parasagittal and
coronal views showed that cell bodies were insinuated
in the white matter overlying lamina I (Fig. 5).
Usually one dorsally directed primary dendritic trunk
coursed within the overlying white matter (Fig. 5).
The remaining primary dendrites extended along
the lamina I dorsal border (Fig. 5). The dendritic
arbor had a predominant longitudinal orientation
(Figs 5A-D, 6) but also expanded sideways (Figs 5E,
F, 6). Dendritic measurements (Table 2) and vectorial
analysis (Fig. 7A) confirmed the preponderance of
the longitudinal spread over the mediolateral and
dorsoventral ones. As shown by the vectograms of
coronal and parasagittal sections (Fig. 7A), the
dorsoventral spread was mainly accounted for by
the dorsally directed interstitial dendrites. Distance
histograms displayed the highest numbers of intersections in the horizontal plane (Fig. 7B). Numbers
of intersections were high for a long distance imparting a broad configuration to the curve (Fig. 7B).
Some cells labelled with free HRP at C,-C, segments
had a presumable axonic process which became thick
distally (Fig. 6C, D). Group B cells represented
5-20% of the retrogradely labelled lamina 1 cells.
Seventy per cent occurred ipsilaterally to the injection
site.

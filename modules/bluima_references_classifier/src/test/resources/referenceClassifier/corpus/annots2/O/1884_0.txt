pre-OL injury
The pre-OL seems to be the main cellular target in the
diffuse component of PVL (figures 5 and 6). This
vulnerability of pre-OLs has been shown not only in
human PVL,19–21 but also in many excellent animal
models.8,20,165–168 Injury of pre-OLs consists of cell loss or
process loss (with intact soma).22 The cell loss mainly
relates to activation of calcium-permeable AMPA
receptors on the cell soma,71,169–179 and the process loss,
with intact soma, to activation of NMDA receptors on
pre-OL processes.8,124,180–183 The ultimate result of either
event would be a deficit of mature oligodendroglia, and a
consequential impairment of myelination, the hallmark
of PVL (figure 5).

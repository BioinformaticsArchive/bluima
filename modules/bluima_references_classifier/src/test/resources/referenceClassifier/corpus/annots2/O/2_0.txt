Previous research from our laboratory has shown that [ethanol
(EtOH)]exposureduringthebraingrowthspurtisdetrimentaltoolfactory bulb development. This study extends those findings by ex-amining the effects of EtOH, nicotine (NIC), and the combination of
thesedrugs(EtOH/NIC)onolfactorybulbmitralcellnumbers,aswell
as on various major neurotransmitterlevels in neonatal rats. An ar-tificial rearing paradigm was used in the present studies. These ar-tificiallyrearedpupsweregiven4g/kg/dayofEtOHandor6mg/kg/

acute neurochemistry study, in which the pups received treatment
on PD 9 only. An artificially reared gastrostomy control group (GC)
and a suckle control group were included. The mean total numbers
ofmitralcellsintheEtOHandNICgroupsweresignificantlyreduced
from that of the GC, as well as the volume of the left main olfactory
bulb. There was no differenceamong any of the groups in mitral cell
density.Asforneurochemistrydata,therewasnodifferenceinneurotransmitterlevelsamonganyofthegroupsintherepeatexposure
regimen. There were, however, changes after the acute exposure
(exposure on PD 9 only). Both serotonin and GABA levels were significantly increased only after NIC exposure. However, norepinephrine levels were significantly decreased after acute exposure in all
three drug treatment groups, compared with that of the control
group. Except for the GC control group, dopamine levels were not
detected consistently after acute exposure to EtOH, NIC, or EtOH/
NIC.Collectively,thesefindingsdemonstratethatexposuretoEtOH

capability of NIC to antagonize (protect) EtOH-induced mitral cell
loss in the developing olfactory bulb.

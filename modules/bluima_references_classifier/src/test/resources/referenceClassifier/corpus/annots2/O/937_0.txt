CaMKII probably downregulates this release, as inhibition
of this kinase elevated release activity (Fig. 5B). Thus, the
level of release activity would presumably depend on the
combined actions of these three kinases.
Cochlear damage and the ensuing hearing loss activate endogenous mechanisms that produce hyperexcitability of central auditory neurons, upregulation of excitatory
glutamatergic transmission in components of the ascending auditory pathway (Gerken, 1979; Willott and Lu,
1982; Salvi et al., 1992; Potashner et al., 1997; Kaltenbach
et al., 2000; Brozoski et al., 2002), and depression of
synaptic inhibition in the CN and the LSO (Salvi et al.,
1992; Boettcher and Salvi, 1993; Suneja et al., 1998a,b;
Potashner et al., 2000). These changes might contribute to
pathologic symptoms that accompany hearing loss, such as
misperception of sound intensity (Salvi et al., 1992; Boettcher and Salvi, 1993) and tinnitus (Jastreboff, 1990; Ax-elsson and Barrenas, 1992; Kaltenbach et al., 2000; Brozoski et al., 2002). The present findings imply that PKA
and CaMKII may contribute to some of these changes, as
cochlear ablation induced a PKA-dependent depression of
evoked glycinergic release in the DCN and a CaMKIIdependent elevation of evoked GABAergic release in the
MNTB.
Regulation of Unchanged Release. Some but
not necessarily all transmitter release that remained un-changed after UCA may be regulated by PKA and
CaMKII. Release activities that were regulated were
located in several of the SOC nuclei. Persistent changes
in evoked [14C]Gly release were not evident in the LSO
and the ipsilateral MSO 145 days after UCA (Suneja et
al., 1998b; Potashner et al., 2000). These apparently
normal levels of evoked release were sustained by PKA
and CaMKII, however, as they became depressed in the
presence of H-89 and KN-93, inhibitors of these ki-nases (Fig. 4B and 5B). These findings imply that after
UCA, evoked release activity would have been deficient were it not for endogenous regulatory mechanisms that act either through PKA or CaMKII to elevate glycinergic release in these nuclei and sustain the
release at levels comparable to those in unlesioned
animals. The common actions of the PKA and CaMKII
inhibitors are consistent with the possibility that the
two kinases act on a single locus. Several protein components of exocytosis, such as synapsin 1 and rabphilin,
can each be phosphorylated by both of these kinases
(Geppert and Sudhoff, 1998; Hilfiker et al., 1999;
Turner et al., 1999). Thus, phosphorylation of these
proteins is an attractive candidate mechanism that might
contribute to regulation of release after UCA.
In contrast, release activity with no apparent regulation by PKA or CaMKII appeared in the CN. Persistent
changes in evoked [14C]Gly release were not evident in
the PVCN and AVCN 145 days after UCA (Suneja et al.,
1998b; Potashner et al., 2000). In addition, PKA (Fig. 3)
and PKC (Zhang et al., 2003b) regulation in these nuclei
had failed at this time and CaMKII regulation was not
evident (Fig. 5A). Because regulation had been active in

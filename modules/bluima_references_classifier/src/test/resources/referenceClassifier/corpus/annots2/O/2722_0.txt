Effects of herbirnycin A are not attributable to toxicity
To address the possibility that the inhibitory effects of herbimycin
A on axon growth were attributable simply to a general toxicity of
the drug, we performed three different experiments. First, we
checked whether the effects of the drug were reversible. After an
initial 8 hr exposure to herbimycin A (stage 32 to 35136) embryos
incubated in inhibitor-free solution until stage 39. As shown in
Figure 3, the average projection length of these embryos was
intermediate between continuously treated and untreated controls, indicating recovery in vivo. This experiment does not show
that the effects were reversed in individual axons, however, be-cause new axons could have entered the optic tract after removal
of the drug. Previous studies using cultured cells have documented the reversibility of herbimycin A (also see in vitro data in
present study) and suggest that the recovery is attributable to de
novo synthesis of the target PTKs (Uehara et al., 1989; Garcia et
al., 1991).
Second, we evaluated the rate of protein synthesis in the
inhibitor-treated brains by measuring the levels of incorporation
of [?S]methionine. The rate of protein synthesis in control and
treated brains was found to be similar and contrasted with significantly lower levels seen in brains treated with cycloheximide
(control brains: 1.2 X 10” ? 2.8 X lo4 cpm, n = 5; herbimycin A:
1.2 X 10” t 2.2 X lo4 cpm, n = 4; cycloheximide: 3.5 X lo4 5 6.1
X 10” cpm, n = 5). The retina was not assayed because sectioned
material of inhibitor-treated embryos showed morphologically
normal, mitotically active retinae that retained phosphotyrosine
immunoreactivity (data not shown) and our previous studies have
indicated that reagents applied to the brain have little or no access
to the contralateral retina (Chien et al., 1993; McFarlane et al.,
1995).
Third, possible increases in cell death in the exposed brain
tissue were evaluated using trypan blue, a dye that is excluded
from live cells (Durkin et al., 1979). After exposure to 1.8 PM
herbimycin A for 12-18 hr, brains were stained with trypan blue
and the number of labeled cells counted in the exposed area of the
brain. The average number of stained cells present in the exposed
side of inhibitor-treated brains (107 ? 15; n = 10) was not
significantly different (`p < 0.05, one-tailed t test) from that found
in control exposed brains (80 ? 15; n = 9). These cells were
sparsely scattered through the forebrain and midbrain regions,
and their number represents a small fraction (probably <l%) of
the total number of cells comprising this area. Thus, effects on

Organotypic slice cocultures
Slice cocultures were prepared as described previously (Seamans et al.,
2003). Briefly, postnatal day 1–3 rat or mouse pups were killed and brains
were placed in ice-cold, sucrose-substituted Ringer's solution containing
(in mM) 200 sucrose, 1.9 KCl, 1.2 Na HPO , 33 NaHCO , 6 MgCl , 0.5
2432
CaCl , 10 glucose, and 0.4 ascorbic acid bubbled with 95% O /5% CO .

Individual coronal sections containing the prelimbic and infralimbic re-gions of the prefrontal cortex, the midbrain containing the ventral tegmental area, and the hippocampus were cut at a thickness of 350 m
using a Leica (Nussloch, Germany) VT-1000 vibratome. Slices were oriented adjacent to one another on a Millipore (Temecula, CA) millicell
insert in a six-well culture dish. Each well contained 1 ml of serumcontaining media consisting of 50% basal medium Eagle, 25% Earle's
balanced salt solution, 25% horse serum with 37 mg/ml glucose, 25 mM
HEPES, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.235 mM Glutamax. After 3 d in
culture, the media was changed to one containing reduced amounts of
horse serum (5%). After 15 d in culture, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (0.08
mM) was added to prevent glial overgrowth. Cell culture dishes were kept
in a humidified incubator equilibrated with 5% CO and were main- 2

tained for 15– 40 d with media changes every 2–3 d. In some experiments
examining the effects of ethanol on VTA dopamine neuron activity, cultures were prepared from transgenic mice that express green fluorescent
protein (GFP) under the control of a tyrosine hydroxylase promoter
(Matsushita et al., 2002).

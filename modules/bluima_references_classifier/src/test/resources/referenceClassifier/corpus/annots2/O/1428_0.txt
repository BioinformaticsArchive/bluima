Sexual dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease could be part
of the spectrum of dysautonomia and both reduced and
abnormally increased sex drive is reported.99 Testosterone
deficiency is implicated.69 By use of a sexual function self
report interview, Yu and colleagues100 noted that 17 of
21 male patients with Parkinson's disease had substantial
impairment of sexual arousal, behaviour, drive, and
orgasm domains, whereas in those with longer duration
of the disease sexual fantasy was increased. Another study
reported high prevalence (76Â·5%) of sexual dysfunction
in patients with the disease after bilateral subthalamic
nucleus stimulation.101 Aberrant sexual behaviour and
drive including hypersexuality form part of the dopamine
dysregulation syndrome, which is linked to dopaminergic
drug treatment in susceptible patients.76

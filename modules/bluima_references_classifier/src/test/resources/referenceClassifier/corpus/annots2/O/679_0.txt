Regions of Interest
MRI scans of the brain were obtained using a Signa 1.5T
MR scanner with a quadrature head coil (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Each subject was placed midline in
the head coil lying in a supine position on the gantry with
the head immobilized by large Styrofoam pads pressed comfortably to either side of the head in the area of the ears.
Conventional MRI included sagittal and axial spin echo T1-weighted images (repetition time TR, 400 milliseconds; echo
time TE, 15 milliseconds), slice thickness, 5mm; field of
view, 24cm; matrix, 256 256. By means of the conventional scans, the ROI of the experimental cortex was centered on the right precentral knob, a landmark used to identify the hand motor representation in the human brain32 (see
Fig 1A). The control ROI was defined in the occipital cortex, a region considered in this study as a control because it
was functionally unrelated to the experimental intervention
(see Fig 1B). ROIs measured 2.5 2.5 2.0cm (see Fig 1A
and B). This ROI size was selected to provide an adequate
signal-to-noise ratio33 for GABA concentrations in the physiological range of 1mM34,35 whereas acquisition times were
minimized to maintain sufficient temporal resolution.

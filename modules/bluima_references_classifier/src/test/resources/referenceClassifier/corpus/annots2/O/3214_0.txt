a Yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with a GAL4 transactivation domain plasmid and a GAL4 DNA-binding domain plasmid and analyzed for growth in the
absence of His. Cells that grew in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, and histidine but in the presence of 25 mM 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT) were then tested for
β-galactosidase activity (26). AD-hGRF2(234–474) concerns the DH domain without IQ sequences. BD-mGRF1(221–497)IIIRDII and BD-mGRF1(221–497)L263Q
concern point mutations in the DH domain as described in the text. BD-mGRF1(221–460) concerns the DH domain without PH sequences. β-Galactosidase activities
represent the average for six colonies from two independent transformations. The β-galactosidase activity for the AD-SNF1/BD-mGRF1(221–497) pair was obtained
from colonies that grew on an accompanying plate that selected for growth in the absence of tryptophan and leucine only. ND, not determined.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have suggested that the Nf1 gene product,
neurofibromin, is an important growth regulator for astrocytes.
First, reduced Nf1 gene expression is associated with increased
astrocyte proliferation in vivo and in vitro (3, 18). This heterozygous growth advantage is cell autonomous and is associated with increased p21ras pathway activation, consistent with
the function of neurofibromin as a p21ras-GAP. Second, neurofibromin expression increased during astrocyte growth arrest
under physiologic conditions in vitro (18, 21). Third, individu-

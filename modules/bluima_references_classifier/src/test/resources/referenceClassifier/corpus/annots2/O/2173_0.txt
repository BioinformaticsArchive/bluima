DISCUSSION
Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the arcuate nucleus
were associated with a decrease in LH pulse frequency,
amplitude, and mean plasma LH levels. However, within
the-group of rats receiving this type of lesion, there was
a dichotomy in the resulting pulsatile pattern of LH
secretion. Some rats secreted LH pulses, but in other
rats plasma LH was virtually undetectable. The amount
of damage to the arcuate nucleus was not more extensive
in these latter cases; in fact, damage to the hypothalamus
was more extensive in the rats showing some evidence of
pulsatile LH secretion. The most salient difference be-tween the two lesioned subgroups was the amount of
damage incurred to the posterior median eminence. This
observation suggested that LH secretion was probably
compromised by destruction of LHRH fibers projecting
to median eminence. This hypothesis is supported by the
finding that NMA lesions, which resulted in comparable
damage to arcuate nucleus neuronal cell bodies but
spared LHRH fiber projecting to the median eminence,
had no effect on any parameter of pulsatile LH secretion.
Taken together, the results of these experiments provide
strong evidence that the presence of neuronal cell bodies
within the arcuate nucleus is not necessary for normal
pulsatile secretion of LH in castrated male rats.
These results are in good agreement with other studies
that employed electrolytic and chemical lesions of the
arcuate nucleus to investigate its role in LH secretion in
rats. Soper and Weick (25) reported that lesions of the
anterior arcuate nucleus did not alter pulsatile LH secretion in ovariectomized female rats. However, when combined with anterior hypothalamic deafferentation, and
hence damage to median eminence afferent fibers, these

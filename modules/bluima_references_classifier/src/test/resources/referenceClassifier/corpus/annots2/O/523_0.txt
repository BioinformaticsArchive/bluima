1^3 days. In the youngest group of animals, very few
Fos-LI-positive neurones were found in the SC of either
non-treated controls (Fig. 5A) or in animals injected with
formalin (Fig. 5B). This absence was not a failure of
technique since abundant Fos-LI expression was
observed in this group in other regions of the nervous
system including inferior colliculus, lateral periaqueductal grey, cuneiform area, parabrachial nuclei, trigeminal
and facial motor nuclei, and spinal cord (Fig. 5C^E).

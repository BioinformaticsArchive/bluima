Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a
headache syndrome characterized by raised CSF
pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass le-sion or ventricular dilation; normal CSF composition; usually normal results of neurologic examination, except for papilledema and occasional CN
VI palsy; and a normal level of consciousness (1).
The hallmark of IIH is papilledema, which may be
bilateral, asymmetrical, or even unilateral; however, IIH can occur in the absence of papilledema.
The diagnosis of IIH is, therefore, not always simply achieved. In this report, we describe the case
of a 9-year-old male patient with IIH without papilledema for which MR imaging of the optic nerves
and pituitary gland provided important clues to the
diagnosis of IIH and showed a return to normal
appearance after normalization of CSF pressure.

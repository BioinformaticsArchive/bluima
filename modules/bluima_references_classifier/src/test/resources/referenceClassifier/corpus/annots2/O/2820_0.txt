Regulation of synaptic, GABA receptor-mediated inhibition is
A

a process of critical importance to normal brain function. Re-cently, we have described a phenomenon in hippocampus of a
transient, yet marked, decrease in spontaneous, GABA

receptor-mediated IPSCs after depolarization activated Ca2+
influx into a pyramidal cell. This process, depolarizationinduced suppression of inhibition (DSI), is absent in hippocampal cells that previously had been exposed to pertussis toxin in
vivo, implicating a G-protein in the DSI process. To circumvent
the problem that a single cell cannot be studied before and
after G-protein block using the pertussis toxin pretreatment
method, we have used the sulfhydryl alkylating agent
N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which blocks pertussis toxinsensitive G-proteins, to determine whether acute inhibition of

TBI-treated and control rats were killed, and the brains
rapidly dissected, frozen in isopentane on dry ice and
analysed using in situ hybridization. Coronal sections were
cut at "3.5 mm from bregma and sectioned at 10 μm on a
Leitz cryostat (Leitz Digital 1702, Wetzlar, Germany).
Sections were mounted on to poly-l-lysine (50 ug/ml, Sigma
P-1399, St Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.)-coated glass slides and
stored at "80)C. Synthetic oligonucleotide probe complementary to rat pituitary adenylate cyclase activating
polypeptide,56 its receptor 164 and BDNF22 were synthesized (Scandinavian Gene Synthesis, Sweden). The probe
for rat PACAP was a 53-mer, corresponding to nucleotides
961–1013 in the rat mRNA sequence (5*-CATTTGTT
TTCGGTAGCGGCTATAGCTGTCTGTGAAGATGCC
GTCCGAGTGGC-3*),56 whilst that for the PACAP receptor 1 was a 39-mer between nucleotides 1252 and 1291

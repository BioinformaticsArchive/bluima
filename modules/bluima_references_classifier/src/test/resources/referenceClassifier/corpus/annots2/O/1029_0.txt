The rats were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 0.1
mg kg 1 of Domitor (medetomidine hydrochloride; Pfizer, Capelle a/d
IJssel, the Netherlands) and 1 mg kg 1 Ketalar (Ketaminebase;
Parke Davis, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). Cannulas were im-planted into the right jugular vein for drug administration and into
the left femoral artery for blood sampling. The arterial cannula
consisted of 4.5-cm polyethylene tubing (i.d. 0.28, o.d. 0.61 mm;
Portex Limited, Hythe, UK) heat-sealed to 18-cm polyethylene tubing (i.d. 0.58, o.d. 0.96 mm; Portex Limited). The venous cannula
consisted of 12-cm polyethylene tubing (i.d. 0.58, o.d. 0.96 mm). The
cannulas were subcutaneously tunneled to the back of the neck. To
prevent clotting, the cannulas were filled with 25% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (Brocacef, Maarssen, The Netherlands) solution in
saline (0.9%) containing heparin (50 IU/ml; pharmacy at Leiden
University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands). For probe
implantation, the rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and the
skull was exposed. A small hole was drilled to allow implantation of
a microdialysis guide cannula (CMA/12; Aurora Borealis Control
B.V., Schoonebeek, The Netherlands) in the anterior striatum relative to bregma (AP, 0.8; L, 2.7; V, 3.5). Two support screws were
placed to hold the guide, which was glued to the skull with dental
cement (dental acrylic cement, Howmedia simplex rapid methylacrylate; Drijfhout, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

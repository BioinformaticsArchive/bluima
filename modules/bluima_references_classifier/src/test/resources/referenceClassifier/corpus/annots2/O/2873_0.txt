affinity (Kd = 153 t 28 PM) (Fig. 2A). When saturation
isotherms were performed with concentrations of radioligand higher than 400 pM, we detected a second
low-affinity binding site (Kd = 1.5-2 uM) that was -50
times more abundant than the high-affinity site. Consequently, the maximal concentration of radioligand used
for the saturation isotherms was 400 pM. Using these
conditions, we also detected specific binding sites (i.e.,
displaceable by an excess of cold ANP) in brain homogenates from SHR, but they did not display the kinetic
properties of typical saturable binding sites, thus preventing the calculation of corresponding B,,, and Kd
values (Fig. 2B). To verify that these differences could
not be due to different rates of metabolism of the
radioligand in brain homogenates from SHR and WKY
homogenates, we incubated 1251-ANP in homogenates
for 90 min in the presence of the same protease
inhibitors that were present in the binding buffer. By
HPLC analysis, we observed that there was little
metabolism of the radioligand (Fig. 3), because 93% of
the tracer had remained intact in SHR brain homogenates, compared with 87% in WKY brain homogenates.
In Vitro Receptor Autoradiography
Some of the difficulties of binding within homogenates may have been due to the fact that the brain is a
heterogeneous tissue that might contain a low number
of binding sites in only a few specialized sites. In vitro
receptor autoradiography with 1251-ANP was therefore
performed to compare binding in the brains of SHR and
WKY in further detail. Examples of autoradiograms
are shown in Fig. 4, and quantitative results are shown
in Table 2. Binding in the SFO, the ChP and the
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of SHR
was reduced to -30% of the levels observed in WKY
rats but was not significantly different in the anterior
commissure, the medial habenula, or the anterior
limbic area of the frontal cortex of SHR compared with
WKY rats. Of note, we performed binding experiments
on the brains of two experimental groups of rats, and
the abundance of binding sites appeared to be higher in
all regions of the brains of animals used in the second
experiment. This was related to the omission of protease inhibitors in the binding buffer of all experiments
subsequent to the first experimental set of animals.
Despite the changes in the absolute levels of binding
detected, the omission of protease inhibitors did not

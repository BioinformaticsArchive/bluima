In adult mammals the pineal gland shows a marked,
rhythmic content of melatonin, with a maximum concentration in the night which is 10-20 times higher than the
daytime minimum1'39"62.This change is causally associated with a parallel rhythm in the activity of the enzyme
serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT, EC 2.3.1.5.), which
may increase 2- to 100-fold during the night depending on
thespeciesstudied25'51.NATisconsideredtobethe
rate-limiting enzyme in the pineal conversion of serotonin
(5-HT) to melatonin e3. It converts 5-HT to N-acetylserotonin which is then O-methylated by the enzyme
hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT, EC 2.1.1.4.)
to melatonin 1'9'25.Alternatively, 5-HT can be oxidatively
deaminated to yield 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is the primary metabolite of 5-HT within
the brain and an important metabolite in the pineal 57.
The large rise in pineal NAT activity during the night is
caused by an increased interaction of norepinephrine
(NE) with fl-adrenergic receptors in the pinealocyte
membranes 9. The catecholamine is released in a daily
rhythm from postganglionic sympathetic neurons originating in superior cervical ganglia. These ganglia are
neurally connected to the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the

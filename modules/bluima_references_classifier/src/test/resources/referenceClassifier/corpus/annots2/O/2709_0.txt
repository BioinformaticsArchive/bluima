area the rise in )H-PDBu binding is linked to the overstimulation of NMDA- and non-NMDA-selective glutamate receptors and is mediated by an excessof free glutamate in the
interstitial fluid. SinceLIGA20 and LIGA4, injected in shamoperated rats, fail to changethe basal`H-PDBu binding (Fig.
3), and fail to inhibit glutamatechannel gating of NMDA- and
non-NMDA-glutamate ionotropic receptor families (Manev et
al., 1990b), one has to assumethat the inhibition of (the ex-pectant increase)`H-PDBu binding elicited by thesetwo semisynthetic lysogangliosidesis due to an action on specific processersesultingfrom the paroxysmalandcontinuousstimulation

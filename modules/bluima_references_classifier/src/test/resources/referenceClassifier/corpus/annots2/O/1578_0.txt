DISCUSSION
Bilateral dorsal hemisection was performed in thoracic spinal cords of adult wild-type mice and transgenic
mice that overexpress tPA under control of the Thy 1.2
promoter. Immunolabeling for CTB showed that cut
sensory axons did not regenerate through or beyond the
site of thoracic dorsal hemisection, as assessed 4 weeks
after injury. In contrast, there was some evidence for
increased dieback. Behavioral testing identified no differences in rotorod performance between wild-type and
transgenic mice.
The presence of the tPA transgene, protein, and
active enzyme was confirmed by a number of techniques. Genotyping at the end of the study confirmed the
presence of the tPA transgene in transgenic (but not
wild-type) mice. In situ zymography showed that thoracic spinal cords from mice of this line also express considerably more active tPA enzyme than wild-type littermates (particularly in gray matter, likely derived from
neurons). Immunolabeling demonstrated more tPA protein in subpopulations of CNS and PNS neurons in
transgenic mice than in wild-type mice. tPA protein was
present in large numbers of large-diameter neurons in
lumbar DRG. These neurons are mechanoreceptors that
project collaterals through the dorsal columns to the
brainstem sensory nuclei (Bomze et al., 2001). Given the
high proportions of large-diameter lumbar DRG neurons that were labeled in each case, it seems likely that
the neurons overexpressing tPA were injured by dorsal
hemisection and effectively traced with CTB. tPA
immunolabeling was particularly evident in dorsal column axons proximal to the injury site, indicating that
protein was present in axons even 4 weeks postaxotomy.
In summary, the lack of any regenerative effect of the
tPA transgene can not be attributed, therefore, to ab-sence of the transgene, loss of tPA protein, or lack of ac-tivity of the enzyme itself.
Enhanced functional recovery was not detected in
this experiment. The behavioral test used in this study
(rotorod) was sensitive enough to detect a long-lasting
sensorimotor deficit, but it might not have been sensitive
enough to detect any subtle improvements in function
that might have occurred. For example, functional
changes dependent not on axon regeneration but instead
on plasticity of spared circuits might have resulted in
changes that could be detected using electrophysiology
or different behavioral tests. tPA overexpression in these

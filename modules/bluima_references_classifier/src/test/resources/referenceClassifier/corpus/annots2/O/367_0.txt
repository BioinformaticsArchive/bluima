to animals that remained in their home cages during withdrawal
( p = 0.014). These data indicate that extinction training reversed
decreases in TH immunoreactivity in the NAc shell during withdrawal from cocaine self-administration. A similar extinctiontraining regimen failed to alter TH levels in NAc tissue from
sucrose-reinforced animals when compared with untreated
controls.
Regulation of TH immunoreactivity in NAc dopamine terminals could result from altered TH regulation in V TA dopamine
cell bodies, and TH levels in VTA tissue differed among cocainetrained and untreated control groups (F(3,78) = 2.991; p = 0.036).
However, Figure 3 shows that TH immunoreactivity in the VTA
was unchanged after both 1 d and 1 week withdrawal from
cocaine self-administration, despite lower TH levels in the NAc
shell from the same animals. In contrast, animals that experienced extinction training during cocaine withdrawal show a
marked 45% increase in TH immunoreactivity in the VTA relative to untreated controls ( p = 0.007) and a 60% increase when
compared with animals that remained in their home cages during
withdrawal ( p = 0.016). Thus, extinction training essentially
increased the amount of TH in both the V TA and NAc when
compared with animals withdrawn from cocaine without extinction training. Extinction training failed to alter TH immunoreactivity in VTA tissue from sucrose-trained animals.

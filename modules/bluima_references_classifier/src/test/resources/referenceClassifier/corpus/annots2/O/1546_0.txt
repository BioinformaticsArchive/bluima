Fig. 3. Pattern of glutamate (A) and c-aminobutyric acid (GABA, B) changes during conditioned fear acquisition experiment. The area under each amino acid peak
(as in Fig. 2) was integrated for each conditioning trial. Peak areas were calculated for each animal and then averaged (error bars are SEM and shown in one direction
only). The first point indicates basal levels before stimulus presentations. The signaled shock group (n = 5, closed circles) received auditory CSâ€“US pairings, the
unsignaled shock group (n = 5, open triangles) received only footshocks, and the control group (n = 4, dashed line) received no shocks but heard white noise
stimuli.

Experimental protocol

Once the animal was prepared for recording, carbachol pipette
was placed into the dorsomedial pontine reticular formation and a
10 nl carbachol injection was made to verify its effectiveness at the
selected site; in 5 out of the 14 animals with carbachol injections,
the position of the pipette had to be adjusted one or two times to
obtain the desired REMS-like effect. During the subsequent 2 h,
the temperature of the animal was elevated to 35.5–36.5 °C and
then maintained constant with a servo-controlled heating pad. The
end-expiratory CO2 was set at 5.5– 6.0% to obtain steady respiratory modulation of XII nerve activity and was kept constant
throughout the experiment. Once all conditions were stabilized,
1 to 12 carbachol injections or five to six saline injections were
made during a fixed period of 5 h after which the animal was
perfused. The total duration of REMS-like episodes generated
during this period ranged from 3.2 to 71.9 min (mean: 22.9 5.8).
The animals were perfused on the average 47.2 7.5 min (range:
8 –94 min) after the last REMS-like episode, or 15.5 0.9 min
(range: 14 –17 min) after the last saline injection.

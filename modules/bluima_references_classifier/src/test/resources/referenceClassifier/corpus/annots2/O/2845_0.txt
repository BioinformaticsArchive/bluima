al., 1991; Meldrum et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1991), electroshock seizures in mice (Zarnowski et al., 1993; Yamaguchi et
al., 1993), photically induced myoclonus in baboons (Smith et
al., 1991; Meldrum et al., 1992) and amygdala-kindled seizures in rats (Loscher and Honack, 1994; Namba et al., 1994;
Durmuller et al., 1994). In our study, we examined the anticonvulsant action of NBQX against limbic motor seizures
evoked from AT in the rat. For this purpose we administered
NBQX either 1) into AT, 2) into the ipsilateral PRC or PPC,
two sites that have been shown to be important targets of AT
outputs (Halonen et al., 1994) or 3) systemically. We also
evaluated the effect of systemic NBQX on tonic seizures
evoked by systemic bicuculline in order to compare the po-tency of this drug against focal vs. generalized seizure manifestations.

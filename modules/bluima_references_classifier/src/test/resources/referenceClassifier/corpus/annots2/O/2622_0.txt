Patch clamping
Whole-cell clamp experiments were performed, directly
visualizing cells using an upright Nomarski microscope with a
x40 water immersion objective (Optiphoto; Nikon, Japan). We
chose only small neurones with diameters of less than 13 ,um;
hence, most of the recorded neurones should have been the
medium spiny neurones. Injection of Lucifer Yellow (Sigma,
USA) revealed some features of the neurones. The cells
projected several fine dendrites, 100-250 /sm long, in all
directions. Fine spiny structures were often visualized,
particularly when cells were located close to the surface.
Edwards, Konnerth, Sakmann & Takahashi (1989) reported
a cleaning procedure used to assist in the formation of a gigaseal in thin-slice preparations. However, we found that this
procedure always damaged the medium spiny cells,
presumably because it tended to damage one of their

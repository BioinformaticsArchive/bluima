that the level of inhibition of macrophage binding to
sections of a tissue is related to the amount of HB1
expressed in that tissue (data not shown).
To complement the investigations using antibodies, a
panel of lectins was also screened in the assay in order
to assess the contribution made by carbohydrate do-mains to macrophage adhesion to brain tissue. These
lectins recognize a variety of different oligosaccharides,
as shown in Table 2. Adhesion was significantly inhibited by the lectins GSI and RCA-I, while DBA inhibited
calcium-independent adhesion only. GSI and RCA-I
recognize oligosaccharides containing a a-linked terminal N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) or galactose (Gal)
residue. DBA recognizes only a-GalNAc. This may in-dicate that the cation-dependent component of macrophage adhesion to brain tissue involves molecules possessing oligosaccharide groups terminating in a-Gal
and that cation-independent adhesion molecules contain oligosaccharides with a oligosaccharides with a terminal a- GalNAc. Another lectin that recognizes a-Gal
and a-GalNAc, SBA, does not produce a significant re-duction in adhesion, although the variability in this as-say may mean that smaller reductions are not detected.
We set out to discover some information about the carbohydrate epitopes present on the HB1 molecule. In a
modified Western blot experiment, the ~110 kDa HB1
antigen was labelled by GSI and DBA but not by Con A.
This finding is evidence that HB1 is a glycoprotein containing terminal a-GalNAc residues and possibly also
a-Gal. It also suggests that at least part of the inhibitory
effect of GSI and DBA is mediated by binding to the
HB1 protein. GSI has been used as a specific histochemical maker for microglia for many years, but there
has been no information about the function of the molecules to which GSI binds (Streit & Kreutzberg, 1987)
The evidence we present here suggests that GSI recognizes a membrane protein on microglia and macrophages, HB1, which mediates adhesion of these cells
within the brain parenchyma. Attempts to sequence
this glycoprotein are currently under way. Identification and further study of the HB1 antigen may provide
a unique insight into the mechanisms controlling
macrophage behavior in the brain.

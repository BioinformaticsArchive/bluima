Figure 2. Histological sequelae of single or repetitive (Rep) mTBI and
sham treatment in Tg2576 mice. H&E staining with Gomori's iron stain
(A, C, E, G) and GFAP staining (B, D, F, H, insets) are shown. Single and
repetitive mTBI resulted in no or very mild damage at the impact site in
the brain at 2 d (A, B), and 16 weeks ( Câ€“H) after the injury. Each inset
indicates a high-power view of the rectangular area shown in the images
in B, D, F, and H. Sham treatment resulted in no overt damage (C, D). A,
B, Repetitive mTBI (2 d after TBI). C, D, Sham (16 weeks after treatment). E, F, Single mTBI (16 weeks after TBI). G, H, Repetitive mTBI
(16 weeks after TBI).

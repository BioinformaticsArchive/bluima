Fig. 1. Representative evoked potentials recorded in the aPCX Layer I to
stimulation of either the LOT or association / commissural fibers stimulated in pPCX Layer III. Histological locations of recording sites and of
pPCX stimulating sites is also shown (stereotaxic atlas drawings adapted
from Ref. [39]; anterior / posterior distance from Bregma in mm is
indicated). Electrodes directed at the LOT were all within the LOT as
confirmed visually during dissection.

Fig. 3. Effects of microinjections of saline (A) or muscimol (B) into the dorsomedial hypothalamic region consisting of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus
(DMH) and dorsal hypothalamic area (DH) on skin cooling-evoked changes in physiological variables. Microinjections were made bilaterally at the time points
indicated by arrowheads and dashed lines. The horizontal scale bar represents 100 s, and vertical scale bars for BAT SNA traces represent 300 V in (A) and
50 V in (B). C: location of the sites of all intra-DMH/DH microinjections for the group data shown in Table 2. D: representative view of sites of bilateral
microinjections into the DMH as indicated by clusters of fluorescent beads (arrows). The scale bar represents 0.5 mm. f, Fornix; mt, mammillothalamic tract;
and VMH, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus.

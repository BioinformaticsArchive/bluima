ABSTRACT. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB)/Rel designates a family of transcription factors participating in the
activation of a wide range of genes crucially involved in immune and inflammatory function. NF-kB/Rel proteins
have been demonstrated recently in primary neurons and in several brain areas. Functional significance of these
proteins is still not understood completely, but since certain subsets of neurons appear to contain constitutively
active DNA-binding activity, it seems likely that they may participate in normal brain function. A growing body
of evidence is accumulating for a specific activation of NF-kB/Rel proteins in the CNS, and in particular in
neuronal cells, during neurodegenerative processes associated to etiologically unrelated conditions. Whether
NF-kB activation is part of the neurodegenerative process or of protective mechanisms is a matter of debate. This
issue will be reviewed here with particular attention to the available reports on the activity of NF-kB/Rel
proteins in both experimental paradigms of neurodegeneration and post-mortem brain tissue of patients affected
by various neurological diseases. We hypothesize that NF-kB/Rel proteins may represent the point of
convergence of several signalling pathways relevant for initiating or accelerating the process of neuronal
dysfunction and degeneration in many neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease,
CNS viral infections, and possibly others. If NF-kB/Rel proteins represent an integrating point of several
pathways potentially contributing to neuronal degeneration, molecules that finely modulate their activity could
represent a novel pharmacological approach to several neurological diseases. BIOCHEM PHARMACOL 57;1:1–7,

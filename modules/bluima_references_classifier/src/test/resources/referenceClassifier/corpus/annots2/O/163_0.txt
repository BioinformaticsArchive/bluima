Figure 2. Responsiveness of Dbh +/- and Dbh -/- mice to P TZ
injections at 40 mg/kg (A) and 30 mg/kg (B). Left, Graphs show seizure
latencies (seconds) to the first myoclonic jerk, forelimb clonus, and clonic /
tonic seizure in Dbh -/- and Dbh +/- mice. At both P TZ concentrations Dbh -/- mice had significantly shorter latencies compared with
those in Dbh +/- mice (mean 6 SEM; single asterisk denotes p < 0.01;
double asterisk s denote p < 0.001). Right, Graphs show the percentage of
animals progressing to tonic extension and the percentage of animals that
died after tonic extension (mortality).

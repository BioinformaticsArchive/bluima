translational machinery (Siegel et al., 1999). eIF2 (P) immunoreactivity was also evident, although attenuated, in the neocortex
and thalamus at 48 and 72 hr after injury (data not shown). By 7 d
after injury, little to no staining above that seen in sham-injured
animals was observed (Fig. 6 D).
When brain sections from sham-injured animals were double
labeled with antibodies targeting both APP and eI F2 (P), little to
no signal was seen for eI F2 (P), whereas only background staining was observed for APP (data not shown), consistent with the
above-described single-label observations. Sections from animals
surviving 24 hr after injury, however, again demonstrated a
marked increase in cellular eI F2 (P) in the mediodorsal neocortex and dorsolateral thalamus that colocalized to the cytoplasm of
neuronal somata also displaying APP-immunopositive axonal
swellings (Fig. 7). All visible axotomized neuronal somata
showed increased eI F2 (P). However, in some of the same fields,
neuronal somata intensely stained for eI F2 (P) were also seen,
despite the fact that they were neither axotomized nor associated
with any somatic increase in APP. Forty-eight hours after injury,
axotomized neurons revealed dispersed cytoplasmic staining for
eIF2 (P), and by 72 hr, few axotomized neurons with increased
eIF2 (P) staining were observed.
To provide a semiquantitative assessment of the observed in-creases in eI F2 (P), Western blotting of specific brain subregions
with subsequent densitometry was performed (Fig. 8). In tissue
taken from the mediodorsal neocortex 24 hr after central FPI,
eIF2 (P) was elevated 32% over sham levels, although this
change was not significant ( p 0.18). As evidenced by the above
immunocytochemistry for eIF2 (P), this result may be attributable to the diffuse nature of the injury within an isolated region
of the neocortex. In the hippocampus, the injury-induced increase
in eIF2 (P) was greater, rising 125% over sham-injured levels
( p 0.01). No change in eIF2 (P) was observed in the thalamus
(data not shown).

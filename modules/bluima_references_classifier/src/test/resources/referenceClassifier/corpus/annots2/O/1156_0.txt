3GnT1 and other sensory systems
The retinotectal system has often been used as a model to better
understand mechanisms used to construct connections in the
developing olfactory system (Key and St John, 2002). Studies
presented here suggest that it may be helpful to consider the
patterning of DRG projections to the dorsal horn of the spinal
cord as an alternative model. Interestingly, there are parallels
between axon targeting by OE neurons to the OB and nociceptive
DRG neurons to the spinal cord. Both create spatial order by
converging input from dispersed sensory neurons to specific tar-

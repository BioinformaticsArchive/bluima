stimuli tested, Oc cells had the shortest latency. These cells are
probably glycinergic and project to the DC N (Smith and Rhode,
1989), and therefore they are a likely source of the short-latency
inhibition to type II and III+IV cells. A common source of
inhibition that is strong to type II and weaker to III+IV cells was
suggested earlier (Nelken and Young, 1994), and is consistent
with results from electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve
(Shofner and Young, 1985; O'Leary et al., 1994) and with numerous previous studies (Smith and Rhode, 1985; Caspary et al.,
1987; Snyder and Leake, 1988; Oertel et al., 1990; Saint Marie et
al., 1991; Evans and Z hao, 1993; Z hang and Oertel, 1993, 1994).
Early studies found that the timing properties of the DC N were
inferior to those of the ventral CN (Lavine, 1971; Goldberg and
Brownell, 1973; Godfrey et al., 1975b; van Gisbergen et al.,
1975a,b; Rhode and Smith, 1986b), but later studies emphasized
good envelope phase-locking and even proposed specific roles for
the DC N in processing temporal information (K im et al., 1990;
Frisina et al., 1994; Rhode and Greenberg, 1994; Langner and
Schreiner, 1996). If synchronization to the envelope frequency of
the AM stimulus is considered, our data on type II and III+IV
cells agree with previous studies in terms of high maximal Rm
values (Fig. 6) and low upper-cutoff frequencies (Fig. 8) (K im et
al., 1990; Rhode and Greenberg, 1994; Z hao and Liang, 1995).
However, the most striking feature of these cells was the increasingly nonlinear response to AM stimuli of increasing SPL s (Figs.
3, 4). At low SPLs, period histograms showed a unimodal re-sponse peak. With increasing SPLs, this peak was replaced in
type II cells by an inhibitory trough flanked by one or two
excitatory modes, as would be expected from increasing recruitment of Oc cells, which showed high synchronization values at all

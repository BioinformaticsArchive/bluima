a Tumor volumes were measured based on area measurements in brain sections from terminally ill mice (see Materials and Methods).
b Many of the largest T121p53+/- tumors from the same brains were dissected
for DNA analysis and thus not measured.
c A subset of tumors with type II morphology was heterogeneous. These
tumors (type IIb) grew to larger sizes than those consisting of only type II
morphology (type IIa) and also contained regions of densely packed cells.

Thirty-one male Wistar rats, which
weighed 280–320 g at the time of surgery, were obtained from Mo ̈ llegaard
Breeding Center (Ejby, Denmark), and
used after two weeks of acclimatisation
to their housing conditions. The rats
were assigned to one of two experiments. In experiment 1, which lasted
two weeks, eight animals were given
bilateral hippocampus lesions and
eight animals were sham-operated. In
Experiment 2, which lasted for seven
weeks, eight animals received bilateral
hippocampal lesions, while seven
sham-operated animals served as controls. The rats were housed in groups
of five to six (mixed lesion/controls),
and had free access to standard rat
pellets and tap water. The animals were
maintained under a 12–24 h light/dark
cycle (light on 7.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m.),
with temperature and humidity at 22 C
and 40–60%, respectively. The experiments were registered and approved by
the Norwegian Experimental Animal
Board (NEAB).

factor in CNS development. Exposure to drugs that act
upon NET during critical phases of CNS development
can lead to alterations in CNS function that would have
long term impacts on function and behavior (Snow et al.,
2001; Standwood and Levitt, 2004). In the clinical setting there is increasing use of antidepressants in treating
childhood and adolescent depression. Both of these
instances point to the need for a more complete understanding of the development of monoamine transporters
in the CNS. In this study we present for the first time an
examination of the anatomical ontogeny of NET, using
quantitative autoradiography. We used [3H]nisoxetine
as a radioligand because nisoxetine has a high affinity
for NET with much lower affinities for the dopamine and
serotonin transporters, allowing specific examination of
NET (Tejani-Butt, 1992; Jayanthi et al., 1993).
Our goal was to analyze NET development in the CNS
in terms of neuroanatomical localization and density. Our
data indicate that NET density increases with development
in forebrain regions. At PND 5 and 10 the transporter is
expressed at very low levels throughout the forebrain, but
by PND 15 NET density increases greatly in most forebrain
regions. From PND 15â€“25 NET expression reaches even
higher levels and then decreases slightly in many areas of
the adult brain. By contrast, the brainstem and cerebellum
NET expression is highest during early postnatal development and decreases dramatically in the adult brain. This
was true for the brainstem as a whole and for discrete
brainstem regions, such as the A5 noradrenergic nucleus
and the locus coeruleus. The time period (PND 5 to PND
25) studied in rats corresponds to humans from the third
trimester of pregnancy to late childhood (Bayer et al.,
1993; Maeda et al., 2000).

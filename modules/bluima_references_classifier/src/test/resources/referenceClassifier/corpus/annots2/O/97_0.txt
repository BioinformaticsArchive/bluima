The majority of functional neuroimaging studies have been based
on the assumption of fixed experimental effects. Under this
model, an experiment is designed so that a variable, or set of
variables, is explicitly controlled by the experimenter. The resulting data are then analyzed in terms of these explanatory variables, typically using a form of the general linear model (GL M).
Although this is a powerf ul approach for both the design and
analysis of functional neuroimaging experiments, it places stringent constraints on the types of experiments that can be performed. Because this type of analysis is hypothesis-driven, it can
only yield answers specific to those questions that are asked.
Often this results in a set of static activation maps that reach some
threshold of significance regarding a particular null hypothesis. In
this report, we describe the use of an alternative analysis (Mc-Keown et al., 1998a,b) that reveals the complex spatiotemporal
dynamics of a finger-tapping task.
One aspect of the GL M that may be problematic for brain
imaging is the requirement of linearity. By definition, the GL M is
a linear combination of explanatory variables, which can be added
to or taken away from a given model in a modular manner.
Although “nonlinear” terms can be added to these models by
specifying higher-order effects (e.g., x2, or xy in the case of two
variables), the hypothesized shape of these effects must be spec-

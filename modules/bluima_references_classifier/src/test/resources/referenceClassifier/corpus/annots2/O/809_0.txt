Fundamental aspects of the intrinsic organization
of the neocortex
The neocortex is commonly described as a 6-layered
structure that is subdivided into cortical areas. These
areas are distinguished by their histological and neurochemical characteristics, their connections (afferent/efferent fiber systems) and their functional properties. There are two major groups of cortical neurons:
spiny neurons and smooth or sparsely spiny neurons. Spiny
neurons include the population of pyramidal and spiny
stellate cells that are characterized by the excitatory
asymmetric synapses they form (glutamatergic). The
majority of cortical neurons are pyramidal cells that
are found in layers II–VI and constitute the bulk of the
projection cells (commonly they are classified according to their projection site). Most spiny stellate cells
are interneurons and they are located in the middle
cortical layers. Smooth or sparsely spiny neurons are in-terneurons and include a large population of neurons
that form inhibitory symmetric synapses (GABAergic),
as well as a small population that are non-GABAergic.
Smooth interneurons are found in layers I–VI and form
a morphologically and physiologically heterogeneous
group. Furthermore, a number of smooth interneurons
have been shown to contain more than one neuroactive substance, commonly a neuroactive peptide. Different types of interneurons can also be recognized by
their chemical and electrical synaptic connectivity. Ad-ditionally, specific morphological types, with particular molecular attributes and connections, have been
shown to present distinct physiological characteristics

et al., 2002).
In general, cortical neurons are thought to be or-ganized into multiple, small repeating microcircuits.
However, as pointed out by Silberberg et al. (2002),
given the great diversity of anatomical, molecular and
physiological types of neurons, and the intricate connectivity, it is evident that a unique, discrete microcircuit cannot exist. However, in spite of the large number
of different elements that constitute cortical circuits, it is
possible to draw up a common basic microcircuit. The
skeleton of this basic microcircuit is formed by a pyramidal cell and its input-output connections (DeFelipe,

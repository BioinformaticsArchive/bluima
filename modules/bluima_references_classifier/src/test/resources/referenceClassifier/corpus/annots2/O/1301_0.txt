pamine transmitter system in normal and pathological hippocampal function.
The understanding of the actions of dopamine as a neurotransmitter in the hippocampal formation has evolved over
the past 3 decades, from the presumption that dopamine had
no significant role (except as a precursor to norepinephrine),
to the current appreciation that dopamine can act via multiple signaling pathways in the hippocampus. For example, in
the CA1 region, potential physiological actions include the
modulation of a calcium-activated K current (Benardo and
Prince, 1982; Pockett, 1985; Malenka and Nicoll, 1986; Berretta et al., 1990; Pedarzani and Storm, 1995), excitatory
neurotransmission (Hsu, 1996; Otmakhova and Lisman,
1998; Yang, 2000; Kotecha et al., 2002), voltage-gated ion
channels (Cantrell et al., 1997; Hoffman and Johnston,
1999), and inhibitory neurotransmission (Gribkoff and Ashe,
1984a,b). The observations concerning effects on the calciumactivated K current and on evoked EPSPs are somewhat

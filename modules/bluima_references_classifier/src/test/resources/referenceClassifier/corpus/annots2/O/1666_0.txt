60), BDNF (20,50,60), and, albeit in smaller amounts,
FGF-2 (60). These factors may have pronounced effects
on repair-related processes such as neuroprotection and
axonal outgrowth, but they may also affect BMSC survival and/or proliferation in vivo through an autocrine
action (116). If this is the case why then do BMSCs
survive poorly within the injured spinal cord? It is possible that the grafted BMSCs simply do not secrete
enough of the necessary growth factors to positively ef-fect their own survival within an extremely harsh injury
milieu with many cells and factors that negatively influence survival. Also, there may be batch-to-batch differences in the ability to produce growth factors, which
was demonstrated for human BMSCs (74) and that
could result in highly variable results masking the true
potential of BMSCs to survive the spinal injury milieu.
Clearly, for the development of safe and effective

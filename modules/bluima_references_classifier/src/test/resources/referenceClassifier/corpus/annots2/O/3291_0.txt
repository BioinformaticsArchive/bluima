ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate possible influences of
suprasegmental lesions on the masseter reflex. The masseter reflex was
elicited in 54 patients with supratentorial (37 patients) or cerebellar (17 pa-tients) lesions 3–11 days after the acute onset of clinical disease. Patients
showing lesions within the pons and midbrain on thin-slice magnetic resonance imaging were excluded from evaluation. The testing procedure in-cluded an additional facilitating maneuver (opening and closing the jaw be-fore tapping). Masseter reflex latencies, interside differences, and
amplitudes were within the normal range in all patients. Latencies were not
different with and without the facilitating maneuver. Amplitudes were significantly higher with the maneuver, but interside differences of amplitudes
were unchanged. Masseter reflex abnormality can be taken as a reliable
measure of direct involvement of the reflex arc.

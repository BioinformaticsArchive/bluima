Introduction
Brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
along with other members of the neurotrophin
family, was first identified as one of the classical
survival proteins in developing mammalian nervous system (Ghosh et al. 1994; Kubo et al. 1995;
Nonomura et al. 1996). The expression of BDNF
exhibits a unique temporal pattern. Whereas the
expression levels of most other neurotrophic factors (e.g., nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3) in
many brain regions decrease during postnatal de-velopment, BDNF expression becomes prominent
only after neurogenesis has occurred and stays at
high levels in the mature central nervous system
(CNS) (Leibrock et al. 1989; Maisonpierre et al.
1990; Rocamora et al. 1993). Concomitant with its
expression pattern, BDNF was found to regulate
events that occur during late stages of neuron de-velopment, such as dendritic growth and synaptic
innervation (Gao et al. 1995; McAllister et al. 1995;
Bartrup et al. 1997; Causing et al. 1997; Rutherford
et al. 1998; Vicario-Abejon et al. 1998). BDNF has
been shown to modulate GABAergic neurons and
synapses. In culture, BDNF increases GABA content and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity level in neostriatal (Mizuno et al. 1994; Ventimiglia et al. 1995) and neocortical neurons (Rutherford et al. 1997), and increases GABA uptake and
soma size of cortical interneurons (Widmer and
Hefti 1994). In BDNF transgenic mice, GAD65 and
parvalbumin expression revealed accelerated
emergence of the mature pattern of inhibitory presynaptic boutons in the visual cortex (Z.J. Huang,
A. Kirkwood, V. Porciatti, T. Pizzorusso, M.F. Bear,
L. Maffei, and S. Tonegawa, unpubl.). In addition to
its modulatory effects on presynaptic GABAergic
neurons, BDNF also accelerates the expression of
postsynaptic GABAA receptor subunits in cerebellar granule cell culture (Lin et al. 1998). However,

nosis [21,22]. When irradiated, there is a marked reduction
in FDG uptake in almost all patients, with increased FDG
uptake returning after about 4 months in the tumors that
fail to respond effectively to radiotherapy [23]. For the
question of residual active neoplasm in the radiated brain
tumor patient, thallium was simply superior to FDG in the
authors' series.
In this series, FDG uptake was absent in both recently
(less than 3 months) and more remotely irradiated brain
tumors. The authors observed an interesting phenomenon
in four of the seven postirradiation patients. FDG uptake
was diminished in areas of marked radiation exposure,
with normal or increased uptake of HmPAO. Presumably,
glucose metabolism and blood flow have become uncoupled. These patients exhibited lateralizing neurologic signs
consistent with regional neurotoxicity. The clinical significance of this uncoupling is not clear and requires further
study.
201Tl SPECT presents many advantages to FDG imaging, using either SPECT or PET. The authors have
demonstrated, using techniques of very similar resolution,
that 201Tl is a more sensitive radionuclide agent than
18F-FDG, especially in regard to posttherapy tumor monitoring [14,15,24]. This finding has implications for 18FFDG PET as well. 201Tl SPECT is less expensive, more
available, and can be used as an independent imaging
modality. The early detection of tumor recurrence is
important because therapeutic advances now have made it
possible to offer effective salvage chemotherapy to children with recurrent brain tumors. 201Tl-SPECT imaging
can provide valuable information when MRI is equivocal
for tumor progression. Increasing radiation doses can
produce contrast enhancing necrotic lesions that mimic
tumor progression but do not accumulate thallium. Al-though the use of radionuclide imaging studies is not part
of the standard of care except in a few select institutions,
it seems clear that 201Tl SPECT is a cost-effective adjuvant imaging modality that can provide much needed
information on tumor metabolism to guide therapeutic
decision making.

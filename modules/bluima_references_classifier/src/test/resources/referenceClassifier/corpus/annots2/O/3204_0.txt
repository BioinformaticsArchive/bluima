Abstract––Receptor-associated protein appears to play an important role in low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein traYcking. Since ligands for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and normal functioning of this protein is indispensable for
central nervous system development, deficient receptor-associated protein expression may result in central
nervous system alterations. In this study, receptor-associated protein knockout mice were behaviorally
tested and nervous system integrity was assessed via in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical/laser
confocal microscopy methods. Receptor-associated protein knockout mice were found to be cognitively
impaired in the Morris water maze compared to controls. In wild-type mice, the receptor-associated
protein was found to be highly co-expressed with somatostatin in hippocampal and neocortical inhibitory
neurons. Receptor-associated protein knockout mice, however, showed a significant decrease in number of
somatostatin-expressing neurons of the CA1 region and somatostatin expression within these neurons.
The decreased number of somatostatin neurons significantly correlated with cognitive impairment
observed in the receptor-associated protein knockout mice.
These results suggest a novel role for receptor-associated protein in modulating the functioning of
somatostatin-producing neurons. Furthermore, this has implications for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis,
in which altered regulation of both somatostatin and the known low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
protein ligands are a consistent finding. ? 1998 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

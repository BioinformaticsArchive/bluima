viruses are represented as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Restriction sites: A, AatII; C, ClaI; E, EcoRI; H, HindIII; Xb, XbaI. The
neuropathogenicity of the viruses was assayed and is shown as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Three symptomatic and two asymptomatic
rats infected with PVF-I and three symptomatic and one asymptomatic rat infected with PVF-K were examined for neuropathological
changes.

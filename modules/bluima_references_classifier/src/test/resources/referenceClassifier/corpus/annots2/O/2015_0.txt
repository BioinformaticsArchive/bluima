Technical considerations
Direct comparisons of NBT and fluorescence ISH
results established that the NBT technique was uniformly more sensitive than the fluorescent techniques.
For example, single-color NBT data indicated that ferret
PCP4 was expressed throughout layer 5, but PCP4 fluorescence signal could only be detected in the lower part
of layer 5, where the PCP4 message was enriched,
(compare Fig. 5B to 6Aâ€²). We concluded that the FISH
technique failed to detect sites of low expression.
Accordingly, we did not calculate coexpression percentages for FISH pairwise comparisons because these
numbers would be fundamentally misleading. Positive
FISH coexpression data, however, are reliable and are
reported in the Results.

General procedure. Experiments were done in adult male
Wistar rats (250–350 g; Charles River Canada, St. Constant,
Canada). All animals were housed under controlled conditions with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were
available to all animals ad libitum. All experimental procedures were done in accordance with the guidelines on the use
and care of laboratory animals as set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Care Committee at The University of Western Ontario.
Immunohistochemistry. Under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia (65 mg/kg ip; MTC Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, ON,
Canada) animals (n 5) were perfused transcardially with
500 ml of 0.9% physiological saline followed by 500 ml of
Zamboni's fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer at pH 7.2–7.4 and 15% saturated picric acid
at 4°C (11). The brains were removed and stored in a 10%
sucrose-PBS solution overnight. Frozen, serial transverse
sections of the brain stem at 40 m were cut in a cryostat
( 17°C; model 5030, Bright Instrument, Huntington, UK).
For each animal, one in every three sections of the brain stem
was processed immunohistochemically as previously de-scribed (11) for hcrt-1-like-ir. An adjacent section was processed for hcrtR-1-like-ir. In brief, brain stem sections were
placed into normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:50 with PBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 for 30 min. The sections were then rinsed in PBS and
placed into primary antisera to hcrt-1 (affinity purified rabbit

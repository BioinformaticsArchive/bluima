effect of drug on Fos-IR in the RVLM, as shown in Fig. 5
(F1,35 = 52.7, P < 0.01), with nearly a fourfold increase
after Isop compared to that after 0.15 m NaCl. There was no
effect of group and no interaction between drug and group.
Figure 6 shows digital photomicrographs of representative
sections from the RVLM.

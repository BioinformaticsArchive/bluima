to animals exposed to ethanol for 24 weeks ( p < 0.05;
Fig. 2). These changes occurred in the absence of an
ethanol-induced change in nuclear volume. The timing of the ethanol exposure affected the numbers of
neurons in the MoV. Macaques exposed to ethanol
at the time of neutrulation, G19 or G20 had significantly ( p < 0.05) fewer MoV neurons than did control
animals.
The facial motor nucleus (MoVII) was not affected by
exposure to ethanol. Neither neuronal number nor vol-

Increased Sensitivity and Elimination of
Autofluorescence by TSA
For immunofluorescence staining, the microwave irradiation procedure alone was found to be inadequate
because the strong autofluorescence occluded the weak
GABAA receptor subunit IR. This is illustrated for the
2-subunit in the CA2 region (Figure 2A) and in the
dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus (Figure
2D). The TSA procedure was then tested in sections
pretreated with microwave irradiation. This resulted
in a striking increase in immunofluorescence staining
intensity for the four GABAA receptor subunits investigated and in the elimination of autofluorescence, as
illustrated in Figures 2C and 2E. In the hippocampus,
the pyramidal cell layer and the dendritic layers, as
well as the interneurons, appeared intensely stained in
sections processed with TSA, as shown for the 2-subunit (Figure 2C). Prominent staining of this subunit
was also seen in the dentate gyrus, with the somata of
granule cells being clearly outlined and the molecular
layer strongly labeled (Figure 2E). In addition, cell so-mata in the hilus of the hippocampus were intensely
stained, together with their long processes (Figure 2E).
A comparable improvement in the detection of GABAA
receptor subunits was observed for the 2 and 3 antisera and for bd-24 recognizing the 1-subunit. The
distribution of the 2-subunit IR was similar to that of
the 2-subunit, except that it was not detected in interneurons. The 3-subunit IR was particularly abundant
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, whereas the
1-subunit IR was most prominent in many interneurons distributed throughout the hippocampal formation. For all antibodies used, TSA led to a dramatic in-crease in sensitivity. For example, a 1:10,000 dilution
of the 2 antiserum yielded intense staining, whereas
the signals were barely detectable with a 1:1000 dilution in conventional immunofluorescence staining.
The second major effect of TSA was suppression of
autofluorescence, which was directly correlated with
the duration of incubation with biotinylated tyramide.

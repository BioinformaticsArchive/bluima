At the end of the artificial rearing period, animals were anesthetized
with Nembutal and perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was then carefully removed and infiltrated overnight with 30% sucrose in 4% paraformaldehyde. After infiltration, the
cerebellum was cut sagitally in 40-pm-thick sections on a freezing microtome. The immunostaining procedure was performed on free floating
sections, and all incubations were at room temperature unless otherwise
noted. In the first step, sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide
for 30 min to remove endogenous peroxidases and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After this treatment, nonspecific binding was
blocked with a solution consisting of 5% milk in PBS for 1 hr. Sections
were incubated overnight (4Â°C) in primary antibody directed against either
the p75 NGF receptor, the trkA NGF receptor, or microtubule-associated

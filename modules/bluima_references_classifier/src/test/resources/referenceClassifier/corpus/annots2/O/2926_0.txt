Figure 3. A, Mean (6SE) antennal-lobe neuropil volumes for 10-d-old bees from each of the four treatment
groups. Together, the glomerular neuropil and the fi-brous (central, aglomerular) neuropil comprise the total
antennal-lobe neuropil. There were no significant differences (NS) between treatments for each of the three
neuropil measurements. Numbers in parentheses are sample sizes. B, Mean (6SE) glomerular volumes for 10-d-old bees from each of the four treatment groups. Bars
with different letters differ significantly. There were no
significant differences (NS) between treatment groups in
the volumes of either the T1-44 or the T4-3(1) glomerulus. The mean volume of glomerulus T4-2(1), however,
was significantly smaller in the untreated control group
than in bees from the manipulated hive ( p < 0.05).
Numbers in parentheses are sample sizes.

Figure 1. A summary of the primary components that control firing of dopamine neurons and the systems on which the dopaminergic system acts in the control of goaldirected behavior. Tonic and phasic activity of dopamine neurons is regulated by inputs from the ventral pallidum and tegmental nuclei (PPTg and LDTg, respectively).
Dopamine, in turn, regulates the interaction of higher-level systems controlling different aspects of behavior within the NAc. The integrated output of these interactions is
then funneled through the ventral pallidal system to limbic and motor control regions. These interactions are shown in detail in subsequent figures.

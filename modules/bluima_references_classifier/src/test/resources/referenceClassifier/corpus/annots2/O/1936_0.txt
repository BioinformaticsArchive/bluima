Induction of ERK phosphorylation during fear
conditioning
To further investigate lateralization of ERK signaling in the
amygdala, we performed immunostaining experiments to
examine whether phosphorylation of ERK occurred preferentially in the amygdala contralateral from the US. A total
of 27 rats were bilaterally implanted with periorbital wires
for US delivery. Each rat received five days of pre-exposure to the behavior chamber (and training to perform the
pellet chasing task), exactly like the rats in the behavior
studies presented above. Following pre-exposure, the rats
were divided into three groups. The Pair group (n 11)
received a training session consisting of 16 CS-US pairings, identical to the training sessions described above for
behavioral experiments. The UNP group (n 8) received
16 CS presentations that were explicitly UNP with 16 US
presentations (see Experimental Procedure); Blair et al.
(2005a) have shown that such UNP training produces no
conditioned freezing to the CS. The CS Only group (n 8)
received 16 identical CS presentations, but the US was
never delivered to this group. In all groups, the US was
delivered on the left side for half of the rats and the right
side for the other half, except for the Pair group in which
had an odd number of rats, so five rats received the US on
the left and six on the right. The training sessions lasted
50 –55 min for each rat (because of the random intertrial
interval). At a time point 65 min after the start of the training
session (10 –15 min after the end of the session), rats were
deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (see
Experimental Procedure). Following perfusions, brains
were fixed and sectioned throughout the rostrocaudal ex-tent of the amygdala (from 1.8 to 3.8 mm posterior to
bregma), and sections were immunolabeled for phosphoERK using DAB (Eitan et al., 2003). Using boundaries from
the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1998), immunolabelled
cells were quantified separately within four distinct subnuclei of the amygdala: the LA, basal nucleus (B), centromedial nucleus (CeM), and CeL. Average cell counts (per
mm2) in each of these four areas (separated by hemisphere) are shown in Fig. 3.
LA nucleus. A one-way ANOVA of labeled cells in the
LA nucleus (from both hemispheres combined) revealed a
significant main effect of group (F2,51 4.78, P 0.012),
and a Newman–Keuls post hoc test revealed that the
number of labeled cells was significantly higher in the Pair
group than in the CS Only (P 0.016) or the UNP
(P 0.045) groups, but not higher in the UNP than the CS
Only group (P 0.43). The number of labeled cells in LA
did not differ ipsilaterally versus contralaterally from the
US in the Pair (t10 0.06, P 0.95) or UNP (t7 0.79,
P 0.46) group, indicating that ERK phosphorylation was
not hemispherically lateralized with respect to the US. In

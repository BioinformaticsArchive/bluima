tion kit, and restriction endonucleases were purchased from Stratagene, Inc. (San Diego, CA).
Plasma Membrane Isolation-Bovine brain microvessel plasma
membranes (also called BBB membranes) were prepared from freshly
isolated microvessels as described previously (22) and were stored in
liquid nitrogen in 0.05 M Hepes (pH = 7.4). This plasma membrane
fraction contains virtually all of the microvessel protein kinase activity (23) and insulin receptor sites (24).
Microvessel-depleted bovine brain cell membranes were prepared
as described nreviouslv (23). Brieflv.-. annroximatelv 1 g of fresh bovine
--
brain cortexwas hombgenized in 8 ml of cold 0.32-M sucrose contain-
ing 5 mM Hepes (pH = 7.4). Pial membrane was removed prior to
homogenization in a tissue grinder and centrifugation at 1000 X g for
10 min at 4 “C. This pellet (Pl), which contains the microvessels, was
discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10
min at 4 “C. This pellet of synaptosomal membranes, desirrnated P2,
was suspended in-1 ml of ?`ES buffer (0.01 M Tris; pH= 7.5, 2%
SDS. 0.1 mM EDTA) for solubilization and subseauent Western blot
analysis. The supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h-at 4 “C at 100,000
x g,-and this pellet of microsomal membranes, designated P3, was
also solubilized in 1 ml of TES buffer. and 0.1 volume of a lo-fold
concentrate of TES buffer was added to the supernatant (cytosol).
Aliquots of P2, P3, and cytosol were removed for measurement of
protein by the method of Lowry et al. (25), and these fractions were
made 5 mM P-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE. The P2 membranes are also called BC membranes and were used in the gel shown
in Fig. 2 or the radioreceptor assay described in Fig. 3 (“Results”).
These BC membranes are >98% depleted of microvessels based on
specific activity measurements of y-glutamyl transpeptidase, a microvessel-specific enzyme (23).
Antiserum Preparation-A rabbit polyclonal antiserum to a synthetic peptide encoding the 13 amino acids at the C terminus of the
GLUT-l isoform (26) was prepared as described previously (27) and
designated anti-CT. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum to purified human
erythrocyte GT was also prepared by injecting 0.25-mg aliquots of
purified human GT (hGT) in complete Freund's adjuvant into rabbits
intradermally followed by serial `boosters, and was designated antihGT. The hGT was nurified from freshlv isolated human red cells
using the method oi Baldwin and Lieihard (28). The hGT was
purified to homogeneity on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue
staining, and it's identity was confirmed by Western blot analysis
using the anti-C-terminal (anti-CT) antiserum.
Western Zmmunoblots-Aliquots of purified hGT (10, 25, 50, 100,
and 250 ng) were applied to 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by
SDS-PAGE. Owing to the tendency of GLUT-l to aggregate in SDS
buffer following boiling (28), no samples were heated prior to application to SDS-PAGE wells. Proteins were blotted to nylon membranes, and the immunoreactive GT was measured with the anti-CT
antiserum using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method (ABC-Elite,
Vector Laboratories) as described previously (27). Standards were
run in duplicate, and the nylon strips, following immunodetection of
hGT, were air-dried and then quantitated with a scanning laser
densitometer. Arbitrary absorption units were plotted uersus the
nanograms of purified hGT fog development of the standard curve,
similar to methods used nreviouslv --bv Sogin and Hinkle (29). Aliquots
I
of (a) microvessel membranes, (b) brain cell membranes (P2 membranes), (c) microsomal membranes (P3 membranes), and (d) cytosol
were also applied to SDS-PAGE gels for subsequent Western immunoblot analysis. The primary anti-CT or anti-hGT antiserum was
used at a dilution of 1500 and exposed to the membranes for 60 min
at room temperature. The final peroxidase development time was
performed at room temperature and restricted to 2.0 min for all
studies.
GT Deglycosylution-N-Linked carbohydrate was removed from
either microvessel or brain cell membranes by treatment with N-glycanse following dialysis of the individual membrane preparations
against 0.01 M Na2HP04 (pH = 8.0). The fractions were evaporated
to dryness and resuspended in 15 ~1 of 0.5% SDS and 0.1 M p-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min at room temperature; 55
~1 of 1.25% Nonidet P-40 and 5 rl of 200 units/ml N-glycanase were
added and incubated overnight at room temperature (30). Controls
used the addition of 5 pl of an enzyme diluent, i.e. 10% glycerol, in
lieu of the N-glycanase. Subsequently, 75 ~1 of a 2-fold concentrate
of SDS samnle buffer was added and, followinn centrifugation, the
samples were applied to polyacrylamihe wells in triplicate; 70 ig of
protein of BBB membranes and 140 &g of protein of synaptosomal or
BC membranes were applied per well.

When slices maintained in high-calcium medium were tested with different
conditioning-testing intervals, it was found that the major effect of adenosine was
at short intervals, with little effect on facilitation at longer intervals. In Fig. 6 results
are shown from a single slice in which the test response was depressed at conditioningtesting intervals less than 50 ms. Although there was a marked effect of adenosine
on the ratio of testing/conditioning responses at intervals less than 90 ms, there was
no significant enhancement of facilitation at longer intervals. This would suggest that
the primary effect of adenosine, at least in high-calcium medium, is to reverse the
depression of test responses at short conditioning-testing intervals.
This conclusion is supported by the results illustrated in Fig. 7, in which the most
striking effects of adenosine are seen at conditioning-testing intervals less than
100 ms. At longer intervals however (Fig. 7B), there was a significant enhancement
in facilitation as well. The degree of facilitation extrapolated from the lines in
Fig. 7 B was statistically significant (72 % for control, v8. 144 % for adenosine;
P < 001), suggesting that the effect of adenosine was not confined solely to the
shorter time points.

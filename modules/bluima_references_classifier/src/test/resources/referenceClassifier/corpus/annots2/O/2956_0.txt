ipsilateral as opposed to the contralateral side in unilaterally
stimulated cats, and in the control unstimulated animals compared with the stimulated ones. Because FLI induction in 5SP did
not exceed that in controls, presumably nociceptive laryngeal
afferents terminating in 5SP (Lucier et al., 1986) may have not
been activated by SLN stimulation. In addition, codeine failed to
reduce FLI in brainstem nuclei implicated in pain integration
(5SP, n.com, and NPBL) (Lant ́eri-Minet et al., 1994). Thus, the
marked FLI reduction observed in stimulated–treated cats likely
resulted from the antitussive properties of codeine rather than its
analgesic properties.
In codeine-control cats, FLI was enhanced in the dorsal vagal
complex. Codeine may have induced FLI via a blood-borne route.
An overdose of codeine activates the emetic reflex via AP (Borison, 1989). FLI in the DM V could have been caused by central
activation of preganglionic vagal neurons by codeine (Kromer,

neurons that project to upper cervical segments formed a single,
large peak shaped like a “crescent” (Figs. 12A, 13A, 14). We
will designate this peak of labeled neurons the lateral upper
cervical peak (UC peak). The rostra1 edge of the lateral UC peak
was located on the precentral gyrus along the area 4/6 border
(Fig. 14). The medial and lateral ends of the lateral UC peak
extended into the anterior bank of the CS (see also Dum and
Strick, 1989, their Fig. 2). A second, much smaller group of
high-density bins with neurons that project to upper cervical
segments was located immediately caudal to the SPcS at the
level of its lateral edge (Figs. 12A, 13A, 14). This second peak
of labeled neurons will be termed the medial UC peak. The area
of cortex occupied by the medial UC peak was less than a 10th
of the area of the lateral UC peak (Table 5).
The high-density bins of area 4 neurons that innervate lower
cervical segments also formed two peaks (Figs. 12B, 13B, 14;
seealso Fig. 7B). Each peak consisted of rostrocaudally oriented
bands that began on the crest of the precentral gyrus and ex-tended well into the anterior bank of the CS. One of the peaks
filled the concavity of the crescent formed by the lateral UC
peak and will be termed the lateral lower cervical peak (lateral
LC peak; Fig. 14). The second peak was located more medially
and was aligned with the lateral edge of the SPcS. This peak

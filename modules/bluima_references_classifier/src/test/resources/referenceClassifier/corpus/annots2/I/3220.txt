display a higher GABA sensitivity than other α subunitcontaining receptors (Knoflach et al., 1996). This effect may
even be exacerbated by the presence of a d subunit because
α6β3d receptors are more sensitive to GABA (EC50 of 0.4 μM)
than those containing a g2 subunit (EC50 of 2 μM; Saxena
and MacDonald, 1996). In addition to a putative relatively
high sensitivity for GABA, α4βd subtypes might be particularly sensitive to modulation by Zn2+. Thus, α4β2g2 receptors are sensitive to Zn2+ despite the presence of a g2 subunit
(Knoflach et al., 1996) and the presence of a d subunit has
been shown to increase Zn2+ sensitivity to α1- or α6-containing receptors (Saxena and MacDonald, 1994, 1996). Furthermore, d-containing receptors exhibit currents of low amplitude, but with a slow rate of desensitization even in the
presence of GABA (Saxena and MacDonald, 1994), suggesting that they might be involved in the generation of longlasting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and consequently
in tonic neuronal inhibition. Such a proposal has received a
recent morphological support as Nusser and coworkers
(1998) have clearly shown that in rat cerebellum all d-containing receptors are located at extrasynaptic sites.
Recent reports (Schwarzer et al., 1997; Brooks-Kayal et al.,
1998) have shown an up-regulation of both α4 and d subunit
immunoreactivities and mRNA levels in dentate gyrus neurons after chemically induced temporal lobe epilepsy in rat. It
is tempting to speculate that an overexpression of α4βd re-ceptor subtype with its putative long-lasting inhibitory po-tential and wide nonsynaptic membrane localization (see
above) may represent an adaptive change to compensate
neuronal hyperexcitability. Future studies are needed to
clarify these issues and to establish the involvement of α4βd
receptors in animal seizure models.
In conclusion, our results show that a heterogeneous complement of GABAA receptors is expressed in rat thalamus
and provides evidence for the existence of α4βd subtype.
Although this receptor subtype accounts for 13% of total
GABAA receptors, its pharmacological and anatomical features may confer it a unique role in monitoring both normal
and hyperactive neuronal networks.

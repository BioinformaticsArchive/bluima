vided that they survive, differentiate into neuronal
phenotypes specificto the site of implantation, and
can functionally replace the lost neurons (Baetge,
1993). But, only a few reports are available where
various types of stem cells have been grafted to the
adult rat brain. Recently, Svendsenet al. (1996)have
shown that purified rat stem cells (generated from
either the embryonicmesencephalon[ofboth rats and
humans] or the striatum of rats) can survive grafting
into the striatum of rats with either ibotenic acid or
nigrostriatal dopamine lesions.Although some of the
grafted stem cells (generated from mesencephalic
tissue) seemed to differentiate into dopamine
neurons, the survival and migration appeared only
modest in this study.
In other studies, Gage et al., 1995a)and Ray et a[.
(1993)usedprecursorcellsisolatedfromtheadultrat
hippocampus for transplantation in intact adult
hippocampus. When maintained in defined medium
containing basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)
in vitro, these cells proliferated and expressed both
neuronal and glial markers (see Ray e~ al., 1993).
Upon transplantation into the adult rat hippocarnpus, many surviving cells located within the
granule cell layer differentiatedinto neurons; the cells
residing outside the granule cell layer exhibited glial
morphology and markers (see Gage et al., 1995a).
These results suggest that the progenitor cells retain
a limited potential for survival and terminal
differentiation into mature glia and neurons when
grafted into the adult rat brain.
Recently, stem cells have also been isolated from
the postnatal hippocampus of both the rat and mouse
brain (Austin, Shetty and Turner, unpublished data).
When exposed to a suitable substrate, cells from
neurospheres were seen to migrate and differentiate
into a large number of both neuron-like and glial-like
cells. Interestingly, cells from some of the larger
hippocampal neurospheres appeared to differentiate
predominantly into neuron-like cells (Fig. 20; Shetty
and Turner, unpublished data). Further characterization of these cells are in progress. When mouse

explanted onto the surface of both intact and
KA-lesioned organotypic hippocampal slices from
postnatal rats, stem cells from neurospheres showed
only modest migration into the surrounding cell
layers; in addition, only a few of the migrated cells
showed neuronal phenotypes when characterized
with MAP-2 immunostaining (Austin, Shetty and
Turner, unpublished data). Thus, the post-lesion
environment in uitro does not appear to be conducive
for enhanced migration and/or differentiationof stem
cells. Additional trophic factors may be required for
differentiation into specific neuronal phenotypes.
Therefore, further studies on the effects of adding
various growth factors in the above organotypic
culture model may provide additional insights on the
capability of these cells for site-specific differentiation.

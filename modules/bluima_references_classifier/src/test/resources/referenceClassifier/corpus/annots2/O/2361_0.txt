Figure 1. Drawings of four CA1 pyramidal cells showing axonal ramifications. The axons have been emphasized in these
drawings. In A, B, C, and D, the axon bifurcates and sends one branch caudally and one branch rostrally. Axon collaterals from
the alveus into strata oriens and pyramidale are present in C and D. Local axon collaterals within the basilar dendritic field are
present in A and D. The axon plexus is partially indicated in A. The arrows are 100 pm in length and point in the caudal direction.

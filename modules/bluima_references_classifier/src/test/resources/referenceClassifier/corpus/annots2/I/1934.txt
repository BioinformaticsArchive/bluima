mate is likely to cause the depression of the positive
wave, the population spike and, in dendritic applications,
of the field EPSP. The similar changes induced by glycine
on the field response may therefore be explained by
activation of NMDA receptors (resulting in strong
depolarization) via synaptically released glutamate. On
the other hand, glycine potentiated the effect of low
glutamate currents but depressed the negative wave on
the field response induced by large amounts of exogenously applied glutamate. It is known that responses to
glutamate decreases following NMDA applications19.
Therefore this depressant effect may have arisen from a
partial desensitization to glutamate action following
strong activation of NMDA receptors by glycine and
large amounts of glutamate. The positivity observed
following glycine, glutamate or NMDLA-induced negative waves on the field response can be explained by
stimulation of the Na+,K+-pump and/or activation of
calcium-activated potassium conductance due to rises in
intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations1Â°'11'31.
In conclusion, our data show that the late negative
wave on the hippocampal field response seen during
iontophoresis of large currents of glutamate is generated
through NMDA receptor/ion channels. This activity can
be induced in all somatic and dendritic layers of the
hippocampus. Glycine appears to be a potent modulator
of NMDA receptors, so that NMDA receptors which are
not significantly involved in low frequency hippocampal
synaptic transmission are activated by synaptically re-leased glutamate under glycine action. This study also
demonstrates that recording of hippocampal field potentials could be a simple method to study the NMDAreceptor function.

Properties of granule cell activation during dynamic
stimulus conditions
Current-clamp recordings from granule cells were next used to
test how the synaptic inputs shape granule cell activation during
patterned ON stimulation. Granule cell responses (Fig. 3a) consisted of barrages of EPSPs along with spikes overriding some of
the EPSPs. On average, granule cells spiked at frequencies be-tween 5 and 10 Hz and showed specific spike-pattern tendencies
that have been observed in vivo (Cang and Isaacson, 2003), for
example, adaptation (spike rate, 10.9 1.3 Hz after the first
stimulus burst vs 4.3 0.4 Hz at later times; n 23; p 0.01) and
stimulus coupling (spike rate, 9.6 0.7 Hz during the first 150 ms
after each stimulus burst vs 4.0 1.3 Hz during the last 75 ms;
n 5; p 0.05). Close examination of the timing of individual
spikes indicated that granule cells spiked very shortly after the
beginning of each EPSP (Fig. 3a, expanded examples, Fig. 3b,
cumulative histogram) and also generally only spiked once for
each EPSP. Across the population of test granule cells, short spike
delays were seen in all cells (Fig. 3c), with the delay being shortest
in cells showing the highest proportion of fast type 2 EPSCs in
voltage clamp ( p 0.0002). The modest (although highly significant) dependence of the spike delay on synaptic kinetics helped
confirm that the upward voltage deflections that led to fast spiking in granule cells were indeed EPSPs, rather than fluctuations in

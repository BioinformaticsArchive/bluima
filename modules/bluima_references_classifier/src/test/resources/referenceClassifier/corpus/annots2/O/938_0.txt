the N mRNA on a molar basis. A transcript of approximately
2.2 kb was also observed in both blots, indicating synthesis of
bicistronic N-U readthrough mRNA. Additional, very faint
bands at 3.7, 5.1, and 6.7 kb suggested small amounts of additional readthrough products, starting with the N gene and
extending up to pentacistronic mRNAs (data not shown).
To assess the presence and genetic diversity of U genes in
other snake paramyxoviruses, FDLV sequences were used to
design RT-PCR primers for amplification of the entire U gene
transcription unit, along with short flanking sequences of the N
and P genes. Two additional snake paramyxovirus isolates,
Gono-GER85 and Biti-CA98, were selected for characterization because partial HN and L gene sequences suggested that
they represent two viral genotypes different from FDLV (2).
The isolates were obtained from the host species Gonosoma
oxycephala and Bitis atropos, which are members of two different major families of snakes. RT-PCR amplification of
genomic RNA from Gono-GER85 and Biti-CA98 generated
products of the expected size for the U gene. Sequence analysis
confirmed that these two additional snake paramyxoviruses
also have U genes in their genomes. Each U gene contained an
intact transcription unit of 604 nt bounded by transcription
start and stop sequences identical to those of the FDLV U
gene (Fig. 1). The flanking N gene transcription stop site, P
gene start site, and trinucleotide intergenic regions were also
identical to those of FDLV (Fig. 1).
The U genes of Gono-GER85 and Biti-CA98 each contained a single ORF with a 3 untranslated region (UTR) of 89
nt, but the 5 UTRs upstream of the ORFs were 14 and 23 nt,
respectively. The ORFs thus encoded proteins of 167 and 164
aa, respectively, with predicted sizes of 19.2 to 19.3 kDa and
basic pI values of 9.6 to 9.9. The nucleotide sequences of the
Gono-GER85 and Biti-CA98 ORFs had 11 and 16% nucleotide divergence from FDLV, respectively, and they had 15%
nucleotide divergence from each other. An alignment of the
deduced U proteins of FDLV, Gono-GER85, and Biti-CA98 is
shown in Fig. 5. The alignment shows that the shorter ORF in
Biti-CA98 is due to the absence of the methionine codon that
starts the ORFs of the other two viruses. The Biti-CA98 ORF
starts three codons later, with an AUG codon that is absent in
FDLV and Gono-GER85. The first AUG codon in each of

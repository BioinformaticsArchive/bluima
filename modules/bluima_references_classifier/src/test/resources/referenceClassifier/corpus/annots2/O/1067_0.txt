Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type -synuclein. Animal care
was conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and procedures
were approved by the University of California Los Angeles Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Transgenic mice overexpressing hu-man wild-type -synuclein under the Thy-1 promoter (ASO) were created previously (Rockenstein et al., 2002) and crossed into a mixed
C57BL/6-DBA/2 background. Animals were maintained on the mixed
C57BL/6-DBA/2 background by breeding mutant females with wild-type
males. We found that breeding wild-type females with mutant males
produces fewer progeny.
Only male mice were used in the study. In the first experiment, 24 male
mice (from a total of six litters), including ASO mice (n 7), and their
littermate wild-type controls (n 17) were repeatedly tested at 2, 4, 6,
and 8 months of age in tests of motor performance and coordination,
sensory neglect, and spontaneous activity. Gait was measured at 8
months of age in these mice. Two separate cohorts of male mice were
used to measure bin cotton use, a test of fine motor skills, at 4 (ASO, 4;
wild type, 4) and 8 (ASO, 4; wild type, 8) months of age. Additional
groups of male ASO (n 14 for pole; n 5 for inverted grid) and
wild-type (n 15 for pole; n 9 for inverted grid) mice were tested on
the pole and inverted grid tests at 3– 4 months of age. The genotype of all
ASO and wild-type mice was verified with PCR analysis of tail DNA.
Animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with free access to
water and food and were group housed with littermates of the same sex
(maximum of four per cage).
Body weight. Body weights (in grams) were measured before behavioral testing at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age.
Challenging beam traversal (motor performance and coordination). Mo-tor performance was measured with a novel beam test adapted from
traditional beam-walking tests (Drucker-Col ́ın and Garcia-Hernandez,
1991; Carter et al., 1999; Dluzen et al., 2001; Goldberg et al., 2003). The
beam was constructed from Plexiglas (Plastics Zone, Woodland Hills,
CA) and consisted of four sections (25 cm each, 1 m total length), each
section having a different width. The beam started at a width of 3.5 cm
and gradually narrowed to 0.5 1 cm increments. Underhanging ledges
(1 cm width) were placed 1.0 cm below the upper surface of the beam.
Animals were trained to traverse the length of the beam starting at the
widest section and ending at the narrowest, most difficult section. The
narrow end of the beam led directly into the animal's home cage. Animals
received 2 d of training before testing, and all training was performed
without the mesh grid. On the first day, animals received two assisted
trials, which involved placing the animal on the beam and positioning the
home cage in close proximity to the animal. This encouraged forward
movement along the beam. After two assisted trials, animals were able to
traverse the entire length of the beam unassisted. Day one of training
ended after all animals completed five unassisted runs across the entire
length of the beam. On day 2 of training, animals were required to run
five trials. To increase difficulty further, on the day of the test, a mesh grid
(1 cm squares) of corresponding width was placed over the beam surface
leaving a 1 cm space between the grid and the beam surface. The un-derhanging ledges provided a support or “crutch” for the animal to use
when a limb slipped on the grid (Schallert et al., 2002) and permits
assessment of a deficit chronically so that the mice do not need to use
compensatory motor strategies to complete the task (Schallert et al.,

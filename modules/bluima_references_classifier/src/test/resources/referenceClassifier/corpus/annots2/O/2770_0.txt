Our previous studies showed a significant number of
differences in central noradrenergic function between
DIO- and DR-prone rats. DIO-prone rats have de-creased NE turnover in the VMN, dorsomedial nucleus,
and lateral hypothalamus, whereas endogenous NE
levels are decreased in the PVN (18). These presynaptic
differences in NE metabolism are associated with wide-

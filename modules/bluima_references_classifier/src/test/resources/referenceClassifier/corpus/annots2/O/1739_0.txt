Fig. 1. GAD expression in the postnatal OB. (A) The immunohistochemistry for GAD is present in gl, grl and plexiform layers (upper box). However,
note the absence of GAD immunolabeling in the SVZ/RMS (lower box). (B) A higher magnification of the lower box in A showing no immunoexpression
for GAD. (C) A higher magnification of the OB layers boxed in A showing GAD immunoexpression in all layers except mitral cell layer. The insets in
C show cellular patterns found in the GRL (left) and GL (right). (D) A scheme of a saggital slice of the postnatal rat forebrain showing the region of
the SVZ/RMS dissected in our biochemical assays (in gray). Scale bars 200 m in A, in B and C 50 m; gl, glomerular layer; grl, granular cell layer;
CC, corpus callosum; GRL, granular layer; LV, lateral ventricle.

1980; Huisman et al., 1983; Kuypers and Huisman, 1984; Cond ́e, 1987),
we defined zone I as the central region surrounding the needle track that
contained an almost solid mass of fluorescent material. Zone II contained large numbers of intensely fluorescent neurons and glia amid a
bright background of fluorescence. Zone II gradually changed into zone
III that contained some background tissue fluorescence and weakly
fluorescent neurons and glia. The effective area of uptake and transport
of these tracers is considered to be confined to zones I and II (Bentivoglio et al., 1980; Huisman et al., 1983; Kuypers and Huisman, 1984;
Cond ́e, 1987). Therefore, the maps of the injection sites (Figs. 1, 2) only
illustrate these two zones.
HSV1. Three concentric zones of labeling surrounded each virus
injection site. Zone I contained the needle track and the highest density
of viral staining and pathology. In some instances, the tissue in this zone
disintegrated during tissue processing. Zone II contained a dense accumulation of infected neurons and glia, as well as a high degree of
background staining. Z one III contained large numbers of labeled neurons but little or no background staining. There is evidence that the
actual zone of uptake for transneuronal transport of HSV1 is limited to
zone I (for discussion of this issue, see Strick and Card, 1992; Hoover
and Strick, 1999). Because this issue is not resolved, we included both
zones I and II in our reconstructions of injection sites (Figs. 1, 2).

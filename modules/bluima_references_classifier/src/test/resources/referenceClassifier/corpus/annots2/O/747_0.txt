analysed in the 8-OH-DPAT and saline test condition
for both the target and non-target subgroups.
In the 8-OH-DPAT test condition a significant
difference was found between the target subgroups or
between one or more of the target subgroups and the
sham group (P B/0.0001; Fig. 3). AVc was significantly
higher in the stimON target subgroup (92.2%) than in
the lesion (79.3%; P 0/0.006) and stimOFF (54.2%; P B/
0.0001) target subgroup and the sham group (61.2%;
P B/0.0001). In addition, AVc was significantly higher
in the lesion target subgroup than in the stimOFF target
subgroup (P B/0.0001) and sham group (P 0/0.0001). A
significant difference also emerged (P 0/0.03; Fig. 4)
between the non-target subgroups or between one or
more of the non-target subgroups and the sham group
(percentages varied between 61 and 86%). AVc was
significantly higher in the stimON (92.2%; P 0/0.008)
and stimOFF (54.2%; P 0/0.04) target subgroup than in
the sham group (61.2%).
The saline test condition revealed significant differences between the target subgroups or between one or
more of the target subgroups and the sham group (P 0/
0.0008; Fig. 3). AVc was significantly higher in the
lesion target subgroup (93.6%) than in the stimON
(81.5%; P 0/0.005) and stimOFF (70.8%; P 0/0.001)
target subgroup and the sham group (74.5%; P 0/
0.003). No significant differences were found between
the non-target subgroups or between one or more of the
non-target subgroups and the sham group (P 0/0.16;
Fig. 4) (percentages varying between 68 and 91%).

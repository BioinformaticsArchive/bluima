ed, increases in neostriatal ascorbate and also induce be-havioral hyperactivity through nondopaminergic mechanisms. Conversely, NMDA antagonist-induced increases in
nigrostriatal dopamine synthesis, as reflected through
changes in neostriatal DOPAC, appear to be regulated by
NMDA receptors located in the substantia nigra. These re-sults provide support for a functional link between neostriatal glutamate and ascorbate and suggest that neostriatal
glutamate release inhibits the behavioral output of the basal
ganglia.

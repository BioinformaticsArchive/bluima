The requirement for dopamine secretion from neurons projecting
from the midbrain to the corpus striatum for the initiation and
organization of motor function has been recognized since the
introduction of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy
for parkinsonism (Birkmayer and Hornykiewicz, 1961; Hornykiewicz, 1966; Cotzias et al., 1967). Lesioning experiments in
rodents and primates using the catecholaminergic neurotoxins,
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), or the monaminergic synaptic vesicle depleting agent, reserpine, have confirmed the specific role of
dopamine in motor coordination (Fischer and Heller, 1967; Un-gerstedt, 1968; Ungerstedt et al., 1974; Goldstein et al., 1975;
Langston et al., 1983, 1984). In these neurotransmitter depletion
experiments, it was also noted that the long-term removal of
dopamine resulted in enhanced sensitivity to the neurotransmitter itself. When rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of nigrostriatal neurons were treated with dopamine receptor agonists, ro-tational locomotion was induced away from the lesioned side
(Ungerstedt and Arbuthnott, 1970; Ungerstedt, 1971a,b). Ungerstedt and coworkers hypothesized that removal of dopaminergic
input to one side of the striatum sensitized ipsilateral postsynaptic
neurons and led to an imbalanced response to dopaminergic
compounds from the two sides of the striatum.

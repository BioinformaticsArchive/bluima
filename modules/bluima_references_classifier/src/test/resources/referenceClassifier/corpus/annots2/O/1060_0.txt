Fig. 2. Alterations in the hippocampal NGF concentration at 4 days
after an intracerebroventricular kainic acid (KA) administration in the
three age groups of animals (n 5â€“ 6/group). Note that, in comparison
with that in the age-matched intact hippocampus, the overall concentration of hippocampal NGF increases significantly after KA-induced
injury (two-way ANOVA, F 47.0, P 0.0001). Bonferroni posttests
demonstrate that the increase observed after KA lesion is significant in
all three age groups. Furthermore, a direct comparison reveals no
differences in the concentration of NGF among the three age groups
after KA-induced injury. However, the concentration of NGF is
greater in the intact aged hippocampus in comparison with the intact
young hippocampus. *P 0.05, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001.

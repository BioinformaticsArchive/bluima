Adenosine is an endogenous modulator of synaptic functions
in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in the peripheral
system. The effect is mediated by two major subtypes of
receptors: adenosine A, receptors, which exhibit higher affinity
to adenosine and inhibit adenylyl cyclase, and A2 receptors,
which exhibit lower affinity to adenosine and stimulate adeny
lyl cyclase. Recent advances in molecular biology and pharma
cology have demonstrated the presence of at least five subtypes,
i.e., A,, A2a, A2b, A3 and A4 receptors. They act with guanosine
triphosphate-binding proteins and are coupled not only to

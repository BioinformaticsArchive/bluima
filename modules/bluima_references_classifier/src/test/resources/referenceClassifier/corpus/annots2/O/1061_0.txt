human V1 is doing significantly less work. There must be
some other explanation that accounts for the human ma-caque difference in V1 over total cortex volume.
Another possibility is that scaling might reflect the ge-ometry of information representation. The most specific
version of this theory is the V1-LGN hypothesis discussed
above. But information representation has the potential to
be a general explanation for scaling in the brain. One
could imagine that in the same way that the information
represented by V1 causes it to scale up relative to LGN,
extrastriate areas might scale up relative to V1. To pursue
this further will require thought about the nature of in-formation processing in areas such as V2 and V4 compared with V1.
This study discussed several aspects of V1 evolution in
primates and added to a growing body of evidence for
unique anthropoid adaptations in V1. Also, it was confirmed that V1 scales with positive allometry relative to
LGN, and negative allometry relative to most of the brain.
A better knowledge of information processing in V1 would
contribute enormously to an understanding of both of
these topics. Fortunately, substantial resources continue
to be put into studying V1. In the future, it should be
possible to understand anthropoid-strepsirrhine differences on a very detailed level. Relating this understanding
to differences in behavior and ecology between the two
groups is an exciting prospect. Similarly, better knowledge of V1's workings should greatly clarify the puzzle of
scaling.

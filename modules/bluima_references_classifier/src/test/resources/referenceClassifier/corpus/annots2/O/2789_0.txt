On neonatal spinal cord sections, all types of
neurons emitted dense neuritic arborizations on all
tissue structures encountered, including the medullar
parenchyma and the surrounding connective tissue
(see Fig. 4A,B). Quantification of total neurite
extension per neuron, performed for chick sensory
neurons, revealed a range from 70 up to 2500 #m
with a mean value of 622 _ 56/am. The mean value
of the longest neurite elaborated was 255 + 22 #m
(Table 2).
Analysis by confocal microscopy of cryocultures,
using anti-N-CAM antibodies to stain neurons and
anti-laminin antibodies to decorate basal laminae,
demonstrated that most neurites extended directly
onto the spinal cord parenchyma, independently of
laminin-rich areas (Fig. 2A,B). Careful analysis of
several sections demonstrated that neurite growth
was homogeneous over the entire profile of the

A transverse section and at this stage did not reveal the
existence of spinal cord areas preferentially supporting, or inhibiting, growth. However, in some cases
where neurites contacted ECM-rich structures such
as blood vessels or the connective tissue sheath
surrounding the spinal cord, evidenced by their in- tense laminin immunoreactivity, growing neurites
followed these structures closely (Fig. 2B). In extreme
instances, when cell bodies attached in the immediate
vicinityofabloodvessel,mostneuriteoutgrowthwas
restricted to the area of the blood vessel (Fig. 2C). No
significant difference was observed in the patterns of
neurite extension between sensory and sympathetic
neurons. We can deduce from these observations that
the neonatal spinal cord parenchyma presents highly
7 permissive cues recognized by both sensory and sympathetic neurons.

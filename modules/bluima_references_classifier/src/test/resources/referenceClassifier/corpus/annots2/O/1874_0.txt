recently described test of imaginal neglect asks
subjects to determine the midpoint of a “mental number line,” an analogical left-to-right–
oriented representation of numbers in ascending order.25 When determining which numeral
occurs halfway between number pairs of various intervals, patients with neglect err toward
larger numbers (e.g., stating that the number
halfway between 6 and 12 is 10). Analogous to
performance on standard line bisection tasks,
the magnitude of error varies in proportion to
the size of the internumeric interval.26
Because patients may exhibit spatial bias on
some tasks but perform normally on others, it
has been recommended that batteries to identify spatial neglect and classify its severity contain a variety of subtests.15,27,28 From a clinical standpoint, administering multiple types of
assessment improves sensitivity in identifying
spatial bias. Also, studies characterizing HSN
over the last three decades have documented
a remarkable number of dissociations, between
every preceding method mentioned, that suggest the existence of separable spatial neglect
subtypes. For example, patients may omit leftsided targets from cancellation arrays while
bisecting lines adequately and vice versa.29
Double dissociations have been also been re-ported between physical and mental line bi-section, between extinction of left-sided stimuli and bias on paper-and-pencil tasks, and
between representational neglect and performance on a battery of clinical neglect tests,
to name but a few.30–32 These observations re-fer only to within-subject performance discrepancies between different measures of neglect.
However, the validity of dissociable behavioral
features in spatial neglect has been substantiated through observation of within-task dissociations based on reference frame, stage of
processing, and distance.

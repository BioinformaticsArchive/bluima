In an attempt to prevent the negative effects seen in long-term
running on hippocampal progenitor proliferation and stress re-sponses in experiment 1, we restricted running activity in experiment 2 using a locking system to allow only 6 km of free wheel
running per 24 h for 24 days. Body weights did not differ between
nonrunners (192.5 3.9 g) and long-term runners (193.0 4.4g).
However, there was a significant increase in body weight seen in
locked-wheel runners (215.0 3.9 g) versus nonrunners (192.5
3.9 g) and long-term runners (193.0 4.4 g; P 0.01), respectively. Rats in both running groups quickly found the running
wheels and by day 4 the locked-wheel group had reached 6 km/24
h, and that distance was achieved each day by all rats until day 24.
Long-term runners without the locking device followed a similar
pattern as in experiment 1, and by 2 wk, had stabilized their

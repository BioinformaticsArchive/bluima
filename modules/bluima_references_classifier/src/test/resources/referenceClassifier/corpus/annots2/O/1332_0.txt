Abstract
The neuropeptide galanin suppresses seizure activity in the
hippocampus by inhibiting glutamatergic neurotransmission.
Galanin may also modulate limbic seizures through interaction with other neurotransmitters in neuronal populations
that project to the hippocampus. We examined the role of
galanin receptors types 1 and 2 in the dorsal raphe (DR) in
the regulation of serotonergic transmission and limbic seizures. Infusion of a mixed agonist of galanin receptors
types 1 and 2 [galanin (1â€“29)] into the DR augmented the
severity of limbic seizures in both rats and wild-type mice
and concurrently reduced serotonin concentration in the DR
and hippocampus as measured by immunofluorescence or
HPLC. In contrast, injection of the galanin receptor type 2

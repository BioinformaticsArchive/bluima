present study, we have extended our analysis to the at-risk neurons in this location. We found clear evidence for the ectopic
expression of the cell cycle proteins PCNA and cyclin B in the
large neurons of this structure (Fig. 1C,D). As described previously for hippocampus, dorsal raphe, and locus coeruleus, the
fraction of the total neurons that were stained was small. This has
been interpreted as a reflection that not all neurons are in the
process of cell death at any one time. Rather, only the dying

study after giving written informed consent as approved by
the Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric
Institute Institutional Review Boards. Basic demographic
information, past psychiatric and treatment history, family
history, and developmental history were acquired using the
Columbia Baseline Demographic Form. This form also
systematically asks about physical and sexual abuse in
childhood (before the age of 15 years). One subject who was
subsequently found to be on medication at the time of the
MRI scan was excluded, as were seven subjects with
diagnosed bipolar disorder.

FIG. 6. (a,b) Distribution of mRNA (left) and
protein (right) for the a1G voltage-dependent
calcium channel subunit in the midbrain.
Numbers in parentheses indicate distance from
the interaural line (Paxinos & Watson, 1996).
Filled areas indicate regions of intense staining;
heavily stippled areas indicate regions of
moderate staining; lightly stippled areas
indicate regions of weak staining. Stars indicate
regions where a1G-IR or mRNA expression was
observed in dispersed large cells.

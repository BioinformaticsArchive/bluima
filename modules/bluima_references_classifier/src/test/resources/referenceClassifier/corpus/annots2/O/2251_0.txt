FIG. 2. Composite profiles of the spatial and temporal limits of direction selectivity for each of several apparent
speeds. Each curve indicates the points for which neurons, on average, met a particular criterion level of the direction
index (see key). Vertical bars indicate standard errors for each point. The number of neurons for which data were
obtained at each speed is shown below the abscissa in C (MT) and D (Vl). A: spatial limits for MT neurons; B:
spatial limits for V 1 neurons; C temporal limits for MT neurons; D: temporal limits for Vl neurons.

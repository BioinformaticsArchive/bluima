Post-traumatic visual loss occurs in 0.7-5% of all cases
of closed head trauma [4,5,7,8]. The canalicular portion of
the optic nerve is most commonly the side of damage. The
optic nerve may be injured by several mechanisms, such as
stretching, torsion, shock wave, hemorrhage, edema, or
external pressure resulting from bone fracture; all may
lead to microvascular hemorrhage, compressive edema, or
both. The optic nerve dysfunction may appear immediately after trauma, but there can sometimes be a delay of
days or weeks [5,7].
The patient presented with markedly delayed rightsided visual loss 10 weeks after a vehicular accident,
although the neurologic evaluation performed immediately after the accident was normal. After head trauma the
diagnosis of visual loss may be delayed if the patient is
unconscious or is unable to report on the clinical situation

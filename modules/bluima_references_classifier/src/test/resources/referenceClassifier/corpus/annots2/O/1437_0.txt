Experimental design

In the first series of experiments, a left SNI or a sham control was
produced. Fourteen days after SNI (n 5) or sham control (n 5),
sections of the spinal cord were stained immunohistochemically
for CREB and pCREB.
In the second series of experiments, intrathecal catheters
were placed in rats. After 5â€“7 days, the SNI neuropathic pain
model was induced. Fourteen days after SNI, saline or one of the
following oligonucleotides was administrated intrathecally: (1) sa-line control (n 6); (2) CREB sense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)
control (40 g/day, n 6); (3) CREB antisense ODN with different
doses (10 g/day, n 5; 20 g/day, n 5; 40 g/day, n 5). The

Immunofluorescence labeling
After 10 days, Retrobeads-injected rats, and after 7
days, FluoroGold-injected rats were perfused intracardially with 150 –200 ml of 4% cold paraformaldehyde
and the brains were removed and frozen. Forty-five- m
thick free-floating slices were cut in a cryostat. Brain
slices from Retrobeads-injected animals were doubleimmunostained for the 7 nicotinic subunit receptor
and serotonin. Briefly, free-floating sections were
washed for 10 min in TBS and unmasked with a boiling
solution of 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Sections were blocked for nonspecific binding of secondary
antibody through a 1-h incubation at room temperature (RT) in a solution containing 2% goat serum, 2%
bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% triton in TBS. Sections were then incubated for three nights at 4°C with
a monoclonal mouse antibody against 7 (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO; 1:1,000) and a polyclonal rabbit antibody
against serotonin (Sigma,1:1,000). After washing in the
blocking solution sections were again incubated for 1 h
at RT with a Cy5 coupled goat-antimouse antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 1:200),
and a Bodipy coupled goat-antirabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The slices were washed in
TBS, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and covered
with Fluoromount.
Brain slices from FluoroGold-injected animals were
double-immunostained with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against FluoroGold (Chemicon, Temecula, CA;
1:3,000) and a monoclonal mouse antibody against the
7-nicotine receptor subunit (Sigma; 1:1,000), following the same procedure described above.
Controls were performed accordingly, except that ad-dition of 7/serotonin/FluoroGold primary antibodies
were left out. Omission of the primary antibodies abol-

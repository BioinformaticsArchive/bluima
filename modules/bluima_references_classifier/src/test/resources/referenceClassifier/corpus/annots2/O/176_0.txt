Figure 4. Fos-positive nuclei /0.1 mm 2 (6SEM) in brain regions that
exhibited enhanced Fos protein expression by the priming injections. The
data are collapsed across conditioning groups. *p < 0.05, represents a
difference from the respective group receiving exposure to the environment only; Fisher's L SD test. Cpu, C audate putamen; EC, entorhinal
cortex; CeA, central amygdala; L A, lateral amygdala; Arc, arcuate nucleus;
CG, central gray area.

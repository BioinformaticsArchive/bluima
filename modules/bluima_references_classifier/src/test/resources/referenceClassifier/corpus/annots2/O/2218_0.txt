In many regions of the brain such treatment appears to have no effect on dopaminergicneurons.JonssonandSachs13foundnochangesindopamine(DA)concentration in the septum, neostriatum, hypothalamus or mesencephalon. Less is
known about the response of cortical dopaminergic fibers, and there are disagreements
in the literature about the effects of neonatal 6-OHDA on cortical tyrosine hydroxylase
(TOH) activity. Peterson and Laverty17,is have found no changes in TOH activity in
thecerebralcortex,whileJonssonandSachs13havereportedareductionofabout70~.
Part of the discrepancy may be caused by differences in the cortical regions sampled,
as TOH present in dopaminergic terminals would interfere with the observation of
changesinTOHinnoradrenergicterminals,andviceversa22.Innoneoftheprevious
studies was an attempt made to differentiate between the effects of neonatal 6-OHDA
treatment on cortical noradrenergic and dopaminergic projections. This study was
initiated in an attempt to make such a differentiation. Use was made of electrolytic
lesions in the locus coeruleus to ensure complete destruction of telencephalic noradrenergic nerve terminals and thus unmask cortical DA and TOH associated with
the mesocortical dopaminergic projections. It was found that the drug treatment
completely destroyed cortical noradrenergic fibers and their associated TOH activity,
but had no observable effect on dopaminergic terminals in the cingulate gyrus and
prefrontal cortex.

Figure 2. Loss of LTP in the ACC and LA in FMR1 KO mice. A, Diagram of an ACC slice showing
the placement of whole-cell patch recording (Rec) and stimulation (Stim) electrodes. LTP was
induced by 80 pulses at 2 Hz with postsynaptic holding at 30 mV. Cg, Cingulate cortex. B, LTP
was induced in ACC pyramidal neurons in adult WT mice (n 9 slices/5 mice). C, LTP was lost in
ACC pyramidal neurons of adult FMR1 KO mice (n 8 slices/6 mice). D, Diagram of a slice
showing the placement of whole-cell patch recording and stimulation electrode in the LA. E, LTP
was induced in LA pyramidal neurons in adult WT mice (n 7 slices/6 mice). F, LTP was lost in
LA pyramidal neurons in adult FMR1 KO mice (n 8 slices/4 mice). The insets show averaged
EPSCs at 5 and 25 min after the pairing procedure (arrows). Error bars indicate SE.

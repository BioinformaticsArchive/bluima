Deprivation procedure

Maternal deprivation took place in a separate room in the animal
facility under similar light and temperature conditions as mentioned
previously. Mothers were removed from their home cages 24 h prior
to the day of experimentation. The home cage, containing the litter,
was then placed on a heating pad maintained at 30â€“33 C for 24 h.
Neither food nor water was available during the deprivation period.
Non-deprived litters remained undisturbed with their mothers until the
time of testing. Maternal deprivation or non-deprivation are referred to
as `condition'.

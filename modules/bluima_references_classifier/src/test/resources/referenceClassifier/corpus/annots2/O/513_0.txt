Figure 2. Nicotinic receptor-mediated responses of FS interneurons. A, L ocal pressure application of ACh (5 mM; 40 msec duration; thick bar) induced
a depolarization (ACh) that was blocked by bath application of 5 M M EC. There was partial recovery after washing for 40 min. Note that the experiment
was conducted in the presence of C NQX and APV. B, L ocal pressure application of 5 mM ACh (thick bar) evoked a depolarization (ACh) that was
primarily unaffected by bath application of 100 nM ML A but was almost completely blocked by subsequent application of 1 M M EC. C, As a positive
control, the effectiveness of ML A was tested on the nicotinic depolarization evoked by local pressure application of 5 mM carbachol (thick bar) on a
hippocampal stratum radiatum interneuron. The strong depolarization and firing of action potentials (top trace; action potentials truncated as a result
of averaging) were completely blocked by bath application of 10 nM ML A, demonstrating the potency of the antagonist. D, Bath application of 100 M
carbachol depolarized a silent FS interneuron by 44 mV and induced irregular bursty firing. The firing was maintained for the duration of the drug
application ( 10 min).

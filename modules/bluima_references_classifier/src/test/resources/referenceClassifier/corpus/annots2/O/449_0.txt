Note. Membranes were incubated with and without 0.33 mM arachidonic acid in the presence and absence (control) of FFA, MAG, or
DAG in the concentrations listed, diluted with buffer A, and determined for basal adenylylcyclase activity. Data are the mean 6 S.D.
of four determinations: ap < 0.01; bp < 0.001; and cp < 0.05, as
compared to the control.

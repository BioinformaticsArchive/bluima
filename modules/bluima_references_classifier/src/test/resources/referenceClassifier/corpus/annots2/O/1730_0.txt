both the PFC and the NAc. Lavin et al. (2005)
showed in adult rats that electrical or chemical stimulation of the VTA in vivo evokes
TH: tyrosine
glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potenhydroxylase
tials (EPSPs) in PFC neurons. Likewise, in
a mouse in vitro preparation, Chuhma et al.
(2004) showed that VTA stimulation evoked
glutamatergic EPSCs in NAc neurons. Be-cause glutamate acting at ligand-gated channels can produce fast EPSPs, the presence
of these glutamatergic projections increases
the likelihood that temporally precise information is conveyed by phasic activity of VTA
neurons.
One intriguing possibility raised by these
studies is that glutamate is a cotransmitter in
some dopaminergic VTA projection neurons.
Cultured VTA neurons form autapses, thus
permitting selective stimulation and intracellular recording of synaptic responses in the
same neuron. Under these conditions, glutamatergic EPSPs were evoked and enhanced
by the D2 antagonist sulpiride (which presumably blocked autoreceptor-mediated in-hibition of transmitter release). This result
indicates that dopamine and glutamate were
released by the same neuron (Sulzer et al.
1998). However, whether dopaminergic neurons release glutamate in vivo in adult animals is uncertain. In fact, direct colabeling
for vesicular glutamate transporters and TH
yields virtually no (Yamaguchi et al. 2007) or a
low rate of colocalization, limited to the most
medial parts of the VTA (Kawano et al. 2006).
Furthermore, ultrastructural evidence indicates that dopaminergic synapses are largely
symmetrical (inhibitory) in the PFC and NAc
(e.g., Seguela et al. 1988, Totterdell & Smith
1989). These anatomical results demonstrate
that, in addition to GABA and dopamine neurons, there is a separate and significant population of glutamatergic VTA neurons.

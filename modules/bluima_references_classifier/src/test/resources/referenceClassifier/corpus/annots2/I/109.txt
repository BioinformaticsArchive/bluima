increased production of NO by endothelial cells can
protect the tissue by improving the microcirculation15.
Mitochondria, which are an important source of
reactive oxygen species, are impaired by free-radicalmediated disruption of the inner mitochondrial membrane and the oxidation of proteins that mediate electron transport, H+ extrusion and ATP production16. The
mitochondrial membrane becomes leaky, partly owing
to the formation of a mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which promotes mitochondrial swelling, the
cessation of ATP production and an oxygen free-radical
burst17. Cytochrome C is released from mitochondria18
and provides a trigger for apoptosis (see below).
The haemodynamic, metabolic and ionic changes
described above do not affect the ischaemic territory
homogeneously. In the centre or core of the perfusion
deficit (Fig. 3), cerebral blood flow is 20% below normal19. Permanent and anoxic depolarization develops
minutes after the onset of ischaemia. Cells are killed
rapidly by lipolysis, proteolysis, the disaggregation of
microtubules that follows total bioenergetic failure and
the ensuing breakdown of ion homeostasis20. Between

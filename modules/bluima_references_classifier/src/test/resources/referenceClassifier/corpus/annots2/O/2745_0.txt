brain (4), and their scattered distribution from the hypothalamus to the olfactory bulb (5, 44).
In humans the GnRH gene consists of four exons and three
introns (6 â€“11), and its expression is limited to a small number
of neurons in the brain, to gonadal and mammary tissue (12),
and to human placental tissue (10, 13). Interestingly, GnRH
expression displays a tissue specificity since the initiation site
for placental GnRH expression is different than the initiation
site for hypothalamic GnRH expression (10, 13). Recently,
transgenic technology has given researchers the tools to study
physiological and molecular aspects of the GnRH neuron. By
targeting the SV40 T antigen oncogene to mouse GnRH neurons using the rat (GT1 cells (14)) or human (GN11 and NLT
cells (15)) GnRH promoter, it has been possible to obtain a
number of transformed GnRH-releasing cell lines. These cells
possess a neuronal morphology, express and release GnRH,
and respond to secretagogues in a manner consistent with that
seen in GnRH neurons in vivo and in vitro. These cell lines
have proven to be invaluable for studying the regulation of
GnRH expression (16), processing (17), and release (18, 19) and
for examining the electrophysiological properties of GnRH
neurons (20, 21).
It is not clear at this time, however, what transcription
factors or cis-regulatory elements are important for initiating
and regulating the hypothalamic expression of hGnRH. The
studies performed by our group using -1131 bp of the hGnRH
promoter to target tumorigenesis in transgenic mice had ap-peared to transform only GnRH neurons (15), suggesting that
this region of the hGnRH promoter was sufficient to direct gene
expression to the GnRH neuron. However, since these neurons
may not have completely differentiated before they were transformed and did not migrate to their final location in the forebrain, it was unclear whether this portion of the hGnRH promoter was actually the minimal promoter needed to
appropriately direct and regulate the normal expression of
GnRH.
We therefore sought to target expression of the luciferase
reporter gene (22) with fragments of the promoter for the
hGnRH gene. The luciferase gene is an extremely sensitive
reporter, which is a quality necessary for use in the study of the
physiological and developmental regulation of the sparsely distributed GnRH neurons. By linking various portions of the
GnRH promoter to a luciferase reporter and creating transgenic animals with these constructs, it has been possible to
examine the anatomical pattern of expression of luciferase as
an assay of hGnRH promoter activity. Series of anatomical and
physiological analyses have illustrated that luciferase expression that is driven by a sufficient segment of the hGnRH
promoter is correlated with the expression of the endogenous
GnRH gene. These studies localize a cis-regulatory region be-tween -1131 and -484 bp upstream of the GnRH gene, which
is essential for the appropriate expression of GnRH in the

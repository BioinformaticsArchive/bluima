and related acidic amino acids, and the equally powerful
inhibitory actions of GABA and related omega amino
acids (Fig. 6B). The quick time course of action, especially
when compared with the slow and prolonged excitation
produced by acetylcholine on the same cells, and the
minute amounts of amino acid needed to induce or block
neuronal firing seemed just what would be expected of
synaptic transmitters. In view of the abundance of both
glutamate and GABA in the brain – which guaranteed a
ready supply – and their active uptake from extracellular
space – which would account for the quickly reversible
actions – Krnjevic ́ & Phillis (1963) concluded that these
amino acids were probably the main central synaptic transmitters, about which there had been so much speculation.
For some years, unsupported by further evidence, this idea
gained little in popularity.

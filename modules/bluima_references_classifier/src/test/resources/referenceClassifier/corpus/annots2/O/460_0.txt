Figure 3. Spatial reference memory in BSP1/neuropsin mutant and control mice. A, Graph showing the mean latency of escape of BSP1/neuropsin mutant mice (open circles; n 8) and wild-type littermate controls
(closed circles; n 8) against trial day. Both groups show a significant
interaction between latency and trial day, indicating learning (ANOVA,
p 0.05). No significant interaction between latency and genotype was
found (ANOVA, p 0.05). B, Results of the second transfer test showing
the average percentage of time spent in the training quadrant (Train) and
the adjacent right (Adj/R), adjacent left (Adj/L), and opposite (Opp)
quadrants for BSP1/neuropsin mutant animals (open vertical bar) and
wild-type littermate controls (solid vertical bar). A pronounced preference
for the training quadrant is demonstrated in both groups (ANOVA, p
0.05) but with no significant difference between genotypes (ANOVA, p
0.05).

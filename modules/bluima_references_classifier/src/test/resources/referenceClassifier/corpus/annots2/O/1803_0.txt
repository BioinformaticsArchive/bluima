Withdrawal responses to mechanical stimulation
following repeated injections of pH 5.0 saline into
the masseter muscle
Since the sensitivity of the ASIC3 channels in trigeminal
ganglion may be at a tissue pH higher than that resulted
from injections of pH 4.0 or pH 3.0 (Connor et al., 2005),
we tested behavioral responses after injecting pH 5.0 sa-

main targets of dopaminergic neurones in the VTA. The
role of CREB in cocaine reward has been investigated by
inducing the overexpression of the gene for CREB in
the nucleus accumbens using an HSV-1 amplicon48. On
the basis of a place-preference protocol, it has been found
that virus-induced CREB overproduction decreased the
rewarding properties of cocaine and made low doses
of the drug aversive. Furthermore, oversynthesis of a
dominant-negative mutant CREB (containing a single
point mutation that prevents its phosphorylation and
transactivation) increased the rewarding effects of
cocaine. Both these behavioural effects had a transient
timecourse that paralleled that of transgene expression.
Thus, upregulation of CREB-mediated transcription in
the nucleus accumbens might counteract adaptations
that intensify cocaine reward.
Pain
The amygdaloid complex is thought to participate in
opioid-induced antinociception49. In order to evaluate
the role of amygdala opioids in the modulation of nociception, a replication-defective (ICP4-) HSV-1 vector
carrying the preproenkephalin gene under control of the
human cytomegalovirus promoter has been injected in
the rat amygdala50. Four days after gene delivery, nociceptive behaviour was assessed by injecting formalin
into the hind paw. Rats that were previously injected
with this preproenkephalin vector, but not those in-jected with the vector backbone or with vehicle, showed
a naloxone-reversible reduction in formalin-induced
flinching behaviour.
Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease
that is characterized by rigidity, akinesia and tremor.
It is a particularly useful disease to use for the study of
the effect of single-gene (over)expression in a selected
brain region, because cellular degeneration is essentially
restricted to the dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that project to the
striatum51.
Several well-characterized models of PD are available
for testing the effect of localized gene transfer. These
models include the local injection of the neurotoxin,
6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) and the systemic
administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). The model on which HSV vectors
have been tested is the unilateral intranigral injection
of 6-OHDA in rats. This procedure causes degeneration
of dopaminergic neurones (hemiparkinsonism) and,
therefore, an unbalance in dopamine (DA) release
and in postsynaptic receptor sensitivities between the
denervated and intact striatum52. These alterations
result in rotational behaviour (contralateral to the lesion
site) after systemic administration of DA-like agents,
such as the direct DA-receptor agonist, apomorphine53.
DA is synthesized from tyrosine by two enzymes. The
first is the rate-limiting enzyme TH, which converts
tyrosine into L-dopa. Functional activity of TH depends
on the availability of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH ), and the enzyme GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GTP-CH1)
4

is crucial for BH synthesis. The second enzyme needed
4

for DA synthesis is aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase
(AADC), which converts L-dopa into DA. AADC is present in sufficient quantities in non-dopaminergic cells,
even in the denervated striatum54. In fact, the main
therapy for PD is oral administration of L-dopa, which
is readily transformed into DA in the striatum51. One
alternative therapeutic approach might be based on

The neurohypophyseal hormone vasopressin (AVP), with wellknown peripheral endocrine functions, has also been postulated
to serve as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter in the CNS.
AVP has been implicated as a neurotransmitter that can enhance
certain forms of learning and memory consolidation (de Wied,
1965). One of the brain areas thought to be involved in learning
and memory processes which is also a suggested site of action
of AVP, is the septum. The lateral septum has been shown by
immunohistochemical techniques to be innervated by AVPcontaining neurons (Sofroniew and Weindl, 198 1). Microinjection of AVP into the dorsal septal nucleus facilitates passive

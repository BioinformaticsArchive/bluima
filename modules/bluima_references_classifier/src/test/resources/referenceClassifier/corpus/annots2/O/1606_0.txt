Mean difference voltages (each deviance minus the standard), within a
window of Â±20 ms around the peak latencies of the group average
deviance-related negativity (N1 / MMN), were measured for each
subject and served as the dependent variable. They were entered into
one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) to assess the
effect of the degree of deviance. These were followed by planned
contrasts (one-tailed Student's t-tests) between adjacent degrees of
deviation (i.e. 10 vs. 20 , 20 vs. 30 ). The one-tailed test is appropriate
as we tested for a specific direction of effect. Linear regression was
performed on the mean group values to determine the slope of the gain
function. To further assess the consistency of the linear relationship
across subjects, a two-stage procedure was performed; first, a linear
regression analysis was performed within each subject, next, the
resultant individual slopes (beta values) were entered into a onesample t-test against zero. Greenhouse-Geisser (G-G) correction was
used where indicated; the G-G epsilon is indicated where it is smaller

peptides and iron (Keller et al. 1998), reduced expression of
MnSOD by selective inactivation of the MnSOD gene
sensitized cultured mouse cortical neurons to glutamateinduced neurotoxicity (Li et al. 1998), and overexpression of
MnSOD provided dramatic protection against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and NO toxicity in cortical culture
(Gonzalez-Zulueta et al. 1998).
Consistent with these findings, the activity of a major
mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, MnSOD, was reduced
and the protein was nitrated. MnSOD inactivation is linked to
oxidative modification of MnSOD in vivo via nitration and
hydroxylation, protein modifications promoted, respectively,
by NO-derived oxidants (peroxynitrite or peroxidase-cata-

Purpose: To evaluate regional variations of metabolite concentrations in normal adult brain cortical gray matter re-gions, and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum,
using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging
(MRSI).

Materials and Methods: Quantitative, multislice proton
MRSI (TR/TE 2000/280 msec) was performed in 12 normal human volunteers (age 39 6 years, 7 male). Me-tabolite concentrations in selected cortical gray matter re-gions and the corpus callosum were estimated using the
phantom replacement methodology.

Results: Frontal and parietal gray matter (PGM) showed
strong differences in choline-containing compound (Cho)
concentrations; in particular, Cho was higher in mesial
frontal gray matter than in both dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (P 0.0005) and PGM (P 0.004). In contrast, both
N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cr) were relatively
uniformly distributed in the cortical gray matter regions
evaluated. Significant metabolic differences were found be-tween the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Cho
concentrations were significantly higher in genu than splenium (P 0.005), while Cr was lower (P 0.004). NAA
showed a trend to be higher in the splenium than the genu
(P 0.05).

Conclusion: Metabolite concentrations, particularly Cho,
showed strong regional variations both within cortical gray
matter regions and between the genu and splenium of the
corpus callosum. Mesial frontal regions showed the highest
Cho signals. Differences in spectra presumably reflect un-derlying changes in structure and cellular composition.
Normal spectral variations should always be considered
when evaluating pathology within those brain regions.

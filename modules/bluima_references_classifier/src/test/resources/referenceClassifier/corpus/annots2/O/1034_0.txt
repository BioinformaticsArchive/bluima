sham-lesioned animals are able to detect it. This could be a
natural consequence of the fact that a hypernatremic stimulus
would be available earlier to osmoreceptors or sodium receptors in the CVOs than inside the blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, a strong osmotic stimulus would eventually be detected
by osmoreceptors inside the blood-brain barrier in areas such
as the MnPO and hypothalamus as the brain gradually became
osmotically dehydrated, and this could short-circuit the CVO
pathway and trigger the drinking response. We observed a
similar phenomenon with low and high intragastric saline loads
in animals with abdominal vagotomy (37). To the extent that
this is true, the SFO appears to be the more important of the
two forebrain CVOs with respect to hypernatremia induced by
SC hypertonic saline in rats. The role of the OVLT may be
more evident with different routes or doses of hypertonic
saline, or its influence may somehow be negated by extracellular fluid expansion after hypertonic saline loading. Certainly
the OVLT was considered for a number of years to be “the”
osmoreceptor for drinking because of pioneering work done in
dogs (39). Species differences are probable.

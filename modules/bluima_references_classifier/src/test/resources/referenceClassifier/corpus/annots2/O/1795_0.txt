Implications of sequestered GPCR/Kir3
channel signaling complexes
The absence of muscarinic-activated Kir3
currents in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells
was unexpected. Treatment with atropine,
however, led to robust expression of muscarinic receptor and GPCR independent
ethanol activated Kir3 currents. Ectopic
expression of either Kir3.2c or m2 muscarinic receptor failed to recover
muscarinic-activated Kir3 currents. Thus,
ectopically and endogenously expressed
channels and receptors in NGFdifferentiated PC12 cells were subjected to
the same regulatory mechanism. Immunostaining of the NGF-differentiated
PC12 cells transfected with HA-tagged
Kir3.2c revealed undetectable levels of
Kir3.2c channels on the membrane surface, indicating that the lack of Kir3
currents was attributable to a defect in
trafficking and not G-protein gating.
An explanation for the loss of m2 re-ceptor/Kir3 complexes may be that muscarinic receptors and Kir3 channels are se-questered in cytoplasmic compartments.
In a mouse mutant containing reduced

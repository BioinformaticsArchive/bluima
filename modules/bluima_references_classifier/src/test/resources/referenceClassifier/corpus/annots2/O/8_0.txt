RESULTS
When sections of hippocampus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex
as well as frontal, temporal, and occipital neocortex from cases of
AD were examined, the most striking feature was the prominent
immunolabeling of the oxidized nucleosides (8OHdG and
8OHG) in the neuronal cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A,C,E), with a similar
pattern found for both antibodies, 1F7 and 15A3. Cytoplasmic
immunoreaction was on granular structures with a Nissl
substance-like distribution extending from the cell bodies to dendrites, but with no axonal elements displaying the immunoreaction (Fig. 1C,E). Intranuclear immunoreaction with 1F7 or 15A3
in AD cases was less intense than that found for the cytoplasmic
immunoreaction. Interestingly, nuclear chromatin, demonstrated
with the antibody to DNA (data not shown), was poorly detected
with 1F7 or 15A3. The relative paucity of DNA-based staining
can be noted clearly in the intranucleolar vacuolar region that
contains chromatin (Peters et al., 1991) and is not immunolabeled
with either 1F7 or 15A3 (Fig. 1 E). In comparison to AD the
control cases, both aged and young, showed the same pattern of
staining but with much reduced intensity in vulnerable neurons
(Fig. 1 B,D). In fact, the difference in immunoreactivity with 1F7
or 15A3 between AD and controls was most striking for cerebral
pyramidal neurons, whereas the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum showed no difference between AD and controls.
The presence of oxidized nucleosides in neurons was not re-lated to the presence of neurofibrillary tangles or apposition to
senile plaques, seen with tau or Congo red staining. In fact,
neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles showed reduced im-munoreactivity. Although in part this might be a result of the
exclusion of normal cytoplasm from the region containing the

No previous studies have used morphological neuroimaging to
compare children with ADHD with siblings of children with
ADHD. To test the hypothesis that the total size of the corpus
callosum is altered in children with hyperkinetic disorder, the
corpus callosum was outlined from a single midline protondensity weighted slice (containing the septum pellucidum).
Fifteen boys with a refined phenotype of ADHD (mean age
10.2 years) and 15 healthy male siblings of children with
ADHD (mean age 10.6 years) were enrolled in the study. The
two groups were compared for global brain size and the
callosal areas of Witelson. No significant differences were
found between the study and comparison groups for any of
the corpus callosum areas, even after age, global brain size,
and handedness were covaried (using MANOVA). In addition,
corpus callosum sizes do not seem to differ between children
with ADHD and unaffected siblings of children with ADHD.
Clinicians should not base their pathophysiological diagnosis
of this disorder on an abnormality of callosal development.

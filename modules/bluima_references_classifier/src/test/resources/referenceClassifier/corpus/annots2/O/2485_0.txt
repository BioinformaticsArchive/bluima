caudal level was no longer seen in relation to the dopamine cells around the
interpeduncular nucleus. Negative sites were found at the caudal poles of the A9 and
A10 regions and throughout the A8 region. A thionin stained section of an electrode
penetration through the caudal pole of the A10 region is shown in Fig. 7 (no. 115).
This animal failed to display ICSS at any of the 7 sites tested. A fluorescence photomicrograph of a more laterally located penetration in the A8 region is shown in Fig. 6;
no ICSS was seen in this penetration.

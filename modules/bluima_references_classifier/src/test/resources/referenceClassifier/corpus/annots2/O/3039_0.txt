gm) were both found to vary over the course of the session (F(6,36)
= 3.91; p < 0.01; F(6,30) = 6.74; p < 0.01, respectively). The
multiple comparisons confirmed that AC TH levels were significantly increased during ingestion and 15 min after initiation of
consumption and declined thereafter (Fig. 7). The rise of corticosterone was slower than that of AC TH and was significant at 15
and 30 min after meal initiation and then declined at 60 min. It is
noteworthy that whereas the extent of the CRH and BN increase
induced by food ingestion was comparable to that noted during a
similar period after restraint exposure, the meal-elicited rise of
AC TH was of a smaller magnitude than that elicited by the
stressor, although both treatments provoked comparable elevations of corticosterone.

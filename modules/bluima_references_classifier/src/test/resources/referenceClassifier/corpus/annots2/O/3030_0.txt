DISCUSSION
Beginning at late prenatal stages and continuing through the first
few weeks of postnatal development, axons of BFCNs reach the
cortex and establish the circuitry via which the cortical neurons
can exert trophic effects on the BFCNs. This circuitry is also
established between BFCNs and cortical neurons in dissociated
cocultures; indeed, BFCNs exhibit extensive neuritic and somatic
growth only when they are cocultured with cortical neurons (Ha
et al., 1996a). Thus, both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated trophic influences of cortical neurons on BFCNs. The
purpose of the present study was to determine whether reciprocal
effects exist, thus testing the hypothesis that BFCNs exert trophic
influences on cortical neurons. Such effects have been suggested
by in vivo studies showing cortical neuronal atrophy and loss and
revealing alterations in dendritic morphology and differentiation
of cortical neurons after placement of excitotoxic or electrolytic
lesions in the BF (Arendash et al., 1987; Hohmann et al., 1991;
Wellman and Sengelaub, 1991, 1995). Recently, a study using the
specific cholinergic immunotoxin 192 IgGâ€“saporin to selectively
remove BFC Ns in vivo demonstrated that reductions in cholinergic innervation result in significantly reduced branching of
apical dendrites as well as reduced numbers of dendritic spines of
pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex (Robertson et al., 1998).
Because BFCNs innervate cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo
(Wainer et al., 1984; Houser et al., 1985) and many of the
sequelae observed after BF lesioning in vivo are expressed by
pyramidal neurons, the present study focused on the subset of

Figure 7. Striatal dopamine, DOPAC, and HVA levels in Sv129/CD1 wild-type and mGlu4 / mice injected with MPTP (4
intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg with 2 h of interval) alone or in combination with PHCCC (3 mg/kg, dissolved in cremophor
EL and injected subcutaneously 30 min before each MPTP injection). Values are mean SEM of five to seven determinations; p
0.05 (one-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test) versus saline-treated mice (*) or versus mice treated with MPTP alone (#).

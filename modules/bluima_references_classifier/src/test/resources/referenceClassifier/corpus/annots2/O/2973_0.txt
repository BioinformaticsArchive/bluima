Six other neurodegenerative diseases are caused
by CAG repeats encoding polyglutamine expansions:
spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubropallidoluysian
atrophy (DRPLA), spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1),
SCA2 and SCA6 (La Spada et al., 1991; Huntington's
disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993;
Nagafuchi et al., 1994; Koide et al., 1994; Orr et al.,
1993; Pulst et al., 1996; Imbert et al., 1996; Sanpei
et al., 1996; Zhuchenko et al., 1997). In all these
disorders, the expansion leads to the selective loss of
different neuronal populations. Somatic mosaicism

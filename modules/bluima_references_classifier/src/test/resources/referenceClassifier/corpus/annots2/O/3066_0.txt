exposure that was given to animals prior to the
recording session in the present study, which in some
cases exceeded that given to subjects in anesthetized
or slice studies. However, this is unlikely to be an
adequate explanation. A number of anesthetized and
slice recording studies (e.g., Refs 11 and 32) and
recent preliminary studies in our own laboratory
(unpublished), indicate that repeated cocaine administration, including that which is self-administered,
enhances rather than reduces the prevalence and
magnitude of inhibition.
The ratio of tonic inhibition versus tonic excitation
in the present study suggests that tonic inhibition
may not play an exclusive role in mediating
the accumbal contribution to cocaine self-

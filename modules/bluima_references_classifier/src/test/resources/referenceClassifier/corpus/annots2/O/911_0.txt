Intermittent L-DOPA also induced a small, but significant
increase in GAD67 mRNA levels in PPE-labeled neurons.
We found an increase of similar magnitude when we measured GAD mRNA levels in PPT-unlabeled neurons. This
crossed double-labeling procedure ruled out the possibility
that the small effect on GAD67 mRNA levels was an
artifactual result of the quantitative analysis of silver grains
in digoxigenin-labeled neurons. Alone these findings suggest that intermittent L-DOPA administration could induce
a small increase in GABAergic activity in the indirect striatal pathway. This hypothesis is otherwise supported by
studies showing that chronic intermittent L-DOPA administration induces a prominent increase in striatal PPE ex-pression (Cenci et al., 1998; Henry et al., 1999; Zeng et al.,
2000; Calon et al., 2002). However, this finding has not
been reproduced in other studies and its significance re-mains controversial (Quik et al., 2002; Tel et al., 2002). In
our study, analysis of 3H-flunitrazepam binding in the globus pallidus revealed no significant change in density of
GABAA receptors following intermittent L-DOPA treatment.
Therefore, although our results suggest that intermittent
L-DOPA may alter the activity of striatopallidal neurons, it
appears that such an action does not result in prominent
changes in GABAergic input to the globus pallidus. This
interpretation is consistent with previous finding that 2-DG
uptake in the globus pallidus remained unchanged following intermittent L-DOPA in rats with a unilateral 6-OHDA
lesion (Trugman and Wooten, 1986; Engber et al., 1990).

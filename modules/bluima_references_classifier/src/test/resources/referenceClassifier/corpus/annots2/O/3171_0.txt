of the spinal cord (1). Decompression is unlikely
to provide significant improvement in patients with
congenital paraplegia. However, MR imaging may
be useful in identifying those children with incomplete spinal cord deficit who may benefit from de-compression surgery by depicting severe spinal ca-nal stenosis or hyperintensity of the spinal cord on
T2-weighted images as an expression of superimposed spinal cord damage due to progressing ky-phoscoliosis. Additionally, MR imaging may detect
causes of spinal cord tethering (ie, tight filum terminale) that may require surgery to prevent progression of kyphoscoliosis and spinal instability.
There is considerable debate in the literature about
the optimal timing for performing arthrodesis.
While some authors (2, 12) recommend that ar-throdesis be performed as soon as the diagnosis has
been made, it may be extremely difficult to achieve
solid fusion, and several procedures may be re-quired, mainly because of the immaturity of the
osseous bed in the newborn. Because stabilizing
surgery is essentially performed to enable the pa-tient to sit up without support, our strategy is to
initially refrain from surgery unless conservative
measures, such as bracing, fail to halt the progression of neurologic deficit. Although arthrodesis
may be proposed at age 5 to 6 months (ie, when
the sitting posture develops) (1), it is our current
policy to protract the use of bracing to at least age
2 to 3 years, when the maturation and growth of
the osseous bed may significantly increase the
chances of success of stabilizing surgery. However,
we agree with Scott et al (1) in that the management of the orthopedic deformity in these children
is complicated and must be individualized.
To summarize, we found a correlation between
the degree of motor impairment and the caliber of
the spinal cord at the level of the dysgenesis. However, the clinical classification of SSD appears to
depend not only on the neuroradiologic picture but
also on the degree of residual function.

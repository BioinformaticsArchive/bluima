The splitting of P3 into additional
stripes was more pronounced on one side
of the Cb in 60% of the animals analyzed (n 7/12). Also, the “new” stripes
were found at a ML location similar to
the wild-type P2 stripes as if the P2
stripes were extended anteriorly into lobule II. Although we found that whether
the “P2 ” stripe was a solid stripe in all
the anterior lobules or variable but on
both sides of the midline, the basic patterning change was present in all animals
analyzed. Even in cases in which “P2 ”
was robust on only one side of the Cb, the
contralateral side did indeed have the
same basic phenotype but “P2 ” was
present in only some lobules (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
It is interesting to note that in the “transition zone” between the AZ and CZ (Fig.
1 E, dotted red line) of wild-type mice
P3 becomes fragmented unevenly be-tween the two sides of the Cb and P2
extends unevenly (both its width and
length) into lobule V (Ozol et al., 1999).
Thus, the variability seen in En1flox/cre
mutants is likely inherent to the process
that establishes the striped gene expression rather than specific to the En1 mu-tant phenotype.
In lobule aVIII of the PZ in wild-type
mice there are four sharp stripes numbered P1 to P4 , and each one has a
different relative size in width (Fig. 1C, Figure 1. Molecular coding is altered in En1flox/cre mutant mice that have normal foliation. A, ZebrinII expression reveals three

In 50% of the mutants (n 6/12) a the CZ appeared narrower with poorly delineated boundaries,

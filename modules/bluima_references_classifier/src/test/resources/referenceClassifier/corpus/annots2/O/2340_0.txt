The site of ischemic alteration in axoplasmic
transport is identical to that seen with pressure
elevation.3 The effect becomes most apparent at
the terminus of the watershed of capillaries that
supply the optic nerve head, namely at the posterior extent of the lamina scleralis. The focal ob-struction of axoplasmic transport occurred at the
posterior margin of the lamina scleralis, the terminus of the circulatory watershed. The extent of
change was elsewhere diffuse both autoradiographically and histologically. Morphologically, the
disc changes resembled acute ischemic optic neuropathy, with edema of the optic nerve and macula
and some blurring of the disc margins.
In longer duration studies, the neurons were
histologically replaced with gliotic tissue. There
was no evidence of glaucomatous cupping, either
by funduscopy or histologically, but a slight saucerization was present due to the gliotic replacement of lost neurons.
The phenomenon of cupping appears to require
pressure elevation associated with ischemia. As
vacuoles appear in the laminar and retrolaminar
areas in the face of pressure elevation, the disc is
capable of collapsing into the defect resulting from

size of the acetylcholine receptor cluster signals in the hMg mouse is
attributable to chronic denervation of mLGC in this mouse. Scale bars: A,
B, 120 m; inset in A and B, 50 m; C, 60 m. D, Quantitative analysis of
denervation (denerv.) along the synaptic band of MGC and LGC muscle
(see Materials and Methods for details). Each curve represents average
values from two mice. E, Quantitative analysis of mLGC denervation
(p75-positive NMJs; see Materials and Methods for details). W, Wild
type; Mg, minigene, hMg-SOD1(G93A). Average values from two mice
each are shown.

(Table 3). Sn was greatest in the liver quasispecies, indicating
the broadest quasispecies repertoire. However, the mean within-sample distance was greater in the brain (P 0.02) and
lymph node clones, indicating greater evolutionary distances
within these compartments. This is seen clearly on the amino
acid phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4), where there is significant clustering of two brain clones (B23 and B6; bootstrap value 95).
Within HVR1 (residues 384 to 410), these clones differ from
the consensus sequence at 10 out of 27 amino acids and are
most closely related to a lymph node clone (N10; bootstrap
value 99). At the amino acid level, there were two dominant
sequences from serum, one of which was the same as the
consensus sequence in the other compartments. The second
dominant serum-derived sequence (S10), accounting for 41%
of serum clones, was not seen in any of the tissue compartments. The Mantel test supported a phenetic structure for the
extrahepatic compartments (P 0.001).
In patient B the E2/HVR1 quasispecies parameters paralleled those in patient A, with greater Pn, Sn, and mean withinsample distance values in brain and liver compared to serum.
Three brain clones (B5, B9, and B11) had a lysine (K)-to-arginine (R) substitution at the carboxyl end of HVR1 and
clustered together on the phylogenetic tree (bootstrap value
61). The Mantel test supported phenetic compartmentalization
of the brain clones (P 0.006).
In order to determine whether there were different host
selection pressures acting on different anatomical compartments, ds/dn ratios were calculated (Table 4). In all cases, the
ds/dn ratio was greater than 1, indicating that positive immune
selection was not occurring in any compartment.
IRES translation efficiency in cell lysates. IRES sequences
of interest were ligated into DCV, as described earlier, and
their translational efficiencies were measured by assaying for

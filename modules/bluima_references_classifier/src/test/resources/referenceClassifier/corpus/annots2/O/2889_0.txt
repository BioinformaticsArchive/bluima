geting of abnormal pattern formation? Cases et al.c were
able to restore formation of the barrels with early drug
intervention, using parachlorophenylalinene (PCPA) to
inhibit 5-HT synthesis. Their prediction that this effect
required administration during the critical period was
borne out: PCPA given after posnatal day 6 failed to elicit
barrel restoration. This dramatic demonstration stimulated additional studies by this group in which the activity of MAOA was reduced in wild-type mice using the specific inhibitor clorgyline. In such animals, barrels failed to
form, clearly demonstrating the remarkable sensitivity of
somatosensory pattern formation to MAs. It is certainly
surprising that alterations of MAOA activity genetically
and of MA levels with cocaine result in such specific
developmental changes, given that either intervention
will result in changes in more than a single MA. The
results suggest that the significance of the role of different
components of the MA systems in modulating CNS development might differ for specific ontogenetic events. In
addition, manipulations that often lead to broad changes
in mature systems might not necessarily cause identical
changes in a developing system.

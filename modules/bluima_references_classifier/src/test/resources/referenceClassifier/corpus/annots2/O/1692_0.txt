al., 2004), which have been called A -derived diffusible ligands
(ADDLs) (Lambert et al., 1998). ADDL-triggered neuronal damage is now recognized as a central feature of AD pathology (Rodgers, 2005; Standridge, 2006). Because ADDLs are gain-of-function ligands that target synaptic spines (Lacor et al., 2004;
Klein et al., 2007) and disrupt synaptic plasticity (Lambert et al.,
1998; Wang et al., 2002), their cellular actions may be particularly
germane to neuropil damage (Klein et al., 2001; Klein, 2006).
This possibility is supported by findings that ADDLs induce ab-normal expression of Arc (Lacor et al., 2004), a synaptic memoryrelated protein, in a manner predicted to cause abnormal spine
shape and receptor trafficking (Lacor et al., 2004; Klein, 2006).
The current study has tested the impact of ADDLs on spines using
mature hippocampal neuron cultures, a preferred model for
studies of synapse cell biology (Boyer et al., 1998). Abnormalities
induced by ADDLs in spine composition, shape, and abundance
strongly support the hypothesis that ADDLs in AD brains initiate
toxic mechanisms underlying neuropil damage.

Figure 5. Tissue-specific expression of myr 8 mRNA. Northern blots of
poly(A) RNA (2.5 g / lane) from type 1 astrocytes ( A), total RNA (15
g / lane) from cerebella at indicated developmental time points ( B),
poly(A) RNA (2.5 g / lane) from neocortices at indicated developmental
ages (C, D), and total RNA (15 g / lane) from the indicated tissues
obtained at postnatal day 10 (E, F ) were hybridized with 32P-labeled
probe 1 (A, B), probe 2 (C, E), probe 4 ( F), and probe 5 ( D). A prominent
signal of 7.2 kb was detected in astrocytes and at all developmental ages
for both neocortex and cerebellum, although the level of the 7.2 kb
message peaked during the first and second postnatal weeks in both
neocortex and cerebellum. The 7.2 kb myr 8 transcript (arrow) was
detected principally in the C NS but was also observed to a minimal extent
in adrenal and heart and skeletal muscle. Equal RNA loads were verified
by evaluation of 18S ribosomal RNA after ethidium bromide staining.
RNA size standards are indicated in kilobases. Ad, Adult; E, embryonic
day; NB, newborn; P, postnatal day.

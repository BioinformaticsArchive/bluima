present study compared with a 6-fold increase in baroreflex-intact animals (8). This is in keeping with the
smaller reduction in RBF for the SAD group (Fig. 4).
Hence, a similar increase in pressure was produced by a
much smaller absolute and percentage increase in PRA
in the SAD group. In a previous study, Liard and co-workers (22) demonstrated that a greater pressor sensitivity to plasma renin, rather than increased renin re-lease, accounted for the augme nted pressure rise seen in
SAD dogs during acute RSt. In the present study, the
large increase in pressure and resistance in SAD animals
despite a much smaller increase in PRA compared with
intact rats is likely to result, in part, from the loss of
peripheral reflex buffering. Changes in central sensitivity
to ANG II may also participate, since the pressor re-sponse to icv ANG II in SAD rats is potentiated to a
much larger degree than can be accounted for simply on
the basis of loss of peripheral buffering mechanisms (2).
In conclusion, the results of these studies, carried out
in conscious unrestrained animals, suggest that approximately half of the pressure increase following acute RSt
may be ascribed to a central action of ANG II. Thus the
combined activation of both the renin-angiotensin and
sympathetic nervous systems and the attendant hemodynamic changes that occur at the onset of renal hypertension involve, in addition to peripheral vasoconstrictor
actions of ANG II, a significant central effect of the
peptide to increase vascular resistance and arterial pressure.

tum where it binds to the p75 receptor (Acsady et al.,
2000). Unlike the MS/DB cholinergic neurons, in the rodent
the NBM cholinergic neurons that project to the amygdala
do not express the p75-NGF receptor (Berger-Sweeney et
al., 1994; Heckers et al., 1994), which may make them less
sensitive to the neuronal death caused by PTD-treatment
(Savage et al., 2007).
Thus, p75-NGF receptors on cholinergic neurons may
make them sensitive to thiamine-deficiency induced neurotoxicity. One of the main functions of the p75-NGF re-ceptor is regulating both cell death and survival (Kaplan
and Miller, 2000; see Twiss et al., 2006 for a review).
Degenerative neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's disease, preferentially display degeneration in those cell populations that contain the p75-NGF
receptor (Woolf et al., 1989; Wang et al., 2008). Excitotoxin-induced lesion and ischemia have both been shown
to increase the density of the p75-NGF receptor in basal
forebrain cholinergic neurons and this overexpression is
associated with cell death (Dunnett et al., 1991; Rabadizadeh et al., 1993; Weiss et al., 1994; Oh et al., 2000).
Currently, the present data suggest that cell loss in the
MS/DB region is not due to widespread cell death in the
basal forebrain, but is specific to the ChAT-positive cells of
the MS/DB.
The neuroanatomical damage seen after PTD treatment is most likely due to glutamate excitotoxicity and/or
ischemia (Todd and Butterworth, 1999, 2001). It has been
well documented that glutamate excitotoxicity is responsible for thalamic lesions in the PTD model of WKS (Langlais
and Zhang, 1993; Zhang et al., 1995) and cholinergic

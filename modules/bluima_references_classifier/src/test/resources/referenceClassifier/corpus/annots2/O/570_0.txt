Fig. 7. Effect of potential inhibitors on the uptake rate of GlySar from
apical (panel A) and basolateral (panel B) membranes. Monolayers grown
in Transwell chambers were preincubated apically (0.4 ml) and basolaterally (1.2 ml) with low-sodium Tris/MES buffer (pH 7.4) for 10 min at
37°C. Buffer was removed and appropriate volumes of fresh uptake
buffer, containing [14C]GlySar and [3H]mannitol (2 M each) with and
without 1 mM inhibitors, were added to the apical or the basolateral side
(pH 7.4/7.4 for donor/receiver compartments); control buffer (i.e., no
GlySar or mannitol) was added to the opposite side. Incubation proceeded
for the specified period of time at 37°C. All data were mannitol-corrected
and expressed as mean S.E. from four separate experiments. , P

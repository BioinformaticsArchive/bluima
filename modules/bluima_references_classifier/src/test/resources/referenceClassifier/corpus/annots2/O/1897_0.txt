munomodulatory effects that may further enhance infection
susceptibility. Controlled studies in humans demonstrate
that morphine produces immunosuppressive effects in
healthy, nondrug-using subjects (Yeager et al., 1995), and
clinical reports indicate that higher doses of opioid analgesics
are associated with greater frequencies of infectious complications among burn victims and patients that underwent
cardiac surgery (El Solh et al., 2006; Schwacha et al., 2006).
Thus, the use of opioids, whether for therapeutic or recreational purposes, may directly influence resistance to infectious diseases.
In animal models, morphine has been shown to suppress a
variety of immune parameters, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood (Lysle et al., 1993;
Lockwood et al., 1994). Opioids modulate immunity in a
highly complex manner by interacting with opioid receptors
expressed by multiple cell types throughout the body. For
example, in vitro studies show that morphine can inhibit
macrophage phagocytosis and interferon- production
through direct interactions with immunocyte opioid receptors (Peterson et al., 1987; Szabo et al., 1993). In addition,

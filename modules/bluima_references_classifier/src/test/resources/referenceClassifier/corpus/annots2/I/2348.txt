to overlap with regard to rostrocaudal cord
location (e.g., compare Figs. 4 and 5). However, the centers of the toe representations de-picted by Brown et al. (3) are displaced caudally one-half to one segment compared to
Fig. 6. The cause of this apparent discrepancy
is not clear but may possibly be explained by
1) interanimal variations in fixation of the
lumbosacral plexus (25) and/or 2) spinocervital tract cells making up the most caudally
located units composing a particular rectangular column of cells with receptive fields on
a particular toe. Along with the most medially
located toe units in L6 and L7 were units found
to have receptive fields on the plantar cushion
(Fig. 6). Other investigators have found a similar representation (e.g., Refs. 1, 11). Since
spinocervical tract cells do not receive inputs
from glabrous skin (3), the plantar cushion
region is not shown on Brown et al.`s (3) diagram.
Again it should be emphasized that Fig. 6
is an abstraction in that the boundaries that
group cells with similar receptive fields actually
place centers of concentrations of units with
similar receptive-field locations; there is considerable overlapping of cells with different
receptive-field locations. Also emphasizing the
schematic nature of Fig. 6 are the observations
that I) many units have receptive fields on
multiple skin regions separated by boundaries
in Fig. 6; and 2) due to variability in fixation
of the lumbosacral plexus (25), the map may
be shifted rostrally or caudally in any given
animal.

Mugneric stimulation

TMS was delivered with a Cadwell MES 10 stimulator
through a 9.4 cm outside diameter coil that had a right
angle at its tip. The tip of the coil was located at the T5
electrode position of the international IO-20 system
(Homan, Herman & Purdy, 1987) and the coil was
placed flat against the head. The handle of the coil was
directed posterior toward the occiput parallel to the
sagittal axis of the head. After preliminary studies the
intensity of the stimulator was 80% of the maximum
output. The peak magnetic field of this stimulator is
2.2 T delivered in a 70 psec pulse. In contrast functional
magnetic resonance imaging of the human cortex uses
1.54 T magnetic field strengths. With the 9.4 cm coil the
induced electrical field is maximal under the border and
is minimal at the center (Cohen, Roth, Nilsson, Dand,
Panizza, Bandinelli, Friauf & Hallet, 1990; Roth, Saypal, Hallet & Cohen, 1991). In the first experiments with
the motion discrimination and spatial resolution tasks
TMS was delivered at fixed time delays after the onset
of the visual stimulus. These delays varied from 50 to
250 msec and in any one test remained constant. Each
time delay was tested three times on three different days
for a total of 30 trials with TMS.
Topographic mapping of the TMS effect on motion
discrimination was performed with a rectangular butterfly coil that had a figure 8 configuration with a
5 x 10 cm dimension. Models and in vitro measurements
of this coil's electrical fields indicate that the peak field
lies under the center of the coil and that the effective
depth of stimulation is up to approx. 2 cm (Cohen et al.,
1990; Roth et ul.. 1991; Amassian, Cracco. Maccabee &

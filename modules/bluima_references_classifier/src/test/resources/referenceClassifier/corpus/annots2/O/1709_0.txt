We report a baby born with flaccid quadraparesis that was considered
possibly attributable to birth injury. Postmortem examination identified an
injury that occurred well before delivery caused by hemorrhage from an
arteriovenous malformation of the brainstem and spinal cord. We discuss
imaging modalities to diagnose neonatal cord injuries, possible treatments,
prognosis and end of life decision making for these unfortunate patients. We
also emphasize the importance of the autopsy in cases of suspected birth
injury.

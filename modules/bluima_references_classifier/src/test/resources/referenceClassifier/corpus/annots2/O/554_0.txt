Figure 2. Prolonged seizures increase neuroblast numbers in the forebrain SVZ. Aâ€“F, Confocal images of coronal sections stained by indirect
immunofluorescence with the use of antibodies that recognize immature
neurons in the rostral SVZ of adult rats 2 weeks after saline (A, C, E) or
pilocarpine (B, D, F ) treatment. Both the amount and intensity of immunostaining are increased after SE. Note that the neuron-specific class III
-tubulin (TuJ1) antibody also labels differentiated neurons outside the
SVZ (C, D), whereas immunostaining for PSA-NCAM (A, B) and doublecortin (E, F ) is restricted mainly to the SVZ. G, H, Immunofluorescence staining for the astrocyte protein GFAP in the rostral SVZ of an
adult rat 2 weeks after pilocarpine treatment ( H ) is similar to the control
( G), although GFAP-IR is increased outside the SVZ region ( H ).
Arrows in C, D, G, and H outline the dorsolateral SVZ. Scale bar (in H ),
100 m. LV, Lateral ventricle; PSA-NCA M, polysialylated neural cell
adhesion molecule; GFA P, glial fibrillary acidic protein.

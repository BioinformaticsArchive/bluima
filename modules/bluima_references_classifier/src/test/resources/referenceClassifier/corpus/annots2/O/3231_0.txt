Figure 1. C at exposure increased serum corticosterone levels. Blood
samples obtained from rats exposed to a cat for 75 min exhibited greater
corticosterone levels than samples obtained from rats that were either
killed directly out of their home cage or had spent 75 min in the chamber
without the cat. *p < 0.01, Bonferroni corrected t test.

REM sleep. Alternatively, REM sleep may promote neurogenesis by preventing neuronal death, a mechanism that is
supported by the reduction of cell-death associated genes
coincident with periods of increased REM sleep and
decreased W.
Several additional genes reduced concurrent with de-creased W and increased REM sleep, including TNFa and
Atf2, retain known links to CaMKII. Activating transcription
factor-2 (ATF-2) is a member of the basic leucine zipper
domain family, and can modulate transcription by targeting
the ATF consensus site (Hai et al. 1989) and cAMP response
element (CRE) sequences (Reimold et al. 1996). ATF-2
binding to DNA is mediated via phosphorylation of the
protein, and heterodimerization with other basic leucine
zipper domain family members (Bhoumik and Ronai 2008).
Expression of Atf2, which is markedly reduced concurrent
with increased REM sleep, is regulated through concerted
interaction between the transcription factor Sp1 and the Atf2
promoter (Nagase et al. 1990).
While CaMKII may influence Atf2 expression, possibly
through interactions with Sp1, CaMKII has been shown to
directly modulate Sp1 transcriptional activity (Sohm et al.
1998). As well, CaMKII is known to interact with the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; Borbiev et al.
2003), which itself can activate Sp1 (Merchant et al. 1999).
In this regard CaMKII activity, acting through Sp1 within the
PPT could suppress REM sleep episodes and promote W by
affecting Atf2 expression. As a result, ATF-2 itself could
effect a W specific transcriptional profile. With a decrease in

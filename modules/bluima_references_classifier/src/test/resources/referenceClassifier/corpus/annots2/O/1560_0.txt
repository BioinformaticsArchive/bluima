tPA is a presynaptic component, as shown
particularly clearly in certain hypothalamic axon terminals (Miyata et al., 2005),
and is thought to influence normal synaptogenesis, long-term potentiation, and
synaptic alterations in disease states
(Madani et al., 1999; Sheehan and Tsirka,
2005). The action of tPA at synapses is
based on its cleavage of the NR1 subunit of
the NMDA receptor, which probably in- creases calcium influx (Nicole et al., 2001)
and thus accounts for its effect in augmenting the severity of NMDA-mediated
excitotoxic lesions. Binding of tPA on the
NR2B subunit also may control various
forms of seizure activity, particularly well
shown in a mouse model of chronic ethanol intake followed by withdrawalinduced seizures (Pawlak et al., 2005). Ion
fluxes also are influenced by a direct effect
of plasminogen on the mitochondrial
outer membrane. Plasminogen contains
five binding segments called “kringles,”
one of which (kringle 5) specifically can
bind brain mitochondrial VDAC to result
in partial closure of the VDAC channel

sprouting of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres
restores total numbers of DR axons to pre-ligation
levels. Analysis of the DR data alone would suggest
that sprouting occurs quite a long time after the
initiating lesion, between three and eight months
following the injury. However, axonal sprouting is
suggested as early as six weeks following injury as
indicated by there being more DR axons than DRG
cells. Although we cannot determine the exact time
axonal sprouting begins in the DR, the overall eVect
on the composition of the primary aVerent fibre input
has now shifted with an increase, above normal, in
myelinated axon numbers.
It is interesting that previous determinations of
DR axon numbers following peripheral axotomy
have not shown a direct increase in numbers of
myelinated fibres.5,10,30 However, following crush or
transection of the sciatic nerve there is a predominance of myelinated fibre input to the dorsal horn
due to dramatic loss of unmyelinated fibres.10
Although the paradigm of segmental nerve lesion is
quite diVerent from sciatic crush or transection, the
end result may be similar. That is, eight months
following these diVerent peripheral nerve injuries,
there is an increase in myelinated fibre input to the
dorsal horn10 as well as sprouting of AÆ fibres into
lamina II.20,40,41
We do not know at this time if the sprouting of the
DR axons results in an increase of input to the spinal
cord. However, sprouting of small calibre fibres21–23
as well as large AÆ fibres20,40,41 has been reported
in the spinal dorsal horn after DR or peripheral
nerve injury. In addition, growth-associated protein-43, a protein involved in nerve regeneration, also
appears in the spinal dorsal horn following peripheral
axotomy.39 DR sprouting is not suggested in our
material until six weeks post-ligation, which is later
than the observed expansion of AÆ fibres into lamina
II, seen two and four weeks following this segmental
nerve lesion.20 The possibility exists, however, that
axonal sprouting occurs earlier but is masked by the
concomitant loss of fibres in the dorsal roots indicated by degenerating myelinated profiles. None the
less, the expansion of AÆ fibres into lamina II20 may
not be the result of sprouting myelinated DR axons
extending into the spinal cord, but instead may
represent sprouting of existing fibres at their terminal
region. However, considering there is no abatement
in the increase in numbers of myelinated fibres in our
study, we cannot exclude the possibility that sprouting DR axons cross the peripheral/central nervous
system barrier and form functional connections in
the dorsal horn. An examination of the DR axon

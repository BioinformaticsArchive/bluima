Fig. 3. With the treatment protocol used, each methamphetaminetreated rat developed a sensitized motor response to the psychostimulant.
Key illustrates the repeated treatment. Sal, saline; Meth, methamphetamine. Shown are individual crossing scores for the same rats whose
responses were averaged for Figs. 1 and 2. Scores illustrate total number
of crossings for a 5-min period 25 min after injection on treatment days 1
and 5 (left side of graph), and 45 min after a Meth acute challenge (AC)
given 14 days later (right side of graph). The 25- and 45-min post injection
time periods represent the peak response time for the first 2.5 mg/kg s.c.
Meth (data not shown) and for 1.0 mg/kg s.c. Meth AC in rats repeatedly
pretreated with Sal (see Fig. 1), respectively. The decrease in crossings
after the fifth daily 2.5 mg/kg Meth injection was due to a substantial
increase in stereotypic behaviors (data not shown). Crossings were not
exhibited in any of the Sal-treated rats on days 1 or 5, but after the 1
mg/kg Meth AC, each of these rats demonstrated robust crossing behaviors.

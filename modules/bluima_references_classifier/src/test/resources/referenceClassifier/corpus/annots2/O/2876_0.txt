growth factors like TNF-α (Chua and Chua, 1990; So et al., 1992),
IL-1β (Shingu et al., 1993), bFGF, EGF, and TGFβ (Edwards et
al., 1987) and by phorbol esters (Murphy et al., 1985). In contrast,
very little is known about the regulation of TIMP-1 expression in
the CNS. Nedivi et al. (1993) first isolated TIMP-1 as a candidate
plasticity gene in the dentate gyrus of kainate (KA)-treated rats
and demonstrated, by using Northern blot approaches, that its
expression is modulated in this region by stimuli producing longterm potentiation and during postnatal development. These ob-servations are in keeping with the hypothesis that controlled
proteolysis is crucial in the development and plasticity of the CNS
(Lynch and Baudry, 1984; Monard, 1988; Frey et al., 1996),
whereas excessive proteolysis contributes to various neuropathologies (Siman et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991; Rosenberg et al., 1992).
In particular, brain seizures and associated pathology recently
have been linked with alterations of serine protease expression
(Qian et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1995; Tsirka et al., 1995), mutations
in an endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor (Pennacchio et al.,
1996), and, most interestingly, with the induction of stromelysin-1
(Reeben et al., 1996), a metalloproteinases that is inhibited by
TIMP-1 (Murphy et al., 1991). Taken together, these data strongly
suggest that proteases are involved in seizure-associated pathology and that their inhibitors, including TIMP-1, may be instrumental in regulating their deleterious effects. To evaluate this
hypothesis, we find it is important first to establish the distribution
and regulation of TIMP-1 in the seizing brain.
As an extension of the findings of Nedivi et al. (1993), we report
here that KA-mediated excitotoxic seizures induce TIMP-1 ex-pression in a time-, region-, cell-, and age-dependent manner and
that the initial induction in neurons is independent of novel
protein synthesis. In addition, we discuss the differential and

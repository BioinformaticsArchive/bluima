the literature studies on hypoxic adaptation have been conducted at altitude, in research stations around the world or in
laboratory simulations of climbs (for an exceptional review,
see Ref. 69). There do not appear to be important differences
in the physiological adaptive response to the various methods
of producing continuous hypoxic exposure.
The degree of hypoxia also has had many descriptors,
however, most investigators refer to three degrees (mild, moderate, and severe), without complete agreement on where the
boundaries are drawn for each level. For the most part, hypoxia
is considered mild if the arterial oxygen tension (PaO ) does not
2


fall below 50 Torr (assuming sufficient red cell volume).
This degree is considered mild because there is almost complete compensation and function is relatively undisturbed. The
equivalent of 10% normobaric oxygen, or an altitude of
5,000 m, is the upper limit for mild hypoxia. Moderate
hypoxia, PaO between 35 and 50 Torr, will manifest as a
2


deterioration of thought processes, and below 35 Torr un-consciousness results. Although the results are not completely
clear, mild hypoxia is not associated with permanent neuronal
damage, but moderate and severe degrees of hypoxia lead to
neuronal loss in a time of exposure/degree of hypoxia-dependent manner.
The term “chronic” is used loosely here to indicate an
interval of time for a physiological response to occur. In the
case of hypoxia, acute exposure occurs during an interval from
a few minutes up to hours or even days, where chronic
exposure occurs over weeks to months. Longer term adaptation
occurs over generations and can be observed and studied in
animal (e.g., Ref. 62) and human (e.g., Ref. 1), populations in
the Himalayas, Andes, and Ethiopia.
This short review will concentrate on the physiological
adaptations of the cerebral circulation to prolonged exposure to
mild hypoxic environments. It will rely mainly on data from
the rodent model because most of the quantitative animal
studies have been done with the rat, but it will include sections
on species comparisons and human studies.

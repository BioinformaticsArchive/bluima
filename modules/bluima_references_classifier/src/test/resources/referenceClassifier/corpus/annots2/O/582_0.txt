Table 1. Infection of parental and recombinant viruses in inoculation, one to three mice from each group were sacrificed
Balb/C mice after 1â€“5 days, and cross-sections were used to determine the
presence of viral RNA by in situ hybridization. Most of the
newborn mice infected with CAV9 or CBV3 died between 3
and 5 days p.i. (Table 1). It was observed consistently that
BAA-infected animals died before the third day post-infection,
while the mortality of the ABA- and BAB-infected mice
resembled that of parental viruses, as some animals were still
alive on day 3 p.i. but died before the fifth day. The BBA and
AAB recombinants appeared to be less virulent because some
mice survived until day 5 p.i.

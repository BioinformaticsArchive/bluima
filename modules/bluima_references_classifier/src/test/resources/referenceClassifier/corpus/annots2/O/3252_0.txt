Hypoglossal motoneurons
Whole-cell recordings were obtained from hypoglossal motoneurons.
Under IR videomicroscopy, they had cell body diameters ranging
from 20 to 60 mm and could be easily differentiated from vagal
motoneurons, which were smaller and located dorsally to the
hypoglossal nucleus. When recorded using Cs-containing pipettes,
hypoglossal motoneurons had an average input resistance of
166 6 12 MW (n = 24; range 85–290 MW). In current-clamp, intracellular positive current injection always triggered a repetitive action
potential discharge (Fig. 7A1). Twenty neurons were challenged with
vasopressin at 0.1–1 mM. They responded either by a depolarization
(8–12 mV; n = 3) or by generating a sustained inward current (30–
80 pA; n = 9); in addition, the peptide caused a reversible increase in
the frequency of strychnine-sensitive inhibitory postsynaptic currents,
IPSCs (n = 12). These properties are characteristic of hypoglossal
motoneurons (Palouzier-Paulignan et al., 1994; and unpublished
results).
ACh was microinjected in the presence of NBQX at 5 mM and D-AP5 at 20 mM. In all 13 neurons tested, ACh at 0.2 mM evoked a
rapidly rising inward current, whose average peak amplitude was
120 6 15 pA (n = 13; range: 55–210 pA; Fig. 7A2). The time course
of this ACh-evoked current was comparable to the time course of the
current generated by ACh in facial motoneurons (see above).
The ACh-evoked current in hypoglossal motoneurons was further
characterized by making use of the nicotinic antagonists, MLA and

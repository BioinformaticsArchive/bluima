FIGURE 5. Identification of oxidation sites in
DJ-1 by MALDI-TOF/TOF/MS/MS and HPLC-ESI/
MS/MS analyses. A, MALDI-TOF/TOF/MS/MS
spectrum of the ion at m/z 1948.1 (1 ) from a
Lys-C digest of DJ-1 pI 6.4 isoform in PD showing
the identity as DJ-1 peptide 133–148 with oxidation of both Met-133 and Met-134 residues to
methionine sulfoxide. The ion at m/z 1636.5 and
1654.4 are interpreted as b ion and b-H2O ion,
respectively, corresponding to the internal fragment M*NGGHYTYSENRVE. B, MALDI-TOF/TOF/
MS/MS spectrum of the ion at m/z 2249.3 (1 )
from a Lys-C digest of DJ-1 pI 6.4 isoform in PD
showing the identity as DJ-1 peptide 13–32 with
oxidation of Met-17 to methionine sulfone and
Met-26 to methionine sulfoxide. C, HPLC-ESI/
MS/MS spectrum of the ion at m/z 761.8 (2 ) from
a tryptic digest of DJ-1 pI 6.4 isoform in control
brain, showing the identity as DJ-1 peptide 49 – 62
with oxidation of Cys-53 to cysteic acid. Peptide
fragments are indicated using the nomenclature of
Roepstorff and Fohlman (52). C*, cysteic acid; M*,
methionine sulfoxide; M**, methionine sulfone.

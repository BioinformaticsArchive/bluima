The increase of cathepsin D content in the cytosol
denotes increased cytosolic enzyme activity, which contributes to naphthazarin-induced cytotoxicity. The effects
of imidazoline drugs on cathepsin D activity were compared by determining the inhibitory effect of pepstatin A.
Authentic cathepsin D (purified from human liver;
Sigma) and cell lysate were incubated with the BODIPYFITC casein (Molecular Probes) substrate to determine
its enzymatic activity. Pepstatin A (50 M) inhibited
cathepsin D activity, and inhibited the naphthazarininduced decrease of mitochondrial potential (Fig. 6, E)
and LDH release. However, guanabenz and the other
imidazoline drugs did not affect the activity of cellular
cathepsin D as well as that of authentic cathepsin D of
human hepatic origin.

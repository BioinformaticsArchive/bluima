dicted using a component-based PET count rate model (20). The
above geometry was modeled, including 1 “bucket” per head, which
combines positioning, energy, and timing data from each of the
18 blocks. We assumed a typical block integration time of 80 ns, a
coincidence time window of 12 ns, and a coincidence processor
with bandwidth of 2.6 MHz. Given the absolute sensitivity and
count rate performance of the scanner, we calculated the effective
sensitivity as a function of activity in the field of view. Effective
sensitivity is defined as (1):

Effect of visual experience on cpg15 expression
The aspects of cpg15 regulation that we found to be dependent on
normal visual experience were its peak levels in the VC at P28
and its subsequent downregulation after the end of the critical
period. Although cpg15 levels in the VC of DR rats are indistinguishable from those in control rats within the first 3 weeks after
birth, the expression at P28 is lower than in controls. Rats DR
beyond P28 maintain the same peak level of cpg15 expression
through adulthood, levels that are significantly higher than in
their control counterparts. There is a crossover of the cpg15
expression profiles in normal and DR rats, such that at the peak
of the critical period expression is higher in normal animals,
whereas after the critical period cpg15 is higher in DR animals.
This crossover can also be seen in the developmental profiles of
susceptibility to MD in normal and DR cats (Mower, 1991). In
rodents, there have been no studies that examine the effects of
dark rearing on susceptibility to MD during the height of the
critical period. Studies at later ages show that similar to cats, DR
rats also retain a prolonged capability to respond to MD, even at
P90 (Guire et al., 1999).
With respect to dark rearing, we show here two additional
cases in which cpg15 regulation closely parallels plasticity as
measured by susceptibility to MD. Electrophysiological studies
have demonstrated that a short exposure to light can trigger
the end of the delayed plasticity that results from dark rearing
(Mower et al., 1983; Philpot et al., 2001). Similarly, early visual
experience in DR kittens attenuates the effects of later dark
rearing so that there is no delayed plasticity (Cynader, 1983).
These results show that the effect of dark rearing can be
negated by a short period of light exposure in DR adults, or
with sufficient early visual experience. We find that a 24 hr
exposure to light returns cpg15 levels in DR rats to those found
in normally raised adults, and that 1 week of visual experience
during the critical period is sufficient to confer normal adult
patterns of cpg15 regulation.
Our results show that even 1 week of visual experience during
the critical period is sufficient for establishing adult patterns of
cpg15 regulation. This suggests that visual experience is not
persistently required during development for normal functional
maturation of the visual system to occur. Rather, exposure to
patterned vision for at least 1 week during the critical period can
irreversibly trigger the molecular machinery that is required for
maturation; this will likely result in normal adult responses to
visual manipulations. Because cpg15 expression is abnormally
high in the adult in the absence of visual experience, the molecular trigger for maturation may involve a general downregulation
of plasticity genes such as cpg15.

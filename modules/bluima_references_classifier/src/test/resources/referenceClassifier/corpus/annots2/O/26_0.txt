The neural mechanisms underlying nociceptive
reflexes have been studied for over 100 years.62
Despite this long research history, the neural circuit
for nociceptive reflexes has yet to be fully described.
It is known that primary aVerent nociceptors terminate in the dorsal horn46,63 and motoneurons provide
an organized output to muscles.48 In addition, ventral horn interneurons contribute by organizing input
to motoneurons projecting to antagonistic muscles.35
The unknown link in this circuit is the nociceptive
neurons that transmit input from primary aVerent
nociceptors to the ventral horn.36
Electrophysiological analysis of dorsal horn
neurons has revealed two broadly defined classes of
nociceptive neuron: nociceptive-specific (NS) neurons
respond exclusively to noxious stimuli, and multireceptive (MR) neurons respond to both noxious and
innocuous stimuli.22,39,49,70 Of these two neural
classes, most research has focused on MR neurons.
The results of some of these studies indicate that a

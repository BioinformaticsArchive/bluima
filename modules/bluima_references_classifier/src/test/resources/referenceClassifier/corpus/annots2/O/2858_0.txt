earlier publication (Taylor et al., 1996). The lower dose (0.5
mg/kg) produced a 3- to 4-fold increase in ir-ACTH at 30 min
(F = 5.21; P = .04), but the increase in ir-cortisol did not
reach statistical significance (F = 3.94; P = .07). The higher
dose (1.0 mg/kg) produced a 7-fold increase in ir-ACTH at 1 h,
which was highly significant (F = 20.8; P < .001), and was
associated with a significant increase in ir-cortisol (Ï‡2 = 9.96;
P = .01). Plasma ir-ACTH declined from there but was still
slightly above control levels at 3 h (data not shown).

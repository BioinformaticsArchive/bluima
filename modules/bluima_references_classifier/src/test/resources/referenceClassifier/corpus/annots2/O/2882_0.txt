of stimuli. The DA innervafion of the nucleus accumbens is
conceived of as a crucial link in the "reward system",
which evolved to mediate the reinforcing effects of stimuli
such as food. This system is thought to be activated by
natural reinforcing stimulJi, and this activation mediates
the reinforcing effects of natural stimuli. According to this
view, other stimuli such as brain stimulation and drugs can
activate this system, which leads to these stimuli being
reinforcing as well. Interference with DA systems, particularly in nucleus accumbens, blunts the reinforcing effects of
these rewarding stimuli, leading to "extinction". This general model of the behavioral functions of accumbens DA is
utilized widely as a theoretical framework for research and a
pedagogical device (e.g. (13,27,87,248)). Because of the
broad nature of this model, and the variety of reinforcing
conditions it is meant to explain, it will be referred to as the
"General Anhedonia Model".
The General Anhedonia Model has been enormously successful in that it has offeIed researchers a framework for
linking together various areas of research. Perhaps the greatest influence of this model has been in the field of drug selfadministration and abuse. It is evident that the General
Anhedonia Model is the most influential wide-ranging
model for dealing with drag abuse. This model is used to
explain stimulant self-administration and place preference
in animals, abuse of a number of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs in humans, and even genetic factors leading to
drug abuse. Yet, despite its ubiquity and utility, the General
Anhedonia Model is not universally supported. The set of
hypotheses that form the structure of this model are still
fiercely debated. It is possible that some of the tenets of
the model are inaccurate or overly simplistic, and that the
model may have value for some areas (e.g. stimulant abuse)
but not others (e.g. food reinforcement). The purpose of this
review is to deconstruct the General Anhedonia Model and
consider the limitation of each separate component. In particular, this review will focus on the hypothesis that DA in
nucleus accumbens directly mediates food reinforcement.

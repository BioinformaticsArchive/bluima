The specificity of the antibody was further confirmed in Fig.
2B. The antibody reacted with GST-α1-syntrophin (Fig. 2B,
lane 1), but not with GST (lane 2). In addition, binding of the
antibody to GST-α1-syntrophin was completely abolished when
it was preincubated with the antigen (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1
and 4). These results suggest that the antibody specifically
reacts with α1-syntrophin.
Next, we analyzed the interaction of nNOS with α1-syntrophin in brain by pull-down assay. Glutathione-Sepharose
beads coupled with GST-nNOS-(1–230) were incubated with a
rat brain lysate and then precipitated. Western blotting with
anti-α1-syntrophin antibody showed that α1-syntrophin was
retained by GST-nNOS-conjugated Sepharose (Fig. 2B, lane 3),

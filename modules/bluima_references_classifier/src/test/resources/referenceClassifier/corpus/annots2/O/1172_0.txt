Volume of the Ischemic Core, Evolving Infarct, and
Periinfarct
Table 2 shows the volume of the ischemic core, evolving infarct, and periinfarct in each patient. The volume
was a sum of four tomographical slices where the PWI
and DWI were performed. The volume of the ischemic
core was less than 5ml in five patients. The volume of
the evolving infarct was less than 5ml in four patients.
These lesions were excluded from this analysis because
inaccuracy caused by partial volume averaging was an-ticipated. The periinfarct lesion was found in 9 of 11
patients. In the other two patients, the extent of the
diffusion abnormality was identical to that of the perfusion abnormality. The volume of the ischemic core
and evolving infarct for the entire lesion (a sum of 19
tomographical slices where the DWI was performed)
also is shown in parentheses in Table 2.

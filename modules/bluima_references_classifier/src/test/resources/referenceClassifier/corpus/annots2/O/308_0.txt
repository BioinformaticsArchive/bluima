Figure 4. Distribution and differentiation of clonally expanded adult
spinal cord stem-like cells (cervical clone) 6 weeks after transplantation
into the adult rat spinal cord. A, Horizontal section of the thoracic spinal
cord showing the dispersion of transplanted cells. Arrowheads outline
the borders of gray matter. B, Glial progenitor phenotype of transplantderived cells. Arrowhead indicates a NG2 (green) and BrdU (red)immunoreactive transplanted cell in the white matter of the spinal cord.
C, D, Oligodendroglial phenotype of transplant-derived cells at 6 weeks.
C, BrdU-immunoreactive transplanted cell expressing APC (red) and not
GFAP (blue). D, Merged images of a transplanted cell expressing Rip (red)
and BrdU ( green). Insets, Single-channel images of the above cell expressing Rip in the cytoplasm and BrdU in the nucleus. E, Colocalization of
BrdU-labeled transplanted cells ( green) with GFAP (blue) immunoreactivity. F, E xpression of the neomycin gene in spinal cord transplant sites of
three animals as detected by reverse transcriptase-nested PCR. Scale bars:
A, 400 μm; B, 10 μm; C, D, 10 μm; E, 10 μm.

FIG. 5. Expression of GAP-43 mRNA in olivary neurons. Darkfield photomicrographs. (A–C) Expression of GAP-43 mRNA in the intact animal, (D–F)
1 month after the lesion and (G–I) 18 months after the lesion. (A, D and G) The most caudal region of the Medial Accessory Olive (MAO); (B,E and H)
MAO at the level of b nucleus; (C and F and I) the rostral half of the inferior olive. Note that 1 month and 18 months after the lesion there is a decrease in
the number of olivary neurons in the caudal MAO (D–E and G–H), whereas the rostral part of the inferior olive does not seem to be affected (F–I). (J) The
counting of olivary neurons expressing GAP-43 mRNA shows that there is at first a decrease in the number of cells at 8 days after the lesion and from
3 months to 18 months another decrease of 50% neurons is observed. (K) Brightfield photomicrograph of cresyl violet sections after in situ hybridization
8 days after the lesion in the caudal part of the MAO. (L) Brightfield cresyl violet sections after in situ hybridization 18 months after the lesion in the caudal
part of the MAO. Note that after the lesion all the olivary neurons expressed GAP-43 mRNA (arrows). Bar in A is 200 mm (A–I), 20 mm (K and L).

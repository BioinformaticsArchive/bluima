Individual Differences

Table 1 presents the performance measures of re-sponse times, Type 2 errors, standardized CPS scores
(M 5  0.05, SD 5 1.59), IQ (M 5 102.1, SD 5 17.62),
MCSs (M 5 4.20, SD 5 3.08), standardized ERSs
(M 5 0, SD 5 1.00), CRS scores (M 5 0, SD 5 1.81),
and OCS scores (M 5 0.13, SD 5 3.96). The mean
scores of the sample on the subtests of the WISC-III
that assess attention and concentration were 11.4
(arithmetic), 10.2 (digit span), and 13.0 (coding),
compared with normative scores of 10.0 for the
general population. On the basis of these results, the

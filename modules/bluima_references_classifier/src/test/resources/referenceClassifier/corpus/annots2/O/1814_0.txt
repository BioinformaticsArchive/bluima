tracellular field-potential measurements in an in vitro disinhibition model of epileptiform activity also indicated that
epileptiform events were initiated in the mid- to deep layers
of human cortex as well (Hwa et al. 199 1). On this basis,
one might hypothesize that neurons with intrinsic burst-firing characteristics would be particularly common in midto deep cortical layers in regions of human cortex susceptible to seizures. We set out to test this hypothesis and de-scribe the proportions of physiological cell types in human
association neocortex, the relationships between physiological and morphological cell types, and the differences in
electrical properties between types.

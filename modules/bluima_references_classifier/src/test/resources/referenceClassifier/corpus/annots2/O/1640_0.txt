Radial exclusion and caudal migration of the nVII
motor neurons are interdependent mechanisms
We showed that in the olt embryos, the mismigrated nVII motor
neurons extended aberrant processes towards the ventricle at right
angles to the anterior-posterior axis (Fig. 4N,P). These observations
suggest that the nVII motor neurons in the olt embryos lose their
ability to migrate caudally. There was some, albeit incomplete,
migration of the nVII motor neurons in the ord embryos, apparently
because of functional redundancy with the celsr1a and celsr1b
genes. However, the migration of the nVII motor neurons in the ord
embryos was by no means normal in nature, and these neurons
stopped migrating at r5 and failed to reach r6. In the ord embryos,
the nVII motor neurons also invaded the neuroepithelial layer. These
results suggest that radial exclusion and caudal migration are
interdependent mechanisms of normal nVII motor neuron
migration. A recent study has shown that the tri/stbm gene is
essential for localization of Prickle to the anterior membrane of
neuroepithelial cells (Ciruna et al., 2006), suggesting that these
genes may control the anterior-posterior polarity of these cells
(Ciruna et al., 2006). This might provide some basis for caudal
migration of the nVII motor neurons.
In a previous study, we showed that the r4-derived nVII motor
neurons are composed of the branchiomotor neurons and the OLe
neurons (Higashijima et al., 2000; Wada et al., 2005), and that the
OLe neurons are possibly among the population to first migrate out
of r4 (Fig. 5D). However, by labeling the OLe neurons with DiI
retrogradely, we demonstrated that the OLe neurons failed to
migrate caudally and remained in r4 in the ord embryos (n=4, see
Fig. S7 in the supplementary material).

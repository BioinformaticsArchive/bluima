A comparison of BOLD responses after visual stimulation and electrical stimulation is shown in Fig. 2. The two
experiments were performed on the same monkey. The
visual stimulus was presented at 7° eccentricity (2° in
diameter). Based on an areal magnification factor of 0.95 at
this eccentricity [9], we would expect a volume of 4.8 mm3
to be excited in primary visual cortex (assuming a cortical
thickness of 1.7 mm). The volume activated due to the
BOLD response in opercular V1 was found to be 16 mm3 in
this experiment (Fig. 2A). However, electrical stimulation
with 800 AA (Fig. 2B) activated a much larger volume of
99 mm3.

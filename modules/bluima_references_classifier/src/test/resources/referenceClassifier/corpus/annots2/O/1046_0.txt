Histologic Analyses
At the end of the observation period, the animals were
anesthetized deeply with diethylether, sacrificed, and fixed by
perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were cut into
six serial 2.0-mm thick coronal blocks from the level of the
anterior pole of caudate nucleus to posterior. The six coronal
blocks were incubated in 25% sucrose for 24 hr, then cut into 6-or 20- m coronal sections. The 6- m coronal sections were
stained with hematoxylin/eosin (HE) for calculation of the
ischemic injury area, and the area of infarction and selective
neuronal death was detected. Infarction area was traced using
NIH Image software, and the total infarct volume (indirect
lesion volume) of the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated as a
percentage of the volume of the contralateral hemisphere, as
reported previously (Swanson et al., 1990).
To detect and estimate the number of surviving grafted
human NSPCs, immunostaining was carried out with mouse
immunoglobulin (Ig)M anti-human specific ribonucleoprotein
antibody (Chemicon). The 20- m coronal sections were incubated in mouse IgM anti-human specific ribonucleoprotein
(human anti-nuclear antigen; hANA; 1:400). Subsequently, the
avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) method was carried out, and the hANA-positive cells in the six coronal sections
throughout the rostral-caudal extent were counted under a light
microscope at a magnification of 100 . The total number of
surviving grafted cells in the whole brain was calculated by
summing the hundredfold numbers of hANA-positive cells from
all six coronal sections.
For double-labeled immunohistochemical staining, the
sections were incubated with the following antibodies: mouse
IgM anti-hANA, 1:400; mouse anti-neuronal nuclei antibody

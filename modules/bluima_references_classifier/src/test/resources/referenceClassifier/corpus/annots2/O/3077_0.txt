Fig. 3. PE peptide concentration in rostral
striatum and nucleus accumbens of 5- and
24-month-old control and ethanol-fed rats.
Each value represents the mean of the arbitrary density units (ADU) associated with the
PE band density on a Western blot. Aging was
associated with a significant reduction of PE
peptide in the rostral striatum [F(1,19)= 25.3,
p = 0.007].YC, young control; YE, young ethanol; OC, old control: OE, old ethanol.

was normalized to protein content, which was determined using the
bicinchoninic acid assay (Smith et al., 1985).
Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression (O'Donnell et al., 1984; Zhao et al., 2003). Bmax and Kd values
were determined for saturation experiments. The equation used for
the two-site model was B [BH/(1 C/ICH)] [BL/(1 C/ICL)],
where B is equal to the amount of radioligand bound; BH and BL are
the percentage of competitor binding to high- and low-affinity sites,
respectively; C is the competitor concentration; and ICH and ICL are
the IC50 values for the high- and low-affinity sites, respectively. For
the one-site model, BH equaled zero and the equation reduced to B
BL/(1 C/ICL). The percentages of the HARBS and the LARBS were
calculated from rolipram competition curves for inhibition of [3H]pi-clamilast binding by nonlinear regression using a two-site model. All
values are expressed as means S.E.M. from at least four independent experiments carried out in duplicate. Differences between the
treatment and control groups were analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance followed by Dunnett's test.
Materials. [3H]Rolipram was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [3H]Piclamilast was a gift from
GlaxoSmithKline (Valley Forge, PA). [3H]Nisoxetine and [3H]citalopram were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA).
Rolipram was provided by Schering AG (Berlin, Germany). Other
chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA)
or Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).

Bax were unchanged with HT at both gene and protein
levels. Thus, there was little or no effect of HT on these
members of the Bcl family.
Cytochrome c is a peripheral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane and functions as an electron shuttle
between complex III and complex IV of the respiratory
chain and its activity is necessary for life. Upon apoptotic
stimuli, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into
the cytoplasm where it oligomerizes with Apaf-1 forming a
complex known as apoptosome. Each apoptosome then
recruits caspase 9, which leads to activation by self-proteolysis. Recent data suggest that cytochrome c release
does not act in an all-or-nothing manner, but rather acts in
a biphasic fashion (Marsden et al., 2002; Scorrano et al.,
2002; Garrido et al., 2006). Although cytochrome c plays a
pivotal role in glutamate-induced neuron death, which is
ameliorated by pretreatment with Es (Zhang and Bhavnani, 2005), we observed no change in cytochrome c with
HT in the DRN region.

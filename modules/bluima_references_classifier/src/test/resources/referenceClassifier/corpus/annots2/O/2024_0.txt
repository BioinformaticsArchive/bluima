trials, for which it was 10 s). The signal was a
sinusoid waveform. In most sessions, stimulation was applied through 3 stimulating electrodes (3-poles), such that the same polarity
was applied to both hemispheres (side) versus
the opposite polarity applied to the center
(frontal) electrode (Fig. 1 Aa,d). This configuration yielded synchronous electric fields in
both hemispheres. In a few experiments, bipolar stimulation was used (Fig. 1 Ab,c). Trials
using the same stimulation protocol were combined for statistical analysis.
To assess the effect of stimulation on unit firing, each spike was assigned to the instantaneous
phase of the reference TES signal obtained by Hilbert transformation. The significance of phasemodulation was evaluated using Kuiper's test of
random deviation from uniformity on circular
data (Fisher, 1993). This omnibus test was preferred over the more standard Rayleigh test, since
our findings (such as bimodal phase preference)
precluded having a predefined assumption re-garding the modality of the TES-induced phase
entrainment and thus the application of conventional (unimodal) phase entrainment measures
(e.g., Rayleigh statistic). Since omnibus tests re-quire a sufficiently large sample of data, we ap-plied 2 criteria a) a minimum number of spikes
(at least 250 per stimulation protocol) and b) a
minimum number of trials (at least 5) for a given
stimulation intensity, frequency and configuration. Because both multiunits and single units
had different number of spikes and both were
tested against the same uniformity hypothesis, we
examined whether the number of spikes biased
our results. A fixed number of spikes (n 600,
n 1000) was randomly chosen from a given
TES session and tested against uniformity. Such
subsampling did not show any particular trend
substantially different from the case when all
spikes were included. Probabilities 0.01 were
regarded as significant.
For the color-coded population display, the
spike count of each unit was normalized by subtracting the mean spike count of that unit from
the spike count of each bin and dividing by the SD
(20° phase bins across one period of TES signal).
To examine the relationship between spikes
and the intrinsic slow oscillation, the peak spectral power of LFP (peakF) within the 0.4 –10 Hz
frequency range was computed in 3.2 s windows.
The original LFP signal was bandpass filtered
around peakF, between [0.75 peakF and 1.25
peakF] Hz, using second order, Butterworth Filter (a built-in Matlab function). The phase of the
bandpass filtered LFP was then derived by Hilbert
transformation. Phase-modulation of units by
the slow oscillation was evaluated by Rayleigh circular statistics, since the unimodal phase modulation by the intrinsic slow oscillation could be
safely assumed from previous experimental evidence (Steriade et al., 1993). For the display of
cycle-by-cycle unit firing, peri-event time histograms of spike times around the first/last troughs
of the reference TES signal were constructed.
For the analysis of the intracellular signal
( 1250 Hz, low-pass), the signal was bandpassed filtered (0.5–10 Hz) to remove the ac-tion potentials. The relationship between the

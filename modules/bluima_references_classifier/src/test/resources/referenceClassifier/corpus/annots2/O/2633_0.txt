FIG. 2. Diagrammatic representation of the
data obtained in a typical experiment. A: rostrocaudal distribution and extent of the arborizations of 5 stained collaterals (a-e) of an AD HFA
on the left side of the cord (ipsilateral to the denervated digits). This afferent had a RF on the me-dial side of the distal phalanx of digit 2 on the left
hindpaw (B, right inset). Arrow: point of HRP
injection, - 1.2 mm into the chronically deprived
digit 3 representation. B: filled squares: relative
locations of 8 spinocervical tract (SCT) cells
whose RFs were used to construct a somatotopic
map of the boundary region between the digit 2
and digit 3 representations, shown in a single horizontal plane through the right dorsal horn. The
RFs of these cells on the right hindpaw are indicated by the numbers and dotted outlines in the
left inset. Vertical dashed line: estimated position
of the boundary between the digit 2 and digit 3
representations. A and B are aligned in the rostrocaudal axis and are drawn at the same rostrocauda1 scale. Note that collaterals of the digit 2 afferent arose ~3.75 mm caudal to the digit 2 representation. Collaterals labeled a-d correspond to
those labeled a-d in Fig. 3A and to the reconstructions in Fig. 6, A-D. For further details see

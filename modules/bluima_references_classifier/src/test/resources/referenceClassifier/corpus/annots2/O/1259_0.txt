Stereotactic surgery is based on a high degree of accuracy in
defining and localising intracranial targets and placing
surgical tools. Brain shift can influence its accuracy
significantly. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic
nucleus can markedly change the quality of life of patients
with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the outcome depends
on the quality of electrode placement. A patient is reported in
whom the placement of the second electrode was not
successful. Deformation field analysis of pre- and postoperative three dimensional magnetic resonance images
showed an intraoperative brain movement of 2 mm in the
region of the subthalamic nucleus (the target point). Electrode
repositioning resulted in efficient stimulation effects. This case
report shows the need to reduce risk factors for intraoperative
brain movement and demonstrates the ability of deformation
field analysis to quantify this complication.

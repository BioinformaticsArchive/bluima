ing is unsuitable as a marker for NOS in glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue (see
Discussion). In the latter method, the use of two chromogens enabled
reliable distinction between cells containing only citrulline ( yellow), and
nNOS/citrulline (dark blue), but made it difficult to distinguish between
cells containing nNOS/citrulline (dark blue), and cells containing only
nNOS (blue).
The citrulline antiserum has been characterized previously (Eliasson
et al., 1997) and was used at a 1:12,000 dilution of purified crude
antiserum. Animals were perfused through the left ventricle with 37°C
oxygenated Krebs'–Henseleit buffer, followed by 250 ml of 37°C 5%
glutaraldehyde–0.5% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% Na2S2O5 in 0.1
M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Glutaraldehyde fixation is necessary be-cause the citrulline antiserum is specific for glutaraldehyde-linked citrulline and does not detect free citrulline (Eliasson et al., 1997). Brains were
post-fixed in the same buffer for 2 hr at room temperature and cryoprotected for 2 d at 4°C in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaC l,
20% (vol / vol) glycerol. Brain sections (40 μm) were cut on a sliding
microtome. Free-floating brain sections were reduced for 20 min with

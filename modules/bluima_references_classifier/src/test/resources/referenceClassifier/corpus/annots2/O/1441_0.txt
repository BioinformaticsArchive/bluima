Behavioral data
Behavioral results in terms of reaction time and accuracy are
shown in Figure 2. Inspection of the raw RT data revealed that
there were no excessively fast or excessively slow button presses
(i.e., there were no RTs 3 SDs from the mean). The number of
errors (and so the number of discarded trials) was measured by a
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA using TASK (SRT, GN-GRT, and CRT) and STIMULI (faces and houses) as withinsubjects factors. None of the factors were significant, demonstrating that errors were equally distributed among the tasks (5% for
SRT, 7% for GNGRT, and 8% for CRT) and the stimulus type
(6% for houses and 7% for faces). We also performed a two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA on the mean RT using TASKS and
STIMULI as within-subject factors. The TASK factor was found
to be significant (F(2,20) 54.6; p 0.0001), and a post hoc t test
showed that subjects were significantly faster in the SRT condition (RT, 415.7 ms) compared with both the GNGRT condition
(RT, 498.1 ms) and the CRT condition (RT, 604.6 ms), which
were significantly different from each other (all of the comparisons were significant at the p 0.0001 level). These results are in
agreement with previous findings demonstrating that differences
among the three RT tasks might be related to the gradual increase
of the number of cognitive processes from SRT to GNGRT and
from GNGRT to CRT tasks (Donders, 1969). Thus, the high ac-curacy and the significant differences in RT across the three tasks
imply that the subjects were carefully following the instructions
presented at the beginning of each trial by preparing the three
tasks in different ways.

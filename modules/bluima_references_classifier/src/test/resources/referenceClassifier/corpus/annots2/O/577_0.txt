in this area.
Paraffin wax-embedded material was processed
for electron microscopy (EM), which revealed in- tranuclear particles with the typical morphology of
herpesvirus (Fig. 4). In addition, immunohistochemical examination was performed with
polyclonal antibodies against herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (Dako⊂, Zug, Switzerland).
The peroxidase–antiperoxidase method with di- aminobenzidine as chromogen was applied. Neurons and glial cells within the necrotic area were
positively labelled with both antisera, showing a
homogeneous brown staining of the cytoplasm and

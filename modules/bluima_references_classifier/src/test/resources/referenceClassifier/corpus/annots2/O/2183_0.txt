Non-D-ASP-preferring OC neurons
Non-D-ASP-preferring neurons,labeledwith WGAHRP only,

only 13 neurons from this classwere studied electron-microscopically.SixwerelocatedintheSOCipsilateraltotheperfused

Also, 4 neurons of this type were found in the contralateral

SOC.No other obvious cytologicaldifferenceswerenotedamong
the non-D-ASP OC neurons.
Non-D-ASP OC neuronsare largerthan their D-ASP-labeled
counterparts.Their lengthsexceed20pm andtheir widths range
from 10 to 20 pm, dependingon whether the somais fusiform
or polygonal in shape.Their cytoplasm containsnumerouslarge
blocks of well-organized rough endoplasmic reticulum with
smaller,lessorganizedNisslsubstanceinterspersedthroughout
(Fig. 6). The nucleusis usually eccentrically placed in the fu- siform somataand centeredin the polygonal perikarya of non- D-ASP OC cells, and possesseosnly a moderate degreeof nu- cleoplasmicinfolding when compared to D-ASP OC neurons.
Twenty to 30% of the surface of each non-D-ASP neuron
profile studiedwasapposedto presynapticterminals(X= 24.0%;
s = 1.9; N = 13). Thesevalues were consistently greater than
thosefor D-ASP OC neuronsand allowed these2 groupsof OC
neurons to be divided into separatepopulations basedupon
their axosomatic synaptic profiles (Fig. 2A). The lower portion
of Figure 2B summarizesthe classificationand distribution of
31 synapticterminals on the non-D-ASP neuronsstudied.Four
types of axosomatic synapseswere observed. The majority of
presynapticterminals contained round and/or oval vesicles30- 40 nm in diameter and asymmetrical synaptic specializations,
with synaptic clefts measuring25-30 nm wide (Fig. 7A); onehalf of theseterminals contained densecore vesicles.This type
appearedsimilar to the one forming the vast majority of synapseson D-ASP OC neurons. Lessfrequently observed were
synapsescontaining large, round vesicles,40-50 nm in diameter, and prominent asymmetrical synaptic specializationsseparatedby a 30nm synaptic cleft (Fig. 8A); the terminal in Figure
8A receives a myelinated axon. Rarely seenwere axosomatic
synapses containing predominantly flat vesicles 40-60 nm in
length (Fig. 8B). In addition, a singlepresynaptic terminal was
observedcontactingbothalabeledandanunlabeledneuronin
the ventral nucleusof the trapezoid body contralateral to the
perfusedcochlea(Fig. 7B); this type contained lucent and uniformly small, round vesicles30 nm in diameter.

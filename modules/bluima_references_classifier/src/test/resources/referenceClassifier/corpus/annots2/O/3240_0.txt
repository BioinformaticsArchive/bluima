The molecular mechanisms underlying the targeting and localization of glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites is poorly
understood. Recently, we have identified a PDZ domaincontaining protein, glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1
(GRIP1), which specifically binds to the C termini of AMPA
receptor subunits and may be involved in the synaptic targeting
of these receptors. Here, we report the cloning of GRIP2, a
homolog of GRIP1, and the characterization of the GRIP1 and
GRIP2 proteins in the rat CNS. GRIP1 and GRIP2 are ;130 kDa
proteins that are highly enriched in brain. GRIP1 and GRIP2 are
widely expressed in brain, with the highest levels found in the
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Biochemical
studies show that GRIP1 and GRIP2 are enriched in synaptic
plasma membrane and postsynaptic density fractions. GRIP1 is
expressed early in embryonic development before the expression of AMPA receptors and peaks in expression at postnatal
day 8â€“10. In contrast, GRIP2 is expressed relatively late in

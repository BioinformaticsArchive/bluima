Figure 3. Behavioral test and body weight of Q71 and Q20 transgenic mice. For each animal indicated, we determined the
following: grip strength, the force (in pounds) needed to release the grip of a rod; Rotarod, the time (in seconds) taken to fall off
an accelerating rod; righting reflex, the time (in seconds) required for the mouse to turn its body to a normal position after being
placed on its back; activity, the counts detected by a passive infrared activity monitor; and body weight. The values obtained for a
given group of animals on different trials on consecutive days were pooled (n total number of values) and are represented in a
box plot. The black circle represents the average, and the line dividing the box represents the median; one-fourth of the data fall between
the bottom of the box and the median, and another one-fourth fall between the median and the top of the box. The lines attached to the
box extend to the smallest and the largest data values. Outliers are indicated as small circles and defined as values smaller than the lower
quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range or larger than the upper quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range. hom., Homozygotes; Wt, wild type.

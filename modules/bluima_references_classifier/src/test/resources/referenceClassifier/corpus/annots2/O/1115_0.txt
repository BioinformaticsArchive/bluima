FIGURE 2. Fibrillation-related tongue movements plotted across
days after hypoglossal nerve crush are shown comparing recovery from a proximal (N 4) or distal (N 4) crush location (A).
In (B), the results for the distal crush location are shifted forward
3 days relative to the proximal crush results, effectively compensating for the difference in nerve regeneration length. Error bars
are standard deviation.

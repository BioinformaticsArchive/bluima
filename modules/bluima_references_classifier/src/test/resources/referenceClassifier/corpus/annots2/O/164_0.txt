mean number of blocks with no CRs was 5.4 (range, 2–9) corresponding to a mean time of 27 min (range, 10 – 45 min). For 5 mM
infusions, the mean number of blocks with CR abolition was 8.8
(range, 7–12), corresponding to 44.2 min (range, 35– 60 min).
Both concentrations of C NQX reduced CR frequencies and
amplitudes (Fig. 3). After infusions of CNQX at 1.54 mM concentration, percent CRs were significantly different from those
seen after vehicle infusion at equivalent time points within the
first 35 min ( p < 0.05, Newman–Keuls multiple-comparisons
test). For 5 mM C NQX inf usions, the effects on percent CR were
significant for the entire 50 min session duration ( p < 0.05).
Similar changes were seen for CR amplitude, with significant
differences ( p < 0.05) for the 1.54 mM concentration over the first
20 min and for the entire session with 5 mM CNQX ( p < 0.05).
Most subjects recovered both percent CRs and CR amplitude
within 1 hr of drug administration, with no residual effects at 24
hr (Fig. 2A,B). Percent CRs recovered sooner after infusion of
1.54 mM C NQX than 5 mM C NQX. Percent CRs were significantly different for the two doses from 30 min after infusion ( p <
0.05), and CR amplitude differences were significant at 40 min
( p < 0.05).
The single subject, F, with minor spread of CNQX into the
cerebellar nuclei had strongly depressed CR frequencies after
1.54 and 5 mM infusions. Although this subject had high CNQX
levels in rostral H V I, it cannot be ruled out that at least some of
these behavioral deficits derive from AMPA–kainate receptor
blockade in the nuclei.

Zebrin immunohistochemistry defined anatomical
boundaries of effective CNQX infusion sites
Zebrin II immunohistochemistry revealed clear zonal patterns of
immunopositive and immunonegative bands throughout the cerebellar cortex that were consistent across subjects. Three zebrinpositive bands were revealed in HVI coronal sections. These
three bands appear to correspond to zebrin zones P4+, P5+, and
P6+ that have already been defined in the rat (Brochu et al., 1990;

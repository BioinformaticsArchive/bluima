Push and pull instructions were varied according
to a predetermined pseudorandom order.
PERTURBATION. The handle perturbation serving to trigger the movement specified by the
prior instruction was produced by a brushless
DC torque motor (Aeroflex TQ34- 1). Torques
of 60 ounce-inches were delivered by the
motor, and the 6-inch rod coupling the motor
shaft to the handle grasped by the monkey re-sulted in an effective force of 10 ounces at the
monkey's hand. The torque motor was driven
by an operational power supply (Aeroflex
AM2OOA). The lag between the application of a
step to the input of the power supply and the rise
of torque motor output (as detected by a strain
gauge) was 4 ms. Once initiated, the torque output from the motor continued until the response
(whether correct or incorrect) had been completed. Response completion was defined as en-trance of the handle into either the push or the
pull zones illustrated in Fig. 1.
REWARD. When the zone specified by the prior
instruction was entered following the perturbation, a reward (fruit juice or fruit puree) was
delivered. An incorrect response did not lead to
reward. In either case, a new cycle of behavior
now began, with a return to the holding position
of the Preinstruction holding step given above.

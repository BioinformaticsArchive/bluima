exercise also stimulates the growth hormoneâ€“IGF-I axis in hu-man beings (Wallace et al., 1999), it is conceivable that changes in
lifestyle associated with modern culture, and more specifically
increased sedentarism, contributes to an increasing incidence of
neurological diseases attributable to acute or progressive neuronal death observed in developed countries. Thus, neuronal de-mise could be added to the growing list of pathological conditions
in which sedentarism is a risk factor.
Exercise not only attenuates the impact of a brain insult but
also impedes progression of ongoing neurodegeneration. Thus,
exercise reduces or abolishes (depending on the type of insult)
neuronal death and decreases or entirely blocks behavioral im-pairment after neurotoxic insult. Sedentary rats present severe
ataxia after 3AP insult compared with mild ataxia in exercised
rats, and sedentary mice show memory deficits after domoic acid
challenge that are not found in exercised mice. Furthermore,
exercise activates endogenous homeostatic mechanisms that counteract the ongoing neurodegenerative process, as seen previously in
brain-damaged or aging rats (Fernandez et al., 1998; Larsen et al.,
2000). Thus, during early stages of the degenerative process, en-dogenous neuroprotective mechanisms (such as brain uptake of
serum IGF-I) allow exercising animals to recover normal behavioral performance, whereas sedentary animals remain impaired.
Many mechanisms are likely involved in protection by exercise

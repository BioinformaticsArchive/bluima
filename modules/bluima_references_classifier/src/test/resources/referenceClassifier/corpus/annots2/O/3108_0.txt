The paraformaldehyde-fixedbrains were then transferred to 30% sucrose
inphosphatebuffer.Thirty-micrometerfrozencoronalsectionswerecutona
microtome and collected in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
sections were rinsed three times in PBS and treated with 0.3% H,O, in PBS
for 15 min to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were
rinsed in PBS six more times to remove the residual H,02 The sectionswere
then blocked for 2 hr in the immunoreaction buffer (10 mM PBS containing
0.25% Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum) without antibody; antibody (final
dilution: 1:20,000) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 60
to 72 hr at 4Â°C. The antibody was obtained from Oncogene Science, Inc.
(Cambridge,MA);theantibodywasraisedagainstresidues4to17ofhuman
c-Fos protein. Chan and Sawchenko= have shown that specific staining with
this Fos antisera is blocked after preadsorption overnight with 100 p M of
synthetic immunogen.
The sections were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with the
biotinylatedgoatanti-rabbitIgG(1:200ofsecondaryantibody)in10mMPBS
containing 0.3%Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum for 2 hr at room temperature.Thesectionsweresubsequentlyincubatedwithhorseradishperoxidase
avidin-biotin complex in 10 mM PBS for 2 hr at room temperature. The
sectionswererinsedthreetimesinPBSandplacedin0.1MTris(pH7.4)for
5 min. The chromatic reaction was completed with diaminobenzidine (50
mg/100 ml of 0.1 M Tris) in the presence of 0.01% nickel ammonium sulfate
solution and 0.035% hydrogen peroxide. The sections were mounted onto
slides, dehydrated, and cover-slipped with Permount. For the quantitative
morphometric analysis, an Olympus BX60 microscope linked to a Image Pro
Plus(MediaCybernetics,SilverSprings,MD)imageanalysissystemwasused.
The regions counted include those that have been described previously.'8
New regions included in this study were taken from the Mouse AtZmZ9Only
one section was analyzed per region per mouse. Data are expressed as the
actual number of Fos-positive cellsiregiodsection. Data were analyzed by
standardanalysisofvariance(ANOVA)techniques.Werecognizethatmany
of the regions are both structurally and functionally related and thus, the
number of independent tests is significantlyfewer than the number of regions
examined. For the ANOVA, the threshold for significance was set at p <
lo-'. Post-hoc analysis used Duncan's multiple range test. The significance
level again was set at p < lo-'.

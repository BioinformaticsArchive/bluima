by relatively higher NH4 oxidation activity compared with
+


NO2 oxidation activity. The NO2 concentration decreased
--

below a depth of about 50 μm, and the NO3 concentration
-

increased up to a depth of about 150 μm, at which point O2
was depleted. However, no further significant NH4 oxidation
+


was observed below a depth of 75 μm, although both NH4
+


and O2 were still present.
Average NH4+ fluxes of 0.08 and 0.13 μmol cm-2 h-1 were
found in the autotrophic nitrifying biofilms (thickness, ca. 200
μm) cultured with and without 100 μM NO2 , respectively;
-

these values were comparable to the flux of 0.09 μmol cm-2
h-1 obtained with the wastewater biofilm, which was about
2,000 μm thick. Thus, the nitrifying activity of the autotrophic
biofilm was ca. 10 times higher than the nitrifying activity of the
wastewater biofilm.

quences as documented in the present and previous studies
(48).
Our findings of an association between clinical status, viral
envelope sequence, and in vitro biological effects conferred by
the viral sequences suggest a possible relationship between
viral protein variation and occurrence of clinical dementia.
However, the actual in vivo mechanisms influencing the development of dementia in AIDS patients remain unclear. To
determine the true pathogenic effects of different HIV-1 en-velope sequences in the brain, in vivo assays will be essential.
Potential models include SCID mice inoculated with HIVinfected macrophages in the brain (66), transgenic animals (62,
63), or SIV/HIV recombinant viruses constructed for testing in
primates (57).

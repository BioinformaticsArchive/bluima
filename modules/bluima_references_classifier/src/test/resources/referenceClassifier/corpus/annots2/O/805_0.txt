from their use of a common substrate (for a review Wu and
Morris, 1998). We have recently demonstrated an overall
inverse relationship between the total NOS and arginase
activity (Liu et al., 2003a), which appears to reflect a competitive relationship between the two enzymes. By contrast, however, in the present study the patterns of NOS
and arginase activity were similar. It should be pointed out
that the experimental conditions were exactly the same
between the two studies except for the tissue harvest: the
sample tissues were harvested from frozen brains in the
study of Liu et al. (2003a) whereas the samples were
collected from fresh brains in the present study. At the
present stage, it is unclear whether the difference in the
tissue harvest conditions would entirely account for the
discrepancy.
One aim of the present study was to investigate agerelated changes in both NOS and arginase in the subregions of the hippocampus. We found that there was a
significant increase in total NOS activity in the DG and a
small change toward an increase in CA1 in the aged
relative to the young groups. Western blotting revealed
that the eNOS protein expression was dramatically de-creased in aged CA2/3 and there was no significant
change in nNOS expression between groups in any subregion of the hippocampus. It should be noted that, to the
best of our knowledge, there is no previous study on
changes of NOS activity and protein expression in the
sub-regions of the hippocampus during aging. Although
several previous studies have investigated the age-related
changes in NOS in the whole hippocampus, the findings
are quite controversial. It has been shown, for example,
that NOS activity and nNOS mRNA are significantly in-creased in the aged hippocampus (Sugaya et al., 1996; La
Porta and Comolli, 1999; Law et al., 2000) and the mRNA
expression of nNOS correlates well with age-associated
cognitive impairments (Sugaya et al., 1996; Law et al.,
2000). These findings suggest that increased nNOS activity and mRNA expression may lead to NO-mediated neurotoxicity, which appears to be consistent with the freeradical theory of aging (Harman, 1956) and the NO hypothesis of aging (McCann, 1997; McCann et al., 1998). In a
recent study by Law et al. (2002), significant decreases in
nNOS activity and protein expression and an increase in
iNOS protein expression were found in the aged hippocampus, suggesting that aging is associated with a de-cline in nNOS and elevated iNOS. In contrast with these
findings, however, Necchi et al. (2002) reported that nNOS
protein in the hippocampus did not differ between young
and aged animals. We have recently demonstrated significant decreases in nNOS and eNOS protein expression in
the aged dorsal and ventral hippocampus, respectively,
with no changes in the total NOS activity (Liu et al., 2003a).
In addition, iNOS, both in terms of activity and the protein
expression, was not detected in the study of Liu et al.
(2003a) and there was no difference between young and
aged rats in terms of iNOS protein expression in the study
of Necchi et al. (2002). At the present stage, it is unclear
whether the discrepancy is due to the difference in the

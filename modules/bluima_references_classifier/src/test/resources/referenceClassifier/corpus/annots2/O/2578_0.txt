behavioural measures (see Section 8.10). The two cloned DA D2 receptor variants from rat and
humans expressed in different cell lines reveal, in most instances, virtually indistinguishable binding
characteristics (Giros et al., 1989; Monsma et al., 1989; Hayes et al., 1992), corresponding to those
of the native striatal DA D2 receptor (for reviews see Seeman, 1981, 1992). However, a distinction
in binding properties between the D2415and D 2 ~ has been reported recently for several substituted
benzamides. D24~5.when expressed in Ltk- cells, showed a 2- to 5-fold higher affinity than D24~ for
clebopride, DO 710, raclopride, remoxipride, (-)sulpiride and YM 09151-2 (Castro and Strange,
1993). Consistent with the situation for the striatal DA D2 receptor (see Section 4), stimulation of
both D2415(Albert et al., 1990; Bates et al., 1991; Neve et al., 1989; Vallar et al., 1990), D2~4

inhibit cAMP production or AC activity, in both a concentration-dependent and DA D2 receptor
specific manner. This also applies to the two human DA D2 receptor splice variants, expressed in
CHO (Hayes et al., 1992) or Ltk- cells (Liu, Y. F. et al., 1992). With prolonged agonist treatment,
the D2415 receptor coupling to AC is desensitised, e.g. the acute agonist-mediated response is
attenuated (Bates et al., 1991). An added note of interest is the observation that both D2415and D2~4
can repress unstimulated levels of co-transfected PRL promoter expression in this cell type in the
presence of DA (McChesney et al., 1991). This provides a basis for the observed DA-mediated
attenuation of PRL release at the level of gene transcription.
The DA D2 receptor-effector coupling is thought to be mediated through a Gi- or Go-protein, as
prior treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX, or islet-activating protein) blocks this pathway
(Albertet al., 1990;Bateset al., 1991;Hayeset al., 1992;Kantermanet al., 1991;Liu, Y. F.et al., 1992;
Neveetal.,1989;Vallaretal.,1990).PTXcatalysesADP-ribosylationofaCysresidue,whichislocated
4 amino acids from the C-terminus of the ~-subunit of these heterotrimeric G-proteins. In brain, Gi- or Go-proteins and in vertebrate retina, G t (transducin) possess this Cys residue and consequently
are able to act as PTX substrates. The ADP-ribosylation functionally uncouples receptors from G:,
Gt- or Go-proteins. The G-proteins play a pivotal role in transducing ligand-receptor-mediated
signals to an effector (for a review, see Spiegel et al., 1992; see also Section 4).
Additional second messenger pathways have been described for the cloned receptors. D2414,D24~5
and D2443 receptor activation also causes increases in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI)
hydrolysis and intracellular calcium (\[Ca2+\]iw) hen monitored in Ltk- cells (Liu, Y. F. et al., 1992b;
Vallar et al., 1990). There is also a PTX-sensitive increase in \[Ca2+\]in CHO cells when either of the
human recombinant DA D2 receptor variants are expressed (Hayes et al., 1992). Research by Vallar
et al. (1990) elegantly illustrates that receptor-effector coupling is not only a function of the structural
features of the receptor molecule, but is also dependent on the properties of the cell in which the
receptor is expressed. With the exception of the negative control of AC activity, the D2415receptor,
when expressed in PRL-secreting GHaCI cells, exhibited a second messenger coupling pattern that
was the reverse of the pattern monitored in Ltk- cells, although the two cell lines expressed similar
receptor levels. In contrast to what was found in the Ltk- cells, no PI response was detected in the

concomitantly hyperpolarized, a phenomenon presumably dependent on the opening of K รท channels
(Bates et al., 1991; Hayes et al., 1992; Vallar et al., 1990). These actions were evidently conveyed by
Gi-orGo-proteinsbecausetheywereblockedbypriortreatmentwithPTX(Batesetal.,1991;Hayes
et al., 1992; Vallar et al., 1990).
The benefit of the structural differences of the two D2 splice variants have been exploited in order
to develop antibodies that recognise either receptor subtype (David et al., 1991). These antibodies
will certainly provide invaluable tools for studying the distribution and function of the bona fide
receptor proteins.

Fig. 2. IHC detection of PrPSc deposition (peroxidase/AEC, red deposits) in the obex (a, b)
and in the lymphoid follicles of tonsil (c, d), from scrapie positive Massese sheep. In animals
which resulted positive by the rapid test, PrPSc accumulation was detected both within the
DMNV and outside it, associated with neurons, neuronal axons and glial cells (a, bar 50 μm).
In contrast, sheep negative to the rapid test, showed immunolabelling only within the DMNV,
mainly associated with glial cells (arrows) (b, bar 25 μm). In tonsil, positivity was detected
within the follicular germinal centers (c, bar 100 μm), involving presumed tingible body
macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (d, bar 25 μm)

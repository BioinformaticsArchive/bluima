Effects of glutamate stimulation of subretrofacial neurones on sympathetic activity
The ventral medulla was explored with a micropipette containing sodium
glutamate: the left side only in one cat, but both sides in the other four.
Microinjections were made with the pipette tip 05 mm below the surface. At fortytwo sites these evoked a positive response, which we define as an increase in muscle
and/or cutaneous sympathetic fibre activity greater than 25% of the pre-stimulus
control level. At nineteen of these sites (referred to here as 'mixed points'), they
elicited positive responses in both fibre types (e.g. Fig. 2A). At sixteen sites ('skin
points'), they produced a positive response in only the cutaneous fibre (e.g. Fig. 2B),
while at seven others ('muscle points'), positive responses were produced in only the
muscle fibre (e.g. Fig. 2C). At least one point of each type was found in every cat.

Figure 7. Effect of NLA or NDA mPRF microinjections on the ability of
mPRF neostigmine (Neo) microinjection to increase the amount of time
spent in a REM sleep-like state over a 2 hr period. The ordinate shows
percent of time (mean + SD) spent in a polygraphically defined REM
sleep state (A), NREM sleep (B), or wakefulness (C) after microinjection
of saline, 40 mM Neo, 22.8 mM NLA pretreatment to Neo (NLA/Neo), or
22.8 mM NDA pretreatment to Neo (NDA/Neo). Neo microinjection
increased the amount of time spent in REM sleep (A), while decreasing
NREM sleep time (B). NLA pretreatment (NLA/Neo) significantly attenuated the ability of Neo to enhance REM sleep time (A) and decrease
NREM sleep percentage (B). NDA pretreatment did not alter the effect of
Neo on REM sleep and NREM sleep time. (C) None of the mPRF
microinjections produced a significant effect on the percent time spent in
wakefulness compared with saline control. Asterisks indicate significant
difference compared with saline ( p < 0.01; independent t tests, Bonferroni correction); â€ , significant difference from NLA / Neo injections ( p <
0.05).

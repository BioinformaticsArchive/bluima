tors, OT containing fibers contacted some neurons and not others. This nonuniformity in OT-responsiveness and innervation
of NTS neurons supports observations on NTS neurons physiologically characterized in vivo (McCann and Rogers, 1990). Be-cause the mechanisms of OT action across OT-sensitive neurons
were similar, our data suggest that the heterogeneous innervation
may confer the specificity that we found in the physiological ac-tions of OT. Both OT and vasopressin are linked to cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptive vagal afferents that provide integrative regulation of cardiovascular, body fluid and electrolyte
homeostasis (Cunningham et al., 2002). Together with what is
known about vasopressin actions in NTS, our findings and others
suggest that OT and vasopressin released by PVN axons in the
NTS provide functionally opposite controls that may act at different neuronal cell groups (Raggenbass, 2008). These converse
actions of OT and vasopressin on cranial visceral afferent neurotransmission may underlie coordinated hypothalamusâ€“ brainstem interactions during complex behaviors as part of both acute
and chronic adaptive coordination of visceral function (Li et al.,
1997; Martins et al., 2005).

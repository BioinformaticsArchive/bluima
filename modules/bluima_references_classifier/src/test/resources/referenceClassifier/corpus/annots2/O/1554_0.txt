Across-modality responses to
intelligible language
We identified voxels that were common to
the contrasts of speech with rotated speech
and written text with false font (Fig. 5). As
expected from the individual contrasts, a

TP. Because the perception of unintelligible stimuli without task demand may be
associated with stimulus-independent
processes, including both episodic and se- mantic memory, we examined the contrasts of spoken and written language with
the number task (Stark and Squire, 2001).
In addition to activity within the left lateral
TP that had been identified in the previous
comparison, activation common to processing spoken and written language was
identified in the left anterior FG, and at the
junction of the TOP junction, just ventral
to the angular gyrus (Fig. 5). There were
additional common activations in midline
cortex: posterior to the splenium of the
corpus callosum, in the superior frontal
gyrus and in medial orbitofrontal cortex
(Fig. 5).
Mean activity across subjects in the
three left hemisphere ROIs were entered
into separate 2 (modality) 2 (intelligibility) ANOVAs. Within the lateral TP, there
were significant main effects of both mo- dality (auditory visual, F(1,10) 27.9,

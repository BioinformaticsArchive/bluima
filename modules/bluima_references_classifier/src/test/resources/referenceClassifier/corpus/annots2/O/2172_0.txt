for antibody decoration, the protofilament structures on the
surface of MTs could not be observed, while MT could be easily
identified by the width of filaments. In the sample incubated
with anti-MAP2 IgG and ferritin-labeled second Ab, ferritin
antibody complexes were found to decorate crossbridges be-tween microtubules and neurofilaments heavily (Fig. S),whereas
crossbridges in the control specimen were not decorated (Fig.
9).
Reconstitution study
MAP2 bound to NFs assembled by L proteins. We attempted to
assemble neurofilaments in vitro to determine whether neurofilaments are crosslinked with microtubules by MAP2 molecules. For this purpose we used neurofilaments from L proteins
only, because H proteins (200 kDa) may also contribute as

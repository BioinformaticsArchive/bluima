Recently, Engelender and colleagues identified a novel
protein that interacts with α-synuclein, which they termed
synphilin-1.41 Interestingly, cotransfection of constructs
encoding α-synuclein (the NAC domain) and synphilin-1 in
cultured cells yields cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions
resembling LB.41 In a previous study,42 we carried out an
immunohistochemical examination of both normal and PD
brains, using antibodies against synphilin-1. In the normal
brain, a fine granular antisynphilin-1 staining of the neuropil was observed (Fig. 4a), the staining pattern being very
similar to that of α-synuclein. In addition, a less intense
antisynphilin-1 staining of the neuronal cytoplasm and
processes was observed (Fig. 4a). In the PD brain, virtually
all classical LB were shown to be immunopositive for
synphilin-1 (Fig. 4b): in contrast with α-synuclein, this protein was localized mainly in the core. Cortical LB often
failed to show synphilin-1 immunoreactivity. Pale bodies or
Lewy neurites were immunonegative for synphilin-1.
Recently, we confirmed that various neuronal and glial

Electrical seizure thresholds

Clonic and tonic– clonic seizures were induced via transcorneal
stimulation (60 Hz, 0.2 s, biphasic), using an apparatus similar to
that described by Woodbury and Davenport (1952). Limbic seizures were induced via transcorneal stimulation (6 Hz, 3 s,
monophasic) using a Grass S48 stimulator (Grass Instruments
Division, Astro-Med, Inc., W. Warwick, RI, USA) as previously
described (Barton et al., 2001). Prior to the placement of the
corneal electrodes, a drop of 0.5% tetracaine was placed on the
eyes. Animals were manually restrained and released immediately following the stimulation and observed for the presence or
absence of a seizure. Clonic seizures were characterized by jaw
and forelimb clonus, and could also include rearing and falling.
Tonic– clonic seizures were characterized by the presence of full
tonic hindlimb extension. Limbic seizures were characterized by
immobility, forelimb clonus, twitching of the vibrissae, and Straubtail. Seizure thresholds were determined by the staircase procedure as described by Finney (1971). Briefly, the stimulation intensity for an animal was determined by the response (defined as the
presence of a seizure) or lack of response of the previous animal.
The convulsant currents required to produce seizures in 3%, 50%,
and 97% of the population were calculated using Probit analysis
(Finney, 1971).

neuronal excitability as compared to fusimotor
discharge have varied, but most investigators
now agree that both factors are involved. The
work of Phillips (11) and Koeze et al. (5) on
projections of motor cortex PTNs to alpha and
gamma motoneurons points to a mechanism
whereby the changes of PTN discharge in motor
cortex prior to an intended movement may give
rise to changes of excitability of muscle spindles
and motoneurons which will participate in the
movements. In addition, the excitability of mo-toneurons could be modulated by way of de-scending control of interneuronal pathways and
of excitability of synaptic terminals of muscle
spindle afferents in the spinal cord (9).

Is estrogen a neuroprotective agent in brain injury?
Estrogen and ischemic stroke therapy
In one of the first studies to look at sex differences in
brain injury outcome and to consider estrogen as a
neuroprotective agent, Hall and colleagues13 observed
that ischemic necrosis was less pronounced in female
compared with male gerbils. They attributed this
finding to the characteristic of estrogen as a lipid
antioxidant. Later, Emerson et al.14 examined
whether estrogen could alter the acute changes in free
Mg2+ concentration and energy metabolism following
cortical fluid percussion injury in both male and
female rats. In females, administration of estrogen
did not prevent the injury-induced decline in free
Mg2+, whereas in males the loss was cut by ~25%.

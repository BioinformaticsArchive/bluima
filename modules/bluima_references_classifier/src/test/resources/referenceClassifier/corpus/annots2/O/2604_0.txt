AscompellingastheconnectionbetweenHFandspaceis,it
nonethelessremainsunclear what particular role HF plays in
spatial cognition. What cognitive mechanism(s)is regulatedby
HF that can explain why birds and mammalswithout an HF
have difficulty learning to navigate or identify goal locations?
Of the various models developed to explain HF function, at
leasttwo have specificallyattempted to explain the relationship
betweenHF and space.O'Keefe and Nadel(1978) have argued
that HF participates in the learning and operation of cognitive
maps. Sutherland and Rudy (1989; but seeDavidson et al.,
1993) have arguedthat HF participates in configural learning
with spaceasone configural component. But what is it about
learningacognitive mapthat HF may beparticularly well suited
to regulate?What is it about learning a spatial configuration
that may necessarilyinvolve HP?

Pigeonhoming behavior, a cornerstoneof ethological research
for more than 40 years, appearsparticularly well suited. The
complex array of spatial mechanismshoming pigeonscan em-ploy to return to their loft (Wallraff, 1990;Berthold, 1991)and
how such mechanismsare learned (Wallraff, 1974; Wiltschko
and Wiltschko, 1982, 1987; Ioale et al., 1990)have beenreasonably well described.A further advantageis that homing pi-geonscan be studied under natural environmental conditions
that allow them to display the richnessof their navigational
ability (Bingman, 1992).
HF lesionshave been found to disrupt the learning of two
spatial navigation mechanismsin homing pigeons.First, homing pigeonswith HF lesionsareimpaired in learningto navigate
homefrom distant, unfamiliar locations (Bingmanet al., 1990;
Bingman and Yates, 1992).To navigate home from a distant,
unfamiliar location, homing pigeons rely on their so-called
“navigational map” (Kramer, 1959; Wallraff, 1974).Although
it is unclear if the navigational map is a map in the literal sense

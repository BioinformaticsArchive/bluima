In the present study, we evaluated two sensitive and specific indicators of estrogen toxicity based on the rodent mod-9.

POMC gene transcripts in monkeys receiving either estrogen

or estrogen plus progesterone. In addition, no differences
between treated and untreated groups were observed in the

size or autoradiographic grain density of POMC neurons.
Furthermore, no changes were detected in the shape (form
factor index) of POMC neurons in the hormone-replaced 12.

In summary, the present data suggest that different mech- 16.

kinking during movement of the cat. The other end of the
swivel was connected by a tube to a strain gauge transducer (Statham, P23Db). The venous cannula was taped
to the side of the spring and was connected directly to
another transducer (Statham, P23Gb) when venous pressure was recorded. At other times, the end of the venous
cannula was sealed and allowed to rotate freely as the cat
moved about the cage. Arterial and venous pressures were
displayed on a Beckman polygraph (type RM). The peak
of the arterial pressure pulse was used to trigger a cardiotachometer (Beckman 9857) and the heart rate was simultaneously displayed. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)
was computed by an electronic averaging circuit (time
constant = 0.53 second). Corrections were made to compensate for the difference in the heights of the recording
transducers and the level of the heart. The cannulas were
kept open by periodic flushing with heparinized saline.

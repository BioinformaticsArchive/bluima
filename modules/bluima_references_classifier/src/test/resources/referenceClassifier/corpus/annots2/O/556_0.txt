FIG. 4. Enrichment of synphilin-1 into synaptic terminals during development. Western blot analysis of rat brain total homogenates and synaptosomes detected using anti-synphilin-1 antibody (A),
anti- -synuclein (B), and anti-synaptophysin antibodies (C) is shown.
The total homogenate was analyzed side-by-side with purified synaptosomal fraction to determine the degree of synphilin-1 enrichment
within synaptosomes. Synphilin-1 and -synuclein are enriched in synaptosomes of adult but not postnatal day 5 (P5) rats, suggesting that
they accumulate in presynaptic terminals of adults. The figure is representative of three experiments with three different synaptosomal
preparations. To determine the subcellular distribution of synphilin-1,
subcellular fractions were obtained by a series of differential centrifugations of adult rat brain homogenate. Equal amounts of protein from
different fractions were analyzed by Western blot using anti-synphlin-1
(D) and anti-synaptophysin antibodies (E). Similar to synaptophysin,
synphilin-1 was found to be enriched in the high speed pellet of the
lysed synaptosomal fraction (LP2), which is a fraction enriched in
synaptic vesicles. H, homogenate.

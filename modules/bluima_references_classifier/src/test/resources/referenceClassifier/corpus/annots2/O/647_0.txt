GABAergic V TA neurons are responsible for the acute rewarding effects of nicotine, whereas the slower and longer-lasting
activation of the mesolimbic DA pathway represents a separate
motivational process that mediates the aversive properties of the
nicotine stimulus (Laviolette and van der Kooy, 2002). Sustained
dysregulation of mesolimbic DA activity induced by nicotine may
represent the dysphoric withdrawal symptoms of nicotine use. In
the case of smoking behavior, repetitive intake of nicotine at
regular intervals might produce immediate rewarding effects by
activating non-DA VTA GABAergic neurons. However, after
continued nicotine exposure and sustained activation of an aversive DA signal, nicotine may be able to alleviate the aversive
motivational withdrawal effects of nicotine by restoring inhibitory
balance to the mesolimbic DA system through the acute activation of the GABAergic neurons.
We observed an attenuation of systemic nicotine-induced locomotor activity in TPP-lesioned animals. As discussed previously,
ascending cholinergic inputs from the TPP to the V TA have been
shown to functionally influence the activity of the mesolimbic DA
system (Blaha et al., 1996). Furthermore, systemic nicotineinduced locomotor activity appears to be dependent on the me-solimbic DA system (Clarke et al., 1988). Thus, one possibility is
that TPP lesions produced a partial blockade of systemic nicotineinduced locomotor activity by blocking excitatory cholinergic
inputs from the TPP to the VTA DA neurons. Alternatively,
descending V TA inputs to the TPP may in part be responsible for
the locomotor activating effects of systemic nicotine.
Nicotine has been reported to produce strong anxiogenic ef-fects (Zarrindast et al., 2000; Irvine et al., 2001). Furthermore,
lesions of the TPP have been reported to increase measures of
anxiety in various behavioral assays (Leri and Franklin; 1998;
Podhorna and Franklin; 1998). It has been reported that administration of anxiolytic drugs before place preference testing was
able to restore morphine but not amphetamine C PPs (Leri and
Franklin; 2000), suggesting that rather than blocking a specific
motivational process, TPP lesions induce high levels of anxiety
that simply overshadow an unblocked morphine reward signal at
the time of behavioral testing. Based on this suggestion, an
alternative explanation for the present findings is that TPP lesions
may amplify an aversive or anxiogenic nicotine signal within the
V TA, thereby overshadowing the rewarding properties of nicotine rather than interfering with a specific neural motivational
process. However, this interpretation is an unlikely explanation
for the present findings, because we observed not only a complete
blockade of an intra-V TA nicotine reward signal but also a
reversal of the motivational valence of intra-VTA nicotine from
rewarding to aversive. Thus, any putative anxiogenic effects in-duced by TPP lesions did not overshadow the conditioning or
expression of nicotine aversions. This nicotine-induced conditioned place aversion was apparent in the presence or absence of
the intra-V TA nicotine cue, indicating that TPP lesions were not
producing any state-dependent learning deficits. Furthermore,
lesioned animals were fully capable of discriminating flavor as-sociations with a systemic nicotine versus saline cue, again demonstrating that these animals were f ully capable of associating the
interoceptive nicotine stimulus (either intra-VTA or systemically) with exteroceptive cues (either environmental properties or
specific flavors).
The present study is the first demonstration of a functional link
between intra-VTA nicotine neural motivational substrates with
the brainstem TPP. Our results suggest that the TPP is specifically required for intra-VTA nicotine reward signaling. Interest-

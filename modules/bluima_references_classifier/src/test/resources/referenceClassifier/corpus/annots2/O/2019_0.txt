al., 1990; Marks et al., 1992; Salas et al., 2003; Winzer-Serhan and
Leslie, 2005) and may therefore influence nicotinic regulation of
attention within this brain region. It is not known how the 5
accessory subunit affects the function of whole neurons of attention circuits and the performance of attentional tasks.
Here, we investigate the role of the 5 nicotinic subunit in
nicotinic excitation of layer VI pyramidal neurons within the
mPFC using a mouse line in which the 5 subunit has been
genetically deleted (Salas et al., 2003). Using whole-cell electrophysiological recording in acute brain slices from adult mice, we
found that the presence of the 5 subunit dramatically increased
4 2* nicotinic currents in layer VI pyramidal neurons. Because
the 5 subunit changed the properties of nicotinic currents in a
population of neurons thought to be important for attention, we
next examined the role of the 5 subunit on the cognitive performance of mice on an attention task, the five-choice serial reaction
time test (5-CSRTT). Under conditions of high attentional de-mand, we found that accuracy in this task was significantly
greater in wild-type (WT) mice expressing the 5 subunit compared with mice that did not express the 5 subunit. Our results
indicate that the 5 nicotinic subunit plays a distinct role in
cholinergic modulation of the neurons in the major corticothalamic feedback layer and is required for normal attentional performance under challenging conditions.

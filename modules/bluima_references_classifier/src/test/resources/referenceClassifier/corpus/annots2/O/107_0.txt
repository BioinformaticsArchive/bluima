speed–direction preferences and subtracts the responses of V1
neurons with incompatible speed–direction preferences. For ex-ample, a model MT neuron tuned for up-rightward motion sums
responses of V1 neurons tuned for up and right and subtracts
responses of V1 neurons tuned for down and left.
Subtractive inhibition in MT predicts motion opponency and is,
therefore, consistent with the key aspects of our results. According to the model, MT activity elicited by a moving grating should
be reduced by superimposing a second grating moving in the
opposite direction (Figs. 2, 3, 9). MT activity should also be
reduced for paired versus unpaired dots (Fig. 5). According to
some models, activity should be completely canceled by superimposing motions in opposite directions (Adelson and Bergen, 1985;
van Santen and Sperling, 1985). Other models predict only partial
opponency, i.e., that neuronal activity should be reduced but not
abolished (Zemany et al., 1998). Our data, in both humans and
monkeys, are more consistent with the latter.
Consistent with the model, V1 activity was similar or slightly
larger for moving gratings than for counterphase gratings. The
response of an individual V1 neuron to a grating moving in its
preferred direction can be suppressed by superimposing a second
grating moving in the opposite direction, as predicted by the
divisive suppression in the model (Carandini et al., 1997; Tolhurst and Heeger, 1997a). However, superimposing the second
grating also enhances the responses of other V1 neurons. According to the model, the sum total neuronal activity in V1 should
depend only on the contrast energy of the stimulus, regardless of
its motion. Increasing the contrast energy by superimposing a
second grating should cause saturation of the sum total neuronal
activity at high contrasts (consistent with the data in Fig. 4), but
should never elicit a reduction in activity (consistent with the data
in Figs. 2 and 3).

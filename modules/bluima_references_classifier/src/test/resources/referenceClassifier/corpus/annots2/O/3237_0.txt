Fig. 1. Schematic illustration showing locations of the probe in
the nucleus accumbens and in the ventral tegmental area. The
locations found in the single probe experiments are indicated in
(A), and the locations found in the dual probes experiment are
indicated in (B). The diagram is taken from the atlas of Paxinos
and Watson;37 numbers represent anterior distance (mm) from
the interaural line.

1986; Palmer et al., 1987a,b), but also that loss of cholinergic and pyramidal
neurons correlate with the severity of dementia (Francis et al., 1985; Neary et
al., 1986; DeKosky et al., 1992); cortical interneurons, on the other hand, are
not affected until much later in the disease course (Francis et al., 1987; Lowe
et al., 1988). Although the cause of cell loss and its mechanism of propagation
is not yet known, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such
as superoxide anions (O2·-), hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been implicated (Volicer and Crino, 1990; Marksberry,
1997). Direct support derives from the demonstration of increased concentration of products of protein oxidation (Smith et al., 1991, 1996; Lyras et al.,
1997), DNA oxidation (Mecocci et al., 1994; Lyras et al., 1997) and lipid
peroxidation in AD. Thus, both basal and free radical-stimulated concentrations of a product of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) have been shown
to be elevated in the neocortex (Hajimohammadreza and Brammer, 1990;
Subbarao et al., 1990; Gotz et al., 1992; Palmer and Burns, 1994; Lovell et al.,
1995; Andorn et al., 1998) and hippocampus (Balazs and Leon, 1994) of AD
subjects. Another lipid peroxidation product is 4-hydroxynonenal, which has
also been shown to be elevated in AD (Montine et al., 1997; Sayre et al., 1997).
Lipid peroxidation is a self-propagating process that is initiated by free radicals. However, it is not clear whether elevated lipid peroxidation in AD is
attributable to increased formation of free radicals or a diminished antioxidant capacity.
The antioxidant defence system includes natural antioxidants (ascorbic
acid, Æ-tochepherol, â-carotene, reduced glutathione), oxygen radical
detoxification enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase) and glutathionedependent hydroperoxide enzymes (Cotgreave et al., 1988). Although the
brain is especially prone to ROS-induced damage because of its high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids and its large oxygen consumption,
it has only moderate amounts of superoxide dismutase and glutathione
peroxidase (Cohen, 1988). The selenium-dependant glutathione peroxidase
(glutathione reductase, EC 1.11.1.9) catalyzed oxidation of reduced glutathione (GSH) is one of the principal mechanisms of detoxifying H2O2. The
oxidised glutathione (GSSG) formed is then reduced by NADPH through
the action of glutathione reductase (glutathione reductase, EC 1.6.4.2).
Normally over 99% of the total cellular glutathione is in its reduced
form, indicating that the reductase reaction usually dominates (Kosower
and Kosower, 1978). This is achieved by maintaining a high NADPH/
NADP+ ratio by supply of NADPH from the pentose phosphate pathway
(Fig. 1).
In order to assess the integrity of the glutathione-dependent hydroperoxide system in AD, the activities of selenium-dependant glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were determined together with the activities
of two pentose phosphate enzymes: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD, EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD, EC
1.1.1.44). These enzymes have been assessed in the same AD subjects in which
increased lipid peroxidation in the inferior temporal cortex was previously
demonstrated (Palmer and Burns, 1994).

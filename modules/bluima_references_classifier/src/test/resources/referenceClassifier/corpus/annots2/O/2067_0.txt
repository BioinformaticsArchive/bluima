In focal cerebral ischemia, a region of cortex
adjacent to the severely ischemic or infarcted area
exists that is characterized by a moderate (40%)
decrease in tissue perfusion.19 This area has been
referred to as the ischemic penumbra, in which
neuronal damage is potentially reversible. Nedergaard and Diemer9 examined the histopathologic
changes in this area in rat brains 4 days after permanent MCA occlusion. In normoglycemic controls,
there was a wide zone of neuronal damage adjacent
to the infarct, but in hyperglycemic rats minimal
damage was found in this area. In the ischemic
penumbra, there was an inverse relation between
neuronal damage and plasma glucose concentration.
It is possible that the smaller area of severe ischemic
neuronal damage in our study is due to preservation
of neurons in this region of the cortex.
Significant differences in the pathophysiology of
the infarct periphery further suggest that hyperglycemia is protective in this area. Nedergaard and
Astrup20 demonstrated recurrent transient deflections in DC potential in the infarct rim in normoglycemic but not hyperglycemic rats subjected to MCA
occlusion. The deflections were associated with transient increases in extracellular potassium concentrations. Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations and subsequent depolarizations result in
increased intracellular calcium concentrations,1
which initiate a cascade of metabolic reactions resulting in multiple adverse effects including the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria,
the activation of phospholipases resulting in membrane damage and the accumulation of free fatty
acids,1 and the release of neurotransmitters including
excitatory amino acids.21 In hyperglycemic animals,
prevention of the initiating depolarizations and
potassium shifts may protect the ischemic penumbra
from irreversible damage resulting from this cascade.
Nedergaard and Astrup20 also demonstrated that
2-deoxyglucose phosphorylation increased by
approximately 200% in the infarct rim in normoglycemic but not hyperglycemic rats. Preventing this
hypermetabolism may also provide protection in the
ischemic penumbra.18 Thus, the beneficial effects of
hyperglycemia may be related to differences in the
pathophysiologic changes in the infarct rim. Reperfusion or significant collateral blood flow to this area
may modify these protective effects and explain why
hyperglycemia has different consequences in different models.
The actual mechanisms by which glucose blocks
depolarizations and hypermetabolism in the ischemic
penumbra are unknown. Perhaps hyperglycemia
alters membrane physiology or prevents glycopenia
where perfusion is decreased and glucose utilization
is increased.20 The protective effects of hyperglycemia do not appear to be mediated by changes in
osmolality. Although serum osmolality was not measured in our study, previous work by Ginsberg et al8
found that rats pretreated with mannitol had a
constant elevated serum osmolality that did not occur

Local perfusion of MDMA and 5-HT content
To determine whether the coinfusion of L-tyrosine and MDMA
could result in long-term depletions of striatal 5-HT, MDMA
(100 M) was reverse dialyzed alone or in combination with
L-tyrosine (500 M) or L-valine (500 M) into the striatum. The
decrease in 5-HT content was dependent on whether MDMA or
L-tyrosine was infused (significant interaction, F(3,16) 5.578;
p 0.05). Although MDMA alone or in combination with
L-valine did not affect 5-HT tissue content in striatum 1 week
later, coinfusion of MDMA and L-tyrosine produced a significant
decrease in 5-HT tissue content in striatum (q 5.472; p 0.05)
(Fig. 6 A). None of the infusion conditions affected DA tissue
content of the striatum 1 week later (Fig. 6 B).
To assess whether the long-term depletion of 5-HT observed
after the coinfusion of MDMA and L-tyrosine was dependent on
AADC, NSD 1015 (100 M) was coinfused with MDMA (100
M) and L-tyrosine (500 M) (Fig. 7). Consistent with Figure 6,
MDMA alone did not change striatal 5-HT content. In contrast,
the effect of the infusion of MDMA on 5-HT content was dependent on the presence of L-tyrosine (F(1,29) 6.221; p 0.05) (Fig.
7A). The combined infusion of MDMA and L-tyrosine significantly decreased 5-HT tissue content compared with the infusion
of MDMA alone (q 4.360; p 0.05) and L-tyrosine alone (q
3.985; p 0.05). The combination of NSD 1015 with MDMA and
L-tyrosine blocked the depletion of 5-HT produced by the
MDMA and L-tyrosine combination (t(14) 4.032; p 0.05).
None of the infusion conditions changed DA tissue content (Fig.
7B). The local infusion of MDMA or any of the infusion conditions used above did not produce changes in core body temperature (data not shown).

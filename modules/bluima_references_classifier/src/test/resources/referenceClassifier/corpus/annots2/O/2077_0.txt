Comparison of the efects of chordotomy on operant and
reflexive reactions
In addition to a severance of ascending axons, an anterolateral
spinal lesion interrupts descending pathways (e.g., Dahlstrom
and Fuxe, 1965; Kneisley et al., 1978) that modulate the excitability of neurons within the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral
gray of caudal segments (Westlund and Coulter, 1980; Carlton
et al., 1985; Basbaum et al., 1986). These serotonergic and noradrenergic systems have been shown to produce primarily in-hibitory effects on dorsal horn neurons (Willis, 1982; Yaksh,
1985; Mokha et al., 1986; Jones and Gebhart, 1987) and in-terruption of inhibitory influences on somatosensory input is
expected to produce both hyperesthesia and hyperreflexia. Op-erating under this assumption-that sensory input to projection
neurons and segmental reflex circuits would be modulated alikemany investigations have utilized reflexive responses to evaluate
influences on nociception by descending systems. However, to
test for a correspondence of reflex and sensory effects, it is im-portant to compare measures of each in response to manipulations of the descending systems. For interruption of descending influences by an anterolateral spinal lesion, this comparison
is most appropriate for stimulation of the ipsilateral side that
is supplied by intact lemniscal and spinothalamic pathways.
In contrast to the predominance of inhibition on dorsal horn
neurons, facilitatory effects on ventral horn neurons and on
spinal reflexes can be produced by serotonergic or noradrenergic
agonists (Fung and Barnes, 198 1; Carp and Rymer, 1986; Wiesenfeld-Hallin, 1987; Suzuki et al., 1988). Other descending
systems that may project via the anterolateral columns can in-hibit activation of motoneurons (e.g., Jankowska et al., 1968).
Thus, anterolateral lesions could produce either hyperreflexia
or hyporeflexia, depending on the relative potency of different
influences on the dorsal and ventral horns (White and Neuman,
1983).
In the present study, it was clear that the early ipsilateral effect
of the lesions was to decrease the amplitudes of flexion responses
to the same stimuli that elicited normal sensory (operant) re-actions on that side. Apparently, interruption of facilitatory ac-tions on the intermediate and ventral horns has a greater impact
on reflex responsivity than interruption of inhibitory influences
on the dorsal horn. Also, the absence of an ipsilateral effect on
operant responses in the early postoperative period suggests that
the descending anterolateral systems exert ipsilateral influences
predominantly upon autonomic and somatic reflex responsivity.
Thus, operant reactions and segmental reflexes were not affected
alike by the chordotomy.
The finding that the force of flexion reflexes was attenuated
caudal to anterolateral chordotomy has implications for models
of spasticity that can result from spinal cord injury. Clinically,
spasticity is characterized by exaggeration of stretch reflexes and

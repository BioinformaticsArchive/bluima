(ii) Inducible cytokines. The levels of IL-1 , IL-1 , IL-4,
IL-6, IL-10, IFN- , TNF- , and iNOS mRNAs were induced
or elevated in the brain during the course of infection (Fig. 2).
Cytokine mRNAs for IL-1 , IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN- were
not detectable in uninfected controls. TNF- was detected in
one uninfected mouse (Fig. 2, lane 4), but this animal was not
included in further analyses. IL-1 was detected in repeated
amplifications in some controls, but not others, as a barely
visible band and may be expressed on a constitutive basis at
very low levels. In infected animals, these cytokine mRNAs

difference became significant at 18 and 30 days whose average values
were, respectively, 0.150 ± 0.020 (n = 48), 0.161 ± 0.019 (n = 66;
P < 0.001; Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the long-lasting
persistence of the CFs, although transected and silent, in the molecular
layer of the adult Wlds cerebellum appears to delay new PC spine
formation and that the ultimate degeneration of the CFs, as in wild
type animals, precedes ectopic spine formation.

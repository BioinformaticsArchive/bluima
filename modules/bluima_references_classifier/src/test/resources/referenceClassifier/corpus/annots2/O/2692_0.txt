FIG, 2. Receptive field extending into the ipsilateral visual field. A : to
determine the size of receptive fields of cortical neurons a horizontal bar
( 5” X 1” ) was moved at different locatiorls. The presented neuron preferred the downward direction. The bar was moved at 4O”/s from up to
down and vice versa, centered at 12 and 6” ipsilateral, 12 and 6” contralatera1 and foveally, as shown in A. B: activity profiles for downward bar
movement accumulated for 20 sweeps (bin size 50 ms). Since time can be
transferred into spatial coordinates, the x-axis is double scaled in temporal
and spatial units.

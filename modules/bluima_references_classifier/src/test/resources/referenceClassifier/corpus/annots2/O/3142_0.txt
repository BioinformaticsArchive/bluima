at this synapse pass more current. Distinct populations of
NMDA receptors within single cells have been reported (Gottmann et al. 1997; Kew et al. 1998), and, indeed, in culture the
type of presynaptic input can dictate the subunit composition
(Gottmann et al. 1997). It also has been shown that NMDA
receptors expressing both NR2A and NR2B subunits are ex-pressed in the brain (Luo et al. 1997; Sheng et al. 1994).
However, the physiological characteristics of these receptors
are not known, therefore it cannot be determined whether they
play a role in the differences seen in the present results.
The presence of NMDA receptor transmission in both input
pathways to the LA studied here even at resting membrane
potentials adds to concerns (Li et al. 1995, 1996b; Maren et al.
1996) about behavioral studies showing that infusion of an
antagonist of NMDA receptors into the lateral and basal amygdala interferes with the acquisition of fear conditioning
(Gewirtz and Davis 1997; Maren et al. 1996; Miserendino et al.
1990). The possibility of effects on routine transmission must
be considered, particularly given that APV infusion in the
amygdala has been found to block the expression of fear (Lee
and Kim 1998; Maren et al. 1996).
It is intriguing to speculate that the differences seen here
between cortical and thalamic NMDA responses may lead to
different contributions to plasticity and fear conditioning. In
the rodent sensory cortex, long-term potentiation (LTP) susceptibility closely parallels the critical period for behavioral
modification of the whisker representation (Crair and Malenka
1995). Furthermore, the thalamocortical synapses show a de-crease in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents with age
that is accompanied by a reduced capacity to generate LTP
(Crair and Malenka 1995). By extension, if a similar situation
exists in the amygdala, the reduced NMDA-receptor-mediated
synaptic current at cortical compared with thalamic inputs
might suggest that the cortical input would show a lesser
capacity for LTP than the thalamic input. This issue could be
addressed in LTP experiments either in vitro or in vivo.

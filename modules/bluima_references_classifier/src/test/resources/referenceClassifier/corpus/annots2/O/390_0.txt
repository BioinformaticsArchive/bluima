ues (22,23). Unfortunately, the measurement of the trace of
a diffusion tensor usually requires three separate, independent measurements of the ADC in each orthogonal direction, thereby severely prolonging the duration of the ex-periment.
Recently, Mori and Van Zijl (24) presented a diffusion
MRI sequence that measures the diffusion trace in a single
spin-echo experiment. The research presented here was
aimed at the adaptation of this sequence for diffusion trace
1H NMR spectroscopy. In particular, the sequence was
combined with a single-volume localization technique and
water suppression and was modified and improved to
provide complete compensation for cross-terms of the ap-plied diffusion gradients with static background magnetic
field gradients. The sequence was evaluated by 1H NMR
spectroscopy on rat brain and skeletal muscle and 1H MR
imaging on rat brain.

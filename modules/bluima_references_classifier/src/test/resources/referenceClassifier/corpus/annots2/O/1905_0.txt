control ( p 0.05) for GR at the highest
concentrations applied. The NK-1 receptor antagonist SR potently reduced the frequency and amplitude of XII inspiratory
motor discharge in a concentrationdependent manner, nearly completely
blocking generation of inspiratory activity
at the highest dose (10 M, n 7). This
result indicates that SP is released endogenously even under baseline conditions
when 5-HT neurons are firing at a low rate,
consistent with previous biochemical
measurements of SP release in response to
electrical stimulation (Iverfeldt et al.,
1989).
Based on the dose–response relationships defined above, we bilaterally microinfused MeSG, KET, or SR into the preBo ̈ tC of slices (see Fig. 1 A for pipette
configuration), at the IC50 concentrations,
to directly determine the effect of 5-HT
receptor activation on the pre-Bo ̈tC
rhythm-generating network. MeSG (5
M) reduced inspiratory burst frequency
in the XII nerve by 79.5 4.3% ( p
0.001; n 8) (Fig. 6 A) after 2 min of bilateral microinfusion into the pre-Bo ̈tC.
Similarly, KET (7.5 M) reduced the frequency by 78.3 5.7% ( p 0.001; n 7)
(Fig. 6 B), while SR 140333 (7.5 M) re-duced frequency by 79.3 4.9% ( p
0.001; n 7) (Fig. 6C).
We then microinfused 5-HT or SarMet SP (an NK-1 receptor agonist) di-rectly into the pre-Bo ̈ tC, bilaterally to verify that the overall actions of 5-HT and SP
on inspiratory activity are excitatory at this
level as implied by the data using antagonists. Both agonists had strong and relatively fast excitatory effects on inspiratory
output (Fig. 6 D–F ). Serotonin (30 M) in-creased inspiratory discharge frequency by
107 7.9% ( p 0.001; n 5) (Fig. 6 D, E)
and reduced the amplitude of inspiratory
bursts by 23 5.7% ( p 0.001; n 5)
(Fig. 6 D). Similarly, Sar-Met SP (1 M)
increased the frequency by 115 8.2%
( p 0.001; n 5) (Fig. 6 F) and reduced
the amplitude of inspiratory bursts by
21 4.7% ( p 0.001; n 5; data not
shown).
Together these results indicate that Figure 4.

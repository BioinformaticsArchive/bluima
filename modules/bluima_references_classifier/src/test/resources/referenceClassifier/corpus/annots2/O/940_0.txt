Fig. 8. Comparison of the levels of PDE1B mRNA in the striatum of WT and R6/1 and R6/2 HD mice. Densitometric analysis of the in situ hybridization
with a probe complementary to the coding region of PDE1B (HD61). The histogram summarizes the quantification of signals in the striatum. Data
represent means S.E.M. for n 4 of each genotype and age of mice as indicated. indicates a statistically significant difference from WT mice while
indicates a statistically significant difference from R6/1 mice at the identical age.

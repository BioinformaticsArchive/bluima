rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were anesthetized with
pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, i.p.), and their brains were fixed by
aortic arch perfusion sequentially with the following: 1) 15 ml of
normal saline (0.9%), containing 1,000 units/ml of heparin; 2)
50 ml of 3.75% acrolein in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4); and 3) 200 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in PB, all delivered at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The
brains were removed and postfixed for 30 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in PB. Coronal sections 40 m thick were cut with
a vibrating microtome from the intermediate medial NTS at the
level of the area postrema according to the atlas of Paxinos and
Watson (1986). This area is known to contain a large population
of noradrenergic neurons, in addition to smaller groups of
epinephrine- and dopamine-containing cells. Tissue sections
were then placed in 1.0% sodium borohydride in PB for 30 min
and washed in PB. Sections were then immersed in a cryoprotectant solution (25% sucrose and 2.5% glycerol in 0.05M PB)
for 15 min. To enhance tissue permeability, sections were
freeze-thawed in liquid freon and liquid nitrogen. Sections were
next rinsed in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.6) and
then incubated for 30 min in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
in TBS to minimize nonspecific labeling.

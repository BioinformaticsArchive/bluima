responses to sensory stimuli of the inferior colliculus (Hurley et
al., 2002), lateral amygdala (Stutzmann and LeDoux, 1999), and
somatosensory cortex (Waterhouse et al., 1986). Of the 14 subtypes (seven families) of 5-HT receptors (Barnes and Sharp,
1999), cortical 5-HT2A receptors are mostly located on the pyramidal neurons (Liang et al., 1998; Jakab and Goldman-Rakic,
2000) and mediate the depolarization of layer V pyramidal neurons (Araneda and Andrade, 1991; Zhou and Hablitz, 1999;
Lambe et al., 2000; Marek et al., 2001), whereas cortical 5-HT3
receptors are exclusively located on the GABAergic neurons (Barnes et al., 1989; DeFelipe et al., 1991; Roerig and Katz, 1997; Puig
et al., 2004) and mainly mediate 5-HT-induced inhibition. Im-portantly, 5-HT2A receptors increase the release of cortical ACh
(Quirion et al., 1985; Nair and Gudelsky, 2004) and glutamate
(Aghajanian and Marek, 2000; Hasuo et al., 2002; Chen et al.,
2003), whereas 5-HT3 receptors decrease ACh release in the cortex (Maura et al., 1992; Crespi et al., 1997; Giovannini et al.,
1998).
Serotonergic neurons play a role in reconfiguring neural circuitry in the sensory and motor systems and are associated with
anxiety and defensive behaviors (Eison and Eison, 1994; Meneses, 1999). Recently, it has been shown that 5-HT2A receptors
alone mediate fear and anxiety states (Castilho and Brandao,
2001; Weisstaub et al., 2006) and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors improves learning and working memory (Williams et al.,
2002; Harvey, 2003; Harvey et al., 2004; Romano et al., 2006).
Also, 5-HT is involved in the control of both cardiovascular and
acute psychological stress reactivity (Davies et al., 2006). We hy-

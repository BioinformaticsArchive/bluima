in significantly higher concentrations of BDNF, NT-3,
or NGF (257%, 500%, 166%, respectively) compared
with cortex surrounding Adv.EGFP injection (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2). There were no detectable differences in neurotrophin concentrations in the cortex contralateral to the
sites of Adv.NTs injections compared with control tissue, suggesting minimal retrograde transport of adenoviral vectors to the contralateral cortex (data not shown).
Therefore, there is a significant increase in the concentration of cortical neurotrophins that is confined to the
area directly adjacent the injection sites of Adv.NTs.

the reporter gene in homozygote CNTF-lacZ knockin mice
than CNTF-ir ONs are found in CNTF wildtype mice is not
readily at hand. However, it has to be borne in mind that
the CNTF-lacZ knockin-mice are CNTF-knockouts, which
may lead to somewhat altered CNTF-promoter-driven ex-pression in these animals. This suggestion is supported by
the finding that, in heterozygous animals, there are less
-gal-reactive ON nuclei found than in homozygous
knockin mice.
The additional experiments carried out in the present
study were designed to characterize specific properties of
CNTF-ir ONs in order to provide a basis for further investigations into possible roles of the factor in this unusual
neuronal localization. In principle, two different scenarios

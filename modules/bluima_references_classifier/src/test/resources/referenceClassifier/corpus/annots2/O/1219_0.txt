FIG. 6. Distribution of cholesterol and phospholipids in raft
fractions from brains of 104 –106-week-old NPC1 / and
NPC1 / mice. The cell homogenates of the cerebellar cortices of
104 –106-week-old NPC1 / and NPC1 / mice in the presence of 1%
Triton X-100 were subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The levels of cholesterol (a) and phospholipids (b) in each fraction were determined, and the distribution of such components across
the fractions is shown. c, distribution of GM1 ganglioside and flotillin-1,
markers for lipid rafts, across the fractions was determined as de-scribed under “Experimental Procedures.” The levels of cholesterol (a,
right panel) and phospholipids (b, right panel) in fractions 4 and 5 (raft
fractions) are shown. Data represent the mean S.E. of six samples.
Two independent experiments showed similar results. *, p 0.04

A substantial loss of hilar GABA neurons, such as observed
in the present study, might be expected to result in deficits in
inhibition. As yet, there have been no electrophysiological de-scriptions of decreased inhibition in the dentate gyrus of pilocarpine-treated animals. However, persistent deficits in inhibition have been observed following intense perforant path
stimulation (Sloviter, 1991a) as well as traumatic head injury
(Lowenstein et al., 1992) both of which produce a loss of hilar
neurons that appears to be very similar to that observed in the
pilocarpine-treated animals. Although several types of alterations could underlie the decreased inhibition, the loss of inhibition directly from damage of hilar GABA neurons appears to
be one very plausible explanation.
Mechanisms that do not involve an actual loss of GABA
neurons have been suggested to underlie the loss of inhibition
of dentate granule cells that has been observed in the perforant
path stimulation model (Sloviter, 199 1b). One hypothesis is that
the loss of hilar mossy cells substantially reduces the excitatory
input to the basket cells and, as a result, the basket cells can no
longer exert their normal inhibitory control over the granule
cells (Sloviter, 199 1b). These different explanations for a de-crease in inhibition within the dentate gyrus are not mutually
exclusive, and multiple mechanisms could underlie the de-creased inhibitory control of the granule cells.
The relationship between the loss of GAD mRNA-containing
neurons within the hilus and spontaneous recurrent seizures is
uncertain. It is tempting to speculate that the loss of hilar GABA
neurons contributes to a decreased inhibitory control of the
granule cells and CA3 neurons that normally determine the
amount of activity allowed to pass to other regions of the hippocampal formation and, subsequently, to widespread regions
of the CNS (Collins et al., 1983; Heinemann et al., 1992; Lothman et al., 1992). However, many other factors will influence
the balance between inhibition and excitation within the dentate
gyrus and CA3 field, and thus the seizure susceptibility of the
hippocampal formation in these animals. First, there are other
sources of GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampal formation
that could compensate for the loss of GABA neurons in the
hilus. Several other groups of GABA neurons remain within the
dentate gyrus, and these include the basket cells and other GABA
neurons, such as axoaxonic neurons, in the granule cell and
molecular layers as well as some GABA neurons in the hilus.
In addition, extrinsic sources of GABAergic innervation exist,
including a projection from the medial septum (Freund and
Antal, 1988) and a small GABAergic contribution from the
entorhinal cortex (Germroth et al., 1989). Compensation for the
loss of the hilar GABA neurons might be accomplished by in-creased activation of the remaining GABA neurons, increased
synthesis of GAD and GABA by these neurons (Feldblum et
al., 1990) and, potentially, morphological reorganization of their
synaptic connections (Davenport et al., 1990a). Ifreorganization
of remaining GABA neurons were to occur, the functional effects
would depend on the types of connections that are formed. It
seems unlikely that truly normal patterns of connectivity would
be reestablished, and thus, the levels of inhibitory control and
the pathways by which this control could be activated might be
quite different from normal, and, possibly, less effective.
In addition, alterations in other circuitry have been observed
in the chronic pilocarpine-treated animals. Substantial reorganization of granule cell axons (mossy fibers) and their collaterals
into the inner molecular layer occurs in these animals (Meilo et

DISCUSSION

The results of this study support the concept that
carotid body afferent input may have a different effect
on phrenic and .hypoglossal motorneuron pools (6, 7).
Augmentation of peripheral chemoreceptor input by
isoproterenol and lobeline administration was found to
increase the respiratory activity of the phrenic, hypoglossal, and recurrent laryngeal nerves, with a preferential activation of the hypoglossal nerve compared with
the other two nerves. Inhibition of carotid body afferent
input by dopamine administration resulted in greater
attenuation of hypoglossal than phrenic or recurrent
laryngeal nerve activity. After vagotomy, the extent of
these responses was diminished, although the greater
change in hypoglossal compared with phrenic activity
was unchanged. After complete peripheral chemoreceptor denervation, the effects of isoproterenol were markedly reduced, whereas the effects of dopamine and lobeline were no longer apparent.
Previous work in both animals (3, l&30) and humans
(20, 29) have documented the inhibitory effect of dopamine on resting and chemically stimulated breathing.
Although several studies concur that dopamine depresses
ventilation primarily by decreasing peripheral chemoreceptor input (3, 18, 30), there is some disagreement as to
whether this is the only site of action. Nishino and Lahiri
(18) and Bisgard et al. (3) suggested that the inhibitory

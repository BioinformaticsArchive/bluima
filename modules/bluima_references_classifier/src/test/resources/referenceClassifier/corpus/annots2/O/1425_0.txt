Introduction
Appropriate regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis is essential for health and survival (Bjorntorp and
Rosmond, 2000; Chrousos, 2000). HPA axis activation and inhibition are complex processes, involving structures throughout
the CNS (Laugero, 2001). Information regarding physiologic
threats (i.e., hypothermia, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia) relay
from the brainstem through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN)
and anterior pituitary, leading to a prompt HPA axis response.
Psychological stressors, or perceived threats, relay through limbic
forebrain circuits. These circuits involve multiple brain regions,
including the hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, locus ceruleus,
bed nucleus of the stria terminals, and the nucleus of the tractus
solitarius (Herman et al., 2003). The intricacy of these circuits
allow for a diversity of stressor-specific responses (Herman et al.,
2003). Moreover, disruption of forebrain/limbic circuits has been
proposed to be involved in the development of affective and anxiety disorders (Coryell et al., 1989; Holsboer, 2000; Ehlert et al.,
2001).
Anxiety disorders are often associated with hyperactivity of
the HPA axis (Holsboer, 2000). These HPA axis changes strongly
correlate with psychiatric disease states, because recovery is associated with reversal of the HPA axis abnormality. Although the

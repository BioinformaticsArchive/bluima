synaptic currents (three cells in three slices). In subsequent
experiments, rats at P5–P10 were used, with major
analyses at P8–P9, and the responses induced by ACh at 10
or 100 μM were investigated. Under these conditions,
repeatable and stable responses to ACh were obtained for
more than 1 h. In a few cases, recordings were made from
P2–P4 preparations (Figs 1 and 3).

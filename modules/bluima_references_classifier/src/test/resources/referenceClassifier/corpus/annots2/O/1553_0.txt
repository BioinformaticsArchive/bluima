that iptakalim blocks pm-KATP channels will promote further
pharmacological investigation.
The pharmacological significance of iptakalim's block of
pm-KATP channels is unclear; it seems contradictory to the
expectation that iptakalim should open pm-KATP channels
and, in turn, protect DA neurons against chemical stressinduced neurodegeneration. However, new experimental ev-idence and concepts have recently emerged that KATP channels promote DA neuronal degeneration. For example, in
Kir6.2 knockout mice, rotenone-induced DA neuronal death
was significantly prevented, suggesting that inhibition of
KATP channels may play an important role in neuroprotection (Liss et al., 2005). From this point of view, the discovery
of the blocking effects on Kir6.2/SUR1 KATP channels by
iptakalim has led to a new direction in the study of the
pharmacological mechanisms of its neuroprotective effects in
various PD animal models using in vivo and in vitro preparations.
The present results do not support the hypothesis that
iptakalim protects SNc DA neurons against chemical stressinduced neurotoxicity by directly opening pm-KATP channels
and/or mito-KATP channels in the somatodendrite of DA neurons, which raises caution against the simple interpretation
that effective neuroprotection induced by iptakalim against
metabolic stress using in vivo animal models is via the opening of pm-KATP channels and/or mito-KATP channels in SNc
DA neurons. However, our data cannot exclude other possible
protective effects of iptakalim associated with the opening of
KATP channels expressed in elements other than DA neurons
themselves.

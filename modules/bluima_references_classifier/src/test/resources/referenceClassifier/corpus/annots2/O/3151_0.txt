Possible risk factors for hypoxia-ischaemia collected
from the mothers' obstetric records
The factors selected from the labour and delivery
situation were: pathological CTG registrations, pH
measurements which showed pre-acidosis or acidosis
in the foetus during delivery, passage of meconium
before delivery, delivery by acute Caesarean section,
forceps or vacuum extraction, and the use of pethidine
or naloxone. Since pethidine and naloxone use differs
greatly from hospital to hospital (17), results were
therefore also analysed without these factors. Incidents
of chorioamnioitis (histological diagnosis), placental
infarctions and calcifications, pathology of the umbilical cord, number and disturbance of vessels, and
coagulation factors were also recorded as possible risk
factors for hypoxia-ischaemia.

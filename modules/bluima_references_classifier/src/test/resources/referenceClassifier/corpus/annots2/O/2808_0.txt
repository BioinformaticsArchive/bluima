deprivation were: cerebrum, Fl,10 = 605.5, P < 0.001;
cerebellum, F1,1~= 79.33, P < 0.001; brainstem,
F1,12 = 264, P < 0.001. After two days' deprivation they were: cerebrum, F~,s = 51.69, P < 0.01;
cerebellum, Fl,lO = 12.44, P < 0.01; brainstem,
Fl,lO = 21.26, P < 0.01. In the large-platform control
group of animals, free calcium levels remained un-affected in all the regions, except the cerebellum
(F1,~o=31.83; P<0.01). All the altered calcium
levels returned to normal after recovery.

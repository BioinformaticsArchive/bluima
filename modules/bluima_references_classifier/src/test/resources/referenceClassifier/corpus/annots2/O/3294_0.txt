four regions were defined: superficial dorsal horn (laminae I-II), nucleus
proprius (laminae III-IV), neck of the dorsal horn (laminae V-VI), and
the ventral gray (laminae VII-X). The number of c-Fos and dynorphinpositive neurons were counted in these four regions in 10 randomly
selected sections from the L4 segment in each animal. Results are given
as mean number of c-Fos or dynorphin-positive neurons per section per
group.
Statistical tests. One-way ANOVA was used to compare immunohistochemical measures (immunofluorescence levels and counts) between the
experimental groups. To evaluate the correlation between bone destruction and behavioral changes, SPR internalization, c-Fos expression,
dynorphin, and GFAP immunofluorescence at the spinal level, a Pearson's correlation coefficient was performed. For multiple comparisons,
the Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD) post hoc test
was used. Significance was at p < 0.05. In all cases, the investigator
responsible for plotting, measuring, and counting, was blind.

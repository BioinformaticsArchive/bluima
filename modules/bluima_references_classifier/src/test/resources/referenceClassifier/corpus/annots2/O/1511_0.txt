We compared shape characteristics of WS versus control groups
in a variety of ways. Our primary approach used sulcal depth
maps as an objective measure of cortical shape. After registering
each individual to the PALS atlas, sulcal depth maps were used to
generate group averages, group difference maps, and t-statistic
maps. The t-statistic maps provide the main substrate for identifying significant clusters in each hemisphere and for analyzing
symmetry across hemispheres, and they culminate in the folding
abnormality maps shown in Figure 3. Subsequent figures illustrate complementary results based on cross-correlations between
individual sulcal depth maps and analysis of group average and
individual three-dimensional surfaces.

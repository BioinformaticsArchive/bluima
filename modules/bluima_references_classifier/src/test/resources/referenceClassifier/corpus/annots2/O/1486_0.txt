FIGURE 6. Mutation of the CRE or C/EBP sites
impairs NGF promoter activation. Transient
transactivation assays of NGF promoter-reporter
constructs bearing CRE and/or C/EBP site mutations. A, promoter-reporter activity of CRE or
C/EBP mutant constructs in C6-2B cells with or
without CLE stimulation (6 h). B, CLE-induced luciferase activity of the NGF CRE C/EBP double
mutant. C, effect of promoter mutations on
responses to PKA, C/EBP , or PKA plus C/EBP .
The -fold induction of luciferase activity in Aâ€“C
was determined as described in Fig. 3 and is calculated relative to the wild-type unstimulated construct (NGF 615/ 16 (WT) plus pcDNA). Data are
the mean S.E. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. D, EMSA using
recombinant CREB and C/EBP . Binding of CREBbZIP to a consensus CRE probe (cCRE) was challenged with unlabeled WT or mutant NGF-CRE oligonucleotides or cCRE (left panel). A similar
experiment using recombinant full-length C/EBP
protein and cC/EBP probe is shown in the middle
panel. Comp., competitor. In the right panel,
labeled WT and mutant NGF-CRE probes were
analyzed for binding to CREB-bZIP.

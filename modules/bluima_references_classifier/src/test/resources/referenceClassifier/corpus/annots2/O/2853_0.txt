and other studies extensive reconstructions of pyramidal cell
axon collaterals were performed at the light microscopic (LM)
level to determine the connectivity between neighboring
pyramidal cells. Here again, sparse connections (2–8 putative
contacts between pairs of neurons) were characteristic of
cell-to-cell interactions in the rat sensorimotor cortex (Deuchars
et al., 1994) and cat visual cortex (Kisvardy and Eysel, 1992).
Thus, one common feature of the intrinsic horizontal circuitry
is that individual pyramidal neurons form sparse connections
with their target cells, suggesting a high degree of convergence
from many cells to an individual target cell. The cell-to-cell
patterns of synaptic input have not been studied extensively, but
at least some appear to be distinctive of the types of cells
involved in that some neurons preferentially target a particular
cell type or particular components of a cell (e.g. Somogyi, 1978;
Winfield et al., 1981; McGuire et al., 1984; White and Keller,
1987; Keller and Asanuma, 1993).
Because pyramidal neurons form most inter-areal corticocortical connections, questions arise as to whether the same
density and pattern of the intrinsic cortical synaptic connectivity are also exhibited by neurons involved in the inter-areal
cortical circuitry. In this study, the synaptic relationships
between neurons in a specific cortico-cortical pathway between
somatosensory cortex areas 3a and 2, and primary motor cortex
in cats was studied. This circuit was chosen because the
physiological relationships between these regions have been
studied extensively. Furthermore, the known morphological
characteristics of neurons that connect these regions suggest
that direct synaptic linkages occur. Projections from area 3a to
area 2, and from area 2 to the primar y motor cortex (MI), are
somatotopically organized in both cats (Waters et al., 1982a;
Yumiya and Ghez, 1984; Avendano et al., 1992) and monkeys
(Pons and Kaas, 1986), suggesting a somatotopic link across all
three regions. In area 2 of both species, layer II–III pyramidal
cells give rise to the motor cortex projection (Ghosh et al., 1987;
Porter, 1992), and area 3a axons terminate in layers II and III.
These terminals synapse primarily with spines, most likely
belonging to pyramidal cells (Porter, 1991). Therefore, the
neurons in area 2 that project to MI are plausible targets for area
3a axons. This study was undertaken to provide direct evidence
of such a connection and to determine the synaptic relationships
of the neuronal circuitr y. The details of these neuronal
relationships will help to explain the physiological interactions
that have been obser ved experimentally and will help to
understand the functional implications of the patterns of cortical
connectivity.

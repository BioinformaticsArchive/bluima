INTRODUCTION

Primary intraspinal primitive neuroectodermal
tumors (PNETs) are rare and can arise as
intramedullary, extramedullary or extradural tumors
at any level of the spinal cord (4,17). Primary PNETs of
the cauda equina are even less common (7,8,14,12,21).
The majority of PNETs that involve the cord or the
spinal nerve roots are metastatic in origin and are the
result of “drop” metastases from the tumors more
superior in the neuroaxis (4,8).

We report a case of primary intraspinal PNET of
the conus and left S1 root that presented with
progressive paraparesis in a 40-day-old infant.

CASE

A 40-day-old male infant presented at our hospital
(Akdeniz University) with a history of progressive
lower extremity weakness of 4 days.

Neurological examination revealed bilateral
weakness of the lower extremities (2/5 motor
strength).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine
revealed an intradural-extramedullar lesion a the L5-S1 level filling the spinal canal and another intradural
lesion with conus medullaris invasion at Th12-L1 level
(Figure 1A), but his cranial MRI was normal.

The patient was operated on under general
anesthesia in the prone position. A T12-L5 laminotomy
was performed and dura then opened vertically. At
the T12-L1 level the yellowish mass was invading the
conus and cauda equina, and at the -S1 level the left S1
root was invaded. Both of the lesions were resected
gross totally by microsurgical technique. There was
also leptomeningeal infiltration of the mass, mostly at
the T12-L1 level.

Postoperative MRI of the spine revealed gross total
excision of these lesions (Figure 1B).

Biopsy materials were composed of poorly
differentiated round cells disposed in a monotonous
sheet or small groups. Tumoral cells had small nuclei
and scant cytoplasm (Figure 2). Tumoral cells also
showed CD99 and NSE immunoreactivity (Figure 3).

The patient's neurological examination showed
improvement following the operation. He was able to
move his lower extremities against the gravitational
force.

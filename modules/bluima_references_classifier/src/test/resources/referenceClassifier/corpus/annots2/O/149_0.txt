express two types of ionotropic GABA receptor. One is the well
known GABAA type, which is blocked by bicuculline and is
typically modulated by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and anesthetics. The other type is relatively resistant to bicuculline and
picrotoxin, and like GABAC receptors is not modulated by barbiturates and anesthetics. However, unlike GABAC receptors,
these bicuculline-resistant GABA receptors are inhibited by benzodiazepines. Both receptor types contribute to fast inhibitory
transmission in the central amygdala.

Figure 5. Long-term potentiation following low-intensity stimulation for 24 days. The
mV differences between the last baseline and all other sweeps are plotted in these
figures for the baseline (pre-LTP) and the LTP induction periods. (Top) Changes in the
early component over days. While animals receiving 160 and 500 μA trains showed a
shift in the surface-positive direction relative to baseline and controls, animals receiving
16 and 32 μA trains did not differ from controls over the LTP induction protocol. For
animals that did show an effect, increasing the stimulation intensity caused a larger
potentiation effect. (Middle) Changes in the late1 component over days. All groups
displayed an increase in the amplitude of the late1 component over the course of the
induction protocol. The potentiation effect increased as the train intensity used to
induce LTP increased, with animals receiving 500 μA trains showing the largest
increase, followed by the 160 and 32 μA groups which showed approximately equal
changes, and finally the 16 μA group which showed the smallest change.
(Bottom) Changes in the late2 component over days. All groups showed a significant
enhancement. Increasing the train intensity increased the rate and magnitude of the LTP
effect. Note that while only 43% (3/7) of animals receiving 16 μA trains displayed late2
component potentiation, the group curve is clearly enhanced relative to controls.

Expression of nNOS, AVP, and OT in
Supraoptic Nucleus of Developing and Adult
Rats
At PN1 and PN7, no nNOS-positive neurons could be
detected in the SON (Fig. 1A and D, respectively). However, AVP- and OT-positive neurons were present in the
ventral and dorsal portion of the SON at these stages (Fig.
1B, C, E, and F, respectively). The distribution pattern of
both AVP and OT neurons at this stage is similar to that
in the adult (Fig. 1N and O), although the cell body size is
much smaller than those in the adult (Fig. 2). At PN14,
relatively few nNOS-positive neurons could be detected in
the SON (Fig. 1G). The number and intensity of both AVPand OT-positive neurons (Fig. 1H and I) and the soma size
(Fig. 2) increased at this stage. At PN21, the number of
nNOS-positive neurons increased (Fig. 1J) compared with
that at PN14. At this stage, the AVP- and OT-positive
neurons also increased in both number and size (Figs. 1K
and L and 2). The patterns of nNOS-, AVP-, and OT-positive neurons in the SON at PN21 were approximately
the same as those found in the SON in adult rats (Fig. 1M,
N, and O, respectively). Quantitative analysis showed
that increases in the number and cell body size of nNOS- Fig. 3. Total numbers of neurons of NOS-IR (A), AVP-IR (B), and

PN7, no coexpression of nNOS/AVP and nNOS/OT could

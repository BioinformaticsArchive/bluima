Wight, 1998). Since the presence of a head and neck tumor
per se has no effect on the BAEP latencies (Leighton et al.,
1997), these subjects were considered eligible for this study.
None of the subjects had recently undergone any general
anesthesia or antitumor treatment such as chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and/or surgery, since these therapeutic mo-dalities might have influenced the results of the BAEP
measurements. In comparison to other studies (Chan et al.,
1985; Chu et al., 1982; Diaz et al., 1990), only male subjects
were examined in this work to exclude gender-related ef-fects. It is known that females are affected differently by
alcohol than males. Usually a lower and shorter alcohol
consumption in females leads to comparable brain impairment. These findings are supported by a study from
Neiman (1998) using computer tomography. In another
study, more extensive neuropsychological deficits were ob-served in females than in males, despite a shorter duration
of alcohol exposure (Bergman, 1987).
The short-term alcohol consumption of the study group
showed that it represented the drinking behavior of lowrisk, risky, dangerous, and high-risk alcohol consumption
(Bühringer et al., 2000). Since a good correlation between
short-term daily and cumulative lifelong alcohol consumption was observed, the cumulative lifelong alcohol consumption behavior of the present study group may be used,
to a certain extent, to describe the long-term drinking
behavior of Western society.
Consistent with the normal pure tone audiometry results,
comparable BAEP peak I latencies were found in both
groups. Even though a certain degree of fluctuation in the
BAEP latencies exists, in particular in the head and neck
tumor group, significant latency differences between the
two groups could be observed in peaks III and V as well as
in the interpeak latencies I–III and I–V. This result indicated that long-term alcohol abuse affects the auditory
nerve and central auditory pathways. The higher variability

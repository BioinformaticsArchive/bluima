tigmine, the number of SR-evoked spike discharges including spontaneously firing ones

(Fig. 4B, G) was 9.6 and the number of spontaneously firing spikes alone (Fig. 4E) was 2.4.
This suggests that the number of pure SR-evoked spike discharges is approximately 7.2.
Hence physostigmine apparently increases not only the rate of spontaneously firing spikes
but SR-evoked spike discharges in brainstem neurons. These changes in discharge rate
were reversible and the rate returned to the control level within 3 min after the administration

of atropine (1 mg/kg, i.v., Fig. 4C, F). This antagonism by atropine was confirmed with

4 RS neurons. The time course of physostigmine effect and antagonism by atropine is
illustrated in Fig. 4G.

Thus, the difference in the volSFO that we observed in the
present work could be a mere consequence of the different size
between treated and control animals. To evaluate the possible
bias that this difference in the size of the animals could be
introducing in our observations, we divide the volSFO by the
naso-anal length of each rat to obtain the volSFO per unit of
length (volSFO/length). The statistical analysis showed that
the treatment had also a significant effect on the volSFO/
length (Table 2) which, in mean value, was reduced a 31%
from control to treated animals (3.87 × 105 ± 1.59 × 104
versus 2.65 × 105 ± 1.15 × 104, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2).
In contrast with the two previous variables, the numerical
density (Nv) either of NADPH+ or Nissl-stained cells within
the SFO did not appear to be significantly influenced by any of
the factors considered in the experiment (Table 2). The t-test
for the comparison of the means of these two variables did not
revealed significant differences between treated and control
animals (P = 0.63 for the Nv of NADPH+ and P = 0.13 for
the Nv of Nissl-stained cells).
As previously stated, the product of the corresponding Nv
by the volSFO was considered as the total number either of Fig. 2. Representations of the differences (as percentage with regard
to control) in the volume of the SFO (volSFO), volSFO per unit length
NADPH+ or Nissl-stained cells. These two variables were
of the animal (volSFO/length), total number of NADPH+ cells and
also significantly affected by the treatment with MSG total number of Nissl-stained cells between control- (black bars) and
(Table 2). In particular, the treated animals experimented a treated-animals (stippled bars). ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01.

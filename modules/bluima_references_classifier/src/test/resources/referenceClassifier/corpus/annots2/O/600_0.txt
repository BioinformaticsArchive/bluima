Dissection, osmium fixation, dehydration, and
embedding procedures
After fixation (and decalcification, if done), cochleas
were rinsed 5 in 0.1 M Sorensen's phosphate buffer
and dissected into basal, mid, and apical turns
(Sobkowicz et al., 1993). Individual turns were transferred to their own small tube for subsequent steps.
They were postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at
room temperature. Finally, they were rinsed in buffer,
dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded
in a metal pan (6 PN) or flat (9 PN to 2 months),
between two microscope slides in Durcupan epoxy
resin (6 â€“16 PN) or an Epon/Spurr mixture (2-month
cochleas). Prior to sectioning the glass slides were dissolved in 52% hydrofluoric acid.

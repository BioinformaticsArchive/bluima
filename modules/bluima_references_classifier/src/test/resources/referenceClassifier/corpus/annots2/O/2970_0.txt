Fig. 2. Immunoprecipitation of the recombinant rat PDE3 by the K116
antibody: specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Aliquots of MA-10 cells
expressing recombinant PDE4D3 were incubated with Pansorbin alone,
Pansorbin preadsorbed with increasing concentrations of the K116 antibody, increasing concentration of the K116 antibody preadsorbed to peptide 2224 (5 μg/ml), or 1:10 –1000 dilutions of preimmune serum. After
immunoadsorption, pellets and supernatant were separated according to
the procedure described in Experimental Procedures, and PDE activity
recovered was measured. Points, mean of three observations.

on GABA transport in neuronal versus glial preparations (Iversen and Kelly, 1975; Schon and Kelly, 1975; Johnston and
Stephanson, 1976; Neal and Bowery, 1977; Schousboe, 198 1;
Iarsson et al., 1983). For instance, /3-alanine is an inhibitor of
glial GABA transport (Schon and Kelly, 1975; Johnston and
Stephanson, 1976; Schousboe, 198 l), while other compounds,
such as cis-3-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, are selective
for neuronal GABA transport (Neal and Bowery, 1977; Larsson
et al., 1983). This indicates a heterogeneity in transporter structure, at least with regard to the substrate recognition site. Hopefully, it will be possible to determine the extent of homology
when the gene(s) for the transporter(s) is (are) cloned. Future
purification of the glial transporter, possibly based on different
sensitivities to inhibition, may also be of help in discrimination
between the 2 transporters. Alternatively, development of
monoclonal antibodies against the neuronal and/or glial transporter may facilitate discrimination, possibly also at the im-munocytochemical level.
The GABA transporter present in synaptic vesicles (Fykse
and Fonnum, 1988; Hell et al., 1988) shows biochemical properties quite distinct from those of GABA-Tp of plasma membranes and is unlikely to have contaminated the purified GABATp against which the antibodies used in the present study were

Fig. 5. Changes in the amount of expressed marker proteins in cerebellar cells in primary culture upon exposure to methylmercury. Cerebellar cells matured for 7 days in vitro were then exposed to methylmercury at 0 â€“1.0 M for 48 hr. Total proteins of the cells solubilized
with SDS sample buffer were subjected to the blot immunoassay using
440-kDa ankyrin (squares), MAP2 (triangles), tau (circle), or GFAP
B

(lozenges) antibodies. Radioactivity at each spot was determined with
BAS 2000 and standardized with the amount of total protein in each
sample. Values expressed as the percentage of control represent the
mean of triplicate assays.

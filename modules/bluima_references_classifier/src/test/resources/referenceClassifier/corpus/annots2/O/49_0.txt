Fig. 5. The medial cerebellar nucleus (CM) volume (mm3) plotted against (a) bodyweight (W;g) and against
(b) the volume of the rest of medulla oblongata (R;mm3) on a double logarithmic scale. The reference line,
determined by means of reduced major axis analysis, is positioned on the averages for the 17 species of
prosimians. Open circle, nocturnal.

AGE AND LH-RELEASING FACTOR 695
in this species. The infusion of extracts made from the median eminence
of pregnant rabbits produced a lower percentage ovulation (25) than
occurred with similar extracts from non-pregnant rabbits (50). It is considered that this difference may have no physiological significance but is
due to the small numbers involved. The median eminence of new-born
rabbits was shown to contain LRF, whereas in the 20-day-old foetuses this
factor was either absent or was present in amounts too small to be measured
by this technique. In this connexion it may be noted that approximately
the same percentage of ovulation occurred with extracts from adult and
new-born animals, despite the fact that 4 times as many new-born median
eminences were infused into each recipient, suggesting that, as with cattle,
the concentration of LRF increases with age and may have been very low
or absent in the foetal median eminences. It has been suggested (Campbell,
1965) that the time of sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus is
coincident with the age at which the primary plexus of the pituitary portal
system develops and it has been shown (Campbell, 1966a) that this occurs
in the rabbit at about 20-23 days of gestation. It seems reasonable that the
synthesis of LRF would begin at about the same time as (a) the sexual
differentiation of the neural elements that control its release, and (b) the
establishment of the vascular pathway that carries it to the anterior
pituitary gland. Experiments are in progress with more concentrated
extracts obtained at various stages of gestation in the rabbit to determine
the earliest age at which LRF can be detected in the median eminence.
The presence of LRF in the median eminence of the rat has been demonstrated by intrapituitary infusion in the rat (Nikitovich-Winer, 1962) and
by other methods (Courrier, Guillemin, Jutisz, Sakiz & Ascheim, 1961;
McCann, 1962). The present work shows that this source of material is also
effective in causing ovulation when infused into the pituitary gland of the
rabbit. It is considered that the number of recipients used in these experiments was too small to allow firm conclusions with regard to different
levels of activity in the oestrous and pro-oestrous groups. The results
indicated that LRF is present in the median eminence of the new-born rat.
This finding conflicts with the previous suggestion that LRF first appears
at the time of development of the primary plexus, for it has been shown
(Glydon, 1957; Campbell, 1966a) that this occurs 5 days after birth in the
rat. Experiments are in progress to determine the age when LRF first
appears in the rat median eminence. The presence of LRF in 10-day-old
rats was reported by Ramirez & McCann (1963).
In general terms the main finding of the present work is that LRF is
present at a very early age in three species. The question arises as to what
its function is at this time of life. Foetal pituitaries of various species have
been reported to contain small or insignificant amounts of gonadotrophic

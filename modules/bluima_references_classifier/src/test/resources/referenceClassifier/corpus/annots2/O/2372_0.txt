an inhibitor of HSV DNA synthesis and virus
assembly. In an experiment in which 100 ,g of
phosphonoacetic acid per ml was given at 6 h
and the cells were then collected 24 h after
infection, the percentage of [3H]thymidine in-corporation into acid-precipitable DNA was
about 7.5, whereas it was 28% in control cells not
treated with the drug. When the extracts were
analyzed on slightly modified velocity sedimentation gradients (Fig. 10), very similar nucleoprotein peaks were evident both in the presence
(Fig. 10A) and in the absence (Fig. 10C) of
phosphonoacetic acid. From the same cells virions were prepared according to Gibson and Roizman (9) and subjected to velocity sedimentation
analysis (Fig. 10B and D). A new heavier sedimenting peak of NPC appeared in the phosphonoacetic acid-treated cells (Fig. 10B), whereas
nucleocapsids accumulated on the sucrose cushion in the untreated control (Fig. 10D).
Electron microscopic observation of the peak
fraction of Fig. 10B revealed the presence of
aberrant nucleocapsids, as shown in Fig. 11. Two
different groups could be identified: the first less
well represented group consisted of particles
with diameters of about 110 to 120 nm exhibiting
structural alterations, the most common one
being the bending out of one side of their shell,
as shown in Fig. lld and f. The second, larger
group included particles which were about half
as large (widths ranging from 50 to 75 nm) and
altered: sometimes the above-described protrusions were observed, as in Fig. llb and e; sometimes more uniform variants were seen, as in
Fig. lla, c, and g; and sometimes miniature
capsids about 50 nm in size and with irregular
side lengths were seen, as in Fig. llh and i.

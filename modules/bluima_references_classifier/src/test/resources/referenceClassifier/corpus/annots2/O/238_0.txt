Figure 4. Diagram illustrating the different patterns of gene expression observed in phenotypically similar TUN EL -positive neurons after TBI,
the interrelationships among different genes, and
possible consequences of these changes. At 12 hr,
TBI induced a decrease in the expression of many
genes (thick downward arrows) with the exception
of increases in N R2A and N R2C mRNAs (thick
upward arrows). At 24 hr, most of the changes
observed at 12 hr had returned to control levels
except for increases in caspase-2 and bax (thick
upward arrows) and a decrease in bcl-xl (thick
downward arrow). Dotted lines indicate connections between genes, whereas solid lines with ar-rows indicate possible consequences of changes in
the expression of particular genes. All changes in
gene expression direction (up vs down) are versus
the relative level in unlabeled cortical neurons
from sham-injured animals.

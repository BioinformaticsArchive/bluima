FIG. 12. Orthodromic activation of 2 units by stimulation of the right
(R) and/or left (L) superior colliculus. A : ~1x0~21-4, which originated in
the left midbrain, is activated by stimulation of the left superior colliculus
at 1.2 ms. The axon was not activated by stimulation of the right colliculus
(not shown). B: axoyl 26-10, which originated in the right midbrain, is
activated by stimulation of the right colliculus at 0.75 ms and the left
colliculus at 0.95 ms. In both cases, a trace in which the unit was not
activated is plotted to better show the onset of the spike. Time calibration:
1.0 ms.

Juvenile salmonid fish readily form dominance hierarchies when faced with limited resources. While these
social interactions may result in profound behavioural and physiological stress, it is unknown if this social
stress is evident at the level of the cellular stress responseâ€”specifically, the induction of stress or heat
shock proteins (Hsps). Thus, the goal of our study was to determine if Hsps are induced during hierarchy
formation in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). To this end, we measured levels of three Hsps,
Hsp70, Hsc (heat shock cognate)70 and Hsp90 in the white muscle, liver and brain of trout that had been
interacting for 36 h, 72 h or 6 days. Our data indicate that Hsps are induced in both dominant and subordinate fish in a time- and tissue-specific manner. In further mechanistic experiments on fasted and
cortisol-treated fish, we demonstrated that high plasma cortisol does not affect Hsp induction in trout
white muscle or liver, but both conditions may be part of the mechanism for Hsp induction with
social stress in the brain. We conclude that the behavioural and physiological stress experienced by
juvenile rainbow trout in dominance hierarchies can be extended to the induction of Hsps.

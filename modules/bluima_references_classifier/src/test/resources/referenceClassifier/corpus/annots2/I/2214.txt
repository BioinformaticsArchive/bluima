in the present study might be more consistent with the idea of a normally inhibitory
influence from the forebrain. It is also possible that the forebrain acts on the PbN of in-tact rats to sculpt the gustatory response by
amplification of the response and suppression of the oF+response. Experiments are
now in progress to explore these issues.
Influence of the forebrain on the PbN
might have several possible anatomical substrates. These include direct input from the
gustatory neocortex (16, 18, 2 1) and/or the
lateral hypothalamus (22). Additionally, an
indirect influence might be applied to the
PbN via forebrain input to the NTS. In this
context, direct projections to the NTS from
the gustatory neocortex (18), amygdala (27),
and lateral hypothalamus (1, 15) have been
described. Because some but not all of the
effects of decerebration on taste responses
are similar in the NTS (14, 17) compared
with the PbN, it is also possible that both
avenues of input from the forebrain to the
PbN might be important. Furthermore, each
of these inputs may have a unique functional
role.

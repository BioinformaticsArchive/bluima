the plantar paw surface. To quantify the alignment between
ipsilateral excitatory RFs and contralateral inhibitory RFs,
the centre of each excitatory RF was identified on the
map and defined as the ipsilateral spatial excitatory centre
for that cell. The distance between this position and the
centre of the region of maximal inhibition (the 0.81–1.00
bin) on the contralateral side was measured for each cell.
These measurements were made on the same standardized
plantar paw diagrams measuring 35 mm × 13 mm at each
age.

Recording of inhibitory postsynaptic currents
For recording of IPSCs standard extracellular solution
containing 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX;
10 μM) and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid
(DL-AP5; 25 μM) was used. The composition of the intracellular solution was (mM): CsCl 107, CsF 35, MgCl 1,
2

HEPES 10, EGTA 10, ATP-Na 4, pH 7.4 (adjusted with
2

CsOH). Cs+ was applied intracellularly in order to prevent
contamination of synaptic responses by potassium currents;
membrane potential was held at "40 mV in order to
prevent sodium currents (see 23,33). Single rectangular
electrical pulses (0.1 ms wide, 2–12 V) were delivered by
an isolated stimulator (ST-02/ISO-100; Experimetria,
Budapest, Hungary). Slices were stimulated either by stainless steel concentric bipolar electrodes (inserted 20–40 μm
into the slice at a horizontal distance of 100–200 μm from
the recorded neuron) or by platinum parallel bipolar electrodes (placed onto the surface of the slice so that the
recorded neuron lay between the two arms of the electrode).
Results obtained with the two kinds of electrodes were
similar and hence pooled. Input resistance was continuously
monitored during the experiments by observing the current
response to a 10 mV hyperpolarizing pulse; experiments
were eliminated if input resistance increased more than 30%.

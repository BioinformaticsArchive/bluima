Figure 7. Effects of quinpirole on GABAergic sIPSCs recorded from LA interneurons of WT,
D2R / , D2L / , and D2R / ;D2L / mice. The graphs are single-cell plots from
patch-clamp experiments. In a WT LA interneuron ( A), 10 M quinpirole reduces the frequency
of sIPSCs (expressed as inter-event interval). The effect of quinpirole is absent in the D2R /
LA neuron ( B), although it is similar to WTs in the D2L / cell ( C). In D2R / ;D2L / LA
interneurons ( D), the effect of quinpirole is reduced.

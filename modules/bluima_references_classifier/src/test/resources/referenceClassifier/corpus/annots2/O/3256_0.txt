abruptly at the crush site (Figs. 7a, 8c), although a few axons did
extend past the crush (Fig. 8c, arrows). In these controls, axon
extension past the crush site was typically restricted to the edge of
the optic nerve. After treatment with C3, large numbers of axons
extended through the site of the crush, both along the edge (Fig.
8c) and in the middle of the optic nerve (Figs. 7b,c, 8d). This
observation of regenerating axons throughout the thickness of the
optic nerve was confirmed by examining serial sections (Fig. 7).
After C3 treatment, many of the axons that extended past the
lesion site showed a twisted path of growth, supporting their
identification as regenerating axons (Fig. 8e). Counterstaining of
the fluorescently labeled sections with Luxol fast blue–cresyl
violet confirmed that the fluorescently labeled axons extended
past the crush and into regions of the nerve that remained
myelinated (Fig. 8b). To examine quantitatively the differences
between C3 and buffer-treated animals, we counted the number
of axons in each section at distances of 100, 250, and 500 μm past
the lesion site in all of the animals examined with the two
immunolabeling methods (Fig. 9a). Significantly more axons ex-tended past the lesion in the C3-treated animals than in the
microcrush lesion or buffer-treated controls at distances of 100
and 250 μm (Fig. 9b). Therefore, C3 applied to injured RGC
axons can enter axotomized axons and promote robust but shortlived axon regeneration in the environment of the optic nerve.

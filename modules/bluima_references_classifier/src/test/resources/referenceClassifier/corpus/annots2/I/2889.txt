distributed much more widely, particularly during
development. Alterations to the pre- or postsynaptic
elements, therefore, should predictably have very different consequences on cortical development.

Modeling effects of prenatal cocaine on brain
development

Cocaine binds to the presynaptic transporters of the
MAs and thereby blocks reuptake, an effect that results
in synaptic increases of NA, DA and 5-HT. Target
regions such as the cortex, in which all three neurotransmitters are expressed, thus are clearly susceptible
to the effects of cocaine. The more ubiquitous distribution of 5-HT and NA afferents suggests that the interactions of cocaine on these pathways should have
widespread consequences, while the more focused DA
input to so-called limbic regions of the cortex suggests
that effects of cocaine on DA should result in more
restricted modifications in cortical development36.
Most investigations of the effects of prenatal cocaine
on brain development and function have focused
upon pharmacological aspects of neurotransmitter
systems with which the drug interacts. There are
numerous reports of changes in DA function, and
some further evidence of changes in the NE and 5-HT
systems (for example Refs 36–40,46,47; for reviews see
Refs 41–45,48). However, most of the changes
reported have been minor or transient. Others have
focused on structural aspects of the effects of in utero
exposure to cocaine. Most studies have employed the
rat model and reported no structural anomalies in the
CNS (for reviews see Refs 42–44). In two studies that
used different animal models (mouse, primate), pronounced structural abnormalities in brain development, particularly in the growth and laminar organization of the cerebral cortex, were revealed. However,

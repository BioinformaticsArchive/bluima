Fig. 2. Immunohistochemical fluorescein labeling of axial spinal cord sections with anti-NF200 antibody.
Normal spinal cord, 1 mm rostral from the injury site, and the injury site at 15 min, 2 h, and 8 h post-injury.
Normal ventral funiculus (A) shows increased axonal density along the subpial margin corresponding to spinothalamic tract axons. At 15 min post-injury (B), ventral funiculus axons at the injury site show extensive fragmentation and a few normal-appearing axons. At 8 h post-injury (C), ventral funiculus at the injury site shows
substantial reduction in immunoreactivity, with several apparently swollen axonal profiles remaining. At
1 mm rostral to the injury site, ventral funiculus axons appear largely normal at 15 min post-injury (D), while
axonal density is reduced at 2 h (E), and further reduced at 8 h (F) with numerous apparently swollen axonal
profiles. Similarly, axonal density in dorsal column 1 mm rostral to the injury site is progressively reduced from
15 min (G) to 2 h (H) to 8 h (I) post-injury. Scale bars Âˆ 50 mm.

GABAergic developmental control of trait anxiety and
behavioral inhibition
Cell type-specific and developmentally controlled gene deletion
was used to elucidate the molecular and cellular substrate underlying trait anxiety associated with a modest GABAAR deficit. Heterozygous deletion of the 2 subunit induced selectively in developing forebrain glutamatergic neurons (Emx1Cre f 2/
mice) reproduced the behavioral features of global 2 / mice
(Crestani et al., 1999). In addition, global 2 / and Emx1Cre
f 2/ mice exhibited marked behavioral inhibition in two stressful test situations known to predict antidepressant drug efficacy
in humans. Both the immobility behavior of mice in the forced
swim test and the susceptibility to mood disorders in humans
have been mapped previously to a GABAAR gene cluster that in-cludes the 2 subunit gene (Yoshikawa et al., 2002; Yamada et al.,
2003). Importantly, a comparable GABAAR deficit of CaMKIICre2834 f 2 mice that was delayed to adolescence and limited to
mature glutamatergic neurons lacked behavioral consequences.

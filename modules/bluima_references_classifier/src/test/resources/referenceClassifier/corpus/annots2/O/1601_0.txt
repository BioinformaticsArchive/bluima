Sequential sections were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal
antibodies to IEGs and TH. The paraffin was removed with xylene
and the sections were rehydrated through ethanol. Endogenous
peroxidase was quenched by incubating the sections in 0.3%
H2O2 for 30 min. The sections were washed thrice in distilled
water, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated
with normal blocking serum (rabbit ABC staining system, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature (approximately 22 Â°C). The sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies. The primary antibody was
omitted in negative controls. After a wash in PBS, the sections

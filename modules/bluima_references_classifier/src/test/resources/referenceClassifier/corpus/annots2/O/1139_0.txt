RESULTS
SCI-Induced Neuronal Loss Is Finalized Within
24 hr Around the Site of Injury
In agreement with other findings, we reported previously that apoptotic markers robustly increased at 24 hr
after SCI, and that apoptosis significantly contributed to
SCI-induced neuronal loss (Qiu et al., 2001). To assess the
extent and time course of neuronal losses after contusion
SCI in rats, we counted cells displaying well-defined
NeuN label at 24 and 72 hr after SCI. We counted the
number of cells labeled with NeuN in sham-treated and
contused rats (n 6) by taking three sections from each of
three cord segments (T7, T8, and T9; Fig. 1). We found
that almost all neurons (80 –100%) at the impact site died
by 24 hr after SCI, and about 50% in one segment rostrally
or caudally (Fig. 1B). The extent of neuronal loss seemed
to remain constant 24 –72 hr after contusion (Fig. 1C), in
agreement with other reports (Grossman et al., 2001). This
finding indicated that cell loss immediately around the site
of impact was completed by the first day after trauma;
however, the extent of neuronal loss was not uniform
throughout the same section of spinal cord. We found the
most pronounced loss of neurons at 24 hr in the deep
dorsal horn region, where SCI had the most devastating
impact (about 80% of neurons lost; Fig. 1C). The percentage of lost neurons stayed the same at 72 hr post-contusion
at one segment rostrally or caudally. About 60% of neurons in the ventral horns died within 24 hr after SCI, and
this number did not change in spinal cords 72 hr after SCI
(data not shown).
To characterize early SCI-induced transcriptional
changes that result in apoptotic cell death during the first
24 after SCI, we used Affymetrix DNA microarrays to
detect mRNA changes in the injured spinal cords at 1, 12,
and 24 hr after contusion. Proapoptotic mRNA changes
that take place at 1 hr after SCI have been reported
elsewhere (Nesic et al., 2002). We identified genes that
were significantly activated or inhibited at 12 hr, regardless
of their mRNA levels at 1 and 24 hr after SCI to focus on
transcriptional changes that precede and underlie neuronal
loss within the injured and two adjacent segments, and are
finalized within 24 hr after SCI, as suggested in Figure 1.
Among the levels of mRNA that significantly changed at
12 hr after SCI, and whose products are critically involved
in regulating cell loss, we found early SCI-induced
changes in the expression of mRNA for the Bcl-2 family
of molecules, changes that have not been characterized
before. Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of cytochrome c release, caspase activity, and apoptosis. The
balance in the expression of antiapoptotic and proapo-

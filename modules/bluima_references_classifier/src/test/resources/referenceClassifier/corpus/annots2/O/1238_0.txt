volley might be expected to increase exocytosis. Second,
cooling could diminish transmitter release by reducing
Ca2+ entry into presynaptic terminals. Third, the sequence
of protein binding steps that regulate vesicle docking,
fusion, and pore formation may be highly temperature
dependent and slowed by cooling (Koh & Bellen, 2003).
Acting at one or more of these steps, cooling could change
the ratio of fully emptying and endocytosed vesicles to
those that are immediately reused (e.g. `kiss and run'), or
it could diminish the fraction of vesicles available within
the readily releasable pool (Stevens & Williams, 2000;
Aravanis et al. 2003; Rizzoli & Betz, 2004; Sudhof, 2004).
The resolution of the FM1-43 methodology used in the
present study cannot distinguish among these alternative
mechanisms, all of which are compatible with our central
hypothesis.
It is unlikely that our results are influenced by terminal
depolarization produced by block of presynaptic ion
pumps. While terminal depolarization could result from
cooling and lead to diminished transmitter release, the
time course of the effects observed in the current
experiments and in our prior epilepsy experiments appear
too rapid to be explained by pump inhibition (Yang et al.
2002).
We are aware that some investigators have suggested
that cooling actually increases the amount of vesicular
release, but diminishes peak synaptic responses because
the release is desynchronized (Pyott & Rosenmund, 2002).
Our findings do not support this hypothesis. We did
observe a prolongation of the presynaptic fibre volley,
which could correlate with reduced release synchrony
during cooling. However, the diminished destaining we
see with cooling is inconsistent with increased transmitter
release. It is possible, as carefully discussed by the authors
of the study, that the effects of cooling on glutamate
desensitization and pharmacological variables complicate
their quantitative analysis of transmitter release.
Two additional confounding issues in our own study
relate to the use of FM1-43. First, there is concern that
FM1-43 may not be a reliable marker of the presynaptic
neurotransmitter compartment. This possibility appears
remote: the imaging characteristics of the dye in slices were
consistent with labelling synaptic terminals and repetitive
physiological stimulation largely eliminated the dye. We
corrected for the small amount of nonspecific staining by
subtracting a background prior to any of our calculations.
While the kinetics of FM1-43 destaining will not exactly
mirror the time course of neurotransmitter release, the dye
does provide a measure of presynaptic activity. Second,
it is possible that the actual rate of FM1-43 dissociation
from the internal vesicular membrane is temperature
dependent. We specifically investigated this possibility in
two separate experiments. When we applied FM1-43 to the
outside surface of cultured cells, there was no evidence of
temperature dependence of FM1-43 dissociation over the

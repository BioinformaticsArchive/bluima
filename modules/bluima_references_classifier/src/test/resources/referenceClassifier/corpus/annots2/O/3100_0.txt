Figure 4. Elimination by ketamine of the evoked firing of a striatal
neuron in response to light cutaneous stimulation in chronically implanted
animal. The upper lip was near the center of the receptive field, which
included the perioral area and snout. Each of four panels shows the raster,
PSTH, and representative waveform of the neuron at different stages of

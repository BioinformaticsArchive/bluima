absence of exogenously applied glycine, was eliminated by
addition of a saturating concentration of glycine to the external
medium. This observation supports a role for the endogenously
released coagonist of the NMDAR glycine site in activitydependent modulation of the NMDAR function.
The functional consequences of reduction in the affinity of
the NMDA receptor for endogenous coagonist were previously
demonstrated in the experiments on genetically modified mice
with point mutations of the glycine site of the NR1 subunit
(Kew et al. 2000). Thus mice carrying Grin1D481N mutation, in
which the NMDAR1 glycine affinity was decreased fivefold,
were viable but had deficits in theta burst-induced LTP in the
hippocampus and spatial learning. The increases in NMDAR
activation, associated with GlyT1 blockade, were also found to
be functionally relevant, as inhibition of GlyT1 led to significant augmentation of NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA1 area of
the hippocampus (Martina et al. 2004).
Taken together, our present results suggest a role for the
NMDAR glycine site in synaptic computation. Spatiotemporal
integration of incoming signals would lead to coordinated
increases in activation of NMDA receptors in a local group of
synapses. Although synapse independence was shown to in-crease the computing power of a neuronal network (Barbour
2001), there might be a need for the cellular mechanism
mediating synchronous plastic modifications in a group of
neighboring synapses. This could optimize conditions for the
encoding and retaining specific information about afferent
activity patterns. Thus maximal activation of NMDARs at
closely located synaptic contacts, soaked in the coagonist
released in an activity-dependent fashion, at depolarized membrane potentials would permit the induction of NMDARdependent synaptic plasticity, while the same synapses could
still retain the ability to function independently at the resting
membrane potential.

Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant differences
in activity of the oxidative enzyme, citrate synthase, between
the saline and AM-injected subgroups. Therefore, the data
presented for each group was pooled. The enzyme activity
was significantly greater in the HDT-EX (Î¼mol?min-1?g-1)
group when compared to CN or HDT counterparts (Table 4).
Exercise training in the HDT-EX group increased the citrate
synthase activity by 22.9 and 26.5% compared to the CN and
HDT group, respectively.

is detected by Western blot and immunocytochemistry
(Borowsky et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2007). At
the cellular level, a subset of dopamine neurons expresses
TAAR1 along with dopamine transporter (DAT) in both the
rhesus monkey and the mouse (Xie et al., 2007). Accordingly,
the broad agonist spectrum for TAAR1 and reported coexpression of TAAR1 with DAT in dopamine neurons support
the hypothesis that TAAR1 may be an important modulator
of dopaminergic brain function and may contribute to physiological, pathological, and/or adaptive properties of psychostimulant drugs of abuse.
When TAAR1 is expressed heterologously in cell lines, it
remains largely intracellular (Bunzow et al., 2001; Miller et
al., 2005). We have pharmacologically characterized rhesus
monkey TAAR1 in HEK293 cells using a highly sensitive
CRE-Luc assay (Miller et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2007). On the
basis of observing an intracellular distribution of the receptor
in vitro, we studied TAAR1 activation in DAT-transfected
HEK293 cells, reasoning that DAT would provide a conduit
for monoamines and amphetamines to enter the intracellular
space and that it would activate TAAR1 to a greater extent.

TABLE I
[3H]Saxitoxin binding analysis of αIIA- and
αIIA/β1A-expressing cell lines
Whole cell saturation binding analysis of SNAIIA and SNaIIA-β1A
cells was performed as previously described (10) over a concentration
range of 0.1–10 nM [3H]STX with the addition of 10 μM unlabeled
tetrodotoxin to assess nonspecific binding. [3H]STX (28 Ci/mmol) was
obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Binding data were normalized to protein concentration using the BCA protein assay kit.
Saturation binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using
Prism to obtain K and B values. Values are shown 6S.E.

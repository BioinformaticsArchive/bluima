nickel ammonium. After DAB incubation, three 5-min washes
were done with TBS, then the slices were mounted onto gelatincoated slides and dried overnight at room temperature. They
were dehydrated and coverslipped the next day.
Control slices were prepared using the primary antibody preabsorbed with the corresponding peptide (5 WM, 24 h, 4‡C) and
by incubating the slices without the primary antibody.
For double-immunostaining, the sections were ¢rst processed
for PTX3 immunoreactivity, as described above using a streptavidin £uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody
(1 :40, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). Then the slices were
washed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated overnight at
4‡C with the primary antibody : rabbit anti-glial ¢brillary acidic
protein (GFAP; 1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), a
selective marker of astrocytes, mouse anti-neuronal speci¢c

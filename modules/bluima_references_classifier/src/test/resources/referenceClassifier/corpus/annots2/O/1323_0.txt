Fig. 3. Signals for both NETRIN-G2 mRNA and AChE are stronger in
the ventral claustrum. (A) In situ hybridization for NETRIN-G2 mRNA.
(B) Adjacent section reacted for AChE histochemistry (DAB-nickel
chromogen). (C) Adjacent section reacted for NeuN immunohistochemistry to visualize total neuronal population (DAB-nickel chromogen). (A=–C=) Quantitative densitometric mapping (MAP Analyzer,
YAMATO Corporation) of NETRIN-G2 mRNA (A=), AChE histochemistry (B=) and NeuN immunohistochemistry (C=). Scale bar 0.5 mm in
C for A–C.

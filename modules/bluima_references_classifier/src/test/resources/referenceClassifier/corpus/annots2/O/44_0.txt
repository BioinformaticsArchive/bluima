Figure 9. L ong-term effects of intra-NAc BDN F
inf usions after saline or cocaine on responding for
CR up to 5 weeks after cessation of BDN F administration. BDN F-inf used animals showed enhanced
responding for CR. After the first saline inf usion
(sal1), there were differences between the groups on
the levers; CR lever responses were increased in the
BDN F-inf used compared with the vehicle-inf used
group (*p < 0.01). Similar effects were observed in
sal2 in which there was a trend for a selective CR
increase (F(1,6) = 5.44; p = 0.06). After subsequent
saline (sal3â€“ sal4) injections, only preferences for CR
over the NCR lever were found. Responding on the
CR lever was markedly increased and persisted in
the BDN F-inf used compared with the vehicleinf used animals after these cocaine challenges on
days coc1, coc2 (F(1,6) = 19.81 and 13.01; p < 0.01),
and coc4 (F(1,6) = 6.87; p < 0.05), and there was
a trend on coc3. Significant differences are shown
as **. No differences in responding on the NCR lever
were observed. Note that the data for sal1 and coc1
are the same as depicted in Figure 8.

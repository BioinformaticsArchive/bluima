peaks (Fig. 7) and the latter was thought to be a-D-mannosidase component I2
in veiw of that a-D-mannosidase Ix has a lower molecular weight than acidic a-D-mannosidase (Hirani and Winchester 1979). The a-D-mannosidase I2 was also
present in the control and I-cell brains, but its amount was only trace in the liver
from I-cell disease. These results were consistent with the pH profile curves and
the results of chromatographies on DEAF-cellulose and Con A-Sepharose.

Fig. 5. (a) CA1 pyramidal cells counted in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer in individual sections along dorso-ventral axis of the horizontal series of
sections. (b) Cell counts obtained by subsampling the original counts for section sampling intervals using every 2nd to every 20th section. (c) Estimates
of the CE obtained from the Gundersenâ€“Jensen estimator using a smoothness constant of 0 (open circles) and 1 (open triangles) for section sampling
intervals using every 2nd to every 20th section. Black squares indicate the observed CEs, i.e. the coefficient of variation among the available
replicates.

cooperation, and image quality. We required that the midsagittal slice
show full visualization of the cerebral aqueduct and the anterior and
posterior commissures, in which a line was estimated requiring the
anterior-commissure-posterior-commissure line to be within three degrees
of 180. If these criteria were not met, the subject was realigned until these
criteria were met. A three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in the steady-state pulse sequence was used to obtain 124 contiguous
images with slice thickness of 1.5 mm in the coronal plane for region of
interest measures (TE 5 msec, TR 25 msec, flip angle 40 degrees,
acquisition matrix 256 192, number of excitations 1, field of vision
24 cm). Coronal sections were obtained perpendicular to the anteriorcommissure-posterior-commissure line to provide a more reproducible
guide for image orientation. Axial proton density and T2-weighted images
were obtained to enable exclusion of structural abnormalities on MRI. A
neuroradiologist reviewed all scans and ruled out clinically significant
abnormalities. All subjects tolerated the procedure well. No sedation was
used.
The imaging data from the coronal sections were transferred from the
MRI unit to a computer workstation (PowerMacintosh, Apple Computer)
and analyzed with the use of IMAGE software (version 1.61) developed at
the NIH (Rasband, 1996) that provides valid and reliable volume measurements of specific structures using a manually operated (hand tracing)
approach. Trained and reliable raters who were blinded to subject information made all measurements. These methods were previously described
by our group (De Bellis et al., 1999; De Bellis et al., 2002; De Bellis et al.,
2001) and are briefly presented here.
Intracranial volumes were calculated by first manually tracing the
intracranial volume of each coronal slice after exclusion of skull and dura,
then summing these areas of successive coronal slices, including GM and
WM and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) volumes, and multiplying by slice
thickness. These measures included frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital
cortex, subcortical structures, cerebellum, and brainstem.
Cerebral volumes were measured after manual exclusion of CSF volumes, cerebellum, and brainstem in the same manner and included cortical and subcortical structures.
Prefrontal cortex volumes were calculated by summing up areas of
successive coronal slices, including gray and white matter and CSF volumes and multiplying by slice thickness. The anterior boundary of the
prefrontal cortex was defined as the most anterior coronal section containing gray matter. The coronal slice showing the genu of the corpus
callosum was used to mark the posterior limit of the prefrontal cortex
(Rosenberg et al., 1997). Prefrontal white and gray matter volumes were
calculated by using a semiautomated segmentation algorithm. This computerized segmentation technique uses mathematically derived cutoffs for
gray matter–white matter–CSF partitions with histograms of signal intensities. This computerized segmentation technique is both labor intensive
and manually operated. It uses an interactive method in which mathematically derived cutoffs for gray matter–white matter–CSF partitions from
histograms of signal intensities are used to individually select gray matter,
white matter, and CSF areas from each coronal slice. Gray matter, white
matter, and CSF areas are thus separately calculated and multiplied by
slice thickness for the individual subject's gray matter, white matter, and
CSF volumes. In this way, we can minimize the inherent limitations on
qualifying white matter signal hypointensities as gray matter on T1-weighted MRI scans by visual inspection of slices (i.e., so that hypointensity artifacts in corpus callosum or cerebral white matter are not calculated
as gray matter). This approach has been validated by using both a stereology technique for brain morphometric measurements and a phantom
with known absolute volumes (Keshavan et al., 1995) and has been used in
several published neuroimaging studies (De Bellis et al., 1999; De Bellis et
al., 2001; Rosenberg et al., 1997). See Fig. 1.
The boundaries of the thalamus were previously described (Gilbert et
al., 2000). The boundaries of the thalamus were defined as follows: The
mammillary bodies and the interventricular foramen defined the anterior
boundary; the internal capsule defined the lateral boundary; the third
ventricle defined the medial boundary; the hypothalamus defined the
inferior boundary; the lateral ventricle defined the superior boundary; and

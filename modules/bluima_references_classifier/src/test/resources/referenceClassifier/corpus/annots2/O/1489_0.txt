Experiment 1
Figure 2a shows the results of our analysis. A repeated-measures
ANOVA with condition, delay, and group as factors found a main
effect of condition (F(1, 17) 19.49; p 0.0004) with lower overall accuracy when conjunctions had to be remembered (M
68%) compared with objects or locations (M 91%). In contrast, a longer delay interval did not generally decrease performance (F(1, 17) 2.96; p 0.10). The effect of group membership
was marginally significant (F(1, 17) 3.75; p 0.07), a finding
that is more readily understood when the interactions are examined. Of interest, the interaction of condition by delay by group
was significant (F(1, 17) 6.80; p 0.02). This was because of
similar levels of performance by amnesics and controls in the
feature condition (M 88 vs 98%) and conjunction condition at
the 1 s delay (M 73 vs 73%), and similar performance levels in
the feature condition at the 8 s delay (M 88 vs 88%) but dramatically lower performance by amnesics in the conjunction
condition at the 8 s delay (M 45 vs 79%). None of the other
interactions were significant (all p values 0.15).
To assess whether binding deficits found in experiment 1 were
caused by hippocampal or extra-hippocampal damage in the
MTL, we compared the performance of patients with damage
limited to the hippocampus (termed “H” group; n 4) to that of
patients with more extensive MTL damage (termed “H ” group;
n 4) on the conjunction trials. No difference was found be-tween groups (F(1, 6) 1.97; p 0.21) and the interaction of
group with delay was not significant (F 1). Of interest, the
groups did not differ at the 8 s delay (H group: M 62%, SE
21%; H group: M 40%, SE 19%; p 0.47).
These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the
hippocampus is important for relational processing even over
brief delays. However, one explanation for the results of experiment 1 that cannot be ruled out is that more information had to
be remembered on conjunction trials as compared with feature
trials. Were the deficits experienced by amnesics in experiment 1
caused by a binding problem, as we hypothesized, or were they
caused by the greater memory load in the conjunction condition
than in the feature condition? If the latter hypothesis is true,

Measurements of Plasma Levels of ANP and BNP
Rat ANP was measured in plasma by radioimmunoassay, after prior
extraction on C18 Sep-Pak columns, with a modification of the
method of Richards et al.25 The antibody cross-reacted 100% with rat
ANP. Rat BNP was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit (RIK
9103, Peninsula Labs) again after prior extraction.

kilocalories from protein and 21% of kilocalories from fat
(Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Baseline food intakes
and body weights were recorded for 7 days. Before the start of
the experiment, cannulas were tested for patency by infusing
20 ng of angiotensin II in 3 μl of sterile saline and confirming
that the animals drank within 5 min of the infusion.
The rats were divided into four weight-matched groups:
saline control (SC), saline restrained (SR), CRF antagonist
control (AC), and CRF antagonist restrained (AR). On each of
the next 3 days (days 1-3), rats were exposed to 3 h of
restraint per day or were nonrestrained controls. The control
rats remained in their home cages during the experiment, but
the cages were moved to an experimental room, and food and
water were removed at 7 AM. Ten minutes before the onset of
restraint or at an equivalent time for controls, all rats
received an intracerebroventricular injection of 3 μl of sterile
saline (SC and SR) or 50 μg of αhCRF-(9—41) in 3 μl of saline
(AC and AR). Restrained rats were placed in Perspex restraining tubes (Plas Labs, Lansing, MI) for 3 h from 8 to 11 AM.
Small blood samples (,50 μl) were collected by tail bleeding
from each rat exactly 1 h after infusion for measurement of
serum corticosterone (corticosterone RIA kit, ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). At the end of restraint, animals were
returned to their home cages in their home room and were
given food and water. Food intake was measured during the
light phase at 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 h after the end of stress. Two
more measurements were taken 1 and 2 h into the dark
phase. The same procedures were followed for days 2 and 3 of
repeated restraint. Body weights and food intakes were
measured daily for 3 days after the end of restraint, and the
animals were killed by decapitation. Feed efficiency ratio was
calculated by dividing weight change during the experimental period by total volume of food consumed during the
experimental period. Blood was collected for serum analysis
of corticosterone, insulin (rat insulin RIA kit, Linco Research,
St. Louis, MO), leptin (rat leptin RIA kit, Linco Research),
glucose (diagnostic kit 510, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO),
and free fatty acids (NEFA C kit; WAKO Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Inguinal, epididymal, and retroperitoneal fat
pads, liver, adrenals, and thymus were weighed and returned
to the carcass. The carcass, less gut content, was frozen for
subsequent determination of body composition, as described
previously (7). Immediately before decapitation, 1 μl of 1%
methylene blue solution was infused into the cannula to allow
postmortem confirmation of cannula placement.
Experiment 2: third ventricle infusion of αhCRF-(9—41) in
repeatedly restrained rats. Forty-four 300-g male SpragueDawley rats were housed as described above and implanted
with cannulas in the third cerebral ventricle with use of
stereotaxic techniques. Guide cannulas (25 gauge, 15 mm
long) were placed using the following coordinates applied to a
flat skull: anteroposterior -2.8, lateral 0.0, ventral -8.1 from
bregma. They were secured with machine screws and dental
cement and fitted with 30-gauge wire stylets. The injection
cannulas (31 gauge) were designed to project 1 mm beyond
the guide cannula tip. The rats were adapted to a dry 16% of
kilocalories from protein-40% of kilocalories from fat diet (8)
for 5 days. Before the start of the experiment, cannula
patency was tested as described above using 5 ng of angiotensin II in a 1.0-μl infusion. Baseline measures of daily body
weight and food intake corrected for spillage were made for 6
days, then on the day before the onset of repeated restraint
the rats were divided into four weight-matched groups. The
infusion and restraint procedures were the same as for
experiment 1, except on each day of restraint the rats received
a 1-μl infusion of saline or 10 μg of αhCRF-(9—41) in 1 μl of
saline 10 min before stress. Tail blood samples were collected

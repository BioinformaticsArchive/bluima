Figure 3. Electron micrograph of the cingulate bundle of a 24-year-old female rhesus monkey (AM100). The myelinated nerve
fibers are less tightly packed than in younger monkeys (Fig. 2),
and astrocytic processes (As) are more frequent between adjacent nerve fibers. Some nerve fibers (1 and 3) contain dense
cytoplasm in splits of their myelin sheaths. Another myelinated
nerve fiber (2) shows ballooning of the sheath. Interspersed
among these myelinated nerve fibers are unmyelinated nerve
fibers (U). Profiles through paranodes (P) are also indicated. Scale
bar = 2 lm.

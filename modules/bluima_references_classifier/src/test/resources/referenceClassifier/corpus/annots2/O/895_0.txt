HOG
The tumor-derived cell line, HOG, despite its limited oligodendrocyte morphology, appeared to possess
characteristics related to immature oligodendrocytes
such as GalC and CNPase expression. Culturing in DM
induced some differentiation noted by enhanced formation of short processes and increased expression of
MBP and MOG mRNA. Arriba Zerpa et al. (2000) re-ported the synthesis of transferrin in HOG cells subjected to differentiation medium containing insulin,
T3, selenium, putrescine and glucose as described by
Eccleston and Silberberg (1984). Transferrin was found
to constitute an early developmental marker for oligodendrocytes (Espinosa de los et al., 1988) and was postu-

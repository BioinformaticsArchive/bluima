rons during brain development. Moreover, oversulfated CS/DS
chains from various marine animals showed growth factorbinding and neurite outgrowth-promoting activities in vitro
(14 –17).
However, the reported functions of brain CS/DS chains in
neuritogenesis are controversial. CS/DS chains act as neuritogenic molecules (for reviews, see Refs. 6, 18, and 19) and also as
inhibitors of axonal regeneration in the injured central nervous
system (20 –23). Such apparently contradictory functions are
probably attributed to the structural diversity of CS/DS chains.
Significant and various proportions of disulfated disaccharide
units, such as the D unit (GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)) and E unit
(GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)), are detected in the brain of cattle
(24), embryonic day 13 (E13) mice (25) and E18 rats (26) (where
2S, 4S, and 6S represent 2-O, 4-O, and 6-O sulfate groups,
respectively). Recently, we demonstrated that the rare oversulfated disaccharide units D and/or iD (IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S))
and E present in embryonic pig brain-derived CS/DS chains are
critical elements for neuritogenesis (27). In addition, CS chains
from appican, the amyloid precursor protein expressed by rat
C6 glioma cells, contained significant proportions of D and E
units (28). CS-H, isolated from the hagfish notochord, has a
unique oversulfated structure characterized by a major disaccharide H (or iE) unit (IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)) (6, 18, 29, 30)
and therefore is actually DS. The term DS-E for this glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and iE (where “i” represents IdoUA) for the H
disaccharide unit have been proposed (6, 18). Further, exogenous DS-E/CS-H exhibited appreciable inhibitory activity in
midkine (MK)-mediated neuronal cell adhesion similar to CS-E
(26). However, the presence of oversulfated CS-E and/or iE
structures in the mammalian brain has not been rigorously
characterized.
In biosynthesis, the structural variability of CS/DS chains is
generated under the control of multiple sulfotransferases and
glucuronyl C5-epimerase, which converts GlcUA to IdoUA (for
reviews, see Refs. 31–33). Chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1
and -2 catalyze the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in chondroitin as well as in dermatan, whereas dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 catalyzes the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in
dermatan (Refs. 34 –37). Several other sulfotransferases like
N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase-1 and -2, which
catalyze 4-O-sulfation at the nonreducing terminal GalNAc
residues in GalNAc 1– 4GlcNAc -, have also been cloned. On
the other hand, N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST), which catalyzes the transfer of
sulfate to the 6-O-position of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate
(GalNAc4S), has been cloned (38) but not yet analyzed in the
brain. The gene expression pattern of this sulfotransferase
would provide clues for investigating the distribution of CS-E
chains in the brain.
Hence, we performed in situ hybridization to probe the distribution of GalNAc4S-6ST in postnatal mouse brain and also
studied the possible functions of E/iE-containing structures in
brain development using a new antibody, GD3G7, generated by
the phage display technique (39). Interestingly, a good correlation between GalNAc4S-6ST expression and the GD3G7
epitope was observed in the mammalian brain.

because GAR had attained its minimum value
(presumedly equal to zero) during the preceding vu. We will call this limiting relaxation
amplitude Rmin. When I& was negative to -65
mV in Fig. 3A, the relaxations consisted of IAR
deactivation. The relaxation amplitudes also
reached a limiting value (&,J following a I&
negative to - 105 mV because GAR had reached
its maximum value at this potential.
The voltage dependence of GAR may be de-scribed by a dimensionless relative activation
parameter (N,), similar to the ~2, or KU, pa-rameters of Hodgkin and Huxley (23), which
varies from zero to one as GAR varies from
zero to its maximum value. NC, may be ex-pressed as follows
N, = [ AG - AGmin]/[ AG,,, - AGminl (6)
where AG,, and AG,i, are the maximum and
minimum values of AG corresponding to a
particular I/F. Substituting Eq. 5 in Eq. 6 yields
Ncc= [R - Rminl/[Rma-x Rminl (7)
Thus it is possible to obtain the variation of
NW from the relaxation data of Fig. 3A.
Figure 3B is a plot of N, versus membrane
potential from five different neurons. The data
points were computed from Eq. 7 through the
use of relaxation data measured as in Fig. 3A
from each cell. The data points from all cells
are fit by the sigmoidal relation
N, = { 1+ ew[( L - E,)IWI}-' (8)

of neuronal and glial elements, retarded myelinogenesis,
increased cell death (Matthews, 2000), and delayed maturation of astrocytes (Huang et al., 2001).
In this study, we employed adult rats that were prenatally stressed to assess morphological changes in astrocytes, dendritic arborization, and synaptic contacts in frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. On PD90, the
brains of prenatally stressed rats were processed for immunocytochemistry studies, by using primary antibodies to
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; the main cytoskeletal
astroglial protein), S100B protein (an astroglial-derived
neurotrophic factor), MAP-2 (a microtubule-associated
protein present almost exclusively in dendrites), and synaptophysin (Syn; one major integral protein of the synaptic vesicle membrane). Cell area of GFAP-IR astrocytes
and relative areas of MAP-2-IR fibers were measured by
computer-assisted image analysis. The intracellular content
of S100B was measured as the relative optical density of
S100B-IR in the astrocyte cytoplasm. The density of synaptic contacts was estimated as the relative optical density
of defined histological fields containing Syn-IR structures
immunostained for Syn. In addition, an electron microscopic (EM) study of Syn-immunostained sections was
performed to establish possible changes at the ultrastructural level of the synaptic contact.

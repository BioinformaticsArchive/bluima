Fig. 9. Effects of AFDX-116 and 4-DAMP on soman-induced inhibition
and PB-induced potentiation of evoked GABAergic transmission in hippocampal slices. A, quantitative analysis of the effects of the m3 receptorpreferring antagonist 4-DAMP and of the m2 receptor-preferring antagonist AFDX-116 on evoked IPSCs and on soman-induced inhibition of
evoked IPSCs. Evoked IPSCs were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons
in hippocampal slices that were exposed first to 100 nM 4-DAMP for 5 to
8 min and subsequently to the admixture of 100 nM 4-DAMP plus 1 nM
soman for an additional 10 min. The same protocol was carried out using
AFDX-116 instead of 4-DAMP. At the end of the experiments, the preparations were washed for 10 min with drug-free ACSF. The amplitudes of
events evoked at a frequency of 0.2 Hz for 3 min were averaged. The
averaged amplitudes of events recorded in the presence of a muscarinic
receptor antagonist or that antagonist plus soman are expressed as
percentage of the averaged amplitudes of events recorded at the same
frequency for 3 min before exposure of the neurons to any drug. Each
graph and error bar represent mean and S.E.M., respectively, of results
obtained from three to six experiments. The amplitudes of currents
recorded in the presence of 4-DAMP or 4-DAMP plus soman were significantly smaller than those recorded under control conditions; , p 0.05
and , p 0.01 according to the ANOVA test. In addition, the amplitudes of events recorded in the presence of 4-DAMP plus soman were
significantly different from those recorded in the presence of 4-DAMP; ,
p 0.05 according to the ANOVA test. B, quantitative analysis of the
effects of the m3 receptor-preferring antagonist 4-DAMP and of the m2
receptor-preferring antagonist AFDX-116 on evoked IPSCs and on PB-induced potentiation of evoked IPSCs. The analysis is similar to that
described in A. Each graph and error bar represent mean and S.E.M.,
respectively, of results obtained from three to six experiments. Amplitudes of events recorded in the presence of 4-DAMP, 4-DAMP plus PB,
and AFDX-116 plus PB were significantly different from those recorded
under control conditions; , p 0.05; p 0.01 according to the ANOVA
test.

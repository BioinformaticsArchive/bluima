useful to determine whether they are part of the cranial
(pre)motoneuron system. Neurons with this discharge pattern have not yet been described in the adult.
The VRG in the adult mammal has a complex microstructural organization of cell types that is not well understood (e.g., Ellenberger and Feldman 1989) so that a de-tailed comparison of cell distributions in vitro and in vivo
is not possible. At least six classes of premotor neurons
have been identified in the VRG of the adult (Feldman
1986; Richter et al. 1986), and in all VRG regions there is
an intermingling of various neuronal types (Ellenberger
and Feldman 1989). At a gross level, in anesthetized mammals in vivo the three VRG subdivisions are distinguished
by the presence of concentrated E-neuron populations in
the caudal VRG and the Botzinger Complex and by the
predominance of I-cell populations in between (in the rostral VRG). There is a concentration of E-phase cells in
vitro at levels corresponding to the Botzinger Complex and
at medullary levels just caudal to the obex, resembling the
distribution in the adult rat (Ezure et al. 1988; Saether et al.
1987). However, in vitro, I-phase neurons are distributed
throughout the cell column so there is not a distinct segregation of I and E cell types in a given region; this resembles
the distribution in unanesthetized, decerebrate adult
mammals (G&lot and Bianchi 1987).
There does not seem to be a dense population of E
neurons at the more caudal VRG levels in vitro. Because
caudal VRG E cells provide the excitatory drive to thoracic
and abdominal expiratory motoneurons (Cohen et al.
1985) and because thoracic E-phase activity typically does
not occur in vitro, the paucity of spontaneously active cauda1 VRG E cells may simply represent insufficient expiratory drive, i.e., quiescent E neurons may only become ac-tive in states of elevated drive in vitro. There may be a
developmental elaboration of VRG E-cell activity, with the
density of spontaneously active E cells increasing with maturation (Farber 1989). This is consistent with the basic
concept that caudal E-phase cell activity is not necessary
for rhythmogenesis (Richter 1982), a fact that may be evident ontogenetically.
It is apparent that further detailed neuron mapping is
required to establish the exact correspondence to the intact
state and whether there are important developmental differences. Our results do establish, however, the existence of
a complement of I- and E-phase cells in the ventrolateral
reticular formation that represents a major subset of the
neurons of the pattern-generation system.

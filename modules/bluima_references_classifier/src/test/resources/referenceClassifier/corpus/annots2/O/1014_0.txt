constant until the final ethanol injection of 2 g/kg. This
injection further raised brain ethanol levels to about 30
mM, where they remained stable for the duration of the
experiment.
To ascertain whether the ability of ethanol to affect
amino acid levels was a direct effect of ethanol on the cells
surrounding the microdialysis probe, ethanol was perfused
directly into the VS. In this CE-LIF experiment, a series of
concentrations (50 mM, 500 mM, 1 M) of ethanol was
perfused (1 L/min) by reverse dialysis into the VS and
samples were collected every 11 sec for 30 min at each
concentration (Fig. 10). Increasing the concentration of
ethanol in the ACSF had no effect on taurine levels but
caused a concentration-dependent increase in both glutamate and glycine levels by about 30% to 40% above base-

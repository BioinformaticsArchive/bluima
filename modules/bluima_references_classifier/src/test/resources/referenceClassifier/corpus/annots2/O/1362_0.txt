Tissue volume in nicotine-treated rats

To determine whether the increased densities of interneurons in NICtreated rats were a result of tissue shrinkage, tissue areas and volumes
were calculated. When ACC tissue area was compared between NICand vehicle-treated control rats, similar values were revealed at both
0-day (NIC, 1.91 ± 0.09 mm2 vs. vehicle, 2.10 ± 0.18 mm2;
P = 0.394, n.s.) and 7-day (NIC, 2.39 ± 0.11 mm2 vs. vehicle,
2.38 ± 0.13 mm2; P = 0.964, n.s.) withdrawal (Fig. 3). Similar ACC
volumes were also derived in NIC- and vehicle-treated control rats at
both 0-day (NIC, 0.031 ± 0.002 mm3 vs. vehicle, 0.037 ±
0.002 mm3; P = 0.066, n.s.) and 7-day (NIC, 0.036 ± 0.001 mm3
vs. vehicle, 0.036 ± 0.002 mm3; P = 0.995, n.s.) withdrawal (Fig. 3).

movement. The dysgranular cortex contained various types of neurons such as mechanosensitive neurons with wide, diffuse or
vague receptive fields, and neurons with tonic
discharges during particular jaw and/or
tongue movements and taste-responsive neurons, indicating some associative function be-tween sensation and behavior. Neurons in
the agranular insular cortex responded exclusively to taste stimuli with or without convergent inputs from the thermo- and mechanoreceptors in the oral region. Besides these specific neurons, neurons concerning attention,
anticipation, or arousal were also intermingled in these cortical regions. Thus the harmonic action of these cortical sensory neurons together with the motor cortex subserving jaw-tongue movements plays an essential
role in the accomplishment of ingestive be-havior.

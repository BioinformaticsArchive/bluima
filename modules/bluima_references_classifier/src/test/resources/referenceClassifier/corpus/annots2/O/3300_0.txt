LIGHT MICROSCOPIC IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY
Rats were perfused at room temperature with physiological saline followed by a zinc-formol fixative consisting of
4% commercial formaldehyde, 0.5% zinc salicylate and 0.9%
NaCl, pH 6.2 (Mugnaini & Dahl, 1983). Other rats were
perfused with a calcium-free RingerÕs variant saturated to
pH 7.3 with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, followed by 4% freshly de-polymerized paraformaldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer
(PB), pH 7.3. The brains were removed one hour after perfusion and left 48 hours at 4– C in a cryoprotectant so-lution (30% sucrose in physiological saline). Serial, sagittal, or coronal brain sections were cut on a freezing stage
microtome at 25 „m, and collected in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), pH 7.3. The free floating sections were incubated for 1 hour in 2% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Triton-X

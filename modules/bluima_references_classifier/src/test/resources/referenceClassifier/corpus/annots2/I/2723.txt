level, they are dominated by the inhibitory ones at the
medial reticular formation of the same level of the brain
in the decerebrated cat. Facilitatory areas in the me-dulla, however, must have thermal-sensitive cells, since
an animal that is free from pontine inhibition responds
to cold by shivering. To look more closely at this-problem of localization one may use specific agents to block
either cells or the fibers.
Conclusion and summary. In lower pontine preparations shivering was abolished by bilateral microinjections of procaine into the lateral medullary reticular
formation. Injections into the same areas in intact anesthetized cats resulted in cessation of shivering. These
effects on facilitatory areas or pathways mediating shivering were reversible and could be repeated in the same
preparation several times. Permanent effects were ob-tained by electrolytic lesions or by local microinjections
of 1% osmic acid. In summary it is shown, by means of
microinjection of local anestheti c, that the pathways
mediating shiveri ng in intact and lower ponti ne cats are
located in the same area in the lateral reticular formation of the brainstem.

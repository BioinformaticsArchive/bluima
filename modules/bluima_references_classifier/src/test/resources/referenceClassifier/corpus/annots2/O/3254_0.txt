Figure 5. Reactive oxygen species scavengers and a nitric oxide synthase
inhibitor block the increase in MBP phosphorylation during neuron–glia
signaling. A, Hippocampal slices were perfused with SOD (120 U/ml),
catalase (260 U/ml), and L-NOArg (50 μM) in the recording saline
throughout the experiment. After 16 min of baseline recording, the alveus
was tetanized (arrows), and then 45 min after the final tetanus, the CA1
subregion was assayed for changes in MBP phosphorylation and amount.
Inset traces were obtained before ( a) and after ( b) tetanization. C alibration: 2 msec, 4 mV. B, Representative autoradiograph of a control and
HFS slice demonstrates an increase in [ 32P]phosphate incorporation in
the HFS slice, indicating decreased phosphorylation of MBP in situ.
Densitometric analysis confirmed these results. There was a small but
significant decrease in MBP phosphorylation when reactive oxygen species scavengers and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor was applied to slices
(n = 6; p < 0.01; Student's t test) with no change in MBP amounts (96 6
21% of control; n = 6).

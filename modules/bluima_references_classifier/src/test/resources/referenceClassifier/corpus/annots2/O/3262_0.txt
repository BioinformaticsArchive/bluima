A methyl ester nitroxide radical [20], PCAM is synthesized as follows. A mixture of 5.0 g of 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl (Aldrich Chem.
Co., Milwaukee, WI, USA), 200 ml of methanol (Kanto
Chem. Co., Tokyo, Japan), and 2.0 ml of concentrated
sulfuric acid (Kanto) was stirred at room temperature for
2 d. The methanol was evaporated and the residue was
extracted with chloroform. The solution was washed
with water, an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate so-lution (Kanto), and then with water again. The organic
layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Kanto)
and evaporated to give PCAM as an orange-colored oil
(2.9 g, 55% yield). Its molecular structure was confirmed
by nuclear magnetic resonance (JNM-A620, JEOL, To-kyo, Japan) and a mass spectrometer (Zabspect Q, Mi-cromass, Manchester, UK).

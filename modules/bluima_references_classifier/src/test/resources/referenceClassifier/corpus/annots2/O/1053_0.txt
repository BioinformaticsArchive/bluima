inhibition (disinhibition, a reduction of inhibitory GABAergic
input onto dorsal horn neurons partially due to a loss of secondorder afferent neurons) (2, 150). Removal of GABAergic inhibition facilitates A-fiber–mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in an NMDA-dependent manner (151). Third, nerve lesion
reduces the expression of the potassium chloride coexporter
KCC2 in the spinal cord, leading to change in Cl– concentration
and a resulting reversal of the GABAA receptor–conducted cur-

location of GFP expression in tissue sections (40 m) by fluorescent
microscopy (described in Immunohistochemistry). Animals with injection sites outside the shell of the NAcc (6 of 61) were excluded before
analysis of behavioral data.
Activity monitoring. Activity was assessed with the Cage Rack Photobeam Activity System (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Immediately after the intraperitoneal injection of cocaine or saline, each rat
was placed into an individual activity monitor and left there for 1 hr. The
monitor consisted of a clean cage set inside a horizontal metal frame
holding seven infrared photobeam motion detectors. Movement data
were recorded using San Diego Instruments software on an IBMcompatible computer. After the session, the rats were returned to their
home cage. Total activity (total beam breaks) and ambulation (two
sequential beam breaks) were quantified automatically by the software
and were analyzed later using Microsoft (Seattle, WA) Excel and SPSS
(Chicago, IL) programs. Statistical significance was assessed by averaging
each of the six 10 min segments; these collapsed time points were
analyzed using mixed effect repeated-measures ANOVA, using viral
treatment as the between-subjects variable and time as the withinsubjects variable. At doses at which there was an overall main effect of
viral treatment, individual segments were tested for significance using
post hoc Student's t tests.
Experiment 2 design: place conditioning. Place conditioning occurred in
a three-compartment apparatus (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT), as
described previously (Carlezon et al., 1998). During screening (day 0),
rats (300 –325 gm) were placed in the small (12 21 21 cm) central
compartment of the three-chamber place conditioning apparatus and
were allowed to explore the entire apparatus for 30 min. Compartments
differed in color, floor texture, and lighting. Data collected during this
screening session were considered to reflect baseline (i.e., before conditioning) preferences for each of the compartments. Rats that did not
show strong a priori preferences ( 18 min) for a compartment were
anesthetized (65 mg/kg, i.p., sodium pentobarbital) and given atropine
(0.25 mg, s.c.) to minimize bronchial secretions. Each rat received
bilateral microinjections (2.0 l/side) of HA1B–GFP (n 34) or GFPonly viral particles (n 33) aimed at the NAcc shell as described for
experiment 1. The medial NAcc shell was targeted specifically because
we showed previously that this region is critical for the rewarding effects
of cocaine (Carlezon et al., 1995) and other stimulants (Carlezon and
Wise, 1996) and because it has the strongest reciprocal connections with
VTA (Groenewegen et al., 1999). Control rats (n 53) received sham
surgery in which the injection needle was lowered 1.0 mm below the dura,
but no injections were made.
After 2 d of recovery, conditioning trials (two per day) were given on
2 consecutive days (days 3 and 4). On the first conditioning trial of each
day, the rats received saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.) and were confined to one of
the large (24 18 33 cm) side compartments of the apparatus. Three
hours later, they received cocaine (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) and were confined to the other side compartment. On the
final day (day 5), they were again allowed to explore the entire apparatus
freely for 30 min. Data collected during this test session were considered
to reflect conditioning-induced (i.e., after conditioning) preferences for
each of the compartments.
Immediately after the final test sessions, rats were anesthetized with
pentobarbital (130 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused with 0.9% saline, followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were kept overnight in 20% glycerol before slicing (40 m). Injection placements were verified by histological analyses (Carlezon et al., 1998). Data from rats with placements
outside the NAcc shell (5 of 73) were excluded from analyses.
Conditioning-induced changes in preference for the drug- or salineassociated compartments were analyzed using a three-way (vector treatment cocaine dose time, before vs after conditioning) ANOVA with
repeated measures, followed by post hoc comparisons with Fisher's t tests
(two-tailed).
Immunohistochemistr y. A number of rats (n 20) from the locomotor
activity studies were selected randomly for immunohistochemistry studies. These rats were injected with 1000 U of heparin intraperitoneally,
anesthetized deeply with pentobarbital, and perfused intracardially with
Tyrode's solution (in mM: 126 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 0.4
NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed, postfixed for 2 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stored in PBS at 4°C 1–2 d before being processed f urther.
Free-floating sections (40 m) were prepared on a Leica (Nussloch,
Germany) VT1000S vibratome and rinsed in PBS (200 mM), pH 7.4. The
sections were permeabilized in PBS–0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min and

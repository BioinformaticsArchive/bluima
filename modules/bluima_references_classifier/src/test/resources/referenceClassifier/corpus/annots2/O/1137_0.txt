adrenalectomized rats maintained with a low dose of corticosterone. These rats are characterized by a higher and
longer-lasting stress-induced release of ACTH (Jacobson
and Sapolsky, 1993; Helmreich et al., 2001; Dal-Zotto et
al., 2002), and a stronger induction of transcriptional ac-tivity of AVP gene in the pPVN (Kov√°cs et al., 2000;
Helmreich et al., 2001). Therefore, in the present work we
have studied, in rats, the long-lasting effects of a single
dose of MET on: (a) basal and stress levels of HPA hormones, and (b) some central components of the HPA axis.

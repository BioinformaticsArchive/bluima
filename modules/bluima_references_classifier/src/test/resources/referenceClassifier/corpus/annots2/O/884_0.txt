FIG. 3. Spinal cord pathology in MBP/HIV-1Nef Tg mice. (A through
D) Light microscopy comparing thoracic spinal cord transsections
from MBP/HIV-1Nef Tg mice (A, C, and D) and from an age-matched
control animal (B). Note the appearance of vacuoles, which sometimes
form clusters, in the anterior and lateral funiculi of MBP/HIV-1Nef Tg
mice (A, C, and D). Vacuolation of the dorsal funiculi is uncommon.
An inflammatory lesion in the lateral funiculus of an MBP/HIV-1Nef
mouse exhibiting significant vacuolar changes can be seen in panel D.
The bright field was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. (E and F)
Electron microscopy of non-Tg (E) and Tg (F) cervical spinal cords in
transsection. Note the splitting of the myelin sheaths in the Tg tissue
(F). Magnification for panels A and B, 77; for panel C, 174; for
panel D, 145; for panels E and F, 5,820.

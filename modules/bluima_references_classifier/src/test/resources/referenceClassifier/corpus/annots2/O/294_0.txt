Fig. 2. Summary of the sustained ef-fects of clonidine on SNA, MAP, heart
rate (HR), and activity of barosensitive
bulbospinal RVLM units. A: clonidine
produced a dose-related decrease in
SNA and nearly abolished activity at
the highest dose. B and C: as seen in the
SNA response, clonidine decreased
MAP and HR at the 2 highest doses. D:
in contrast to the near abolition of SNA
produced by clonidine, barosensitive
bulbospinal RVLM units were only
mildly inhibited with the 2 highest
doses of clonidine. E: separation of
RVLM units on the basis of conduction
velocity showed that baseline activity
was significantly different, with higher
firing rates in the faster conducting neurons (top). However, the highest dose of
clonidine (10 Î¼g/kg) produced a comparable percent inhibition of the RVLM
units across the range of conduction ve-locities (bottom). P < 0.05.

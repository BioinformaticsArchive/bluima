wanted to point out that although
BMI-1 knockdown had no significant effect on the cell cycle status
and survival of BE(2)-C cells, longterm culture apparently selected for
the subpopulation of BE(2)-C/Bmi- 1si cells that retained normal levels
of Bmi-1 expression. Whereas early
passage (passage 9) BE(2)-C/Bmi- 1si cells showed a significant reduction in the Bmi-1 level, late-passage
(passage 18) BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells
expressed Bmi-1 at a level similar to
that of control BE(2)-C/pSuper cells
(supplemental Fig. S1A), and
regained the ability to grow in soft
agar (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus,
Bmi-1 is required for sustaining
long-term growth of BE(2)-C cells
in the culture, most likely by maintaining their self-renewal capacity.
During the study, we noticed that
about 20 –30% of early passage
BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells displayed the
morphology of S-type cells, with
large and flattened bodies (Fig. 5C,
BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si, Phase). To assess
their differentiation state, immunofluorescence staining of cell lineage
markers was performed. Compared
with BE(2)-C/pSuper cells (Fig. 5C,

showed a marked decrease in the
expression of HNK-1 and periphFIGURE 4. Clonally derived BE(2)-C progeny cells retain the capacity to undergo BrdUrd-induced differ- erin, which was accompanied by an

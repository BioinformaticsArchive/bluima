Fig. 1. Clonidine's effect on VTA DA cells. (A) A 20 s bath application of the -2 noradrenergic agonist clonidine (40 M) evokes a slight depolarization
of the membrane potential in VTA DA cells (1.7 0.4 mV, n 10). Concomitant with this event there is a significant decrease in the following
measurements: action potential amplitude, afterhyperpolarization amplitude and, rate of subthreshold depolarization. There is a significant increase
in the interspike interval. (B) Current-clamp response of a VTA DA cell to a family of eight hyperpolarizing dc current pulses of 100 pA each (duration:
1 s, frequency: 1/9 Hz) in the absence and presence of clonidine. The cell was held at 0 pA. Note that all the effects seen above (part A of the figure)
are also seen here. The amplitude of voltage responses under clonidine is increased indicating an augmentation in the cell's input resistance. Voltage
“sag” is also more profound and visibly slowed indicating a shift in the voltage dependence of the underlying Ih. (C) In voltage clamp mode, bath
application of clonidine reduces the difference between the steady state current (Iss) and the instantaneous current (Iinst) at all command potentials
below the holding level ( 55 mV), that is, clonidine inhibits Ih Iss Iinst. In the presence of clonidine the membrane current reaches its steady state
value at a much slower rate. As indicated by part B of the figure, clonidine's effects on Ih, membrane potential and firing frequency follow a similar time
course.

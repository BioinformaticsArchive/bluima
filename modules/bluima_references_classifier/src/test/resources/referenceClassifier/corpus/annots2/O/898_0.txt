Phobias are characterized by recurrent, exaggerated
anxiety responses to particular stimuli or situations.
Such phobic responses include both subjective experiences of anxiety and autonomic manifestations (e.g.,
changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration), as
well as the tendency to avoid the feared object or setting.
Specific phobia (SP) is the most common of these disorders, with a prevalence of approximately 10% in the
general population (Fyer 1998). In SP, selective stimuli or
situations (e.g., small animals, heights, or enclosed spaces)
induce fear and anxiety responses (American Psychiatric
Association 1994). Several other disorders have also been
well described in which a variety of external stimuli
induce anxiety responses. For example, in social anxiety
disorder (SAD; also known as social phobia), social
situations are the symptom-inducing stimulus, whereas in
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety results from
trauma-related stimuli. In certain disorders, internal precipitants might induce anxiety, such as in obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), in which intrusive thoughts
occur that are associated with anxiety and repetitive
behaviors. In panic disorder (PD), the precise precipitant
of anxiety is uncertain; by definition, at least some of the
panic attacks arise spontaneously.
Despite these clinical/phenomenologic differences
among the anxiety disorders, all individuals with these
disorders suffer from either exaggerated fear responses to
relatively innocuous stimuli (e.g., phobias) or spontaneous
fear responses in the absence of a discernable threat (e.g.,
PD). This has led contemporary models of these disorders
to focus on amygdala dysfunction as one potential unifying aspect of their pathophysiology. This tenet was initially based on animal studies that demonstrated a central
role for the amygdala in the conditioned fear response
(LeDoux 1996, 2000). More recently, studies of patients
with lesions and neuroimaging experiments in healthy
subjects have extended these observation to humans,
implicating the amygdala in fear conditioning and the
perception of threat-related stimuli (Adolfs et al 1994,
1995; Anderson and Phelps 2001; Breiter et al 1996a;

Fig. 3. Schematic representation of a new model of organization of the basal ganglia based on novel anatomical,
neurochemical and physiological data. The main findings
imply that GPe and STN display broad projections to more
structures than those predicted by the "direct/indirect'"
model of organization. On the one hand, in the present
model, the striatum and STN are both considered as input
structures for the basal ganglia. They both distribute cortical information, the striatum (from broader cortical areas)
and STN (from more restricted cortical areas) to the same
targets, namely GPe and GPi/SNpr, where they converge
into the same groups of cells. On the other hand, the output
structures (GPi/SNpr) are under the antagonistic effect of
both input stations and a strong GABAergic input from
GPe. Moreover, although it does not appear on the figure,
all the above-mentioned structures are modulated by a
direct dopaminergic projection from the substantia nigra
pars compacta. GPe, external segment of the pallidum; GPi,
internal segment of the pallidum; Pf, parafascicular nucleus
of the thalamus; STR, striatum, STN, subthalamic nucleus:
SNpr, substantia nigra pars reticulata.

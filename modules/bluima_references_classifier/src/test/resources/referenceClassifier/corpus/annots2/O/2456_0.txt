550 gm in transverse extent (Brown et al. 1977 b). It is, therefore, pertinent to enquire
whether this similarity leads to the two elements always being in register in the
transverse plane when the s.c.t. cell's field contains that of the afferent fibre. For none
of the ten pairs was there coincidence between the positions of the axons's arborization
and the cell's dendritic tree; there was always overlap between the two but part of
the bouton-carrying terminal axonal arborization always occupied a region of the
dorsal horn free from dendrites of the cell. In some pairs the major part of the axon's
arborization was well outside the region where the dendrites ramified (as viewed in
transverse sections of the cord; see Fig. 5). In these cases the receptive field of the
afferent fibre was at the periphery of the s.c.t. cell's field (see below).

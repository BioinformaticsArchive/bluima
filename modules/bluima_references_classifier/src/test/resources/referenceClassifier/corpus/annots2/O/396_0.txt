The effects of localized SII cooling on SI responsiveness
were examined first by means of evoked potential recording.
The inactivation of SII was usually achieved when the
temperature at the face of the cooling block fell to 5–10°C
as shown for both the hand and foot areas of SII in Fig. 2.
On rewarming to the 38°C control temperature, the SII
responses usually recovered within 1–2 min (Fig. 2), and the
inactivation procedure could be repeated without evidence
of impairment. In some cases, in particular when the cortical
temperature changes occurred rapidly, the phenomenon of
cortical spreading depression was observed (see Fig. 10 and
DISCUSSION) necessitating a repetition of the inactivation
procedure.
The effectiveness of cooling for reversible SII inactivation
was also confirmed by single neuron recording from SII around
the margin of the cooling block (Fig. 3). As the overlying
cortical temperature fell, the spike responsiveness to skin stimulation was abolished by cooling to 12°C as revealed in the
response traces in Fig. 3A and the plot of response level () in
FIG. 2. Effect of reversible SII cooling on SI responsiveness as assessed by
evoked potential recording. Evoked potentials were recorded simultaneously Fig. 3B. Furthermore, background activity plotted in the botfrom SII (left column) and SI (right column) in response to a tap stimulus tom graph was also abolished by the cooling. When the tem-(arrow, 3 ms, 600 μm) applied to contralateral hand (top traces) and foot perature of the cortex was restored, the responsiveness of the
(bottom traces). Each trace displayed was averaged from 40 successive
SII neuron recovered promptly (Fig. 3, A and B), although
sweeps. The amplitude of SI-evoked potentials appeared unaffected by SII
inactivation (8°C for hand, and 5°C for foot), although there was some there was an episode of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in
prolongation of the response. SII responses recovered fully on rewarming to association with the second rewarming (Fig. 3B).

In the dopamine-depleted striatum, D, receptor activation
produces c-fos induction in striatonigral neurons (Robertson et
al., 1990, 1992). In contrast, c-fos induction in striatopallidal
neurons results from D, receptor bfockade in the normally in-nervated striatum (Dragunow et al., 1990; Robertson et al.,
1992), probably due to release from the presumed tonic inhibition dopamine exerts through the D, receptor on these neurons. Thus, the induction of c-fos appears to reflect an excitatory
response of striatal neurons. After a single high dose of cocaine,
the temporal pattern of striatal c-fos mRNA induction parallels
closely the increased extracellular dopamine levels in the striaturn (e.g., Kuczenski and Segal, 1992) as well as behavioral
activation (e.g., Kalivas and Duly, 1993) with c-fos mRNA,
dopamine levels, and behavioral activation reaching peak levels
by 20-40 min and returning to basal levels by 90 min to 2 hr
after the injection (H. Steiner and C. R. Gerfen, unpublished
observations). Since c-fos levels are very low in the normal
striatum, the induction of c-fos by cocaine treatment therefore
presumably reflects the increase in dopamine activation of D,
receptors on striatonigral neurons.
On the other hand, the present results demonstrate that other
mRNAs, specifically dynorphin, display a temporal pattern of
elevation that is not tightly correlated with c-fos mRNA levels
and therefore not with the level of activation of striatonigral
neurons. It is suggested that such changes in gene regulation,
that appear with a delay and persist beyond the period of direct
drug action, reflect a compensatory response-in the case of
dynorphin in striatonigral neurons, to regulate the responsiveness of those neurons to subsequent dopamine stimulation. This
is supported by the reduction in cocaine-induced c-fos as dy-norphin levels increase over days and by the ability of the dy-norphin agonist to block acute cocaine-induced c-fos expression.
The regional variations in the basal and drug-induced levels
of mRNAs expressed by striatal neurons provide further information about the functional organization of the striatum. First,
as shown here, there are significant differences between striatal
regions in the basal levels of dynorphin and substance P ex-pression. Since the levels of dynorphin and substance P mRNA
are regulated, at least in part, by D, dopamine receptor-mediated mechanisms (Gerfen et al., 1990), regional differences in
basal levels may reflect normal differences in dopamine neurotransmission and/or interactions with other transmitter systems.
Second, the present results-by demonstrating different basal
levels of dynorphin mRNA and a differential influence of co-caine treatment on gene regulation-especially suggest functional differences between dorsal and ventral striatal regions.
The hypothesis presented here, that dynorphin levels reflect a
compensatory mechanism to limit the response of neurons to
dopamine neurotransmission, might lead to the prediction of
greater basal dopamine release in areas with higher basal dy-norphin expression. While this might be the case in some striatal
regions (e.g., patch vs. matrix in the dorsal striatum), the situation is more complex with respect to dorsal-ventral differences.
In fact, a comparison of extracellular dopamine levels between
the dorsal central striatum, which displays low basal dynorphin
expression, and the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, with
high basal dynorphin expression, shows results opposite to the
prediction: higher basal dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum
than in the nucleus accumbens (Kuczenski and Segal, 1992).
However, these regions also differ in the distribution of the
dopamine transporter, which functions to remove dopamine

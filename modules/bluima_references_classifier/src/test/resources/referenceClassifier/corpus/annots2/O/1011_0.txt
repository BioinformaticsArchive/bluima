Experimental Design

In this experiment, we evaluated the effect of tacrolimus to
inhibit or diminish the development of cerebral hyperemia
and raised ICP during barbiturate anesthesia. The PCA rats
were divided into 4 groups. Two groups received a control
infusion of 0.9% saline and 2 groups received ammonia infusion for at least 180 minutes. One group receiving saline and
1 group receiving ammonia infusion also had injections with
tacrolimus. The animals were given tacrolimus as an i.v. injection (0.7 ml) and at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. The drug was
administered through the venous catheter 15 minutes before
ammonia infusion was started. Also 3 additional sham-operated control groups were investigated; 1 group receiving
ammonia infusion and 2 others receiving saline infusion for
approximately 180 minutes. Two groups received vehicle and
1 group received tacrolimus (Table 1).

were incubated in either 0.06 nM (10 ng/ml) TeNT in serum-free culture
medium or in serum-free medium alone for 24 h. Cultures were fixed as
described above and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a mixture of mouse
monoclonal anti-VAMP and affinity-purified rabbit antisynapsin 1a,
each diluted 1:1000 in PBS/normal goat serum. After rinsing, cultures
were incubated for 60 min at 35 °C in a mixture of goat anti-mouse
IgG-fluorescein (1:50) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine (1:100) in
PBS/normal goat serum.
Thin Layer Chromatography—Sphingolipids labeled by incubating
cell cultures in [14C]galactose (2 μCi/ml) for 24 h were isolated and
identified as described by van Echten et al. (33). In brief, after radiolabeling, cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted from the cell
pellet with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol/water/pyridine (60:30:6:1, by
volume) for 48 h at 50 °C. Lipid extracts were desalted by reverse-phase
chromatography on silica gel LiChroprep RP18, applied to silica gel high
performance thin layer chromatography plates, and chromatographed
with chloroform/methanol/aqueous CaCl (0.22%) (60:35:8, by volume).

Ganglioside standards and sample spots were visualized with anisaldehyde spray reagent (Sigma) and quantified by scintillation spectrometry.
Toxin Binding—Fragment C of TeNT or fragment B of cholera toxin
(toxin-binding fragments) each conjugated to HRP (2.5 μg/ml) was
added to control and FB -treated cultures for 30 min at room temper- 1

ature. After rinsing in HBSS, cultures were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in HBSS. Cells were reacted for 15 min with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (0.75 mg/ml in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6)
containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and treated for a few seconds with
0.1% osmium tetroxide to intensify the reaction product. After rinsing
in Tris-HCl, cultures were stored in Tris-buffered saline containing
glycerol for subsequent photography.
Alternatively, tetanus holotoxin (4 μg/ml) was premixed with the
monoclonal antibody 18.2.12.6 (1:2000, 3.75 μg/ml) in HBSS/BSA for 30
min at room temperature (34). Living cultures were incubated for 30
min each at room temperature in toxin-antibody complex followed by
goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine (1:100) with HBSS/BSA
rinses between incubations. Cultures were rinsed, fixed in 2% parafor-

All B6D2 F2 o¡spring were tested for various alcohol-related
phenotypes including locomotor activation and anxiolysis followed by hypothermia and sedation. Mice were ¢rst tested for
ethanol-induced locomotion and anxiolysis using a 5-day procedure. During the procedure, animals were habituated to the
saline injections and activity chambers during the ¢rst 4 days.
On day 5, all animals were injected with 1.8 g/kg ethanol (i.p.)
dissolved in saline (20% v/v). On all days, animals were placed
into the activity chamber 2 min following the injection. Activity
was assessed by an automated photobeam system that includes a
10U12 array of photocells, situated 1 cm o¡ the £oor, surrounding a 21U25U18-cm Plexiglas arena. Activity was
assessed in 5-min intervals for a total of 15 min. The distance
traveled during each block was used as a measure of activity.
For a more detailed analysis, the arena was separated into
60 equal zones, 48 of which were located next to the arena

P<0.0001]. Post hoc test showed that while in rats
pre-exposed to the neutral stimulus (empty box)
DA transmission was stimulated by feeding preferentially in the NAc shell, the reverse applied to rats
pre-exposed to the appetitive stimuls (Fonzies-filled
box).
The present study shows that the responsiveness of
DA transmission to motivational stimuli is critically
dependent upon the specific compartment of the NAc
where DA transmission is monitored. Thus, conditional appetitive stimuli (mainly olfactory) arising
from a Fonzies-filled box stimulate DA transmission

protein synthesis. Both the concentrations of RNA and
the protein synthetic efficiency were improved so that
hypox rats treated with both hormones were better able
to synthesize protein than hypox rats treated with
growth hormone (8) or thyroid hormone (this paper)
alone. Therefore, as anticipated from the studies on the
individual actions of the hormones, they complemented
each other when present together.
As might be predicted from the limited ability of
growth hormone-(8) or T, to stimulate muscle protein
degradation when given individually, only small in-creases in protein degradation were recorded in perfused hem icorpus of hypox rats after tre at ment with the
combined hormones (data not shown 1. The prim ary
effect of these hormones on muscle was via protein
synthetic processes although the possibi .lity tha .t excessive doses of T4 might stimul ate muscle protein Catabolism in hypox rats has not been excluded.
In summary, treatment of hormone- #deficient rats,
thyrex or hypox, with thyroid hormone can stimulate
protein synthesis and protein degradation; however,
stimulation of muscle growth appears to derive from the
action on protein synthesis. The stimulation of protein
synthesis may correlate, in part, with hormonal influences on the efficiency of synthesis, but more detailed
studies are needed to determine specific changes in the
rates of peptide-chain initiation and/or elongation. The
primary action of the hormone in muscle is accounted
for by its regulation of the capacity for protein synthesis. When administration of thyroid hormone was coupled with growth hormone, which had a more marked
effect on synthetic efficiency than capacity (8), greater
stimulation of protein synthesis i.n muscle of hypox rats
resulted than was ach .ieved with ther ho rmone alone.

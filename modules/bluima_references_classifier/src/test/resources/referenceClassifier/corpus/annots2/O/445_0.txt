(3) Explants offorelimb-bud {FLB) and foreUmb-bud
combined with sensory ganglia (FLB/SG)
Fragments of FLB from embryos of stages 21-24 showed marked similarities
in cell types represented, to explants of somite, although cartilage was present
in great amounts even in explants grown from stage 21 embryos. Exposure to
formaldehyde gas after 12 days in vitro revealed no fluorescent cells. Similar fragments when combined with sensory ganglion (FLB/SG) produced fluorescent
cells identical in appearance and distribution to those observed in somite
recombined with sensory ganglia (S/SG) cultures (Fig. 7). Recombinants from
donors of stages 25-26 again did not produce fluorescent cells (Table 1).

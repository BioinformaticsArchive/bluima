NAA is the most enigmatic free amino acid in the
vertebrate brain. Its concentration in the brain is one of
the highest of all free amino acids where, as an osmolyte,
it constitutes ;1% of the dry weight of the brain and
3– 4% of total brain osmolarity. NAA is synthesized
from acetyl-coenzyme A and Asp by NAA synthase
(L-aspartate N-acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.17). Its singularity also includes the following: Within the CNS, NAA
is synthesized primarily, although not exclusively, in
neurons, where it is present in amounts up to 20 mM
representing ;7% of neuron osmolarity and where it
also exhibits a very high intracellular– extracellular gradient. NAA as an entity does not enter into neuronal
protein metabolism or into any other neuronal metabolic
pathways save one. In some neurons, a portion of NAA
is converted into NAAG from NAA and Glu by an
NAAG synthase (N-acetylaspartate-L-glutamate ligase),
an as yet incompletely characterized enzyme (Tyson and
Sutherland, 1998).
Curiously, both NAA and NAAG are synthesized in cells
that for the most part cannot utilize or hydrolyze them. As
is the case for NAA, NAAG is an important osmolyte in
brain where it is present at ;10% of the NAA concentration (Coyle, 1997), a level that is also one of the highest
concentrations for any dipeptide in the brain. Further, neuronal NAA and NAAG are both dynamic in nature and turn
over within days by virtue of their continuous efflux in a
regulated intercompartmental cycling between neurons and
macroglial cells. NAA cycles between neurons and oligodendrocytes, among the only cells that do contain large
amounts of aspartoacylase (N-acyl-L-aspartate amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.15), the major NAA catabolic enzyme in the
brain (Baslow et al., 1999). The NAAG derived from NAA
appears to undergo a cycle similar to NAA, but with the
catabolic enzyme in this case, NAAG peptidase (glutamate
carboxypeptidase; EC 3.4.17.21), present on the surface of
virtually all astrocytes, and absent in cultured oligodendrocytes and microglia (Berger et al., 1999). At present, other
than the genetic aspartoacylase inactivation that results
from the CD mutations, there are no selective inhibitors

1063 or SKF 10,047 was perfused through the dialysis probe. Bars,
mean S.E.M. DA content of the sample collected while perfusing 50 nM
PS and/or 30 M BD 1063 or 100 M SKF 10,047 through the dialysis
probe for 20 min, expressed as percentage of baseline. Statistical analysis
revealed a significant main effect of drug treatment [F(4,28) 3.934, p
0.011]. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant increase in DA levels after
PS and PS BD 1063, indicating that BD 1063 does not block the
PS-induced increase in DA overflow. SKF 10,047 administration into the
striatum through the dialysis probe did not significantly affect extracellular DA levels compared with control. , significant differences from
baseline values (Bonferroni, p 0.03). Number of animals is six to eight

The following monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antisera were used.
CaMKII-α. Anti-CaMKII-α is a well-characterized mouse monoclonal antibody (Erondu and Kennedy, 1985) specific for the α subunit. It
was a gift from Dr. M. B. Kennedy and was also obtained from
Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN).
CaMK II-β. T wo antibodies to C aM K II-β were used. A rat monoclonal
antibody, cB β-1, characterized in Scholz et al. (1988), was a gift from Dr.
H. Schulman. A goat polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide
corresponding to amino acids 521–540 at the C -terminal end of mouse
CaMKII-β was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA).
CaMKII-g. A goat polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 478 – 495 at the C -terminal end of human
CaMKII-g was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
CaMKII-d. A goat polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 515–533 at the C -terminal end of rat
CaMKII-d was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
All antibodies were diluted 1:500, except anti-CaMKII-α which was
diluted 1:1000. Sections were preincubated in 0.05% Triton X-100 and
3% normal serum in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. They were transferred to the
same solution to which the diluted antibody or antiserum had been
added. After 36–48 hr at 4°C, the sections were treated with avidin–
biotin peroxidase kits (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and re-acted in 0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine–tetrahydrochloride plus 0.01%
H2O2 to visualize bound antibodies. Control sections were incubated in
0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing normal serum instead of the
primary antibody and showed no staining above a weak, nonspecific
background. The sections were finally mounted on gelatin-coated slides,
dehydrated, and coverslipped. Adjacent sections were reacted for cytochrome oxidase or mounted and stained with 0.25% thionin.
For double immunocytochemical staining, the indirect immunofluorescent technique was used. To examine potential colocalization of
C aM K II-α and C aM K II-β, sections were incubated simultaneously in
mouse anti-C aM K II-α and rat anti-C aM K II-β at the same concentrations given above, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 3% goat serum,
3% rabbit serum, and 0.24% Triton X-100, for 24 hr at 4°C. After
washing, the sections were incubated in a mixture of 1:100 rhodamineconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and 1:100
fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Vector) in phosphate buffer
containing 3% goat serum, 3% rabbit serum, and 0.25% Triton X-100.
Sections were mounted under coverslips on glass slides in a 1:3 mixture
of 0.1 M phosphate buffer and glycerol. To demonstrate the lack of
colocalization of CaMKII-α or CaMKII-β with GABA, sections were
incubated first for 24 hr at 4°C in a mixture of 1:3000 mouse antiCaMKII-α and 1:5000 rabbit anti-GABA antiserum (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 3% horse serum, 2% bovine
serum albumin, and 0.25% Triton X-100. After washing, sections were
reincubated in a mixture of 1:100 fluorescein-conjugated horse antimouse (Vector) and 1:100 rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
(Chemicon) IgGs in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 3% horse serum,
2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Other sections were
incubated first in a mixture of 1:500 rat anti-CaMKII-β and 1:500 rabbit
anti-GABA, followed by a mixture of 1:100 fluorescein-conjugated
rabbit anti-rat (Vector) and 1:100 rhodamine-conjugated donkey antirabbit (Chemicon) IgGs in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 3% rabbit

1998). Dystrophin is localized mainly in synaptic membranes of the CNS (Lidov et al., 1990) and is absent in
neuronal synapses of DMD patients and of mdx mouse
(Kim et al., 1992), a dystrophin-deficient genetic model of
DMD. Dystrophin is essential for anchoring molecules critical for neuronal functions by acting as adaptors between
the actin cytoskeleton and membrane-bound receptors.
For instance, syntrophin is a component of the dystrophinassociated protein complex and anchors neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (nNOS) (Brenman et al., 1996), which
plays an important role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, and the activity of nNOS is impaired in skeletal
muscle tissues from DMD patients and mdx mice. Therefore, dystrophin plays a critical role in the formation and
maintenance of macromolecular signaling complexes.
These findings prompted us to speculate that neuronal
excitability is impaired in dystrophin-deficient brains, causing cognitive deficits in DMD patients and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. We focused upon the hippocampus be-cause dystrophin is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and mdx mice have exhibited impaired
associative learning, implicating hippocampal dysfunction
(Muntoni et al., 1991). We here report that mdx mice were
found to be more resistant to kainic acid-induced seizures
when compared with control mice, and that the receptor
density for kainic acid, a glutamate agonist at kainate
receptors, was significantly lower in the mdx mice brains.

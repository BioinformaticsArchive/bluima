and normalized to the ratio in WT cortical extract. E, F, Immunoprecipitation (IP) of extracts from cerebral cortical hemispheres from E15.5 dcKO (E) or reeler (F ), and their WT em-bryos with anti-Dab1 antibody followed by blotting with antiphosphotyrosine (pY-Dab1, 4G10) and anti-Dab1 antibodies.
Both the ratio of Dab1 protein itself and the ratio of tyrosine
phosphorylated Dab1 to total Dab1 protein were calculated
and normalized to the ratio in WT cortical extract. G, H, Mouse
embryonic cortical neurons were prepared from WT and dcKO
embryos, cultured, and stimulated with either mock or purified Reelin for 15 min (G) to see stimulation of signaling molecules or for 3 h (H ) to detect degradation of Dab1. Total
protein extract was subjected to IP with anti-Dab1 and antiC3G antibodies to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1
and C3G, respectively. Total protein extract was also subjected
to blotting with antibodies against phospho-Akt (serine 473),
Akt, Crk, CrkL, and phospholipase C 1 (PLCr1) as a loading
control. The arrow in G indicates location of tyrosine phosphorylated C3G. I, Schematic diagram of the role of Crk and
CrkL in the Reelin signaling pathway. We suggest the Reelin
pathway consists of two subroutines, specific subroutine
(Subroutine S) and general subroutine (Subroutine G). Molecules in Subroutine S include the pathway-specific molecules
such as Reelin, Reelin receptors VLDLR and ApoER2, and Dab1,
while Subroutine G consists of common molecules such as Crk,
CrkL, Akt, and Rap1. We suggest that the two subroutines
operate separately, but are coupled to each other by the in-teraction of tyrosine phosphorylated Dab1 (pY-Dab1) with
Crk/CrkL. PI3K, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Rap1, repressor activator protein; rl, reeler.

Fig. 8. Patterns of OX-42 staining. Bar = 50 â€žm. (a) Section through the contralateral ventral horn 3 days after local axotomy.
Ramified microglial cells are evenly spread over the entire ventral horn, showing a relative weak immunostaining. (b) Section
through the ventral part of the ipsilateral ventral horn 3 days after axotomy. Ramified microglial cells are evenly scattered
between motor neurons. In comparison to (a), the intensity of immunostaining is increased. (c) Activated microglial cells within
the area of axotomised motor neurons at 1 d after axotomy. Microglial cells are preferentially activated around the neurons,
indicated by an increased immunostaining with OX-42 . (d) Area of axotomised motor neurons 3 days after axotomy: microglial
cells form a circular mantle around the axotomised motor neurons and the intensity of immunostaining has further increased.

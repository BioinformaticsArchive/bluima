SUMMARY

1. The organization of the visual cortex was studied with a technique
that allows one to determine the physiology and morphology of individual
cells. Micro-electrodes filled with the fluorescent dye Procion yellow were
used to record intracellularly from cells in area 17 of the cat. The visual
receptive field of each neurone was classified as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, and the cell was then stained by the iontophoretic injection of dye.
2. Fifty neurones were successfully examined in this way, and their
structural features were compared to the varieties of cell types seen in Golgi
preparations of area 17. The majority of simple units were stellate cells,
whereas the majority of complex and hypercomplex units were pyramidal
cells. Several neurones belonged to less common morphological types, such
as double bouquet cells. Simple cells were concentrated in layer IV, hypercomplex cells in layer II + III, and complex cells in layers II+III, V
and VI.
3. Electrically inexcitable cells that had high resting potentials but no
impulse activity were stained and identified as glial cells. Glial cells re-sponded to visual stimuli with slow graded depolarizations, and many of
them showed a preference for a stimulus orientation similar to the optimal
orientation for adjacent neurones.
4. The results show that there is a clear, but not absolute correlation
between the major structural and functional classes of cells in the visual
cortex. This approach, linking the physiological properties of a single cell
to a given morphological type, will help in furthering our understanding
of the cerebral cortex.

INTRODUCTION

The complexity of the wiring of the cerebral cortex is obvious to anyone
who examines a Golgi preparation of the brain. That these intricate connexions are made with a high degree of specificity has been evident since
the pioneering work of Cajal (1911). Physiological studies of single

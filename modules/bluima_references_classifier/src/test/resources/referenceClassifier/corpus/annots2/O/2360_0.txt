There are several ways in which the cholinergic neurons of the host brain could
respond to the growth-promoting stimulus of the embryonic hippocampal implants. In
Fig. 7 four different types of axonal growth responses are exemplified. These conform
to possibilities also suggested by previous investigators (see, e.g. reviews in refs. 1 and
8). The first two examples represent classical axonal regeneration from a severed
axonal stump (e.g. in the lesioned fimbria-fornix). In the first example, the lesioned
neuron possesses no axon collaterals. After axotomy the neuron does not undergo
retrograde cell death and is capable of regenerating its axon. The second situation is
similar to the first, but in this case the neuron possesses a sustaining collateral axon
(innervating, for example, the lateral septal nucleus). This collateral is assumed to
prevent retrograde cell death following injury to the main axon. Thus, there would be
an increased possibility of cell survival and of axonal regeneration from the severed
stump. A variant of this is illustrated in the third example. In this situatior~, the injured
collateral undergoes retrograde degeneration or resorption back to its junction with
the uninjured collateral. The latter sprouts a new collateral which reinnervates the
appropriate target. Although, in the strict sense, this process should be considered
axon generation, it does represent regeneration of the original projection. In the fourth
case in Fig. 7 the entire neuron forming the original innervation degenerates following
axotomy. A new, anomalous innervation of the target then arises from neighboring
cells of the same system or from neurons in another projection system with a similar
transmitter content that possess uninjured axons which are located near the target. A
similar type of paraterminal or collateral sprouting has already been demonstrated in
the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway by the work of Lynch, Cotman et al.s,~6,a~.
However, the distances covered by the growing axons in the present experiment are
considerably greater than those observed for paraterminal sprouting or reactive
synaptogenesis of the latter type.

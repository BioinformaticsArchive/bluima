There are two major findings of this study. First,
cerebral vascular responsiveness to an excitatory neurotransmitter is intact despite the reduced metabolic
rate during hypothermia. Dilator responses to NMDA,
which were dose dependent and reversible during hy-pothermia, were virtually identical in magnitude to
responses during normothermia. Second, hypothermia
fails to preserve cerebral vascular responses to NMDA
after ischemia. Therefore, nonspecific suppression of
the brain metabolic rate during ischemia fails to in-hibit the cellular mechanisms responsible for disruption of this neuronally initiated vascular response.
These results suggest that protective effects of hypothermia may not be most apparent in the immediate

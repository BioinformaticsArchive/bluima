Such signs of necrotic cell death were apparent 30 min
after the capsaicin injection (50 mg/kg s.c.) but never
encountered after the ¢rst few days post-treatment
(Jancso¤ et al., 1977 ; Jancso¤ and Kira¤ ly, 1981 ; Sza¤ lla¤ si
and Blumberg, 1999 ; Szoke et al., 2002), and it is likely
that this characteristic, fast neurotoxic response is due to
the action of capsaicin combined with the e¡ects of
asphyxia. In contrast to capsaicin, anandamide never
induced respiratory distress or asphyxia, nor did it elicit
necrotic cell death of B-type neurons. It is worth mentioning that resiniferatoxin, in contrast to capsaicin, does
not evoke the Bezold^Jarish re£ex of apnoe, vasodilatation and bradycardia (Szolcsa¤nyi et al., 1990), nor does it
induce necrotic cell death (Sza¤ lla¤ si and Blumberg, 1999).
Based on the observation that 98% of the VR1-immunopositive neurons also showed CB1 receptor-like immunostaining (Ahluwalia et al., 2000), it has been suggested
that a large subpopulation of nociceptive primary sensory neurons co-express CB1 and VR1 receptors. A-type
cells of the trigeminal ganglia have not been shown to
contain either VR1 or CB1 receptors, although large
neurons in other brain regions displayed CB1 receptors (Hohmann and Herkenham, 2000). The question
whether anandamide alters mitochondria via VR1- or
CB1-receptor activation might be decided using cells
that express only one of these types of receptors. Our
ongoing experiments on VR1 and CB1 knock-out mice
may provide a de¢nitive answer to this question.
High levels of expression of CB1-immunoreactivity have been found in the hippocampal formation
(Egertova¤ and Elphick, 2000). Using a synthetic, radiolabelled cannabinoid, CB receptors were localized in the
CA3 area of Ammon's horn and in the molecular layer
of the dentate gyrus (Herkenham et al., 1991). In addition, a subpopulation of basket cells and another population of interneurons displayed marked immunostaining
for CB1 in all subregions of the hippocampal formation
(Katona et al., 1999; Ha¤jos et al., 2000). Neonatal an-andamide treatment did not cause morphological alterations in any hippocampal neurons, supporting the view
that anandamide causes mitochondrial damage by acting
on VR1 but not CB1 receptors. Although it has been
shown that anandamide can activate VR1 receptors in
hippocampal slices, the majority of these VR1 receptors
appear to be located on axon terminals rather than on
cell bodies (Al-Hayani et al., 2001).
Our unpublished observation has shown that, in many

erably among cells, ranging from ;400 pA to >2800 pA in
different cells. For purposes of statistical analysis and data display, we normalized all data to the magnitude of the inward
current measured 1 min after starting to apply GnRH to the slice;
although the values are not substantially different from those
recorded immediately before the GnRH was applied, this time
point was selected to minimize possible differences caused by
changes in flow rate. To facilitate comparisons, we analyzed data
from 25 cells from 14 different animals from which recordings
were made with C sC l intracellular solution in the recording
pipette and BaC l2 in the bath solution. These analyses included
all cells from which we obtained good recordings, regardless of
their assignment to the categories described above.
In general, the inward current began to increase in magnitude
5â€“10 min after GnRH was first washed onto the slice. Although
the difference in magnitude of the inward current in cells exposed
to GnRH or the control solution is not significant after 5 min of
exposure, by 10 min after GnRH was first applied, the inward
current was significantly larger in responsive cells relative to cells
exposed to the control solution (t(17) = 2.16, p < 0.05). The
inward current typically continued to increase in magnitude over
the first 15 min of GnRH exposure and remained elevated
throughout the duration of GnRH exposure. Nevertheless, we
observed considerable variability in the time course of the re-

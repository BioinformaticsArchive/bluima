phospho-ERK2 as a substrate. Compared with the robust
ERK phosphatase activity in extracts of sham and
ischemia/no reperfusion animals, ERK2-directed phosphatase activity in extracts from animals subjected to ischemia
and a 30 min reperfusion decreased significantly (Fig. 1B, C).
The effects of ischemia/reperfusion on ERK2-directed phosphatases are selective as the phosphatases in cortical ex-tracts that act on the MAPK family member JNK are not
affected (Fig. 1D).

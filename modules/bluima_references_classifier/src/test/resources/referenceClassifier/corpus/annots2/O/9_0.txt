The primers we designed were synthesized and purchased from Life
Technologies (Grand Island, NY). We also synthesized a pair of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers as controls to assess cDNA quality. The nucleic acid compositions for all
primers are listed in Table 1.
Approximately 2 μg aliquots of total RNA were used in cDNA synthesis for each sample. All reagents were purchased from Perkin-Elmer
(Norwalk, CT) except those specified. The cDNA synthesis was performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 1× PCR buffer II, 5 mM MgC l2 ,
1 mM each of dNTPs, 20 U of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 μM oligo-dT16 primer,
and 3 U of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). DNA
contamination was prevented by incubation of the transcripts with DNase
I for 30 min at 37°C followed by heat denaturation of the enzyme for 5
min at 75°C (Huang et al., 1996). After 50 U of Moloney murine
leukemia virus (MuLV) reverse transcriptase were added to each tube,
the reaction proceeded at 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 1 hr, 95°C for 5 min,
and stored at 4°C until used for PCR. Two negative controls were used
in preparation of reverse transcription mixtures to detect any potential
contribution of contaminating genomic DNA or pseudogene product to
the PCR signal. The first negative control contained an isolated RNA
template from the rat brain, but not the MuLV reverse transcriptase. The
second negative control contained all reagents except the RNA template,
which was replaced by nuclease-free water.
Optimal PCR conditions were experimentally determined with modifications from Amoureux et al. (1995). Briefly, reactions were performed
in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1 μl of synthesized cDNA, 1× PCR
buffer II, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each of dNTPs, 1 U of AmpliTaq DNA
polymerase, and 0.5 μM each pair of primers: GAPDH plus MT-I or
GAPDH plus MT-III primers. Each experiment included two negative
controls, as described above. A positive control contained either MT-I or
MT-III, generated by PCR from the rat brain and the mouse MT-I cDNA
(a gift of Dr. Richard D. Palmiter at the University of Washington,
Seattle, WA), then purified by Geneclean kit (BIO 101, La Jolla, CA).
The PCR analysis was amplified 25 cycles for MT-I and 20 cycles for
MT-III with 1 min denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 60°C, and 1
min extension at 72°C. After the last cycle, a final extension was performed at 72°C for 5 min. The reaction tubes were stored at 4°C.
The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis in 1× Tris
acetate for electrophoresis (TAE) buffer with a 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg /ml ethidium bromide. A 100 bp DNA ladder (Promega) was
used as a size marker. The DNA bands were visualized using Eagle Eye
II video-imaging system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) under UV light, then
analyzed using the NIH Image 1.6.0 software on an Apple Power
Macintosh computer. We used a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test for
evaluation of the molecular data. A cutoff of p < 0.05 was used as the
accepted level of significance.
We first confirmed that MT-III mRNA is present in the brain but
absent in liver using our amplification procedure described above. The
mouse brain and liver were homogenized separately, then the brain
homogenate was diluted 2× with the liver homogenate, repeating ten
times to produce a total of 11 combined samples that contained the brain
homogenate decreasing from 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.781,
0.391, 0.195, and 0%, respectively. The eleven combined samples were
individually processed for RNA isolation. Two micrograms of total RNA
were taken from each of the combined homogenates, then synthesized
for cDNA. Two microliters of cDNA was used to amplify MT-III for 20
PCR cycles. The density of bands resulting from these eleven samples
were quantified as described above and plotted.

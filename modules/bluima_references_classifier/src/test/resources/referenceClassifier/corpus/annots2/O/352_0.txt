viral infection may influence its susceptibility. These
results suggest that E2 levels in plasma may have a role in
CNS susceptibility to PRV. Together these results support
our initial hypothesis that plasma E2 levels affect susceptibility to viral infection in intact female rats.
This is the first report of a relationship between the
estrous cycle and resistance to CNS infection, but three
previous reports indicate sex differences in responses to
viral infections, two of which affect the CNS [2,41]. While
all three reports indicate that females have an increased
ability to fight off infections, two of the reports indicated
that females had improved cellular immunity (pro-inflammatory) response and the third report indicated that
females had a better humoral immunity response. In the
case of vesicular stomatitis virus, female mice had a lower
viral titer in CNS homogenates than males [2]. The
enhanced recovery by females correlated with higher levels
of expression of nitric oxide synthase types I, II and III;
increased prevalence of reactive astrocytes and earlier and
enhanced levels of major histocompatibility complex class
II cells; and increased T cell infiltration. In a mouse
myocarditis model, female mice were much less susceptible to coxsackievirus B3 infection than males [24] and
the underlying mechanism may have been a differential
response by the lymphocytes. Males have a Th-1 cell
phenotypic response and subsequent increases in IL-2,
IFN-g, and lymphotoxin. On the other hand, females have
a Th-2 cell phenotypic response which is indicated by
increases in IL-4, Il-5, IL-6, IL-10, and transforming
growth factor β. Treating males with E2 prior to infection
alters the subsequent Th subset differentiation and abrogates the development of myocarditis; conversely, treating
a female with testosterone leads to myocarditis [24].
Muller et al. studied the development of fatal T cellassociated lymphocytic choriomeningitis in infected β2-microglobin knockout mice [41]. They found that females
developed more severe problems and had a higher incidence of death than males. These reactions could be
mimicked in castrated males given female sex hormones.
Differences between male and female in T helper cell
responses appear to underlie the gender gap (see review
[67]). In our laboratory, we have found a sex difference in
the number of infected neurons in the CNS after kidney
infection (a full report is in preparation), in addition to the
estrous cycle-related differences in viral susceptibility
reported here. In summary, three reports discussed above
indicate that females have an increased ability to fight off
infections compared to males. Two of those reports
indicate that the sex difference may be due to an enhanced
pro-inflammatory response in females. Whether the proinflammatory response varies throughout the estrous cycle
is unknown.
A second mechanism that may underlie the phenomenon
is E2 modulating either the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) or the sympathoadrenal stress axes. In the sympathoadrenal axis, female rats exhibit higher basal [15] and

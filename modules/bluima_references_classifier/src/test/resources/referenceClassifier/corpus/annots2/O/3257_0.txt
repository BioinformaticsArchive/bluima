postejaculatory interval (PEI) and (2) reveal that LHA 5-HT can
A

inhibit both basal and female-elicited DA release in the NAcc.
These findings suggest that the neural circuit promoting sexual
quiescence during the PEI includes serotonergic input to the
LHA , which in turn inhibits DA release in the NAcc. These
A

findings may also provide insights concerning the inhibitory
control of other motivated behaviors activated by the NAcc and
may have relevance for understanding the sexual side efects
common to antidepressant medications.

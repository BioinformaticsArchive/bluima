Western Blotting
Cultured cells harvested on 20 DIV were sonicated in
20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM EGTA, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium
-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, and 1 g/ml of various protease inhibitors ([p-amidinophenyl]methanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin,
antipain, and benzamidine), followed by mixing at a volume
ratio of 4:1 in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8; containing 10%
glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 5%
2-mercaptoethanol) and subsequent boiling at 100Â°C for
10 min. Each 20- g protein aliquot was loaded on a 7.5%
polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis at a constant current of
15 mA/plate for 2 hr at room temperature and subsequent
blotting to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane treated
previously with 100% methanol. After blocking with 5% skim
milk dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5; containing
137 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20), the membrane was
reacted with an antibody against MAP2 or GFAP diluted 1.0
104 or 5.0 104 times with buffer containing 1% skim milk,
followed by reaction with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase. Proteins reactive with those
antibodies were detected with ECL detection reagents through
exposure to X-ray films.

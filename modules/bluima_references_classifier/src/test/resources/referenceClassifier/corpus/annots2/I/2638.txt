kDa (1). Some of the observed small proteins may be products
of the many small open reading frames interspersed between
known genes in the regions already sequenced. The latest T4
map (10, 12) also includes a total of 84 otherwise unidentified
open reading frames, coding for potential proteins of 5 to 45
kDa, all transcribed in the typical "early" direction; most of
these include appropriate control signals. It should be possible
to gradually correlate them with proteins observed on gels by
combining such data as their predicted size and migration on
pH gradient gels, timing of synthesis, control patterns predicted from the sequence, and elimination by one of the known
deletions. This, in turn, can help predict their functions, since
T4 proteins tend to cluster into groups with related functions,
with regard to both genetic locus and control patterns.
It is hoped that the data presented here will further encourage others to use the powerful two-dimensional gel technique
to analyze the proteins with which they are working. The
methods we have used are relatively simple and inexpensive.
We would also appreciate data on any additional proteins that
have been identified, to help complete a compendium of T4
protein data as we have been doing with T4 gene-mapping and
restriction mapping data (10-12) and the integrated T4 se-quence bank (available on disk).

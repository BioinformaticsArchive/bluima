posterior thirds of the intraparietal sulcus, and in the superior
parietal lobule.

Evoked hemodynamic responses
The following section characterizes the evoked hemodynamic
responses of some relevant areas. The experimental design al-lowed us to distinguish the percentage adjusted BOLD signal
associated with the IC, the DP, or the TC (Fig. 1). IC - and
DP-related activities were further subdivided according to the
task contingencies in two categories each (ICGo, ICNogo, DPGo,
DPNogo). TC-related activities were subdivided into four categories, according to the combination of instruction and trigger cues
(TCGoGo, TCGoNogo, TCNogoGo, TCNogoNogo).

Figure 3E illustrates the EHRs for a local maximum in lobule
HV/HVI of the cerebellar cortex. This anatomical region showed
a specific sustained response during the delay period after a “Go”
instruction cue (in green). The specificity of the former response

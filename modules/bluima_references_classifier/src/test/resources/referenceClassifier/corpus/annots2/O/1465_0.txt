RESULTS

Detection of Phosphorylated Kv3.1b Potassium Channels Using a Ser-503 Phospho-specific Antibody—Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were performed to evaluate the specificity of the anti-phosphoSer-503 Kv3.1b antibody that was used throughout this study. CHO
cells were stably transfected with the wild-type Kv3.1b gene or with
S503A mutant Kv3.1b, in which this PKC phosphorylation site is
mutated. As described previously (15), no detectable basal immunostaining was observed in Kv3.1b-CHO cells until treatment with PMA
(500 nM), an activator of PKC (Fig. 1A). Moreover, no immunoreactivity
was detected after treatment with PMA in cells transfected with the
S503A mutant Kv3.1b or with the Kv3.1a splice variant, both of which
lack the Ser-503 phosphorylation site. Negative control experiments in
which the primary antibody was either omitted or pre-adsorbed with
the antigen peptide also revealed no immunostaining in PMA-treated
Kv3.1b-CHO cells. In contrast, incubation of the primary antibody with
a heterologous peptide did not affect the immunostaining in PMAtreated Kv3.1b-CHO cells (Fig. 1A).
In contrast to the Kv3.1b-transfected CHO cells, profuse immunostaining was seen on the membrane of MNTB principal neurons in adult
rats using the phospho-specific Kv3.1b antibody, even in the absence of
pharmacological activation of PKC. This immunolabeling represented
specific staining of Kv3.1b phosphorylated at Ser-503 because it was
blocked by preincubating the primary antibody with the antigenic peptide but not with the heterologous peptide (Fig. 1B).
Immunoblots of denatured protein extracts were carried out in transfected CHO cells. Consistent with previous studies using antibodies
against other regions of the Kv3.1b protein (2, 24), a protein band of
100 kDa was detected in extracts from Kv3.1b-CHO cells using the
phospho-specific Kv3.1b antibody pre-absorbed with the heterologous
peptide (Fig. 1C). This band was absent when the immunoblots were
treated with antibody that was pre-adsorbed with the antigenic peptide
or when the cells were treated with Me SO, the vehicle for PMA treat- 2

ment. Moreover, no band was detected in PMA-treated CHO cells that
had been transfected with the S503A mutant Kv3.1b gene. Therefore,
this antibody recognized Kv3.1b channels only when the channels were
phosphorylated by PKC at Ser-503.

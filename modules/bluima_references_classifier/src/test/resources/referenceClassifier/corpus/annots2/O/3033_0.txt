CASE REPORT
Two male cousins, MC and MM, live in the same household
and therefore share the same socioeconomic background and
home environment. They have been raised by the same parents
(great-aunt and uncle) and have biological mothers who are sisters
with similar home, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds.
MC was exposed to lead at the age of 24 to 48 months, when he
spent time with his biological mother at his grandmother's home,
although he continued to spend most of his time at his great-aunt's
home, where lead was not present. MM tested negative for blood

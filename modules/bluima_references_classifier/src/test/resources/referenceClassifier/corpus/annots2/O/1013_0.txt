Retinal Progenitors Compared With Brain
Progenitors by RT-PCR
Retina-derived populations (Fig. 2) expressed the
nuclear transcription factors Hes1 and Hes5, both associated with the neurodevelopmentally regulated Notch
pathway. Comparison of retina- and brain-derived cultures (Fig. 3) revealed that both populations expressed the
neurodevelopmental markers doublecortin (DCX), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), nestin, and nu-cleostemin, whereas Pax6 was seen only in RNA extracted
from retinal populations. Additional genes expressed by
both retinal and brain cultures included Sox2 and glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), whereas other genes ex-pressed by retinal cultures alone included the eye specification genes Dach1, Six3, and Six6, as well as the retinal
marker recoverin (Fig. 3). All RT-PCR results pertain to
case SC30, whereas the positive results for DCX, EGF-R,
GFAP, nestin, nucleostemin, and recoverin also apply to
pooled RNA from cases SC22 and SC23.

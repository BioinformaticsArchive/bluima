Figure 2. Axial proton-density-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging section of the brain of a healthy 10.3-year-old boy
showing location of single proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) voxel sampled in the left inferior
anterior cingulate cortex (top left). 1H-MR spectrum obtained in
sampled voxel after postprocessing, featuring major peaks for
N-acetyl compounds (NAA), choline compounds (Cho), and
creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr; top right). Same for boy with
autism from Figure 1 (bottom). Note diminished Cho and Cr
intensities relative to NAA.

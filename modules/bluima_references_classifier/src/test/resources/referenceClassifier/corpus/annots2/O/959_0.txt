matter remained unaffected. The locomotor function in
control injured rats was mildly involved (scores 15–16 on
the BBB scale). It has been shown that lesions of the
ventrolateral funiculus but not of the dorsal funiculus
produce severe locomotion deficits, resulting in poor
scores in the open field test (Schut et al., 2002). As a result
of the increased sparing of lateral funiculi induced by cell
grafts, the transplanted groups had moderate but significantly improved neurological outcome.
In contrast, the amplitude of MEPs and SSEPs was
markedly higher in OEC- and SC-transplanted groups
than in the medium-injected group. The use of electrophysiological techniques allows detection of functional
differences between spinal cord-injured groups that may
be masked in gross neurological evaluations of locomotor
behavior (Loy et al., 2002; Garc ́ıa-Al ́ıas et al., 2003).
Supramaximal transcranial stimulation produces depolarization of cortical and brainstem motor neurons, which
propagate the impulse along the spinal cord to synapse and
depolarize lumbar motoneurons (Konrad et al., 1990).
Injuries of the spinal cord compromise the preservation of
MEPs, mainly when the lateral funiculi are lesioned (Ad-amson et al., 1989). The maintenance of MEPs in OECand SC-grafted groups is thus attributable to the greater
sparing of the lateral funiculi in these animals compared
with DM animals. On the other hand, the low-intensity
stimuli applied to the tibial nerve to evoke the SSEPs
produce excitation of large, myelinated afferent fibers,
which correspond mainly to the dorsal column spinal
pathway (Fehlings et al., 1988). However, other afferent
spinal tracts are involved, mainly the spinocerebellar tracts,
which run along the dorsal and middle aspect of the lateral
funiculi (York, 1985). The presence of SSEPs in all our
injured groups is suggestive of multiple spinal pathways
contributing to the recorded signals. Again, the different
preservation of dorsolateral funiculi would explain the
maintenance of SSEPs after injury with amplitudes that
were significantly higher in the OEC and SC groups than
in the DM group. The amplitude values of MEPs and
SSEPs remained without noticeable changes in group DM
during follow-up, whereas they increased slightly from 14
dpo to later tests in grafted groups. This could be due to
regeneration of a population of injured axons spanning the
lesion site or to remyelination of demyelinated axons by
the grafted glial cells.
After spinal cord injury, the facilitation of spinal
reflexes leads to the development of hyperreflexia. This
phenomenon is electrophysiologically detected by an in-crease of the H/M ratio. The increase of reflex excitability
is due to the interruption of descending input from su-praspinal nuclei, leading to diminished presynaptic inhibition of Ia muscle afferents by spinal interneurons (Calancie
et al., 1993) and to changes in motoneuron excitability
(Chen et al., 2000). The three experimental groups presented a high H/M ratio because of an increase in the H
reflex wave amplitude at early stages of follow-up. The
ratio tended to return to normal values with time in the
two grafted groups, more in the OEC group than in the

that of progressive supranuclear palsy.5 Therefore, it
seems unlikely that the dorsiflexion of the neck can be
explained by lesions of the basal ganglia alone. In
progressive supranuclear palsy patients who exhibited
dorsiflexion of the neck, pneumoencephalogram and
computed axial tomography (CT) have shown atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum,6 7 suggesting that
lesions of the midbrain tegmentum may be involved
in rigidity and dorsiflexion of the neck.8 9
The interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), located in
the tegmentum of the rostral midbrain is a cell group
lateral to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus adjacent to
the periaqueductal grey. It has been found that bilateral INC lesions in cats cause dorsiflexion of the
neck.'0 However, the behavioural deficits of such cats
were not examined in detail in the previous studies.'0
In the present experiments, we have made further
observations on behavioural deficits produced by
bilateral INC lesions in cats to examine whether INC
lesions contribute to the characteristic neck posture of
progressive supranuclear palsy patients, and have
tried to correlate these studies with clinical and
pathological data, including our case of progressive
supranuclear palsy.
The INC areas have also been shown to participate
in vertical eye movements." -'1 We report that INC
lesioned cats also show impairment of vertical eye
movement characteristic to progressive supranuclear
palsy patients. Part of our case report and results
of animal experiments were presented earlier
briefly.71415

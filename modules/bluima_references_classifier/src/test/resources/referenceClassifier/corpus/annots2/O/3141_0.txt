Spermatogenesis
Active spermatogenesis was observed in 33 6 3% and
31 6 3% of the seminiferous tubules of the sham control
SCE and SCI-SCE rats 3 days after the surgery (Fig. 2, A
and B). These results demonstrate that the testes of these
animals were indeed SCE. By 2 wk after SCI, abnormalities
in spermatogenesis, including delayed spermiation (Fig.
2C) and vacuolization of spermatid nuclei (Fig. 2D), were
seen in the remaining spermatogenic cells. By the end of
the fourth week, abnormalities in spermatogenesis similar
to those that we have reported previously [1, 3] were common in SCI-SCE rats.
Three months after the surgery, active spermatogenesis
was observed in 46 6 4% of the tubules in sham control
SCE rats (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, while the seminiferous
epithelium was regressing and abnormalities including
sloughing of germ cells and failure of normal spermiation
were apparent (Fig. 3, B and C), active spermatogenesis

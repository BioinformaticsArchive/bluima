DISCUSSION
Our results showed that an abnormal linear high intensity
area indicating LF degeneration is usually observed along the
medial margin of the GPi on MRI in MJD patients; this
finding was not observed in control subjects. Our results are
supported by the fact that on pathological examination severe
LF degeneration is usually observed in the MJD brain.2 To our
knowledge this MRI finding has not previously been
described.
The abnormal signal probably indicates LF degeneration
but could also be due to the degeneration of other fibre
systems whose topographical distribution partly overlaps that
of the LF. There are two candidates for this possibility
because the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra are
usually involved1–3 8 in MJD. The first is the subthalamic
fasciculus9–11 which is the main outflow of the subthalamic
nucleus to the globus pallidus. The second is the dopaminergic mesostriatal fibres which run along the LF,12 but we
have never observed this abnormal signal in Parkinson's
disease patients. On the other hand, the abnormal signal may
not be specific for MJD because it probably indicates LF
degeneration.
Our results show that the signal is observed in most MJD
patients from the early to the end stages of the disease, but
may not be present at the very beginning, because the signal
was observed only unilaterally in a patient (patient 16) 1 year
after the onset of the disease. This result is similar to a
radiological report demonstrating that atrophy of the globus
pallidus was observed only in patients with an MJD duration
of 10 years or longer.13 In addition, the unilateral presentation 16 years after onset of the disease in a patient (patient 2)
whose CAG expansion was very small compared to our other
patients, suggests that the presentation of the abnormal
signal depends on the size of the CAG expansion in the MJD1
gene. This result accords with the fact that the clinical course
and the degree of brainstem and cerebellar atrophy in MJD
patients are closely correlated with the size of CAG expansion
in the MJD1 gene.14–17
No specific correlation was confirmed between the
presence of the signal and clinical symptoms. But it is
interesting that no rigidity was observed in 13 of our 16
patients. Considering that the substantia nigra of MJD
patients is usually severely degenerated,15 and that nigral
degeneration results in parkinsonism, it seems likely that
MJD patients would usually show parkinsonism. But

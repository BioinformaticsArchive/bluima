carcinoma cells.41 Since c-Fos and Jun have been
shown to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis,18
cell diVerentiation40 and neuronal plasticity,9,42 it
is conceivable that the neurotrophic activity of
PACAP38 on immature granule cells could be as-cribed to the activation of oncogenes. Further investigations are required to determine the transduction
pathways mediating the eVect of PACAP on granule
cell survival and neurite outgrowth.

tion, selected areas were photographed, trimmed, reembedded in araldite, and resectioned at 1 Î¼m. These
semithin sections were rephotographed and resectioned in ultrathin sections. The ultrathin sections
were examined in a Jeol electron microscope, without
heavy metal staining to avoid artifactual precipitates.

RESULTS
We ultrastructurally studied a total of 33 AT-8-positive pretangle neurons and 37 neurons with immunopositive intracellular NFT. Of these, 26 pretangle
neurons and 24 neurons with NFT belonged to
aged nondemented brains, and the rest to AD brains.
Since no differences in either pretangle neurons, or
neurons with early or mature NFT, were detected
between aged nondemented and AD brains, the following description of ultrastructural characteristics ap-plies to all of the brains studied.

Pretangle Neurons
At light microscopy, diffuse AT-8 immunoreactivity
was observed in the soma and proximal dendrites of
pretangle neurons. In addition, some pretangle neurons presented areas of intense immunoreactivity, usually surrounding the nuclear envelope and sometimes
forming clumps (Fig. 1, inset). Ultrastructurally,
pretangle neurons presented light nuclei with small
clumps of heterochromatin and a large nucleolus
(Fig. 1A). In the cytoplasm, small Golgi dictiosomes
close to the nuclear envelope were visible, as well as
small mitochondria and numerous ribosomes (Fig. 1B).
The cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum were very
frequently dilated, forming vacuoles of variable morphology which were partially studded with ribosomes (Fig.
1A,B). Local dilatations of the nuclear envelope were
also evident. In addition to the diffuse cytoplasmic
immunostaining, more intense immunoreactivity was
observed surrounding the nuclear envelope and in focal
accumulations, but not inside definite organelles
(Fig. 1B). Lipofuscin was present in varying amounts in
most pretangle neurons. Because of its high electron
density it was difficult to ascertain if this lipofuscin was
immunolabeled or not, although in some cases immunolabeled material appeared closely associated with it
(Fig. 1A). At high magnifications, some pretangle neurons showed a few short immunolabeled filaments,
located either in the apical dendrite or somewhere in
the soma (Fig. 2A,B). When these short filaments were
isolated, the typical helicity of PHF was not clearly
distinguishable. Granulo-vacuolar degeneration colocalized with immunoreactive material in some pretangle
neurons from the CA1 hippocampal sector (not shown).
Early Tangles
At light microscopy, neurons with early neurofibrillary degeneration showed, in addition to diffuse immunostaining of the neuronal soma and proximal dendrites, delicate but strongly immunopositive fibrillar
stripes. Ultrastructurally, these neuronal bodies presented all the above-described characteristics of
pretangle neurons plus a few groups of intensely immunopositive PHF (Fig. 2C). These groups of AT-8-positive
PHF were always associated with focal areas of more
intense immunoreactivity and dilated cisternae of the
endoplasmic reticulum, and sometimes they were adja-

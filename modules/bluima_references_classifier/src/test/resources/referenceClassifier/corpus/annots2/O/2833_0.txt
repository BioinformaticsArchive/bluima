tral nucleus of amygdala and the lateral septum contained
high levels of dopaminergic terminals (Bjo Ìˆrklund and Lindvall, 1984). There was no prominent change of TH-IR terminals even in the SIB(+) group in all these areas (data not
shown). Similar to these immunocytochemical data, the do-pamine content by HPLC analysis did not show any significant difference among the three experimental conditions (ta-ble 1).
No apparent differences in the immunoreactive intensity
or the number of TH-IR neurons in the hypothalamus, such
as the arcuate nucleus (A12), zona incerta (A13), periventricular area (A14) and posterior hypothalamic area (A11)
were observed among control, SIB(-) and SIB(+) (for A13, see
fig. 3, A-C). Similarly, dense TH-IR terminals in the median
eminence were detected in SIB(-) and SIB(+) as in control

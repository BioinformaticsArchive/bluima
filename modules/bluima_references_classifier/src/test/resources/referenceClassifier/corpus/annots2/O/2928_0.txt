manent structural alterations in a variety of regions
of the adult rat brain including hippocampal formation.7,8,61 It is suggested that administration of
this neurotoxin results in an intense continuous
seizure activity in limbic pathways followed by a
neuronal loss in CA1â€“CA3 subfields and the hilus of
the dentate gyrus, which is accompanied by sprouting
and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fibre pathways. The major synaptic target of the mossy fibre
sprouting is the inner third of the dentate molecular
layer, which is apparently denervated by seizureinduced damage to hilar mossy cells.7,8,42,48,62 These
structural alterations induced by kainic acid have

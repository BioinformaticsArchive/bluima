Fig. 3. The ATP-evoked increase in EPSC frequency did not require
action potential conduction but required calcium entry. A, Representative
recording of mEPSCs recorded in the presence of TTX (0.5–1 μM, upper
trace) and then in the presence of TTX plus ATP (1 mM, lower trace). B,
Cumulative probability plot for the cell in A, showing interevent intervals
for mEPSCs in control (solid line) and then in the presence of ATP (1 mM,
broken line). C, Data from seven neurons showing that ATP could elevate
the frequency of mEPSCs; the data from the same cells are also shown in
D, where ATP caused no change in the amplitude of mEPSCs. E, Representative recordings of mEPSCs in the presence of TTX and cadmium
(100 μM, upper trace) and then in the presence of TTX, cadmium and ATP
(1 mM, lower trace). F, Cumulative probability plot for the cell in E
showing interevent intervals for mEPSCs in control (solid line) and then
in the presence of ATP (1 mM, broken line); note that the two distributions
overlie each other. G, ATP did not elevate the frequency of mEPSCs in the
presence of cadmium (n = 6). Data from the same cells are also shown in
H, where ATP caused no change in the amplitude of mEPSCs in the
presence of cadmium. In these experiments, TTX and cadmium were
allowed to superfuse the slice for 10 –20 min before application of ATP.

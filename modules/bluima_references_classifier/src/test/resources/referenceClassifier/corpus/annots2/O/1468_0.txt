Immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization techniques

E18 and postnatal animals were perfused transcardially with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4.
Brains were cryoprotected in PB–sucrose 30% and frozen in dry
ice for immunohistochemistry studies. For in situ hybridization
studies, the cryoprotection buffer was PB 0.1 M– 4%-PFA, 30%
sucrose. Serial coronal sections of 50 m (for P0, P5, P7, P9) or
30 m (for P15, P21 and adult) of a total of 27 mice were cut with
a cryostat and stored at 20 °C in a 40% PB 0.1 M, 30% glycerol
and 30% ethylene glycol buffer.

Total RNA isolation and real time reverse
transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) analysis

Twenty-four mice were decapitated and the brains were extracted
and kept at 80 °C until use. The brains were extracted and
sonicated with a blender in RNAase free lysis buffer (Applied
Biosystems, Barcelona, Spain). Samples were kept for 1 h at 4 °C.

Cell culture

Human oligodendroglial cell line MO3.13 was obtained from Eu-cell Bank (Barcelona, Spain) by permission of Dr. Niels Hellings
(Buntinx et al., 2003). The cells were grown in wells in a Laboratory-Tek II Chamber slide system (Nunc, Barcelona, Spain) in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 g/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at
37 °C. MO3.13 cells grown under these conditions show immunoreactivity for the oligodendrocyte markers: myelin-specific lipids
galactosylceramide, 2=,3=-cyclic nucleotide 3=-phospodiesterase
and myelin basic protein (MBP) (Buntinx et al., 2003).

Western blot

Fifty micrograms of total protein from each sample was boiled
(under reducing conditions) at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were
separated on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel (run at constant voltage, 125 mV for 1–2 h) and electrophoretically transferred (at 200 mV for 4 h) to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences, Barcelona,
Spain). After several washes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, Tris–
HCl 50 mM, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), the membrane was incubated
with a rabbit anti-DDR1 antibody (Abdulhussein et al., 2004) in
TBS– 0.05% BSA– 0.02%-sodium azide at 4 °C overnight. On the
following day, membranes were washed with TBST (0.05% Triton
X-100 in TBS buffer) and TBS with 3% non-fat milk. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit IgG (dilution 1:2000) (Dako, Barcelona, Spain) using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL
Plus, Amersham Biosciences). As a positive control, human em-bryonic kidney (HEK) cells transiently transfected with DDR1b
were used (Alves et al., 2001).

In situ hybridization

Riboprobe preparation. A 1.2 kb fragment from a full length
mouse DDR1 cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK (kindly provided
by Dr M. E. Hatten, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA)
was used to make sense and antisense probes. The antisense
riboprobe for mDDR1 was generated by linearization of this plasmid with HindIII and subsequent incubation with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Madrid, Spain). The sense riboprobe was prepared
by cutting with XbaI and transcribing with T3 RNA polymerase.
The in vitro transcription was performed using Megascript kit
T7/T3 (Ambion, Inc.) and the probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain).

the ventricle, the so-called ependymal zone (ez) (Bayer
and Altman, 1991). BrdU-positive cells were also diffusely scattered in the intermediate zone. These observations are consistent with previous studies of the
developing rat neocortex with [3H] thymidine (Bayer
and Altman, 1991).

Developmental Changes in Distribution
of GABAergic Cells
The distribution of GABAergic cells was examined
using GABA immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization with [35S]-labeled oligonucleutide probes against
GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs. GABA immunostaining
showed marked changes in the distribution patterns of
GABA-positive cells in the neocortex from E17 to E20.
At E17, a prominent band of GABA-immunoreactive
cells was seen in the sv and inner iz (Fig. 1). Labeled
cells were mostly biopolar and oriented parallel to the
ventricular margin. Occasional GABA-labeled cells were
observed in the vz (arrow, Fig. 3). In contrast, a striking
feature at E20 was the presence of abundant GABAimmunoreactive fibers and a few bodies within the vz,

Probes
To prepare erbB riboprobes labeled with 32P-UTP (for RNase protection
assay) or 35S-UTP (for hybridization histochemistry), we used DNA
templates corresponding to sequences contained in the coding region of
each erbB mRNA. An erbB-2 DNA template was prepared by cloning a
BamHI 422 bp fragment of a rat erbB-2 cDNA (Bargmann et al., 1986a)

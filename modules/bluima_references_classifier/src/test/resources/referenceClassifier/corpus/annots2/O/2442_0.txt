DE-AFFERENTATION OF S.C.T. NEURONES 601
(intracellularly stained sample; the extracellularly recorded neurones were found at
similar depths). All of the s.c.t. neurones were isolated by antidromic stimulation from
the upper cervical cord and not by the presence of resting discharges or receptive
fields. In these respects the present sample differs from all others in which the effects
of dorsal rhizotomies (or peripheral nerve section) on dorsal horn neurones have
been studied.
Basbaum & Wall (1976) recorded cells of the 'lamina 4' type at the L4 5 junction
region of cats with S1 spared dorsal roots after sectioning roots L4 7, S2 and more
caudally. The neurones were recorded extracellularly and were isolated by their
resting discharges and responses to mechanical stimulation of the skin. According to
their Figs. 6 and 7, some of the recording sites were in laminae V and VI. Similarly,
Mendell et al. (1978) recorded cells in cats with L5-S1 dorsal roots sectioned and
isolated them either by their resting activity (extracellular recording) or responses
to dorsal column stimulation (intracellular recording). Devor & Wall (1978, 1981)
recorded extracellular units of the 'lamina 4 and 5' type in cats with the sciatic and
saphenous nerves sectioned 28 to 105 days previously. These units were presumably
isolated by similar means.
Pubols & Goldberger (1980) recorded dorsal horn neurones extracellularly in the
L6 segment of cats with either L6 or L6 and L7 dorsal roots spared. Units were isolated
in response to mechanical stimulation of the skin. Pubols & Brenowitz (1981, 1982)
used either L6 spared-root animals or cats in which the L6 dorsal root had been cut.
Dorsal horn neurones were isolated by similar methods to those used by Pubols &
Goldberger (1980).
In all of the above studies the samples of dorsal horn neurones were indiscriminate
in the sense that no attempts were made to identify the neurones in terms of their
axonal projections. The dorsal horn is a complex neuropil (see Brown, 1981) and
within any one cytoarchitectonic lamina there is a wide variety of neuronal types,
e.g. neurones of the s.c.t., the post-synaptic dorsal column system, short axoned
excitatory and inhibitory interneurones. Although it seems unlikely that neurones
in lamina I and lamina II were recorded the samples certainly contained neurones
in laminae III, IV, V and probably VI. Furthermore, in all of the above studies any
neurones with no resting activity and no input from the skin would have been
overlooked. All the samples were, therefore, biassed against finding neurones that had
lost their input and not acquired any more. In other words, the bias was towards
finding neurones with some remaining input (which might previously have been
ineffective).
In our sample we examined all isolated s.c.t. neurones. Only if either antidromic
invasion fails after de-afferentation or certain classes of s.c.t. cells become unrecordable
would our sample be unrepresentative. We believe these possibilities to be unlikely
as the recorded sample included s.c.t. neurones with antidromic conduction velocities
throughout the normal range and with appropriate locations in the dorsal horn.
In the present sample of s.c.t. neurones located by intracellular staining there is
an under-representation of cells in the medial parts of the dorsal horn and a slight
under-representation in the most lateral parts. It seems highly unlikely that the lack
of medially placed neurones affects our results to any great extent. Neurones in the
medial quarter of the dorsal horn tend to have small receptive fields and in segments

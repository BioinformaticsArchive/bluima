INTRODUCTION

Factors affecting the growth of peripheral neurites in vivo have been studied
by Harrison (1910) and Spiedel (1932, 1935). Constant reference to these two
classical papers on amphibians confirms their stature and the general lack of
information on the initial stages of growth of nerve pathways in whole embryos.
This contrasts with a wealth of information on cultured neurons (reviewed
recently by Johnston & Wessells, (1980)). We have used the scanning electron
microscope to study the first establishment of innervation fields in Xenopus
laevis embryos (Davies, Kitson & Roberts, in preparation; Taylor & Roberts,
in preparation). In this paper we examine the growth of the network, or plexus
of neurites formed on the inside surface of trunk skin by Rohon-Beard and
extramedullary cells (Harrison, 1910; Hughes, 1957; Roberts & Hayes, 1977).
While most of Spiedel's observations were on regenerating neurites in the tails
of older tadpoles, our results concern the first establishment of sensory innefvation of the trunk skin by unmyelinated neurites. We have been concerned

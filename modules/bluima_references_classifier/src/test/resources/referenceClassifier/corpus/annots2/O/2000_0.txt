Fig. 2. Cdk5rap2an/an mice show reduced neuronal number and thinner superficial layers but preserved cortical layer organization.
(A)μCdk5Rap2 mutant mice show preserved cortical layer organization, although each layer is far thinner than normal. P0 wild-type (+/+) and
mutant (an/an) littermates are shown. Coronal sections stained with Tbr1 antisera, which labels deep layer VI neurons (green), and with Ctip2
antisera, which labels layer V neurons (red), show the preservation of cortical layer organization in the mutant. The marginal zone (MZ) and IZ are
also shown. (B,C)μDeeper cortical layer markers show the overall reduction in cortical thickness in the an/an mutant. (B)μTbr1, layer VI; (C) Foxp1,
layers III-V. (D,E)μSuperficial cortical layers are reduced in the Cdk5Rap2an/an brain. P0 wild-type (+/+) and mutant (an/an) littermate coronal sections
stained with antisera against (D) Brn1 (layers II-III) and (E) Cux1 (layers II-IV). In B-E the brackets correspond to wild type and highlight the
differences between mutant and control animals. (F)μThe density of superficial and deeper neuronal layers. The density of layers II-III was calculated
as the ratio of Brn1-positive cells to total CP nuclei counted per section (the mean percentage is shown). The Brn1 density (red bars) in wild-type
(n6 animals, 486 cells counted/section) and mutant (n7 animals, 417 cells counted/section) animals is significantly different; **, P7.4 10–10.
The corresponding increase in the density of deep neuronal layer VI is shown. The percentage of Tbr1-positive cells (green bars) among total CP
nuclei is moderately increased in the mutant (n5 animals, 431 cells counted/section) as compared with control littermates (n6 animals, 544 cells
counted/section); *, P1.3 10–4. Sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) to label nuclei. Error bars indicate s.e.m. Scale bars:
50μμm.

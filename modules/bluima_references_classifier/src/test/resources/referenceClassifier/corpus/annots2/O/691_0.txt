Dmt is 2 ,6 -dimethyltyrosine), was 36 times more potent than
morphine in antinociceptive tests after subcutaneous administration in mice (Zhao et al., 2002). [Dmt1]DALDA has a molecular weight of 640 and carries a 3 net charge at physiological
pH, thus making it a highly polar molecule and rather unlikely
to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, repeated subcutaneous administration of [Dmt1]DALDA led to supraspinal and
spinal tolerance, and binding studies revealed a 30% reduction
in [Dmt1]DALDA binding sites in both brain and spinal cord
(Zhao et al., 2002). These findings suggest significant distribution of [Dmt1]DALDA to the brain and spinal cord after subcutaneous administration.
The distribution of substances across a continuous cell
layer may proceed via transcellular or paracellular pathways. The transcellular route is highly unlikely for oligopeptides, and previous studies with met-enkephalin analogs
have shown that that they are primarily transported via the
paracellular route, and their permeability across a cell layer

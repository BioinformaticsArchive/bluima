Figure 6. Bar graphs showing the density of GR-ir cells in the dorsal LA across varying levels of CORT manipulation. Number of labeled cells,
exclusively cytoplasmic, and exclusively nuclear staining patterns were distinguished. In all regions examined in all CORT treatment groups, the ADX
group demonstrated essentially no detectable GR-ir levels. A, A count of the number of GR-labeled cells demonstrated a significant difference in the
ADX condition, with no differences among the remaining conditions. B, Counting cells with only cytoplasmic staining, the intact and low-C ORT
conditions contain the same number of cells, and these groups are significantly higher than the 5 mg of C ORT group and approaching significance in
the 10 mg of C ORT group. C, Counting cells with only nuclear staining, the high-C ORT groups are now significantly higher than the intact and
low-C ORT group.

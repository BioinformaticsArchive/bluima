DISCUSSION
Recently, solvent abuse became an important public health
problem particularly among school-aged children. Inhalation of
toluene-based products such as glue or spray paint is popular
with solvent sniffers because of the euphoric effect and easy
accessibility of these substances. The neurotoxicity of toluene
in humans has been discussed for many years, and the brain
seems to be the main target organ for toluene toxicity (I). The
mechanism of the toluene neurotoxicity is not clearly under
stood; however, toluene is known to enter the blood rapidly
through the respiratory tract, and asymptomatic levels are
reached within approximately 60 min ( /5). Toluene has a high
lipid solubility and no protein binding capability and distributes
according to lipid contents of the brain (รยก6). By the results,
toluene may cause progressive multifocal impairments. Pancerebellar dysfunction, pyramidal tract abnormality, personality
changes, emotional instability, paranoid psychosis, cognitive
impairment and frank dementia have been attributed to toluene
abuse (1-4,7). Persistent neurologic abnormality has been seen
in spite of variable degree of spontaneous recovery within
months after the cessation of toluene inhalation (3).
Previous investigations using CT combined with gross nec
ropsy findings have described diffuse cortical atrophy in tolu
ene inhalant abusers (3,17). In addition, MRI of toluene abuse
has been reported to show poor differentiation of gray and white
matter, increased periventricular signal intensity and moderate
hypointensity of thalami and basal ganglia on T2-weighted
images (4-7,10-14). Our case, unlike other studies, showed no
structural abnormality on MRI. SPECT findings depicted mul
tifocal cerebral cortical and basal ganglia and thalamic perfu
sion impairments. Only a few reports dealing with perfusion

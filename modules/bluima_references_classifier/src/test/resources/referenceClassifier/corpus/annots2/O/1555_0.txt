Figure 4. fMRI data. Significant responses during successful recognition of faces encoded in
emotional context, modulated by the pupillary size recorded at encoding. A, Locus ceruleus,
displayed on the mean structural MR image, normalized to the same stereotactic space. B,
Parameter estimates of the responses in the LC, modulated by the pupillary size observed at
encoding (arbitrary units SD).

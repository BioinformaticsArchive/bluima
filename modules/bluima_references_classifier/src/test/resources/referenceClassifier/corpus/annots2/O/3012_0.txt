INTRODUCTION

Primary central nervous system tumors are common childhood neoplasms, accounting for 9â€“20% of all malignancies in the pediatric group. Astrocytomas and primitive
neuroectodermal tumors are the most frequent histologic
subtypes.
Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a generic
term for diverse neoplasms having in common, in addition
to a postulated derivation from primitive neuroepithelial
precursors, a peak incidence in the early years of life and
an aggressive clinical biology. PNETs account for about
20% of pediatric primary central nervous system (CNS)
neoplasms [1]. Most of the cells of these tumors are small,
anaplastic, and undifferentiated.
Cytogenetic studies of these tumors have shown isochromosome 17q as the most common structural abnormality
[2, 3], with loss of one copy of 17p. Restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses of this area have

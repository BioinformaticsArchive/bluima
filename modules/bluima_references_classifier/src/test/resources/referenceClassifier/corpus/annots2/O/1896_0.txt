Discussion
We sought to determine whether ROS participate in the increase
in CBF induced by NMDA receptor activation, and to identify the
source and signaling mechanisms responsible for the ROS production. One of the main functions of the NMDA receptor is
synaptic plasticity, a phenomenon thought to underlie learning
and memory (Lau and Zukin, 2007). Both NO and ROS are in-volved in synaptic plasticity, but whereas the sources of NO are
relatively well defined (Garthwaite, 2008), the sources of ROS
remain controversial (Kishida and Klann, 2007). Recent data in
NOX2-null mice have implicated NADPH oxidase-derived ROS
(Kishida et al., 2006), but functional evidence linking NMDA
receptor activity to NOX2-dependent ROS production was lacking. Furthermore, the signaling pathway and the ultrastructural
bases for NOX2-dependent ROS production during NMDA re-ceptor activation remained unclear. Our findings fill several
knowledge gaps in the mechanisms by which NMDA receptors
trigger ROS production. First, the data provide direct evidence
that NOX2 is the major source of ROS during activation of
NMDA receptors. Second, they demonstrate that nNOS-derived
NO is the signaling molecule linking NMDA receptors to NOX2dependent ROS production. Third, they demonstrate that the
association between NMDA and nNOS via PSD95 is required for
the ROS production, pointing to the involvement of synaptic
NMDA receptors and excluding NMDA receptors on nonneuronal cells (Stys and Lipton, 2007). Fourth, they demonstrate
that nNOS and NOX2 are colocalized with the NMDA receptor
subunit NR1 at postsynaptic sites, providing the ultrastructural
bases for their interaction. Fifth, they demonstrate that NO leads
to NOX2 activation via cGMP and PKG, the same signaling pathway that mediates the hemodynamic effects of NMDA. Sixth,
they suggest that in the setting of NMDA receptor activation NO
and ROS may not act by distinct signaling mechanisms, but that
NO is upstream of ROS in the same signaling pathway. These
novel observations provide a more complete understanding of
the mechanisms by which NMDA receptor activation leads to
ROS production.

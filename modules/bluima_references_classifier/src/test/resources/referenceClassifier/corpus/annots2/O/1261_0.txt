Fig. 1. D1-like receptor antagonist (SCH23390) exposure does not alter baseline EPSC amplitude. The baseline EPSC amplitude remained generally unchanged as
the test pulse frequency changed from 0.5 Hz to 0.067 Hz during layer III (A and B) or layer V (C and D) synaptic stimulation. Application of D1-like antagonist
(SCH23390, 1 lm) did not change the baseline EPSC amplitude.

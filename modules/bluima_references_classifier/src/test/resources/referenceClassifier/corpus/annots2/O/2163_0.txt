Synaptic potentials
Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic po-tentials (EPSPs) were observed in most neurons, and a PSP was invariably evoked by
stimulation of the solitary tract. Maximally
evoked PSPsusually led to the generation of
one or more action potentials (Fig. 3A). Synaptic potentials were examined in isolation at
potentials held hyperpolarized to prevent ac-tion potential generation. The presence of a
slow depolarizing responsein somecells suggested that intrinsic currents might be activated by subthresholdsynaptic depolarizations
(27,28,40,54). This possibility wasexamined
in five cells by comparing the effect of membrane polarization on maximally evoked PSPs
and step depolarizations of similar amplitude
and rise time 5-10 ms (Fig. 3, B and C). The
amplitude of responsesto short duration current injections did not vary significantly at po-tentials in a range > 10 mV hyperpolarized
from the threshold for action potential generation. In addition, the amplitude of maximal
PSPsdid not increase with depolarization in
this range as might be expected if an inward
current was activated.
Two tests were usedto determine whether

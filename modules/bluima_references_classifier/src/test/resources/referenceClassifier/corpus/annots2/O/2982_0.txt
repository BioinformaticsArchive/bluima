and AMPA-induced current densities display a significant increase with age, as well as a small decrease
in aYnity for the receptor. NMDA-mediated
currents are maintained during late ageing and
display a general trend towards an increase with age.
The increase in AMPA-induced currents during
ageing may be a compensatory increase in response
to counteract a denervation of synaptic pathways and
may mediate neurotoxicity associated with some age-

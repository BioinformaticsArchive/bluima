METHODS
All experiments were performed in Sprague-Dawley
rats (250-350 g). Preliminary experiments were carried
out in rats anesthetized with urethan (1.25 g/kg ip.).
Single-barrel glass micropipettes pulled to a 40- to 60-pm tip were stereotaxically implanted into the locus
coeruleus and used to administer arginine vasopressin.
The following coordinates were used: -1.7 mm posterior
to the ear bar, 1.1 mm lateral to the midline, and -7.1
mm ventral to the cortical surface (12). Two to five days
prior to acute experimentation rats received a femoral
arterial catheter for measurement of arterial pressure
and a jugular venous catheter for peripheral drug administration.
The remaining experiments were carried out in conscious, restrained rats. Two to five days prior to acute

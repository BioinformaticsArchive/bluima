in modulation of important neuralfunctions suchasthermoregulation, sleep,neurohormonerelease,and nociception (for
reviews, seeDavies et al., 1984;Barkai and Bazan, 1989;Ito et
al., 1989; Shimizu and Wolfe, 1990; Hayaishi, 1991). Recent
studieshavedemonstratedthat PGD, isalsosynthesizedin the
PNS,especiallyinthedorsalrootganglia(DRG)andtoalesser
extent in the sciatic nerve of chickens(Vesin and Droz, 1991;
Vesin et al., 1991). In DRG, the existenceof PGD synthasein
DRG neuronscouldbeindirectly surmisedsincePGD synthesis
occursin chick embryo DRG at an early developmental stage
when DRG contain mostly maturing neurons(Vesin and Droz,
1991).Furthermore,neuron-enrichedDRGcellculturesmore
actively metabolize arachidonateinto PGD, than non-neuronal
cell cultures suchas Schwanncells (Vesin et al., 1991).Thus,
DRGneuronsarethemostimportant,butnotthesole,source
of PGD,. In fact the problem of the cellular origin of PGD, is
more complicated since DRG neuronsare composedof two
main classesl:arge and light A neuronsand small and dark B
neurons.Both classesare subdivided into two subclassebsased
on ultrastructural and immunocytochemical criteria (Philippe
andDroz,1988).Peripheralglialcellsarealsoseparatedinto
two distinct groups:satellitecellsandSchwanncells(Pannese,
1974). The situation is even rendered more complex because
PGD, is synthesizedby at leastthree distinct enzymes(Ujihara
et al., 1988a):(1) PGD synthaseof the “spleen” type, a GSHrequiring enzyme (Christ-Hazelhof and Nugteren, 1979;Urade
et al., 1987a),presentin spleen,thymus, bonemarrow, intestine,
skin, and stomach(Uji&ua et al, 1988~;Urade et al., 1989b,
1990a);(2) PGD synthaseof the “brain” type, a GSH-independentenzyme(Uradeetal.,1985)presentinbrain,spinalcord,
and epididymis (Urade et al., 1987b, 1989a, 1993);and (3) the
great variety of GSH S-transferasesthat convert PGH, into
various PGs including PGD, (Ujihara et al., 1988b).
In order to specify and localize the type of PGD synthase(s)
in chick DRG, we undertook immunocytochemical detection
of PGD synthasesby usingrabbit IgG raisedagainstPGD synthaseof the rat brain or the rat spleentype. The resultsclarify
the presenceof thesetwo PGD synthaseisozymesin distinct
populations of chick DRG cells: (1) the “spleen” type of the
enzymeconfinedtoparticularsatellitecellssurroundinglarge
A neuronsand to Schwanncellsencompassingthe initial segment of the axon, and(2) the “brain” type of the enzymelocated
in small B primary sensoryneurons and particularly concentrated in the B, neurons,the latter of which rarely coexpress

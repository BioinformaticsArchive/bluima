FIG. 4. Histograms of step distances on the ladder task for an inactivated
(A, X2) and noninfused control (B, C2). In X2, the forelimb contralateral to the
infusion showed a broader distribution and a greater average step distance than
the ipsilateral forelimb. Trials in which the limb slipped off the ladder rung are
shown in light gray, whereas trials without slips are shown in dark gray. In the
control cat, the step distributions were symmetrical for the right and left
forelimbs. Inset: placement of the forepaw on a ladder rung. Double arrow
indicates the step distance measure that we used for the analysis in this figure
and the analyses in Figs. 4 and 5.

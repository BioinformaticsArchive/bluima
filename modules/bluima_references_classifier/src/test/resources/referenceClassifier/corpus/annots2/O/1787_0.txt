Testing was conducted during the morning, approximately 2 h
after the lights were turned on. Rats were briefly handled by the
experimenter for 2 days prior to locomotor testing. On the test day
rats were transferred to an adjacent unfamiliar room and immediately placed in the activity cages where locomotor activity was
recorded for 1 h. To monitor locomotion, rats were placed in
translucent Plexiglas® cages identical to the home cages
(40 20.5 20.5 cm) with a metal grid floor placed above sawdust
bedding. Cages were arranged in racks flanked by two parallel
rows of photo-beam cells to track both horizontal displacement
and rearing. All movements were processed by a central computer
connected to a device using the Ratmove® software (MBNI-University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Because these measures lie upon a continuum of responses following a normal distribution, rats were assigned to the HR group if the locomotor
activity score was at least 1 S.D. above the mean locomotor
activity score for each randomly selected subject sample or the LR
for 1 S.D. below (Rosario and Abercrombie, 1999). As a result, the
HR and LR groups of rats were defined as those exhibiting locomotor scores in the upper and lower thirds of the population,
respectively.

Hypothalamus

Fig. 3. Contour plots of heat production (continuous lines) and respiratory
evaporative heat loss (interrupted lines) during combined thermal stimulation of hypothalamus and spinal cord at three levels of air temperature (T.).
The contour lines connect all combinations of stimuli which resulted in
equal rates (W/kg) of heat production and heat loss respectively. Animal
G 103, 363 perfusion periods.

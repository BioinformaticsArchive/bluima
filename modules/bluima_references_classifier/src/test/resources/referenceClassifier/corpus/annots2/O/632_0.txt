a dense innervation of the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca
(MSDB) in the rat (de Lecea et al., 1998; Peyron et al., 1998;
Nambu et al., 1999) and in other species (Galas et al., 2001). The
MSDB, via its cholinergic and GABAergic projections to the
hippocampus, controls the hippocampal theta rhythm and associated learning and memory functions that occur during exploratory behavior and REM sleep (Vanderwolf, 1969; Winson,
1976). Pronounced hippocampal theta activity similar to that seen
in REM sleep also occurs during cataplectic attacks in canine
narcoleptics (Kushida et al., 1985; Wu et al., 1999).
Neurons of the MSDB express the Hcrt-R2 but not the Hcrt-R1
mRNA (Trivedi et al., 1998); a disruption of the Hcrt-R2 gene
underlies canine narcolepsy (Lin et al., 1999). Intense axonal
degeneration of unidentified fibers has been suggested in the
MSDB of canine narcoleptics and in patients with symptomatic
narcolepsy (Siegel et al., 1999).
In a recent study, a complete loss of hippocampal theta, during
both wakef ulness and REM sleep, was found to occur after
lesioning of Hcrt receptor-bearing neurons of the MSDB but not
after selective lesioning of MSDB cholinergic neurons, suggesting
that Hcrt receptors may be present on the noncholinergic (presumably, GABAergic) neurons of the MSDB (Gerashchenko et
al., 2001a). Inf usion of Hcrt into the medial septum has also been
reported to increase behavioral, electroencephalographic, and
electromyographic indices of arousal (Espana et al., 2001). Thus,
Hcrt inputs to the basal forebrain may be important for the

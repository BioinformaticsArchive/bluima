Fig. 6. Graphs showing the mean and S.E. of AVP mRNA grain density in (A) and the number of neurones expressing AVP mRNA in the parvocellular
subdivision of the PVN of virgin, late pregnant, and lactating female rats (n=7â€“8 rats per group). The AVP mRNA response to stress remains preserved
during these stress hyporesponsive periods. Stress effect: *P<0.05, ***P<0.001; State effect: @P<0.05.

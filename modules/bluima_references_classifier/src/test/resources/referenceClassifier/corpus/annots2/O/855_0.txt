Introduction
Dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum plays a central role in a
variety of motor and cognitive activities. Abnormal striatal DAergic transmission is involved in several neuropsychiatric diseases,
such as parkinsonism, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (Berke
and Hyman, 2000; Lewis and Lieberman, 2000; Obeso et al.,
2000). Endogenous DA, released from midbrain DA neurons,
modulates striatal function by interacting with DA receptors.
Among the various subtypes of DA receptors, the D1-like family
has been involved in the regulation of motor activity and in the
expression of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of D1-like receptors reduces spontaneous motor activity (Meyer et al.,
1993; Vallone et al., 2000) and prevents both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) (Calabresi et al.,
1992a, 2000; Centonze et al., 2001; Kerr and Wickens, 2001). To
date, however, it is still unknown which member of the D1-like

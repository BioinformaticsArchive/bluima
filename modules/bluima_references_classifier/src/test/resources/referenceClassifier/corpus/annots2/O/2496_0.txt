Retrograde and orthograde labelling with hor8eradish peroxidase
In order to determine whether foreign segments projected to muscles that had had either part
or all of their motoneuronal pool removed by the spinal cord deletion, horseradish peroxidase
(HRP, Sigma Type VI) was injected into selected limb muscles between St. 30-36, according
to previously published procedures (Landmesser, 1978a). Cords were processed histologically as
described earlier (Landmesser, 1978a), sectioned transversely at 10 ,sm and counterstained with
cresyl violet. The distribution of labelled motoneurones in the remaining cord was determined
in eighteen embryos by counting each section under oil immersion at a total magnification of
790x.
All somas containing granular HRP reaction product were counted and no correction was
made for double counting. However in the iliofibularis series (Table 2) the mean soma diameter
was determined for both control and experimental motoneurone pools and was found not to
differ. Therefore any correction factor would apply equally to both and should not have affected
the determination. Data are presented in histograms as number of labelled cells per 30 1am
length of cord. Often as a control procedure, a muscle whose motoneurone pool should not have
been affected by the deletion (usually the caudilioflexorius) was injected in the contralateral
limb.
The mean number of motoneurones (labelled and unlabelled) per section in LS7 was also
calculated for each embryo listed in Table 2 by making motoneurone counts in five alternate
sections at the beginning of the segment. These values were then combined to yield a mean
figure for controls and one for the partial cord deletions.
To determine projection patterns prior to cleavage of individual muscles (Romer, 1927) parts
of the ventral muscle mass in five embryos were injected at St. 27, according to previously
described procedures (Landmesser, 1978b). In all cases, the first four LS segments had been
removed, depriving the adductor of its entire motoneuronal pool. Therefore, the adductor region
of the muscle mass was injected in one limb. The caudilioflexorius region was injected in the
contralateral limb because this muscle's motoneurone pool lying in LS 7 and 8 should not have
been affected by the deletion. At this stage absolute counts of labelled cells are quite variable
among embryos in which similar injections have been attempted. This finding is most likely due
to differences in the size of the injection and difficulty in distinguishing cell boundaries while
counting. These counts none the less give a reasonable quantitative estimate of the segmental
distribution in a single embryo, and allow one to determine if a given segment contributes
innervation to a certain region or not.
Orthograde labelling was carried out to assess projection patterns prior to St. 30. This allowed
us to define the earliest projection patterns, prior to the stage at which motoneurones ramify
extensively within the muscle masses and can therefore be detected with the retrograde technique (St. 27). Ten per cent HRP in Tyrode solution was injected with micropipettes into the
ventral quadrant of specific lumbosacral segments in isolated spinal cord-hind limb preparations
at St. 23-30. This resulted in diffuse staining of a large number of motoneurones, which were
confined to one or two segments. Their diffusely stained axons could then be traced, following
histological processing similar to that described above, through the plexus and into the muscle
masses of the limb. In general preparations were sectioned transversely to the long axis of the
limb and camera lucida reconstructions were made of the plexus and main nerve branches, to
determine the course of both labelled and unlabelled axons into the limb.

anticipated, glial cells rapidly incorporated labeled DHA as
indicated by a statistically significant increase in total radiolabel associated with cellular stores (p 0.05, n 3). Radioactivity associated with cellular stores increased from 35 8%
at t 30 min to 51 3% at t 60 min and 61 4% at t 90
min post addition of [1-14C]DHA (n 3) indicating that cellular
uptake of labeled DHA was time-dependent. Because glial cells
are involved in host defense and inflammation in neural tissues, we exposed them to the microbial product, zymosan A, as
well as a non-selective stimulus for cellular calcium (calcium
ionophore, A23187) to test whether they were agonists for the
formation of novel docosanoids from cellular DHA stores. Activation of glial cells induced a statistically significant release
(p 0.05, n 4) of cell-associated label as well as formation of
the novel docosanoids. Results in Fig. 3A indicated release of
4.1 1.1% of total cellular DHA following exposure to zymosan A and 5.6 2.4% with calcium ionophore when directly
compared with glial cells that were exposed to vehicle alone
(1.6 0.6%). Reversed-phase-HPLC radioprofiles demonstrated that zymosan A challenge of glial cells released several
distinct 1-14C-labeled compounds from cellular DHA stores (see
inset of Fig. 3A). In addition to distinct docosanoids that carried
radioactivity in the profile there was also label associated with
material that corresponded to the retention time of native DHA
that accounted for 74 6% (n 3) of the total released
radioactivity. Exposure of human glial cell to either zymosan A
or calcium ionophore gave agonist-dependent and selective loss
of [1-14C]DHA from phosphatidylethanolamine that ranged
from 13 to 28% and from 3 to 22%, respectively (see Fig. 3A and
“Experimental Procedures”).
To identify the endogenous docosanoids formed from cellular
stores of DHA in human glial cells, we analyzed the released
DHA-derived products by LC-PDA-MS-MS based lipidomics (as
in Fig. 1). Again, activation of glial cells with either calcium
ionophore (Fig. 3B) or zymosan A stimulated the formation (not
shown) of novel 17-lipoxygenation product 10,17S-diHDHA as
well as its -oxidation product 10,17S,22-triHDHA (note that
both were also produced in blood; see Fig. 1). The structure of
the -22 product was determined by analysis (at m/z 375) of the
MS-MS spectrum (Fig. 3C). The material beneath the peaks
corresponded to 10,17S-docosatriene and 17S-HDHA (not
shown) and gave MS-MS and UV spectra essentially identical
to the 17S-oxygenation products of DHA that were detected
with human whole blood (see 10,17S-docosatriene in Fig. 1B).
Of the theoretically possible multiple isomers, only one major
peak eluted 10,17S-docosatriene produced by glial cells (see
“Experimental Procedures”). The -22-hydroxy-4,17-diHDHA
was also formed as shown in the LC-MS selective ion chromatogram at m/z 375 (Fig. 3C). This structure was consistent with
the MS-MS (at m/z 375) and prominent ions of diagnostic value
at m/z 216 (260-CO2-H), 236 (273–2H2O-H), 247 (303-3H2O-2H), 272 (290-H2O), 273, 293 (M-H-2H2O-CO2-2H), 300 (344CO2), 303, 313 (M-H-H2O-CO2), 337 (M-H-2H2O-2H), 345
(344 H), 357 (M-H-H2O), and 375 (M-H) together with the UV
spectrum ( max 238 nm, Fig. 3C, inset). The formation of -22-hydroxy-4,17-diHDHA suggests conversion of 17S-H(p)DHA by
a 5-lipoxygenase-like mechanism that can oxygenate DHA at
the carbon 4 position as shown for DHA to give 7S- or 4S-HDHA (41, 42). Hence, with 17S-H(p)DHA as substrate, this
LO-like reaction can generate 4S,17S-diHDHA that is subsequently -oxidized at carbon 22.
To assess the potential pathways involved in the formation of
these new compounds, human glial cells were exposed to exogenous DHA in the presence of calcium ionophore. Lipidomicbased analysis using LC-PDA-MS-MS as shown in Fig. 4
yielded products consistent with the presence of 15-LO, 12-LO,

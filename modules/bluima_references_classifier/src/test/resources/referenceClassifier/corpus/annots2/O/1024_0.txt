Histological procedures

Following the completion of testing, rats were deeply anesthetized
and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Brains were
removed, blocked, sectioned on a vibrating microtome (Vibratome
Series 1500) and sections were mounted on subbed slides. Sections were then defatted in 50% chloroform/50% ethanol (2 1 h)
and rehydrated and stained with 0.25% Thionin, coverslipped with
DPX, cleaned with Citrisolv and subsequently examined under a
light microscope to verify cannula placement. Photomicrographs
of relevant injection sites were captured using a Nikon microscope
connected to a Spot RT camera system, digitized and prepared for
presentation using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.

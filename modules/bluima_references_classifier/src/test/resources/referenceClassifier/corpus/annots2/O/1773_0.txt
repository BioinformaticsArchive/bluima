Chronic wasting disease (CWD) (Williams and Young, 1980) is an endemic
prion disease of free-ranging deer (Odocoileus spp.) and wapiti (Cervus elaphus

1997; Miller et al., 2000). Chronic wasting
disease occurs naturally in both deer and
wapiti, but it has not been reported to
occur naturally in other North American
cervid species. Because of their close
taxonomic relationship and similarities in
DNA sequences of the prion protein (PrP)

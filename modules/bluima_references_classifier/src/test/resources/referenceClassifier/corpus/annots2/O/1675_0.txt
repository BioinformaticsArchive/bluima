Hippocampal ACh release depends on the
conditioning procedure
To show the differential recruitment of the hippocampal cholinergic system in fear conditioning as a function of the informative
value of the CS, we compared the time course of the ACh release
in the hippocampus between two conditioning procedures (i.e.,
CS–US pairing and CS–US unpairing) using in vivo
microdialysis.
Basal extracellular levels of ACh (raw values) measured before
acquisition (first four samples) were similar between the two
groups (F(1,9) 0.499, p 0.05) and did not vary significantly
across time (F(3,27) 1.76, p 0.05). The statistical analysis
conducted on percentage from baseline revealed that conditioning induced an increase in ACh release (F(6,54) 14.81, p
0.0001) that lasted for 30 min after conditioning (Fig. 1A). This
increase was significantly higher in the unpaired group than in
the paired group (time conditioning, F(6,54) 2.51, p 0.032).
Specifically, during the first 30 min after conditioning, ACh levels
were higher in the unpairing compared with the pairing condition (F(1,9) 5.78, p 0.039). The same analysis conducted on
absolute, rather than relative, values (Fig. 1 B) also confirmed this
conditioning effect (F(1,9) 8.48, p 0.017).
It is important to note that the use of neostigmine in the
perfusate can hardly explain the differential training-dependent
ACh release observed. First, previous studies have shown that,
although the ACh levels increased with neostigmine concentra-

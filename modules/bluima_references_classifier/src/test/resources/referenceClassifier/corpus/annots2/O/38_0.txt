Influx of 109Cd into Testis, Epididymis, and Brain
To characterize the nature of cadmium transport, multipletime regression analysis was conducted from 1 to 60 min
after injection of 109Cd and I-alb. The doses of cadmium were
less than 1.0 Î¼mol CdCl2/kg, well below the threshold for the
acute hemorrhagic reaction that occurs in the testes. I-alb
was used to verify that the 109Cd treatment did not alter the
permeability and integrity of the vascular barrier.
Cadmium transport in the testis (Fig. 1), epididymis (Fig.
2), and brain (Fig. 3) was significantly greater (P < .0001) in
sensitive 129/J mice than resistant A/J mice, as shown by
differences in Ki. No significant entry of I-alb into the tissues
occurred during this time period, and albumin entry rates
were not significantly different between strains in any tissue
(Table 1).

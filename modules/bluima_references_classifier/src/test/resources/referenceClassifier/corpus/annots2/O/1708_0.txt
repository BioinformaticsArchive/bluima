This table shows the numbers of endosomes identified in cell bodies of the lamina IIIâ€“IV NK1 receptor-immunoreactive neurons. Naive animals received no electrical stimulation, and results from the two sides of the spinal cords of these
animals were pooled. All other groups were stimulated at A strength on the ipsilateral side, except for the C control group, which were stimulated at C fiber strength on the ipsilateral side. For additional details, see Materials and Methods.
Cells with 20 endosomes were defined as internalized. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's pairwise comparisons showed that the difference between the ipsilateral side of the C control group and all other sides/groups was significant
(p 0.001), whereas no difference was detected between other sides or groups.

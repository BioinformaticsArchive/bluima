FIG. 8. Detection of tubulin-binding proteins by West-Western
DL-Glycerol-3-phosphate
analysis. A, BS20 (lane 1, 20 μg), p46 (lane 2, 0.5 μg), SeV particles
1 mM 0.32
(lane 3, 6 μg), and tubulin (lane 4, 0.5 μg) were resolved by electro- 2 mM 0.32
phoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, pro- 3 mM 0.29
teins on the gel were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane, followed by staining with Amido Black. Positions of viral proteins (NP, P,
F , and HN) and marker proteins are shown on the right. B, after the
1

pretreatment of the membrane without (lanes 1– 4) or with (lanes 5– 8)
tubulin (50 μg/ml), tubulin remaining on the membrane was detected
by using an anti-chicken brain β-tubulin monoclonal antibody. Closed
and open arrowheads indicate the positions of tubulin-binding proteins
(p52 and p27) in BS20 (lane 5) and p46 (lane 6), respectively.

6. In conclusion, excitatory amino acids appear to mediate red
nucleus burst discharge. We postulate that non-NMDA receptors
may be particularly important in the initiation of bursting. An
initial depolarization mediated in this manner might then lead to
the expression of known NMDA actions that serve to sustain the
burst. Activation of negative slope conductance and slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials might produce sustained activity in
individual neurons and in the recurrent loops comprising the cerebellorubral circuit. It is further postulated that Purkinje cell inhibition regulates activity in the cerebellorubral circuit, thus shaping
motor programs destined for spinal motor centers.

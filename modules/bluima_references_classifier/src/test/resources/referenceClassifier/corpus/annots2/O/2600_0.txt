Fig. 7. Neural ensemble oscillating responses in bat inferior colliculus with phase shift dependent on
interaural delay. Top left: spectrogram of emitted call of bat Eptesicus. Top right: diagram of stimulus
delivery system. The bat's sonar emissions were picked at microphones (m), digitally delayed and then
returned to the bat from loudspeakers (s) as echoes. Bottom: responses to emission and echo (6 ms between
emission and echo) recorded from small groups of neurons in the inferior colliculus with glass
micropipettes with impedance of 5-10 Ma. Each trace represents an average response (n = x) to the
emission-echo stimulus, at a particular interaural difference in presentation of the echo, with the delay
indicated in microseconds. Note the systematic phase shift, in milliseconds, as the interaural delay is
increased, in microseconds. After Haresign ef af.`9

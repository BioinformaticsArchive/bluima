fected with AXOR12 and Gqi5 were challenged with a large
library of more than 1500 putative ligands, and responses were
measured in a microtiter plate-based (fluorometric imaging
plate reader) calcium mobilization assay. We observed that
specific responses were elicited by two neuropeptides originally
isolated from the sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima (an-tho-RW-amide I (17) and antho-RW-amide II (18)), and a neuropeptide from the lobster, peptide F1 (19) (sequences shown in
Table I). Further experiments demonstrated that these re-sponses were not dependent upon co-transfection of the recombinant chimeric G protein and were concentration-dependent
with EC50 values in the low micromolar range (Fig. 2). For
further studies, CHO AXOR12:Gqi5 cells were used. The CHO
parental cells did not respond to the peptides studied here, but
the transfected cell line responded to the three surrogate agonists (Fig. 4 and Table I). Galanin and galanin-like peptide,
when tested at concentrations up to 1 μM, did not activate CHO
AXOR12:Gqi5 cells (data not shown). The common feature of
all activating peptides is the presence of an amidated LRF or
LRW motif at the C terminus. This suggests that the cognate
ligand for this receptor is likely to have a similar structure at
the C terminus.
From a search of the patent literature, KiSS-1, a potential
ligand for AXOR12, was identified (patent number
WO200024890, Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd). An analysis
of the peptide sequence of KiSS-1 showed it to have features
typical of secreted neuropeptides including a signal sequence,
as predicted by signalP (20), several potential dibasic cleavage
sites, and a cleavage/amidation site (Fig. 3). This would result
in a putative 54-amino acid-secreted peptide product corresponding to residues 68 –121 of the full-length KiSS-1. Most
interestingly, this contains a C-terminal LRF-amide sequence,
as predicted from our studies with nonmammalian peptides.
A range of peptides of different lengths were synthesized,
corresponding to the C-terminal end of the putative secreted

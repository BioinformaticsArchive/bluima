blood samples were taken before, during, and after ischemia to
measure blood pH, arterial PaO (mm Hg), and arterial PaCO
22
(mm Hg).
The ostium of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
occluded intraluminally with a method previously described
(Bastide et al., 1999). The right carotid arteries were exposed
through a midline cervical incision and the common carotid and
external carotid arteries were ligated with a silk suture. The
pterygopalatine artery was exposed by developing a plane
alongside the internal carotid artery, and was ligated at its
origin with a fine silk. Aneurysm clip was placed across internal carotid artery and an arteriotomy was made in the common
carotid artery stump allowing the introduction of a 4/0 monofilament nylon suture with its tip rounded by flame heating.
This was secured in place and the aneurysm clip on the internal
carotid artery was removed. The suture was gently advanced
into the internal carotid artery and passed into the intracranial
circulation to lodge in the narrower lumen of the proximal
anterior cerebral artery (20 to 22 mm distal to the carotid bi-furcation) thereby occluding the origin of the MCA. Mild re-sistance to this advancement indicated that the intraluminal
occluder had entered the anterior cerebral artery. After 60 minutes the suture was carefully removed until its tip was blocked
by ligature placed on common carotid artery to permit reperfusion. The caudal arterial catheter was removed and the artery
was ligated to prevent bleeding. The animals were placed in
cages to recover from anesthesia at room temperature and were
allowed to eat and drink freely.

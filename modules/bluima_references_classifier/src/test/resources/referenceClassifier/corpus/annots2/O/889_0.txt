Increased local C biosynthesis in the brain
As mentioned above, the liver is regarded as the
principal source of C proteins to be released in
the serum. In neurodegenerative disorders such
as AD, there is clear evidence that the BBB is intact,
excluding the possibility of transudation of serum
from the plasma as a potential source of C. The
hypothesis that the brain itself acts as a source of
C arose from in vitro work showing that glial cells
and neuronal cells can synthesise C components
(Ref. 4). Early studies used RT-PCR analysis to
measure the level of C mRNAs in AD, HD
and normal age-matched brains (reviewed in
Ref. 4). Although the level of C mRNAs was
found to be weak in normal brains, diseased
brains showed markedly upregulated C mRNA
expression particularly in areas of primary
pathology (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and
midtemporal gyrus in AD, and caudate in HD).
In AD, the level of C1q mRNA was increased from
11–80-fold when compared with normal brain.
The levels of C3, C4 and C9 mRNAs were also
found to be upregulated in AD (Ref. 67) and the
levels of C3 and C4 mRNAs were increased in HD
caudate compared with the temporal lobe.
Surprisingly, immunohistochemical and ISH
analysis indicated that not only were reactive glial
cells abundant sources of C (microglia astrocytes),
but so were neurons.
It has been postulated that pro-inflammatory
cytokines (e.g IL-1βand TNF-α) expressed in
neurodegenerative disorders constitute a
driving force in stimulating local C biosynthesis
by resident cells (Ref. 4). RT-PCR, ISH and
immunohistochemistry have indicated that the
levels of C inhibitors are barely increased in
neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that
brain cells would be highly susceptible to
damage by increased local C biosynthesis
(reviewed in Ref. 4). Moreover, there is now
considerable evidence that C is synthesised
and activated in the brain of several animal
models of neurodegenerative diseases [e.g.
amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice
and stroke models] (Refs 26, 86). Together, these
data indicate that a full C system can be generated
in situ to promote an innate immune response

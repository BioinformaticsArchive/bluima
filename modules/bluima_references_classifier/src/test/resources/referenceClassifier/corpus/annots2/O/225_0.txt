Cloning of rat TC10 with EST approach using the
axotomized hypoglossal nuclei-derived cDNA library
Previously, we have established a special cDNA library, which was
made using rat injured hypoglossal nuclei (Tanabe et al., 1999). In
this study, we identified two distinct but partially overlapping
unknown clones among the 750 cDNA clones, which were subcloned randomly from the cDNA library. An in situ hybridization
study revealed strong upregulation of the mRNA expression in
axotomized hypoglossal motor neurons. Subsequently we
screened a rat brain cDNA library to isolate the full coding region
of this clone. Among the 1 Ã— 10 6 clones of the rat brain cDNA
library that were screened, 46 positive plaques were identified. A
search through the DDBJ showed that this clone has high homology with the human TC10 gene. The human TC10 protein en-codes 205 or 213 amino acids, depending on the choice of the first
methionine. This rat homolog contains an open reading frame of
205 amino acids that predicts a 23 kDa protein and shows an
almost complete match with the shorter human TC10, except for
one amino acid exchange (Val to I le at 143) (Fig. 1). In addition,

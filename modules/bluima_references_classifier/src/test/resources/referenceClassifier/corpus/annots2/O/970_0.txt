Fig. 7. Genome-wide interval mapping of cerebral ventricle size in AXB,BXA RI mice. The solid line represents the likelihood ratio statistic as determined by marker regression at each of the microsatellite markers
along the x-axis.The gray histogram represents the results of the bootstrap analysis, and shows that the overwhelming majority of the 1000 permutations in this analysis aligned within the QTL interval defined by the
marker regression. Dotted line is the additive effect—a negative number indicates the trait is modulated by
the “B” allele. LRS scores are equal to 4.6 times the LOD score.

ture ORNs (Cau et al., 1997, 2002). Our present data demonstrate
that Foxg1 plays an important and evolutionarily conserved role
in the proliferation and differentiation of early olfactory progenitor cells. Future studies should help identify the transcription
factor combinatorials underlying olfactory neurogenesis.

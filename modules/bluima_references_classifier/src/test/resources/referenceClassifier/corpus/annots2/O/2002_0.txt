exhibit a weak dependence on calcium entry. Thus release persists
in low external calcium and is more resistant to inhibition of
VGCCs (Hoffman and Gerhardt, 1999; Chen and Rice, 2001,
2002; Chen et al., 2006). Other reports indicate that somatodendritic release shows a steep dependence on external calcium entry
such that release is completely inhibited with blockers of VGCCs
(Jaffe et al., 1998; Beckstead et al., 2004; Ford et al., 2007; Kim et
al., 2008). It remains unclear whether similar mechanisms regulate the release of dopamine in the cell body region and axon
terminal fields.
The time course of the rise and fall of extracellular dopamine
following synaptic release also has been reported to differ be-tween the midbrain and striatum. In the striatum, the concentration of dopamine peaks within 200 ms and is cleared after
several hundred milliseconds (Benoit-Marand et al., 2001; Chen
and Rice, 2001; Phillips et al., 2002). In the midbrain, however,
the reduced rate of dopamine uptake by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and an increased extracellular volume fraction
results in a prolonged rise in extracellular dopamine (Rice and
Nicholson, 1991; Garris and Wightman, 1994; Cragg and
Greenfield, 1997; Cragg et al., 2001; Cragg and Rice, 2004; Rice
and Cragg, 2008). Thus it has been reported that in the SNc
extracellular dopamine peaks 2000 â€“3000 ms after a single
stimulus and remains elevated for several seconds (Chen and
Rice, 2001; Chen et al., 2006).
As opposed to the long-lasting extracellular presence of dopamine that has been proposed based on electrochemical techniques, the physiological actions of dopamine in the midbrain
have recently been found to be relatively brief (Ford et al., 2009).

plated (200,000 cells/cm2) onto poly-L-lysine (0.05 mg/ml) and laminin (0.1 mg/
ml)-coated tissue culture coverslips (Fisher Brand; Fisher Scientific) in NBM
with L-glutamine, B-27, and P/S supplements (complete NBM). On day 2 in vitro,
cells were infected with BDV or mock stocks diluted with fresh medium (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 0.02), and medium was partially (50%) replaced
every fourth day thereafter.
(iii) Cortical mixed neuron-glial cultures. For preparation of mixed neuron
and glia cultures, cortices from E15 to E17 Lewis rats were used. Dissociated
cells (350,000 cells/cm2) were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5%
FBS, 5% horse serum, and 1% P/S (vol/vol) and otherwise treated as described
above for neuron-rich cultures.
(iv) Coculture and treatment protocols. Activation of microglia by BDV in-fection was evaluated either by exposing microglia to purified virus or BDVinfected neurons or in the mixed BDV-infected and uninfected primary neuronglial cultures. Microglial cells (microglia seeding density, 50,000 cells/cm2 in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S) were seeded over primary
cortical neurons grown at an initial seeding density of 200,000 cells/cm2 for 14
days in vitro, 12 days postinfection (p.i.). To further purify microglial cultures
from loosely attached astrocytes and dead cells, medium was replaced 2 h later
with fresh NBM (cocultures with primary neurons) or with DMEM–10% FBS
(all other cocultures). Twelve hours later, medium was replaced again with NBM
or DMEM–1% FBS–1% P/S (vol/vol) supplemented with either LPS (0, 1, 10,
and 100 ng/ml; dilution of culture medium with LPS was 1% [vol/vol]), Tat (0,
1, 10, and 100 ng/ml; 1% [vol/vol]), the BDV stock (MOI up to 0.1; up to 5%
[vol/vol]), or the mock stock. At the end of incubations, cell supernatants were
collected and stored at 70°C until tested.
Immunocytochemistry. At 5 to 16 days in vitro (or as indicated in the text)
cocultures were washed two times with PBS and then fixed for 15 min with PBS
plus 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde at room temperature. After permeabilization
with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), cultures were blocked for 2 h in PBS with 2%
donkey serum (Chemicon) and further incubated with primary antibody mixtures
overnight at 4°C in blocking solution. After extensive washing, the cultures were
incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The following antibodies were used: anti-MAP2 (1:1,000 dilution) as a
neuronal marker; anti-GFAP (1:800) as an astrocyte marker; anti-CD11b/c (1:
50) and anti-Iba1 (1:800) as microglia markers; anti-ED1 (1:100), anti-MHC-I
(1:100), and anti-MHC-II (1:100) as markers of microglia activation; anti-activated caspase-3 (1:200) as an apoptotic marker; and anti-BDV N (1:50) to
identify infected cells (34). In some experiments microglia were visualized with
FITC-lectin IB4 (5 g/ml) that was added to the primary antibody mixture (42).
Immunostaining without primary antibodies was used as a negative control.
Following mounting with Gel/Mount medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatfield, PA), the samples were allowed to dry in the dark and were viewed using
a 25 , 40 , or 63 objective lenses on an LSM 5 PASCAL confocal microscope
from Carl Zeiss (Melville, NY). Digital images of the cells were captured and
processed by using the software supplied with the microscope.
Microglial activation assays. Microglial activation was assessed by (i) counting
round (activated) microglia cells; (ii) immunostaining for the markers of activation, i.e., MHC-I and -II or ED1 (see above); and (iii) measuring the levels of NO
and interleukins TNF- , IL-1 , and IL-10 in the culture medium.
Microglia stained for specific cell markers (anti-CD11b/c or lectin-IB4) show
two subpopulations of cells: flat ramified and round amoeboid cells. The round
morphology as well as intensive CD11b/c staining are the typical hallmarks of
reactive microglia in vivo and in vitro (43). These cells were clearly distinguishable from resting microglia. Counting round microglia cells was performed manually in 10 random fields (digital confocal images at 25 magnification) per well
of the experimental plate. The results from 2 to 4 wells per condition were used
for statistical analyses.
The production of NO was determined indirectly through the assay of nitrite
(NO2), a stable metabolite of NO, based on the Griess reaction (24). Briefly, a
50- l aliquot of conditioned medium was mixed with 200 l of distilled H20 and
20 l of Griess reagent [0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride,
1% sulfanilamide, and 2.5% phosphoric acid; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, CA] and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm on a microtiter plate reader (Spectra MAX 250;
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Nitrite concentrations were calculated from
a standard curve of sodium nitrite (Sigma) ranging from 0.1 to 100 M.
TNF- , IL-1 , and IL-10 levels were determined using sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Twenty-five
microliters of conditioned medium was incubated with 50 l of assay diluent
RD1-41 in the assay plate for 2 h at room temperature. After any unbound
substances were washed away, horseradish peroxidase-linked polyclonal antibody
specific for rat TNF- , IL-1 , or IL-10 was added to the wells. Following the

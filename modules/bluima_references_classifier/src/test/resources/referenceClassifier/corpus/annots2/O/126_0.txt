HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE PREPARATIONS. The human brains were
obtained from clinical autopsy at the National Institute of Forensic
Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Brains were
handled as has been described earlier (5). The cryosectioning and
autoradiography on whole hemisphere sections, the handling of the
brain sections at the end of the incubation, and the evaluation of
the binding were carried out as described in detail elsewhere (4, 25).

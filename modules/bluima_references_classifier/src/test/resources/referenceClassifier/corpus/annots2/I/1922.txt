Extensive innervation of the periosteum by peripherin (A) and CGRP fibers (B,C). A: Innervation of periosteum overlying the parietal bone at the
top of the adult skull. B: Innervation of periosteum overlying the interparietal bone at the back of the skull. C: Innervation of periosteum overlying
the frontal bone on the side of the skull. Note that periosteal fibers do not enter the calvarial bones. Arrowheads point to labelled fibers. A:
Coronal plane. B,C: Horizontal plane. Scale bar 50 m for A; 500 m for B; 200 m for C.

Because expression of the human PP2A C mutant interfered
with murine PP2A function in our transgenic mice, it is likely
that the mechanism of PP2A inhibition is identical to that in
yeast. This suggests a functional conservation between murine,
human, and yeast PP2A that reflects conservation at the se-quence level (65).
In a related study, a mutant form of the structural subunit A
of PP2A with impaired binding of regulatory B subunits was
expressed under control of the -actin promoter in transgenic
mice. This expression caused a 30% decrease in the activity of
the holoenzyme in heart homogenates (66, 67). In our L199P
mutant mice, a reduction of PP2A activity similar to that found
in the PP2A subunit A mutant mice was seen. Despite differ-

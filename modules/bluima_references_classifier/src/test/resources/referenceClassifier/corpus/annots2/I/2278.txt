thesia, however, can differ from electrophysiological
findings obtained without anesthesia. This situation is
favorable for the investigation of the neural circuitry in
temperature regulation, including the thermal afferent
pathway. In addition, rats with lesions in the ventrobasal
complex of the thalamus can still maintain the body core
temperature even during cold exposure (3). In the present
autoradiograhs it is suggested that peripheral thermal
afferents arrive at the VPM and change their metabolic
activity at the VPM. However, the physiological significance of the fact that the increased metabolic activity of
the VPM is induced by cold exposure, and the decreased
activity by heat exposure, remains to be elucidated.
The brain regions with significant changes in metabolic activity observed only by peripheral thermal stimulation (i.e., SCN, rSN, and HPC) presumably compose
the afferent pathways from peripheral thermosensors,
but this hypothesis needs further examination. In the
regions with increases of activity only during peripheral
cooling (i.e., PH, ZI) and central cooling (i.e., SC, VL,
AV, LD, HL), the increased activity may be evidence of
pathways from peripheral or central sensors activated by
cold stimuli. There was, however, no increased activity
in these regions (SC, VL, AV, LD, and HL) when the
body core temperature decreased significantly during
severe cold exposure. We did not investigate the metabolic activity of many regions in expt 1, although we
observe them in expt 2 (e.g., frontal cortex, amygdala,
and medulla-pons). On a possible role of the sulcal prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex,
anterior amygdala, solitary nuclei, and lateral reticular
formation in the medulla in thermoregulation, no information is available. However, increased activity in these
regions may aid the study of their contributions to thermoregulation.
In conclusion, the rat brain regions that significantly
change metabolic activity are thought to compose the
structural and functional components in the thermoregulatory system. Needless to say the results from macroscopic changes in the metabolic activity of brain regions
cannot be compared with those from many stimulation,
lesion-studies, or single-unit experiments. How regions
of the brain affected by thermal stimuli contribute to the
development of thermoregulatory responses cannot be
determined based on changes in metabolic activity alone.
For this, further analyses are necessary, using stimulation, lesion, or unitary recording techniques. The present
study has shown, however, that the [““Cl-DG technique
can be employed to identify the brain regions of functional involvement in thermoregulatory responses. This
technique provided us not only with novel information
that may complement existing knowledge but also with
new information on the central mechanisms underlying
thermoregulation.

spread of cortical activity from the stimulating electrode at
various times after stimulation onset. If all the elements mediating the stimulation-induced response are excited simultaneously this would suggest that all fibers are being activated
directly. On the other hand, if the tissue closest to the electrode
is activated first followed later by the tissue furthest from the
electrode, this would suggest that the delayed response arises
from indirect activation. Such lateral spread of activity triggered by a punctate visual target was demonstrated in V1 using
optical imaging and attributed to conduction laterally by un-myelinated, synaptically connected fibers within cortex or by
conduction through feedback projections from extrastriate cortex (Grinvald et al. 1994; Slovin et al. 2002). The lateral spread
of activity was estimated to range from 0.09 to 0.25 m/s from
the center of direct activation and to travel between 1 and 4 mm
through the operculum.
If the lateral spread of activity is so prevalent in cortical
tissue even at the lowest currents, why then does microstimulation of neocortex evoke precise behavioral responses as
evidenced, for example, by the fine correspondence between
the endpoint of an electrically evoked saccade from V1 and the
center of the receptive field of the directly activated neurons
(Tehovnik et al. 2003)? It is possible that the behavioral effects
of microstimulation may be caused by decoding the activity of
a neuronal population significantly larger than the neurons
activated directly as a result of the passive spread of current.
Yet it is thought that stimulation disproportionately activates
the largest and most excitable elements of cortex directly and
that these elements tend to project subcortically rather than
laterally (Calvin and Sypert 1976; Deschenes et al. 1979;
Finlay et al. 1976; Macpherson et al. 1982; Nowak and Bullier
1996; Phillips 1956; Stoney et al. 1968; Swadlow 1985, 1988;
Takahashi 1965). These stimulated neurons might more readily
gain access to subcortical networks involved in the execution
of precise behavioral responses such as cortically generated
saccadic eye movements. The chronaxies of the directly stimulated elements that mediate a variety of cortically evoked
behaviors including saccadic eye movements, conditioning
responses, and phosphene induction fall between 0.1 and 0.4
ms (Bartlett et al. 2005; Brindley and Lewin 1968; Dobelle and
Mladejovsky 1974; Rushton and Brindley 1978; Tehovnik and
Lee 1993; Tehovnik and Sommer 1997; Tehovnik et al. 2003).
As mentioned earlier, such short chronaxies obtained with
different methods suggest that microstimulation is directly
activating the largest elements in cortex.
A second possibility of why microstimulation of neocortex
produces precise behavioral responses is that the activation of
the lateral projections in cortex might fail to significantly
contribute to spiking activity and thus to an evoked behavior
resulting from conduction issues. The lateral connections
within cortex are often unmyelinated and therefore relatively
unexcitable (Nowak and Bullier 1996; Swadlow 1985). Unmyelinated fibers are prone to conduction failure (Raymond and
Lettvin 1978; Swadlow et al. 1980), whereas large myelinated
fibers can follow pulse frequencies well in excess of 100 and
800 Hz (Macpherson 1982; Paintal 1965; Stoney et al. 1968;
Swadlow 1985; Takahashi 1965). One consequence of this is
that the directly activated tissue may contribute disproportionately to an evoked behavioral response. This supposition is
consistent with the finding that directly activated fibers in V1
using a punctate visual stimulus result in a discharge of spikes,

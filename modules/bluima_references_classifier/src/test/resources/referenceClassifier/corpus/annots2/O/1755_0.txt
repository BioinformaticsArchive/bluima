Injury paradigms and assessment. Two insults
were studied in astrocyte and slice cultures.
Glucose deprivation (GD) was done by removing glucose from the medium (Ouyang et al.,
2006). Combined oxygen GD (OGD) was done
in slice culture by anoxic exposure in medium
meant to replicate ischemic extracellular fluid
as described previously (Ouyang et al., 2005).
For primary cultures, we used OGD to mimic
ischemia (Xu et al., 2001). Ceftriaxone pretreatment of slice cultures was 100 M for 5 d before
OGD.
Cell death in primary astrocyte cultures was
detected with the fluorescent cell death markers
propidium iodide (PI) or SYTOX green. In hippocampal slice cultures, cell death was assessed
by measuring mean fluorescence intensity of PI
in a standardized area in the CA1 region subtracting the fluorescence in a square placed in
an undamaged area outside of the CA2/CA3 cell
band (background) as described previously
(Ouyang et al., 2005).
Immunohistochemistry and Western blots. Af-ter experiments, cell and hippocampal slice cultures were fixed with 4% phosphate-buffered
paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (Ouyang et al., 2005) using antibodies
against GFAP, GLT-1, S100 , and GLAST (glutamateâ€“aspartate transporters) (Millipore,
Bedford, MA). Western blots were performed
using anti-GFAP and anti-GLT-1 antibodies.
Glutamate uptake. Glutamate uptake was
measured according to published methods
(Vesce et al., 1997; Brooke and Sapolsky, 2003)
using aspartate. Aspartate is taken up by the
same transporters as glutamate because of their
similar molecular weight but is not further me-tabolized (Drejer et al., 1983). Briefly, after
ischemia-like injury, the cells were incubated in
glucose-free medium with a mixture of 3H
D-aspartate (0.5 C/ml) and cold aspartate at 1
M. After 7 min, the cells were washed four
times with ice-cold PBS containing the transport inhibitor threo- -hydroxyaspartic acid (1
mM), scraped with lysate buffer (1% Triton
X-100), and counted by a scintillation counter
for incorporated radioactivity.
Mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen radical production. Live cell imaging studies
were performed as described previously (Ouyang et al., 2006) with some modifications. We
used tetramethylrhodamine ethylester (TMRE)
to assess mitochondrial membrane potential,
and MitoSOX Red or hydroethidine (HEt) to
assess oxygen radical production. Fluorescence
changes were quantified (Ouyang et al., 2006)
by selecting a cytoplasmic region of each cell
that was strongly fluorescent at baseline and
normalizing subsequent fluorescence measurements to the basal fluorescence for each cell at
the start of the experiment.

stimuli are processed such that during recognition,
stimuli are processed in a fundamentally different
way than during categorization. During recognition, increased occipital activity for familiar stimuli
appears to override decreases that are associated
with nondeclarative memory. This effect could be
owing either to the effort applied to making a recognition memory judgment or to the successful
retrieval of a previously encountered stimulus.
This interpretation must be tempered by the
fact that the two experimental conditions were not
completely parallel. Despite matching the conditions as closely as possible, there were necessarily
several differences between them. In the categorization condition, each pattern presented at study
was a novel distortion of a single prototype dot
pattern. In contrast, in the recognition condition,
five patterns were each repeated eight times at
study. Therefore, the tasks differed both in the
number of times each dot pattern was repeated
and in the similarity between the dot patterns in
the study phase. Furthermore, in the test phase,

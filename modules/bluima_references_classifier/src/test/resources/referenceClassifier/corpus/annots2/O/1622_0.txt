FIG. 1. Transfection of pEF-Bos-hGDNF
reduces the motor impairment of hemiparkinsonian rats. (A) The reduction in methamphetamine-and apomorphine-induced
turning behavior in transfected animals.
Â§Significantly different from turns shown by
the same group before transfection; *significantly different from control groups (n = 20
in each experimental condition). (B) The
analysis of the unrestrained gait of nontransfected (n = 3) and transfected (n = 3)
hemiparkinsonian rats made at the end of
the study. The line drawings show the
spatiotemporal sequence of movements of
both hind limbs in a series of four and five
strides (see supplementary video for a representative motion analysis of the gait). The
graphs show the mean F SEM values corresponding to three parameters of at least four
hind-limb strides per animal and experimental condition. *Significantly different from
the hind limb without lesion. P b 0.05,
repeated-measures two-way ANOVA and
Bonferroni posttest.

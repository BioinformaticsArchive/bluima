a DNA synthesizer model 381A from Applied Biosystems Inc. All
reagents were of analytical grade.
Time during Pregnancy--Rats were mated for one night and pregnancy was detected by the appearance of a vaginal plug the following
morning. The length of gestation was calculated assuming mating
took place in the middle of the night. The gestation period was
approximately 24 days. The increased time of the gestation period,

in implantation, with development occurring at a normal rate after
implantation.
Analysis of RNA from Fetal Tissues-Total RNA was purified from
tissues collected from at least 8 fetuses according to the method of
Strohman (51). The quality of RNA was checked by Northern gel
analysis before being spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for dot
blot hybridization analysis. After hybridization and autoradiography,
the spots were cut out and radioactivity was determined in a liquid
scintillation counter as described previously (7).
Partial Hepatectomy-Male Buffalo rats weighing 250 g were used
in the described experiments. Partial hepatectomies were performed
between900a.m.and1:OOp.m.accordingtothetechniquedescribed
by Higgins and Anderson (52), removing an average 75% of the liver.
The animals were kept under ether anesthesia during the operation.
Levels of mRNAs in tissue extracts were determined as described
elsewhere (53).
Isolation of Gene Clones from a Genomic Library-A Buffalo rat
genomic library of 2 x lo6 independent recombinants was prepared
from liver DNA as described previously (54). Recombinant cDNA of
a rat transthyretin clone (7) was 32P-labeledby nick translation (55)
and used as a hybridization probe to screen for gene clones from the
library according to themethod described previously (54).
Analysis of DNA by Restriction Mapping and Blot HybridizationLiver DNAof a Buffalo rat was prepared as described by Blin and
Stafford (56). Phage DNA of the gene clones was prepared according
to Maniatis et al. (57). The restriction map of the cloned gene was
constructed by digestion of DNA of the overlapping gene clones with
restriction endonucleases. DNA restriction fragments were separated
accordingtosizebyelectrophoresisinanagarosegel(57).ForDNA
blot hybridization, DNA from the gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose
membrane (58) and hybridized (57) to cDNA probes labeled with [cr-32P]dATP and [cP~'P]~CTbyP nick translation (55).
M13 Subcloningand Dideoxy Sequencing-The dideoxy chain termination sequencing technique (59) was used with [a-35S]dATPaS
and a pentadecamer MI3 primer. Sequencing templates were prepared by subcloning restriction fragments of the gene clones into the
BamHI, EcoRI, SmuI, TaqI, and XbaI sites of the MI3cloning vectors
mp8, mp9, mp18, and mp19 (60). DNA samples were separated by
electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels (61)which were dried onto
blotting paper prior to autoradiography.
Primer Extension Analysis-A synthetic oligonucleotide 5'-CCCAGGGCCAGCTTCAGACG-3' complementary to a section of
exon1ofthetransthyretingenewaslabeledatthe5'endwith[y-3ZP]ATPby T4 polynucleotide kinase (62) and used as a primer.
Total RNA was extracted with guanidine hydrochloride (63) from
livers removed from healthy Buffalo rats and from rats 24 h after
induction of inflammation. Polyadenylated RNAwas purified by
oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (64). Primer extension experiments were performed as described by Shelness and Williams (65).
Samples obtained after primer extension and molecular weight markers were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6%polyacrylamide sequencing
gels (61).
In Situ Hybridization of Transthyretin mRNA in Fetal TissuesThe forebrain and hindbrain regions were dissected from rat fetuses
on 17% days of gestation, and visceral yolk sacs were isolated from
11%and 14%-day embryos. Tissues were rapidly frozen in TissueTek, OCT, low temperature embedding compound (Miles Scientific
Div., Naperville, IL) in isopentane cooled on dry ice. Serial frozen
sections of 8 Fm were cut andair-dried on gelatin-coated microscope
slides. Sections were fixed in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline for 5 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed
in distilled H 2 0 , and air-dried. Sections were prehybridized, then
hybridized for 16 h at 40 "C with 32P-labeledoligonucleotide probes
and washed under conditions similar to those described previously
(34, 66-68). The oligonucleotide probe, designed as a synthetic 30-mer complementary to rat transthyretin mRNA (7) was end-labeled
with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) and [Y-~'P]ATSPe.ctions
were washed under conditions which ensured stability of oligonucleotide hybrids, i.e. twowashes in 0.6 M NaCl and 0.06 M sodium citrate
a t 40 "cfor 30 min and finally in 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium

Neuronal intranuclear inclusions in
transgenic mice
Transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of the human
Huntington's-disease gene containing an expanded
CAG repeat derived from a patient with juvenile-onset
Huntington's disease17 develop many of the clinical
features characteristic of this disease.18,19 Within the
brains of these transgenic mice, before the onset of
neurological signs, the transgene protein containing an
expanded polyglutamine repeat appears in the nucleus20
and forms a characteristic intranuclear inclusion
(figure). The presence of this inclusion leads to
morphological changes within the nucleus. The nuclear
membrane develops prominent invaginations
accompanied by an apparent increase in the density of
nuclear pores.20 The NII is additionally strongly
immunoreactive with antibodies to ubiquitin.20
These observations in transgenic mice prompted us to
analyse the distribution of huntingtin protein within the
brains of patients with Huntington's disease. Antibodies
that recognise the N-terminal of huntingtin
immunolabel NIIs, whereas antibodies to C-terminal
portions of the protein do not.21 Antibodies to ubiquitin
also recognise NIIs. Similar structures have occasionally
been seen in necropsy or biopsy samples of cerebral
cortex or caudate nucleus from patients with
Huntington's disease, although their relevance to the
mechanism of the disease was not appreciated.22
Intranuclear inclusions containing a protein with an
expanded polyglutamine repeat have been seen in the
brains of patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3,
dentatorubropallido-Luysian atrophy (M Becher and
C A Ross personal communication), as well as in
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of patients with
spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and mice transgenic for
this mutation,25,26 which suggests that neuronal
dysfunction is due to the mutant protein within the
nucleus. Schrezinger and colleagues27 showed that the
expansion of a polyglutamine sequence within a
truncated huntingtin protein leads to in-vitro and in-vivo formation of fibrils with a -pleated sheet (amyloidlike) structures that are insoluble. The insolubility of the
mutated protein seems to be enhanced by cleavage of an
n-terminal fragment containing the polyglutamine
sequence. Antibodies that recognise this n-terminal
fragment immunolabel NIIs in the brains of patients
with Huntington's disease, whereas antibodies directed
to more central sequences in the protein do not.21 It
remains to be established if the mutant proteins
involved in the other triplet-repeat expansion diseases
similarly form amyloid-like insoluble nuclear fibrils.

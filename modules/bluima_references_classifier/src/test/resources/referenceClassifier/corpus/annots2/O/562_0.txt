molecular picture therefore suggests a unique set of genes defining
hippocampal development.
To elucidate the patterned development and lineal origins of
the hippocampus, and to complement the emerging molecular
organization, we used aggregation and blastocyst-injection chimeras to retrospectively analyze like-genotype cohorts of the
three major cell types in the adult mammalian hippocampus. We
examined the underlying clonal architecture and lineage relationships of the pyramidal cells, granule cells, and GABAergic interneurons of the hippocampus. We found that the hippocampus
proper follows a radial clonal architecture, whereas the dentate
gyrus follows an outside-in neurogenetic gradient in its clonal
organization. Furthermore, the two sides of the hippocampus
arise from distinct progenitor populations. We also demonstrate
that the GABAergic interneuronal population arises separately
from the principal hippocampal neurons, and their progenitors
contribute to the dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper alike.
Quantitative analyses of like-genotype cells in the hippocampus
provide upper estimates for the size of the progenitor pools of
each of the three major hippocampal cell types. Finally, observations of like-genotype cells across brain regions in several chimeras indicate that the hippocampus shares lineage with telencephalic and diencephalic structures. These new insights into the
clonal architecture of the hippocampus form a developmental
foundation for the emerging molecular events that are critical for
understanding hippocampal development and f unction.

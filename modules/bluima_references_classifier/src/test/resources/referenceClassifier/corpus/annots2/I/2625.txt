for this interpretation, the difference in latencies between
antisaccades and saccades was calculated for individual
subjects as summarized inFignre 5. Compared to the control
A, the patients with frontal conical lesions (p < 0.01), and
compared to the control B, the schizopinenks (p < 0.005)
showed significantly larger differences. Parkiaqmian pa-tientsdidnotshowasignificantdifferencecompmedtothe
control A, however. These results ate also consistent with
our interpretation that frontal patients and schizoplnenks
(but not Parkinsonian patients) show specific abnormalities
in the antisaccade task. These abnormalities in the antisaccadetaskcanbeexplainedbyadysfunctionofthesaccadic

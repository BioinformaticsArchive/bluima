Many large and smaller arteries in the body, particularly the arcuate vessels in the kidney, the
coronary arteries, the aorta, and the carotid vessels,
showed intimal thickening. In the aorta, the elastic
tissue was somewhat fragmented. In a section through
a costochondral junction the growing zone was absent
and the bony trabeculae thickened. Samples of muscle
showed atrophy and partial replacement by fat. In the
skin of the scalp, the hair follicles appeared to be in the
resting phase, with little evidence of new hair shaft
formation. The epidermis itself seemed inactive. The'
pituitary gland had a large posterior lobe with mucous
inclusions.
In the brain, the layering of the cerebral cortex was
normal. The white matter was diminished and the
corpus callosum was thin and poorly myelinated. The
lateral geniculate bodies were severely hypoplastic and
the optic radiations virtually absent. The cerebellar
cortex was severely hypoplastic (Fig. 3), showing
thinning of the molecular layer and a very sparsely
populated granule cell layer. The Purkinje cells were
best preserved but were frequently displaced out of line
and displayed occasional dendritic stars and axonal
torpedoes. The inferior olives were normal. The central
grey masses in the cerebrum and cerebellum were
normally formed. The pyramidal tracts in the brainstem and spinal cord were small and poorly
myelinated. A striking feature in the cerebrum and
cerebellum was extensive calcification. This was
patchy and involved capillaries, the walls of the larger
arteries within the brain, and interstitial tissues. The
larger arteries often showed narrowing or occlusion of
the lumen by fibrous tissue. However, no infarcts had
occurred. The calcific deposits were present in
cerebrum and cerebellum and were particularly heavy,
though in a patchy fashion, in the basal ganglia,
cerebellar cortex, and dentate nucleus. In the eyes, the
retinae were severely atrophic and disorganised.

so that the effect on specific binding (Fig. 5) could be calculated. This
correction factor was, however, always small since the non-specific uptake
from the low concentrations of saxitoxin used in Fig. 5 was small (< 6 f-mole. mg dry-').
Calcium. The replacement of all the sodium chloride of Locke solution
by an isosmotic amount of calcium chloride (113 mM) had little effect on
the uptake of saxitoxin in high concentrations (200 nM). However, at low
concentrations of saxitoxin when the total uptake is largely determined by
the saturable component the binding was markedly reduced (Table 2).

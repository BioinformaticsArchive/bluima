neuronal death,3,9,16,17 the effects of rtPA remained largely
unclear.
The present report demonstrates that rtPA causes a dosedependent increase of ischemic injury, which is in close
agreement with previous findings by Wang et al.2 In contrast
to those previous data, however, the present results do not
necessarily support the conclusion that the increase of injury
may be attributed to excitotoxic side effects, although toxic
effects of rtPA have previously been described in cell
culture.18 â€“20 Conversely, the present report shows that rtPA
infusion is followed by complex hemodynamic changes in the
ischemic brain tissue, which might outweigh such toxic
effects and need to be taken into account in the present
discussion. After high (ie, 10 mg/kg body wt) but not after
lower (up to 2 mg/kg body wt) doses of rtPA, we observed an
initial hyperperfusion response immediately after the onset of
reperfusion. Although this dose is well above those doses
usually applied in humans (0.9 mg/kg body wt),21 it much
better reflects the pathophysiological situation because the
thrombolytic activity of rtPA is considerably lower in rodents
than in human patients. In fact, it has been shown that because
of species differences, an approximately 10-fold higher rtPA
dose is required in mice to achieve activation of the plasmin
system comparable to that in humans.22,23 Hence, an rtPA
dose of 10 mg/kg body wt in rodents almost equals the dose
of 0.9 mg/kg body wt in humans.21 Thus, our data suggest that
the hyperperfusion may be a consequence of the direct
fibrinolytic action of rtPA and may be explained by the
prevention of spontaneous clot formation after thread
retraction.
However, the amelioration of blood flow was only shortlasting and was followed by a secondary decrease of Doppler
flow, which dropped below levels of control animals within
90 minutes after thread retraction in rtPA-treated animals.
Further autoradiographic experiments showed that this secondary hypoperfusion was most pronounced in the ischemic
border zone (ie, the sensory cortex), where regional CBF
decreased to 33.5 11.3 mL/100 g per minute within 2 hours
after reperfusion. Since regional CBF decreased below the
critical flow threshold required for tissue survival, which is
between 50 and 55 mL/100 g per minute,24 our results
strongly suggest that the reduction of blood flow was at least
partly responsible for the rtPA-induced increase in infarct
size. The fact that both hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion
responses were noted after rtPA delivery may explain why
the dose-response dependency between rtPA and infarct size
was not linear in the present study but rather followed a
bell-shaped relationship. In our study the maximum increase
in infarct size was observed at rtPA doses between 1 and 2
mg/kg body wt, ie, at doses at which the secondary hypoperfusion response became prominent. On the other hand, the
increase in infarct size was less pronounced at higher rtPA
doses, ie, at 10 mg/kg body wt, which may be due to the fact
that the now detected hyperperfusion response opposed the
injury-aggravating effect.
Our data thus raise a question regarding the reasons for the
hemodynamic changes after rtPA treatment. The biological
half-life of rtPA is very short (8 to 12 minutes).25 It is
therefore unlikely that rtPA effects were evoked by rtPA

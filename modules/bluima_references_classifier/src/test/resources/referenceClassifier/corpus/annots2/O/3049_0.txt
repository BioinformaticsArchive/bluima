Functional and Clinical Implications
The widespread distribution and topographic organization of
frontal cortex-projecting DA neurons may inf luence our
understanding of the role of the mesocortical DA system in
schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our views regarding the
function of dopamine in the frontal cortex of primates, including
humans, has been predicated on the assumption that this
afferent system arises from the VTA, as it does in the rodent. The
present demonstration that the dorsal and ventromedial frontal
cortices are innervated by relatively distinct populations of
mesencephalic DA cells, with the dorsal regions heavily targeted
by DA cells which reside outside of the VTA, may suggest that
these projections are functionally dissociable. Behavioral studies
of these different prefrontal cortical domains in primates
suggests that the dorsal PFC regions are intimately involved in
spatial and object working memory functions (Fuster, 1985;
Goldman-Rakic, 1987), as well as in the control of eye
movements (Bruce and Goldberg, 1984), whereas the
ventromedial cortices have been less associated with spatial
processes and more so with emotional and autonomic functions,
response inhibition and stimulus significance (Fuster, 1984; see
also discussion in Yeterian and Pandya, 1991). The dorsal
precentral cortices are, of course, critical for the planning and
execution of voluntary movement. It is tempting to speculate
that the DA innervations of the dorsal and ventromedial frontal
regions possess unique functional characteristics due to
different cellular origins and afferent inputs in the midbrain, and

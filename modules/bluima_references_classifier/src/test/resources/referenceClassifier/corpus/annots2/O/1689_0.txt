Introduction

The loading of glutamate into the synaptic vesicles via the vesicular
glutamate transporter (VGLUT) is an essential step in glutamatergic
synaptic transmission. Three vesicular glutamate transporters have
been identified: VGLUT1, VGLUT2 and VGLUT3. Although highly
homologous and with similar characteristics when loading vesicles
with glutamate (Fremeau et al., 2001; Herzog et al., 2001; Takamori
et al., 2001; Gras et al., 2002; Varoqui et al., 2002), they have
different CNS distributions. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are the predominant isoforms, accounting for most of the presumed excitatory
glutamatergic terminals in the CNS. Interestingly, VGLUT1 and
VGLUT2 display complementary expression patterns. VGLUT1
predominates in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and hippocampus,
whereas VGLUT2 is widely expressed in the diencephalon, brainstem
and spinal cord (Fremeau et al., 2001; Herzog et al., 2001). However,
none of these brain regions exclusively expresses one isoform and,
although most of glutamatergic neurons express either VGLUT1 or
VGLUT2, coexpression of the two has been reported (Hisano et al.,
2002; Herzog et al., 2006). Furthermore, there is a developmental

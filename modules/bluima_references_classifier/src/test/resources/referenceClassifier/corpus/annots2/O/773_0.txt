Surgery
All operations were performed on male cockroaches under
steady CO2 anaesthesia. Cell culture medium (L 15; GIBCO,
Eggenstein, Germany) containing penicillin and streptomycin
was used to rinse the wounds. For the initial left optic lobe
(OL) section, a triangular cuticular flap was cut into the head
capsule to expose the OL. With an iridectomy scissor, the optic
nerves and the optic stalks were cut, and the OL was removed;
the cuticle was flapped back in place and sealed with wax.
For transplantation of AMe tissue into the right antennal
lobe (AL) of a host cockroach (Fig.·1B), its right brain
hemisphere was exposed. With a razorblade fragment, a
pocket was cut into the right AL. Then, the donor animal was
decapitated, its brain exposed, and the perineurium of one
OL was removed. According to external markers, tissue
containing the AMe with its adjacent PDH-ir cells (in
controls: tissue out of the adjacent medulla) was excised from
the donors brain with a fine glass pipette (tip- ̆ , 150–250·μm).
The tip of the pipette was stuck into the AL of the host animal,
the graft tissue was carefully blown out and occasionally its
position was corrected with an eyebrow hair. Then, the right
OL was removed; the cuticle was flapped back in place and
sealed with wax. In the OL-to-OL transplantations, animals
were donors and host at the same time (Fig.·1A) and the AMe
graft was implanted into the location of the host's removed
AMe.

compared at three time intervals separating the arrival of the
stimuli (O-20, 21-40, and ~40 ms) by using analysis of variance
for repeated measures, followed by Fisher's least significant difference when appropriate. In the grouped data from the kainic
acid studies, the percent responses to area postrema and to
either ADN or vagus nerve stimulation were compared during
control conditions 2-5 min after kainic acid was injected in the
area postrema and at maximum recovery from the kainic acid by
using analysis of variance for repeated measures, followed by
Fisher's least significant difference when appropriate.
Significance levels were set at P < 0.05.

joint induced internalization of the NK-1 receptor in the monoarthritic
model, in parallel to the observed functional changes in postsynaptic
excitability. In all animals, 30 min were allowed between ankle
extension and perfusion for fixation; this interval was chosen because
this time period demonstrated maximum receptor internalization
following NK-1 receptor activation in vivo. The confocal microscopy

Figure 5. GABA-mediated inhibition of olfactory nerve inputs to the GL. A, The GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (50 μM) produced a slight
increase in the amplitude and duration of the GL response. In contrast, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (5 μM) suppressed this response. B,
Bicuculline produced a small increase in the NMDA receptor-mediated component, isolated in the presence of CNQX (10 μM) and nominally
magnesium-free solution (low Mg 2+).

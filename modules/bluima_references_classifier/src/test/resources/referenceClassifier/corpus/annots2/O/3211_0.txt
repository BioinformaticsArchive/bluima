Figure 2. GATA-3-directed LacZ labeling in brain tissue from adult (A, B) and young (F, G), heterozygous GATA-3 +/nlslacZ mice and adult
GATA-3 +/taulacZ mice ( C–E). In the adult GATA-3 +/nlslacZ mice the labeled cells occurred throughout the brainstem including both rhombencephalon
and mesencephalon. Extensive labeling appeared, for example, in the colliculi (Col), superior olive (SO), and caudal and rostral raphe nuclei (for
whole-mount preparation, see A, B; for coronal sections, see D, E). In the GATA-3 +/taulacZ mice the same distribution pattern can be observed plus the
major projection pathways; these include, for example, the medial forebrain bundle (mf b) and the descending projections from the raphe nuclei to the
spinal cord [bulbospinal serotonergic pathway (bsp)]. The levels of the coronal sections with the rostral and caudal raphe nuclei depicted in D and E
correspond to the levels indicated in the whole-mount preparation in A. During early development at embryonic days 10.5 ( F) and 11.5 ( G), three
populations of GATA-3-positive cells can be observed in a frontal view of the brainstem. In the middle, one can see a dense population of neurons at
the level of rhombomere 4 (r4), which presumably give rise to the efferents of the auditory system, whereas somewhat more rostrally and caudally of this
region one can observe the other two groups of neurons. Considering the identical distribution of serotonergic neurons during early development (Aitken
and To ̈rk, 1988), it appears most likely that these latter rostral and caudal groups of positive GATA-3 neurons give rise to the serotonergic neurons of
the rostral (PnR, DR, DRV L, and B9) and caudal (ROb, RPa, RMg, and B4) raphe nuclei, respectively. Scale bars (in D, E), 0.9 mm.

Plasmids. Dr. K. Partin (Colorado State University, Fort Collins,
CO) generously provided the cDNA for GluA1i and GluA2i in the
mammalian expression vector pRK5 and GluA4i in mammalian ex-pression vector pRK7. The cDNAs for TARP subunits 2, 3, 4, and
8 in mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 were generously supplied by Dr. D. S. Bredt (University of California, San Francisco, CA).
Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells. HEK293 cells were
grown in a 10-cm culture dish until they were 70 to 90% confluent.
Cells were then transfected with 10 g of total plasmid DNA by using
Lipofectamine 2000 (DNA:Lipofectamine 1:2) in Opti-MEM se-rum-free medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cotransfections contained 5 g of a plasmid with AMPA receptor cDNA and 5 g of a
plasmid with TARP cDNA. When AMPA receptors were expressed
alone, 5 g of a noncoding vector was used in place of the TARP
plasmid. The transfection mixture was replaced with normal culture
medium containing 100 M 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(DNQX) after 16 to 18 h. Cells were harvested for binding tests 40 to
50 h after starting the transfection.
Brain Dissections. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with
halothane and decapitated according to an institutionally approved
protocol and in observation of the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. Adults were 3 to 5 months old, and pups were of
postnatal day 14 to 16. The brain was extracted from the skull,
immediately placed in ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl,
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and dissected into eight general regions:
frontal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus,
hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem. The sections were frozen
in 320 mM sucrose plus 0.2 mM EGTA (pH 7.0).
Membrane Preparation and Binding Assays. P2 fractions
were prepared from frozen brain sections by using a conventional
protocol involving homogenization in isotonic sucrose, differential
centrifugation, osmotic lysis, and repeated washing (Kessler and
Arai, 2006). On the day of the experiment, membranes were thawed,
tip-sonicated, washed again, and suspended in Hepes/Tris buffer
(HT; 100 mM HEPES, 100 M EGTA, pH 7.4). Protein was measured
according to the method of Bradford (1976), using bovine serum
albumin as standard. Binding was measured at 25°C so that the
basic kinetic properties of the receptors would be similar to those of
receptors in excised-patch recordings. For binding tests, membrane
aliquots (5–50 g of protein) were mixed with 20 nM [3H]fluorowillardiine (FW) and appropriate additions in HT to a final volume of 50
l. CX546 was added from 166.7-fold concentrated stock solutions in
dimethyl sulfoxide; control samples contained dimethyl sulfoxide at
the equivalent final concentration of 0.6%. Samples were incubated
at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at 22,000g for
10 min. The supernatant was removed, and pellets were washed with
1.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KSCN, 5 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 7.4). Pellets were dissolved with Beckman Tissue Solubilizer (BTS-450; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and scintillation
fluid (containing 13 mM acetic acid) was added to determine radioactivity.
Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were rinsed in their culture
dish with ice-cold harvest buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl,
100 M EGTA, pH 7.4) followed by incubation in this buffer for 2 min
at 0°C. In all steps preceding binding, cells and buffers were kept at
0 to 4°C. Cells were harvested with a transfer pipette and homogenized with a PowerGen 125 tissue homogenizer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Homogenates were washed twice by centrifugation at 37,000g for 15 min and resuspension in ice-cold harvest buffer. Homogenates were then subjected to at least one freeze/

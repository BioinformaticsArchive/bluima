non-neuronal origin in which, consistent with its proposed function in fundamental signalling events, it
was found to be expressed ubiquitously39. Differences
in abundance between the various ShcA isoforms were
detected, however39. p52ShcA and p46ShcA isoforms are
found in every cell type with an invariant reciprocal
relationship, while p66ShcA expression is tissue-restricted
(mainly found in epithelial cells), suggesting that the
three different ShcA isoforms might serve different
functions. Accordingly, it was shown that unlike
p52ShcA and p46ShcA, p66ShcA does not transform mouse
fibroblasts in vitro, nor does it induce MAPK or Fos
activities, even though it is phosphorylated by EGF,
bound to the EGFR and complexed to Grb2, like other
ShcA isoforms41.

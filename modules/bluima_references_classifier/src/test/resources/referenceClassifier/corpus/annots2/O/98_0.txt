The modulating effects of electrical stimulation ES. in the reward sites RSs. of the hypothalamus and adjacent brain areas on the
defensive reaction DR. in response to peripheral noxious stimulation PNS. and on evoked potentials EPs. recorded in the thalamic
centromedian–parafascicular complex CM-Pf. to the same PNS have been investigated in 20–40-, 41–60-day old and 3–5-month old
rabbits. Previously, RSs were identified by the method of intracranial self-stimulation ICSS.. Behavioral and electrophysiological
testings successively performed on each rabbit first awake and then anaesthetized have revealed the ES in all investigated RSs to inhibit
DR and EPs. These effects were not observed if the stimulating electrode tip was localized in emotionally neutral brain sites. In
behavioral testings, the antinociceptive effect of rewarding stimulation was positively correlated with the ICSS intensity in given brain
sites regardless of the age of the rabbits. In electrophysiological testings, a similar dependence of nociceptive EPs inhibition on emotional
values of stimulated brain sites determined as a rate of lever pressings during ICSS. was discovered only in 20–40-day and 3–5-month
old rabbits. Stimulation of low emotional value RSs low rate LR.-rabbits. exerted a weaker inhibitory influence in 3–5-month old
rabbits in comparison with 20–40- and 41–60-day old rabbits both in behavioral and electrophysiological testings. The weakest
antinociceptive effect of rewarding stimulation among the rabbits with a high rate of lever pressings HR-rabbits. was found in 41–60-day
olds in electrophysiological testings. In 41–60-day old rabbits, we have observed a discrepancy between the behavioral analgesia and its
electrophysiological correlates. It may be suggested that the observed peculiarities of antinociceptive influences produced by RSs ES are
determined by the age factors of neurotransmitter brain systems. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

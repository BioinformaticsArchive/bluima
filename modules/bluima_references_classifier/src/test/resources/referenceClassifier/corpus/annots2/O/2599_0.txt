familial cases were identical to those found in

experimental scrapie. All were distinguishable from
ferritin and detergent aggregates, and had a diameter of
10-12 nm. In the lower part of the figure are
electronmicrographs of scrapie and CJD material. The
concentration of these particles, as judged by
electronmicroscopy, was at least ten times higher in the
scrapie sample. The particles have not been found in
similar fractions from control cases and from the
Alzheimer's disease case.

Cerebral cortices from 12- or 14-day embryonic WT and PSD-93
KO mice were removed and digested for 15 min at 37 °C in PBS
supplemented with 0.15 unit/mL papain, 2 mM cysteine, 3 mM
glucose, and 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. After addition of
heat-inactivated horse serum, cells were gently dissociated by
trituration and centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min. The cells were
resuspended in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, 5% (vol/vol) horse
serum, 1 mM pyruvate, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 25 g/mL streptomycin, filtered twice through 70- m and 40- m filters, and centrifuged 600 g for 10 min. Cells were then resuspended in supplemented DMEM (as described above) and plated at a density of
5 105 cells/well in six-well dishes coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cell cultures were fed every 4
days with Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with B-27 and glutamine. Cultures were maintained
in a 37 °C humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere and
used at 10 days in vitro to analyze tyrosine phosphorylation of
NR2B.

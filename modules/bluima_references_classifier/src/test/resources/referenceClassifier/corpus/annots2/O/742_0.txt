The corticosterone and glucose responses to a 5-min swim were
examined in the same rats used for 2DG and insulin tests. On the test
day, rats were attached to the blood collection lines and placed in the test
chambers for 1 h before collection of the preswim baseline sample. Rats
were placed individually for 5 min in a bucket of water maintained at
37 C. They were then removed from the water, towel-dried, and returned
to the test chambers for the remainder of the test. Blood samples were
collected at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min after the start of the swim.

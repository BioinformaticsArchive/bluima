Fig. 6 Western blotting analysis of glycoprotein (gp) 130 dimerization
under reducing (a) and non-reducing (b) conditions. Interleukin-6 binds
to its receptor and consequently induces dimerization of gp130, which
results in activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway. Crude samples
from control spinal cord and 12 h after spinal cord injury (SCI) were
subjected to western blotting with anti-actin (a-Actin) and anti-gp130
(a-gp130) antibodies. Note the 260-kDa band was detected under
non-reducing conditions 12 h after SCI (b). CNT; control spinal cord
without compression. The experiments were performed four times with
similar results.

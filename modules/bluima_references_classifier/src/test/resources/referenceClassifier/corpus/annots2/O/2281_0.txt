Recordings from lateral
geniculate nucleus
The findings of part I indicate that PMLS
receives visual input from a pathway originating in retinal Y-cells. To determine if
some of this input is transmitted directly to
PMLS from the lateral geniculate nucleus, I
sought to record from cells in the LGNd that
could be activated antidromically from the
lateral suprasylvian area. A special effort was
made to record from cells in the MIN, since
this component of the LGNd is known to
contain Y-cells (14, 43, 49, 58) and to have
a substantial projection to the lateral suprasylvian cortex (3, 19, 37, 45, 47, 64, 68, 87).
Recordings from a cell lying at the lateral
border of MIN are illustrated in Fig. 4. This
unit was identified as a geniculate Y-cell on
the basis of its short latency of activation
from the OD (1.4 ms, Fig. 4A) and OX (0.9
ms, Fig. 4B) and its small OD-OX latency
difference (0.5 ms). Stimulation of ipsilateral
PMLS evoked a short-latency action potential
(Fig. 4C), whose antidromic origin was confirmed by its collision with orthodromic
spikes evoked from the OX (Fig. 40) and by

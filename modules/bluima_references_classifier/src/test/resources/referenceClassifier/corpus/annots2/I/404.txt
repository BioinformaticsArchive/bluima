dental since only a limited number of sites and nodules were
analyzed, they compare favorably with earlier studies in which
spore (+) and spore (-) type Frankia populations were found
to coexist on the same root system (30). In artificial medium,
the Frankia population of the spore (-) type exhibited larger
specific N2-fixing activity than the population of the spore (+)
type. In contrast to our results, however, the introduction of a
Frankia population of the spore (-) type into soil harboring an
indigenous population of the spore (+) type did not result in
the development of significant numbers of nodules of the spore
(-) type nor in an increase of the N2 fixation rate. Plant growth
of A. glutinosa was much more enhanced after inoculation with
a Frankia strain obtained from nodules of the spore (-) type
than after inoculation with homogenates of nodules of the
spore (+) type or a mixture of both (29).
In summary, our study has shown that introduced Frankia
strains incubated in leaf-litter-amended and nonamended soil
for several weeks in the absence of plants remained infective
and competitive for nodulation with the indigenous Frankia
populations on the host plant Alnus glutinosa. Inoculation into
and incubation in soil without host plants generally supported
subsequent plant growth performance and increased the percentage of nitrogen acquired by the host plants through N2-fixation. Further studies, however, need to address long-term
effects of such an inoculation on nodulation activity. The po-tential activation of indigenous Frankia populations through
increasing the availability of nutrients rather than through in-oculation with pure cultures warrants investigation as well.

(data not shown). Brain-specific RhoB content is significantly
decreased in G M/G M lines relative to WT (Fig. 6 B). Thus,
increasing or decreasing the level of ABC transporters in the Dm
SPG can alter xenobiotic partition at the humoral/CNS interface
in much the same way that changes in MDR1/Pgp expression
alters xenobiotic penetration into the cytoplasm of isolated cultured cells (Chaudhary and Roninson, 1993).
Pharmacokinetic models predict that altering the level of ABC
transporter expression or localization will shift the chemical partition of drugs in the BBB-protected space (Schinkel, 1999). Be-cause Mdr65 resides in the apical membrane of the SPG in flies,
the cytoplasm of SPG cells is included in the BBB-protected zone,
and varying the level of Mdr65 should alter the sensitivity of SPG
cells to ABC transportable cytotoxins in a predictable manner. To
test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of the anti-microtubule
agent vinblastine on SPG cell function. VB was chosen because it
is transported by Mdr65 in vitro (data not shown). Because breakdown of the cytoskeleton affects the integrity of paracellular junctions, SPG cell function can be assayed by monitoring the passage
of large MW dextrans from the hemolymph into the CNS. In the
absence of VB, the paracellular diffusion barrier is intact, and the
3 kDa FITC– dextran is entirely peripheral to the brain (Fig. 6C or
D, and data not shown). When WT animals are coinjected with
3.3 mM VB and FITC– dextran, a small but significant amount of
FITC signal leaks into the CNS (Fig. 6C, left). Under the same
conditions, Ex8 brains accumulate FITC– dextran internal to the
SPG more than WT brains, indicating that mdr65 loss of function
increases the sensitivity of SPG cells to VB (Fig. 6C, right, and data
not shown). Similar results are obtained when Mdr65 loss of
function is directed to the SPG by Mdr65 RNAi (Fig. 2 E); thus,
cell-autonomous Mdr65 function provides some measure of chemoprotection at the barrier interface (data not shown). We performed the same experiment on mdr65 overexpressors using 6.6
mM VB. These animals accumulated significantly lower levels of
FITC– dextran than WT (Fig. 6 D, G M/G M). In vivo retinal
dye penetration studies corroborated the results obtained above
by direct assessment of retinal fluor content (Fig. 6C,D, bottom
panels). These results indicate that anatomically selective changes
in Mdr65 can lead to altered levels of chemical neuroprotection
and suggest that modulation of individual components of the
BBB can be exploited to adjust the entry of specific drugs into the
brain.

Materials and Methods
Nonhuman primates. Two gonadally intact adolescent (4 –5 years old)
male rhesus monkeys (Macacca mulatta, 8.9 and 7.7 kg) participated in
the studies. Monkeys were housed individually in temperature- and
humidity-controlled rooms maintained on a 12 h light/dark schedule
with lights on at 7:00 A.M. Monkeys were fed Monkey Diet Biscuit daily
after each experimental session and were weighed biweekly. They participated in a psychological enrichment program. The animal protocol was
approved by the Yale and Veterans Administration Animal Care and Use
Committees and is in compliance with United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Nicotine administration. Nicotine was administered orally using the
dose escalation paradigm described previously (Pietila et al., 1998). Nicotine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was administered in a saccharin–Kool-Aid
(Kraft Foods, Northfield, IL) solution as the sole source of fluid on a daily
basis (with the exception of days of nicotine withdrawal before each scan
and also for the day of and immediately after the scan). During weeks
0 – 4, the animals increased their average nicotine consumption from 3.3
to 37.5 mg/kg. During the last 5– 8 weeks of the study, the animals'
average daily nicotine consumption was 30 –38 mg/kg. After 6 and 8
weeks, the nicotine solution was removed and the monkeys had access to
water. Monkeys were imaged 1–2 d after 6 weeks and 7 d after 8 weeks of
nicotine exposure.
[123I]5-IA SPECT imaging of nonhuman primates. Nonhuman primates were imaged using methods described previously (Staley et al.,
2000). Each animal was fasted for 18 –24 h before SPECT scanning. Two
hours before the study, the animal was immobilized using ketamine (10
mg/kg, i.m.), positioned on the bed of the SPECT camera, and immediately prepared with an endotracheal tube for administration of 2.5%
isoflurane. Glycopyrrolate (10 g/kg, i.m.), a long-acting peripheral an-ticholinergic drug that does not cross the blood– brain barrier, was coadministered with the initial ketamine injection to decrease respiratory and
digestive secretions. Body temperature was maintained at 35–36°C using
a heated water blanket. Vital signs, including heart rate, respiration rate,
oxygen saturation, and body temperature, were monitored every 15–30
min throughout each study. An intravenous perfusion line with 0.9%
saline was placed and used for the bolus injection and infusion of the
radiotracer. A second line was placed and was maintained with lactated
Ringer's solution at a rate of 1.8 ml kg 1 h 1 throughout the experiment and was used to obtain blood samples. The animal's head was
immobilized within the gantry with a “bean bag” that hardens on evacuation (Olympic Medical, Seattle, WA). [ 123I]5-IA was prepared to give
a product with radiochemical purity of 90%, and [ 123I]5-IA plasma
levels were measured as described previously (Zoghbi et al., 2001). Re-gional [ 123I]5-IA uptake was assessed after administration of [ 123I]5-IA
using the bolus (40.0 9.3 MBq) plus constant infusion (6.7 1.9
MBq/h) paradigm. Fifteen minute SPECT scans were acquired continuously for 8 h with the nonhuman primate brain-dedicated multislice
CERASPECT camera (Digital Scintigraphics, Waltham, MA), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained and processed as
described previously (Staley et al., 2000). The primary outcome measure

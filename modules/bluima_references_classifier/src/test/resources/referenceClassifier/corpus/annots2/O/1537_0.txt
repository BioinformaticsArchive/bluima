Introduction
The tight coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood
flow (CBF), known as functional hyperemia, is a complex phenomenon that was first described more than a century ago (Roy
and Sherrington, 1890). Despite this, its molecular and cellular
mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. A key molecule in neurovascular coupling is nitric oxide (NO), which has been identified
as both a mediator and modulator of vascular responses that
accompany increased neuronal activity (Iadecola and Zhang,
1996; Lindauer et al., 1999). In the cerebellum, functional hyperemia is dissociated from the spiking of principal neurons, the
Purkinje cells (Caesar et al., 2003; Thomsen et al., 2004), and
relies almost exclusively on release of the potent vasodilator NO

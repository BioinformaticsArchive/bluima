wound healing in the CNS are extremely complex.
Thus, as a regrowing axon encounters an area of reactive astrocytes, the growth cone encounters molecular
messages from the ECM that may signal either growth
promotion or inhibition. A recent investigation indicates that significant regrowth of CNS axons can occur
in the adult brain in the absence of a reactive ECM
(Davies et al., 1997). Therefore, the ability of a substance
to eliminate changes in matrix composition following
injury could have a profound influence on the maintenance of a growth-permissive environment necessary
for successful regeneration.
Previous studies have noted that neurofilamentpositive axons appear within the perilesion area 4
weeks post-lesioning and proceed to the injury site,
where they terminate (Stichel & Muller, 1994). Our data
indicate that there is a major disruption of neurofilament-positive fibers within the corpus callosum in the
saline-treated animals after 30 days, whereas this same
area displays a relative abundance of neurofilamentpositive fibers in the suramin-treated animals. While
this finding is exciting and provocative, it remains to be
investigated whether these fibers are regrowing or are
simply spared due to the alleviation of some of the
sequelae following injury. However, these results do
suggest that disruption of the immune and/or gliotic
response early after injury may be sufficient to enhance
wound repair, which is analogous to the critical time
frame in which drug therapy must be initiated following spinal cord injury if it is to have any salutary effect
(Bracken et al., 1990).
In summary, we have demonstrated that a single
intracerebral injection of suramin can reduce several
facets of the immune and/or gliotic response. Whether
this reduction in gliosis and inflammation results in an
improvement of recovery of function is worthy of further investigation. Moreover, if the major protective
action of suramin occurs via the blockade of growth
factor actions, blockade of individual growth factors
using specific antibodies and/or antagonists might be
expected to enhance recovery. In conclusion, such interventions may be of use in controlling the inflammatory
response to brain injury and therefore facilitating re-covery from CNS trauma.

A
utosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD- PKD) is the most frequent inherited nephropathy and
an important cause of ESRD (1). Mutations in two
genes, PKD1 and PKD2, have been associated with ADPKD.
Mutations in PKD1 account for approximately 85% of the af-fected families, and they are associated with a renal disease that
progresses more rapidly than in families with PKD2 (2). PKD1
and PKD2 encode integral membrane proteins, polycystin-1
and polycystin-2, that interact in renal primary cilia and regulate the proliferation and differentiation of renal tubular cells
via different signaling pathways (3). Mutations in PKD1/PKD2
disrupt these pathways, leading to cystogenesis by a combination of increased cellular proliferation, abnormal fluid secre-

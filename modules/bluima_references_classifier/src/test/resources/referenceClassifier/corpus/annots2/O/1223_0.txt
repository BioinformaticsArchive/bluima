abuse has previously been detected by immunoblotting in several
brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum,
amygdala and prefrontal cortex (Hope et al., 1994a; Nye et al.,
1995; Nye & Nestler, 1996; Pich et al., 1997). Its presence has also
been detected in striatum by immunohistochemistry (Hiroi &
Graybiel, 1996; Hiroi et al., 1997). The functional role of DFosB
expression in the striatal complex has been characterized by using
transgenic mice. Short-term DFosB expression in the striatal
complex reduces preference for cocaine (McClung & Nestler,
2003), while long-term striatal expression increases the locomotoractivating and rewarding effects of cocaine (Kelz et al., 1999;
Colby et al., 2003). However, despite the fact that the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) is also an important substrate for drugs of
abuse (Wise, 1988, 1996), drug induction of DFosB has not been
detected in this brain region by Western blotting. Given the longstanding evidence that the VTA is critical for motivated behaviors,
and the accumulating evidence that drugs affect many different cell
populations through VTA circuitry (Bonci & Malenka, 1999;
Cornish & Kalivas, 2001; McFarland & Kalivas, 2001; Koeltzow
& White, 2003; Marinelli et al., 2003; Thomas & Malenka, 2003),
the present study further investigated the DFosB response in this
brain region.
Here we used immunohistochemistry, which is more sensitive than
Western blotting and provides greater anatomical detail, to detect
DFosB after chronic drug treatment. We used two antibodies: one that

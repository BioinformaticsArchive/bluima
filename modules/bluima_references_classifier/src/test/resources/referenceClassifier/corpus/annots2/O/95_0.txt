cells remain located in the molecular layer, suggesting a failure
to complete migration from the external to the internal granule
cell layer. In contrast to the Purkinje and granule cell populations, all three of the deep cerebellar nuclear cell groupings
form correctly and are composed of cells of both mutant and
wild-type genotypes. Despite similarities of the cdk5 -/- phenotype to that reported in reeler and mdab-1 -/- (scrambler/
yotari) mutant brains, reelin and disabled-1 mRNA were found
to be normal in cdk5 -/- brain. Together, the data further support the hypothesis that Cdk5 activity is required for specific
components of neuronal migration that are diferentially re-quired by diferent neuronal cell types and by even a single
neuronal cell type at diferent developmental stages.

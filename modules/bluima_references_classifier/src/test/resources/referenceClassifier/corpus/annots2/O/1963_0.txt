ever, we did not perform a quantitative analysis of possible
changes in response strength in relation to SWA modulation of DCN activity. Given the findings in this study we
re-analyzed a population of DCN neurons classified as
responsive (n 36) or unresponsive (n 13) to lip stimulation, which showed some degree of SWA modulation in
their baseline activity. Because the rate of DCN firing was
modulated by the SWA rhythm we could estimate the SWA
phase at the time of sensory stimulation by tracking the
time of the preceding maximum in DCN firing rate. Our
analysis of spike counts during the short latency excitatory
(SLE) or the inhibitory (INH) response periods as a function of SWA phase at time of stimulation did show that
each response component was modulated by the relation
between stimulus time and SWA phase (Supp. Fig. 2).
Specifically a significant increase in spike count was ob-served during both response periods when the stimulus
occurred closer to a preceding rate maximum (Supp. Fig.
2B, C), which we showed to be related to cortical downstates. Strong sensory responses during cortical down
states are not surprising given that somatosensory cortex
may show a heightened sensitivity to sensory input during
down states (Sachdev et al., 2004). However, we found a

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we describe a novel rat protein whose
primary structure and domain organization define it as a novel
isoform of the TPR domain protein SGT (Fig. 1). This novel
isoform, which is almost exclusively expressed in the brain,
was named SGT, and the previously described, ubiquitously
expressed variant (13, 17) was named SGT. In an initial
comparison, the two SGT isoforms showed very similar characteristics with respect to their main protein interaction partners such as Hsc70 and CSP (Fig. 4 â€“ 6), indicating that SGT
and SGT operate in a very similar functional context in cells,
particularly in the brain.
Like Hop, CHIP, and TOM70, SGTs belong to a group of
proteins that use TPR domains to bind to the very C terminus
of Hsc70. Based on the structural information available for the
interaction of Hop with the C terminus of Hsc70, we performed
experiments that helped to define the Hsc70 binding mode of
SGTs. The crystal structure of the C-terminal seven amino acid
residues of Hsc70 in complex with the first TPR domain of Hop,
which as in SGTs contains three TPRs, revealed an Hsc70

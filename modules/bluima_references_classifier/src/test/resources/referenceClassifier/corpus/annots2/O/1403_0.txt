and severe but incomplete on the right L2–5
and S1– 4. Detrusor areflexia was present, but
with normal compliance. The anal tone was
normal. Laminectomy with removal of spinous process for T11-L1 levels
and neurolysis were performed 88 days after vertebroplasty. During surgery, 2 free pieces of bone cement were found compressing the spinal
cord over the L1–2 level. A larger amount of whitish bone cement was
located in the epidural space of T12–L2 and the foramen of T12/L1 and
L1/L2 bilaterally. On pathologic examination, the arachnid membrane
showed fibrosis and thickening (Fig 3G) and the epidural soft tissue
showed fat necrosis and focal chronic inflammation cell infiltration (Fig
3H). On follow-up 4.75 years after percutaneous vertebroplasty, she still
depends on a Foley catheter and is bedridden with stool incontinence.
Her left leg can move, but not against gravity. Her right leg cannot move
at all. Her son is seeking recovery from these problems, but this seems
hopeless within the constraints of current medical practice.
The patient experienced no lower leg weakness before vertebroplasty. Laminectomy was performed immediately following vertebroplasty because of an intraspinal leak. Lower leg weakness was found
after these procedures. The chief operator agrees that this patient's
new neurologic deficits appearing after vertebroplasty were caused by
an intraspinal leak of bone cement.
This was an early case of a neurosurgeon with inadequate materials and an immature technique. He drilled a passage in the pedicle

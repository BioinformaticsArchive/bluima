was overlaid on 1 ml of buffer #2 in an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 19,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman Optima TL
Ultracentrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 750 l buffer #1 and repelleted at
1000 g for 15 min twice to ensure that the pellet was free of contamination. The resulting nuclear fraction was resuspended in 1% STE.
The samples were then mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli
buffer with -mercaptoethanol and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. Blots
were probed with an AB against calcium calmodulin protein kinase 1
(CamK), a cytoplasmic protein, to assess purity of nuclear cell fractions and as the loading control for whole tissue homogenates. The
CamK AB was from Affinity BioReagents, Inc., Golden, CO, USA (0.5
g/ml). RNA polymerase (Pol II), a nuclear protein, was used as the
loading control for the nuclear fractions. The Pol II AB was from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA (H-224; 1:500
dilution). Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined
using G-Biosciences (St. Louis, MO, USA) CB-X Protein Assay Kits
according to manufacture's instructions. N-glycosylation of NK3-R
was assessed using PGNaseF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Samples were mixed in an equal volume of Laemmli buffer, then
heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and incubated with PGNaseF (5U) and
Triton-X-100 (2.5 l) for 3 h at 37 °C. Additional denaturation experiments were performed by heating samples in Laemmli buffer with
0.1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 100 °C for 30 – 60 min.

DISCUSSION

Zn 2/ and benzodiazepines can be effective modulators of
GABAergic responses in the SCN. It has been suggested
that zinc is present in the SCN, possibly representing a synaptically releasable pool within presynaptic terminals ( Hu-ang et al. 1993 ) , and raising the possibility that it may act as
an endogenous modulator. Benzodiazepines are commonly
prescribed anxiolytics that can influence circadian behavior
in rodent models. Reports on the effects of these modulators
on SCN neurons have produced differing conclusions in the
literature. We found that Zn 2/ inhibited ( in a dose-dependent
manner ) responses, produced by endogenous sources of

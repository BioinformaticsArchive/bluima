intriguing prospect that a similar form of tonic inhibition in VB
neurons contributes to the specific modifications of sleep EEG
patterns induced by etomidate and other hypnotics.
Here, we characterized GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in thalamic nRT and VB neurons of wild-type
(WT), 2 / , and 2N265S mice (Sur et al., 2001; Reynolds et al.,
2003). We report that, in this circuit, GABAA receptor-mediated
transmission is dominated by the tonic, extrasynaptic conductance of VB neurons. Zolpidem does not induce SWS, and this
hypnotic had no effect on the tonic conductance, whereas 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP or Gaboxadol)
and etomidate both induce SWS, and in common these hypnotics
greatly increased the tonic conductance. These findings suggest
that enhancement of extrasynaptic inhibition in the thalamus
may underlie the sleep EEG profile of THIP and etomidate.

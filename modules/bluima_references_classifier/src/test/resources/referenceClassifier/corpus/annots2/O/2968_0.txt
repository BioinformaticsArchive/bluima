tecta and the rodent midbrain (Cheng et al., 1995; Drescher et al.,
1995; Donoghue et al., 1996; Z hang et al., 1996). In the chick, the
ability of ephrin-A2 and -A5 to repel RGC fibers has been
demonstrated, using both cell membrane fraction assays and the
transfection of tectal cells (Drescher et al., 1995; Nakamoto et al.,
1996; Monschau et al., 1997). However, little evidence has been
provided for ephrin-A2 and -A5 function in the mouse, in which
knock-outs and other key genetic experiments will take place, and
considerable differences exist between avian and rodent retinotopic development (Vanegas, 1984; Simon and O'Leary, 1990,
1991; Roskies et al., 1995). For example, the extension of optic
fibers across their targets differs both in the laminae in which they
extend and also in the overall length of their extension before the
rudimentary map begins to form [compare chick from studies by
Crossland et al. (1974, 1975) and Vanselow et al. (1989) with
rodent from studies by Sachs and Schneider (1984), Stein (1984),
Edwards et al. (1986a,b), and Frost et al. (1986)]. Moreover, in
rodents, the contact-mediated repulsion observed in culture is not
reflected by retinal outgrowth patterns in vivo (Godement et al.,
1984; Simon and O'Leary, 1992), suggesting that living superior
colliculus (SC) cells must be examined for their vital ability to
repel axons. Neither previous cell culture assays nor the molecular patterns of ephrin-A2 and -A5 have suggested underlying
mechanisms that may account for the differences that exist during
development of the avian and rodent retinotopic maps. Importantly, a single parallel functional and molecular analysis has not
been made with cellular resolution in any system.
We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the different growth
cone behaviors that are revealed when RGCs encounter individ-

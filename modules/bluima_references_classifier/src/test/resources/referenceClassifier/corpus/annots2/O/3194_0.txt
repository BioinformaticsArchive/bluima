b-Galactosidase staining
Four weeks after the transplantations, mice were anaesthetized and
transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS.
Brains were removed, postfixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde
on ice, and equilibrated overnight at 4 °C in PBS/30% sucrose.
Sections (40 mm) were incubated free-floating in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-galactoside (X-Gal) (Sigma) at 37 °C (Jones et al., 1996).
After X-Gal staining, sections were counterstained with neutral red
(Sigma).

RESULTS
The probe trials confirmed that the procedure resulted in a conditioned response to the stimulus presented during the conditioning
sessions and not to the second stimulus. Rats conditioned to the
compound stimulus showed intermediate levels of conditioned re-sponding to either stimulus alone (Fig. 1; interaction of group and
stimulus, F(2,12) = 24.7, p < 0.01).
Modality-specific subsectors of the thalamic reticular nucleus
were activated according to the attended stimuli. Neurons stained
positively for Fos protein were more numerous in the sector of the
thalamic reticular nucleus associated with the conditioned, at-tended, stimulus (Figs. 2, 3). Thus, rats conditioned to light showed
activation of visual thalamic reticular nucleus, whereas rats conditioned to tone showed activation of the auditory thalamic reticular
nucleus. Rats who had received previous conditioning to the compound stimulus showed activation of both visual and auditory

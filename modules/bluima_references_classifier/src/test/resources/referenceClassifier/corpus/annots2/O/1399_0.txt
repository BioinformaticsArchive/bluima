Fig. 4. (A) Changes in density of GAD neurons in the hollows of row B vibrissae in all groups in experimental (“trained”) and control hemispheres.
The values represent the mean number of the GAD neurons 105/ m2, SD. There is a significant difference between experimental (“trained”) and
control hemispheres in the group of animals receiving aversive training (CS UCS). *** P 0.001. The asterisk denotes where the experimental
hemisphere differs significantly from the control side of CS UCS group and experimental and control sides of all control groups. ANOVA, followed
by post hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test, CS UCS n 8, PSEUDO n 6, CS only n 7, UCS only n 6, Naive animals, n 6 (six
hemispheres), exp, experimental side; ctrl, control side. (B) Changes in density of the double immunofluorescent staining GAD /PV in row B hollows
in both experimental (“trained”) and control hemispheres in all experimental groups. The values represent the mean number of GAD /PV neurons
105/ m2, SD. CS UCS n 8, PSEUDO n 6, CS only n 7, UCS only n 6, Naive animals, n 6 (six hemispheres).

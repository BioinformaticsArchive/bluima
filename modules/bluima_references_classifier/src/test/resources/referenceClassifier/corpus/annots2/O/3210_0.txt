Figure 9. Comparison of variance accounted for by three models. Variance accounted for was calculated as 100 * (1 - var(obs - pred)/
var(obs)). A, Linear model compared against the model of Simoncelli and
Heeger (1998). B, Linear model compared against the generalized powerlaw summation model. Note that all three models provided fair accounts
of the data but also that the generalized model provided the consistently
lowest errors.

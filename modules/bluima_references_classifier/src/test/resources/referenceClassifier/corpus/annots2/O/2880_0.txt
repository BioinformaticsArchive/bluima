The vagina and medulla of the adrenal gland of
mice vaginally infected with herpes simplex virus
(HSV) types 1 and 2 were examined in the latent
stage of infection (5 to 51 weeks post-infection).
RNA in situ hybridization with HSV-1 and -2 latencyassociated transcript (LAT) RNA probes resulted in
positively stained neuronal cell nuclei in the uterovaginal plexus, but not in the medulla of the adrenal
gland. These organs were chosen because HSV
antigens can be detected not only in the vaginal
epithelium, but also in neurons of the uterovaginal
plexus and in the medulla of the adrenal gland at
the acute stage of genital infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing LATs in
neurons of the uterovaginal plexus in the genital
tract of latently HSV-infected mice.

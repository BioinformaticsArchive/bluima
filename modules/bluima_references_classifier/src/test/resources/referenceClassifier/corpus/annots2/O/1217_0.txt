sufficiently to reverse facilitation of neuronal activity in the
Kir6.2(–/–) neurons due to membrane depolarization, al-though the mechanism of spike facilitation and membrane
depolarization observed in Kir6.2(–/–) SNr neurons is currently unknown.
Another issue regarding neuronal K channels is the
ATP
functional role of presynaptic K channels [16,30–33]. For
ATP
example, in GABAergic synapses on SNr neurons, as well as
postsynaptic K channels on SNr neurons, presynaptic K
ATP ATP
channels expressed on the terminal of axons originating from
GABAergic striatal neurons have been reported [8]. Amoroso et al. [30] suggested that hyperpolarization in the terminal caused by activation of presynaptic K channels during
ATP
metabolic stress reduces GABA release and so facilitates SNr
neuron activity, leading to a seizure-prone state. In our condition of isolation from presynaptic effects by the presence
of blockers of both excitatory and inhibitory fast neurotransmissions, the firing rates of both wild-type and Kir6.2(–/–)
GABAergic SNr neurons increased about 35% in normoxia,
indicating some facilitatory effect of blocked GABAergic
transmissions on the firings of SNr neurons. However, the
responses to hypoxic challenge in the presence and absence
of blockers were similar: a striking contrast in the spontaneous firing rate of SNr neurons, a net decrease in wild-type
and a net increase in Kir6.2(–/–) neurons, indicating that the
opening of the postsynaptic K channels is pivotal in the
ATP
hypoxia-induced responses of wild-type SNr neurons. Re-cently, a new approach to evaluating pre- and postsynaptic
K channel to neuronal activity during metabolic inhibiATP
tion has been reported in CA1 neurons using `synaptic bouton preparation', in which single neurons can be isolated with
their synaptic terminals attached and functional [34]. In that
study, metabolic inhibition induced by NaCN produced a
tolbutamide-inhibitable outward current in postsynaptic
somatic membrane, while the frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was in-creased. Both of these actions should reduce neuronal excitability and function protectively for CA1 neurons. In addition,
the increase in mIPSC frequency was not affected by tolbutamide, although diazoxide decreased the frequency, suggesting that presynaptic K channels on GABAergic terminals
ATP
on CA1 neurons are functional in this condition but are not
activated to reduce synaptic release during metabolic stress
when postsynaptic K channels are being activated.

Regarding the sensitivity of K channels to hypoxic
ATP
insult, it is also important to note that wild-type mice exhibited generalized convulsion in very severe hypoxic conditions such as 4.3% O for 150 s [24]. On the other hand, in
2

milder hypoxic conditions such as 7.3% O , most of the Kir

6.2(–/–) mice showed no convulsion and none died. It has
been reported that the tolerance of conscious animals to
hypoxia increases very rapidly when the oxygen concentration is above 5%, while below 4% O , survival time is
2

extremely short (<10 min) [35]. Thus, K channels may
ATP
fully exert their protective role only in limited severities of
hypoxic challenge just above the critical transition. In addi-

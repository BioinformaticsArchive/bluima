veloped for treatment of AD, relatively little is known
regarding how these drugs affect receptor occupancy by
ACh. A method to measure changes in mAChR receptor
occupancy by ACh could lead to much improved pharmaceuticals or dosage regimens.
In vivo imaging of muscarinic cholinergic receptor
availability, using positron emission tomography (PET)
or single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT), offers a method for evaluating ACh occupancy
of mAChR, provided a radiopharmaceutical with demonstrated sensitivity to ACh levels were to be available.
Although a large number of mAChR radioligands have
been developed for PET and SPECT imaging in the hu-man brain (Eckelman et al., 1985; Dannals et al., 1988;
Wilson et al., 1989; Dewey et al., 1990; Wilson et al.,
1991; Frey et al., 1992; Koeppe et al., 1994; Mulholland
et al., 1995; Farde et al., 1996; Carson et al., 1998), most
have been aimed at measuring the numbers of binding
sites and not towards measuring changes of endogenous
ACh levels. In this study, the authors evaluated the sensitivity of N-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-4-piperidyl benzilate
(4-[18F]FEPB)—a moderate affinity (K 1.7 nmol/L),
i

reversibly-binding, nonsubtype-selective mAChR an-tagonist (Skaddan et al., 2000)—to changes in brain ACh
levels induced by treatment with the AChE inhibitors
physostigmine and phenserine.

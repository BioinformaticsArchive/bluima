THE CENTRAL REGULATION of swallowing involves ``swallowing centers'' in the brain stem, which receive sensory input from the oropharynx and esophagus and,
together with peripheral peristaltic mechanisms, control much of the swallowing sequence (17, 25). However, the initiation of swallowing is a voluntary action
that requires the integrity of sensorimotor areas of the
cerebral cortex (27). If these higher centers, or their
connections to the brain stem, are damaged, then
patients have severe difficulty in starting a swallow
(dysphagia) (5, 13). Pathophysiological evidence from
stroke patients has implicated a number of cerebral
regions important in the control of human swallowing,

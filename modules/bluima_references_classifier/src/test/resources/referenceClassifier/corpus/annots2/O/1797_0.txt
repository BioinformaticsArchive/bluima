treated BBEC are indistinguishable from those secreted by
primary bovine pulmonary endothelial cells treated with the
same number of bacteria (data not shown). Furthermore, this
BBEC line has been used extensively by others to investigate
the pathogenesis of a number of bacterial pathogens, including
E. coli (3, 50) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (82).
Perhaps the timing of events is a critical factor. Apoptosis of
H. somnus-treated primary bovine pulmonary endothelial cells
is minimal at the early time points investigated in this study. H.
somnus-treated BBEC do undergo appreciable levels of apoptosis following longer periods of incubation (data not shown).
The link between MLCK activity and apoptosis is controversial. Although some investigators have demonstrated that
pharmacological inhibition of MLCK protects cells against
apoptosis (14), others have shown reduced MLCK activity to
promote cell death (22). Clearly, the mechanistic coupling of
cytoskeletal alterations and apoptosis, in H. somnus-induced
vasculitis and in other systems, requires further investigation.
We found that conditioned medium from H. somnus-treated
monolayers modestly decreased TEER when added to fresh
BBEC monolayers. TNF- has been reported by others to
increase permeability of BBEC monolayers (46). However,
some investigators have reported no alterations in brain endothelial permeability in response to TNF- . For example,
Schnell et al. (56) reported that stereotactic injection of TNFinto the striata of rats resulted in no alteration of blood-brain
barrier integrity. Seynhaeve et al. (58) recently reported that
high doses of TNF- had no impact on tumor endothelial cells
in vitro, while coadministration of TNF- and interferon
caused severe morphological changes and inter-endothelial
cell gap formation. In our system, addition of TNF- alone did
not cause any change in TEER. However, addition of an

and immunohistochemistry (Cutler et al., 2001; Nyle ÃÅ n et
al., 2001).
In the brain stem we identified nNOS-immunoreactive
neurones within all major subdivisions of the NTS. nNOSimmunoreactive neurones were also found within the ventrolateral medulla although their distribution in this part of
the brain stem was scattered. The distribution of nNOSexpressing neurones within the NTS of the rat has been
described previously by a number of studies (Esteves et
al., 2000; Lawrence et al., 1998; Rodrigo et al., 1994). In
agreement with these reports, nNOS-immunoreactive neurones were observed in commissural, medial and central

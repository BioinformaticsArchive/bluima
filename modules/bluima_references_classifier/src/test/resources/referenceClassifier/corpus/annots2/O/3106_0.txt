MATERIALS AND METHODS
Explant preparation. Sprague Dawley rats at defined stages of pregnancy
[day of sperm detection = embryonic day 1 (E1)] were deeply anesthetized with 7% choral hydrate. Embryos were obtained by cesarean
section and decapitated, and the brains were transferred into Gey's
balanced salt solution supplemented with glucose (6.5 mg/ml). Pieces of
thalamic and cortical tissues were cut in 200 μm 3 explants with a
McIlwain tissue chopper.
Thalamic explants were obtained from E18 –E19 fetuses. At this de-velopmental stage, neurogenesis in the thalamus has just finished, and
major pronuclei, from which thalamic nuclei differentiate, are formed
(McAllister and Das, 1977; Altman and Bayer, 1979). The medial and
lateral parts of the differentiating thalamus were separated (Fig. 1 A). In
this study, the medial thalamus is called “limbic thalamus,” because it
gives rise to the main limbic-associated nuclei such as the anterior group
of nuclei, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the medioventral nucleus (Krettek and Price, 1977; Robertson and Kaitz, 1981; Deacon et al., 1983). The
medial thalamus also includes the habenular complex, which does not
project to or receive fibers from the cortex. In some experiments, the
habenula was dissected out from the limbic nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.
The lateral region of the developing thalamus contains the principal
nuclei that project to sensory and motor areas of the cortex; this region
will be referred to as “nonlimbic” thalamus. It includes the ventroposterior group of nuclei, which provide inputs to the somatosensory cortex, as
well as dorsolateral and medial geniculate bodies, which project to the
visual and auditory cortex, respectively (Wise and Jones, 1978; Paxinos
and Watson, 1982).
Cortical cells destined for either lateral limbic cortex or neocortex
were isolated from E16 embryos at a time when the cerebral wall is
essentially composed of subplate and deep cortical plate neurons (Miller,
1988; Bayer and Altman, 1991). Limbic cortical tissue was obtained from
the ventrolateral regions of the cerebral wall, at the border with developing striatum and paleocortex, and neocortical explants were prepared
from parietal cortex located dorsally (Fig. 1 B).
Preparation of native cortical membranes. Native membranes from
young postnatal animals [day of birth, E23 = postnatal day 0 (P0)] from
P3 to P7 were prepared according to the method of Go ̈tz et al. (1992).
Lateral limbic cortex and medio-dorsal neocortex were dissected in Gey's
balanced salt solution supplemented with glucose. Tissues were homogenized in buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM spermidine, 25
μg /ml aprotinin, 25 μg /ml leupeptin, 5 μg /ml pepstatin, and 15 μg /ml
2,3-dehydro-2-desoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid, pH 7.4), and the homog-

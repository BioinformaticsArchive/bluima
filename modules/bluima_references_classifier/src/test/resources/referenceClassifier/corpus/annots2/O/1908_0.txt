Drug infusion significantly affected high fat chow intake
(F(3,13) 39.0, P 0.001). DAMGO infusion into the NAcc
more than doubled consumption over the 2 h session (Fig.
1A). This effect occurred mainly in the first hour of consumption, with only minor consumption in the second hour
(Fig. 1B). Muscimol infusion into the VP greatly reduced
baseline consumption and this blockade of intake persisted when DAMGO was concurrently infused into the
NAcc (both P 0.01 relative to saline control).
The 100 ng/ l dose of VP muscimol decreased baseline consumption, making it difficult to dissociate specific
effects of this manipulation in blocking DAMGO-induced
increases in intake versus general suppressive effects on
consumption. To explore this issue further, we tested the
effects of a fourfold lower dose of muscimol. Similar to the
high dose, the low dose of VP muscimol significantly de-creased high fat chow consumption (F(3,13) 20.14,
P 0.001; Fig. 2). Bilateral infusion of 25 ng/ l muscimol
into the VP attenuated food intake to 60% of control levels,
a smaller decrease than seen with the higher muscimol
dose, but still significant (P 0.05). Concurrent infusion of
NAcc DAMGO significantly elevated consumption (P
0.001, relative to NAcc saline VP muscimol), but did not
restore the high levels of consumption seen after NAcc
DAMGO VP saline infusion (P 0.001, comparing NAcc
DAMGO VP muscimol).

FIG. 1. Survey of nucleus ovoidalis. Lefl: cytoarchitecture of the nucleus in the left thalamus, characterized by a densely
packed neuron group, in a 30-pm paraffin section stained with cresyl violet. RI&: distribution of afferent fibers and
terminals mark the same borders visible in the cytoarchitectonic picture. This borderline is easily visible in 400-pm slices.
Dark field illumination: labeling was achieved with [ `HI-glycine iniected into the left inferior colliculus. Radiolabeled axons
ascend through the tractus ovoidalis.

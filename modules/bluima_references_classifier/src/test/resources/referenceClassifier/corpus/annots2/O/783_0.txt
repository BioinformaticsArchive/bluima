Endogenous [32P]ADP-Ribosylation of MBP
Cortical regions from BD postmortem brain demonstrating differences in endogenous [32P]ADP-ribosylation of com- s

pared to nonpsychiatric comparison subjects were reassessed for
endogenous [32P]ADP-ribosylation of an exogenous substrate
protein, MBP. Endogenous [32P]ADP-ribosylation of this substrate was carried out as described above for isoforms, with
s

the addition of 300 g MBP before incubation of samples.
Endogenous [32P]ADP-ribosylation of MBP also was linear with
respect to both time (30 –120 min) and protein concentration
(100 – 400 g).

either stained with 0.05% osmium tetroxide for 30 seconds or
counterstained with Giemsa (In ÃÅiguez et al., 1985). Sections
were then dehydrated, cleared, and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). To test the specificity of the primary antibodies further, sections were prepared
from an animal that did not receive an injection with either
CTB or PHA-L, and probed immunohistochemically with these
antibodies. No specific staining was detected in any brain
regions, compared with control sections that were probed
without the primary antibodies.

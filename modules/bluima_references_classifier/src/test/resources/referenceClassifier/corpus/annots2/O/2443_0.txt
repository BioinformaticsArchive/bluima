Visuotectal projections from 'pie-slice' compound eyes 31
projected rostrocaudally and the original ventrodorsal axis projected
mediolaterally. This is the orientation in which a normal eye projects to the optic
tectum (Gaze, 1958) (Fig. 1).
Studies on these types of compound eye suggest that many features of the maps
from compound eyes are determined by the original, embryonic, positions of the
two eye fragments. It would seem that during normal development each part of
the eye rudiment acquires a. positional value, a unique identity which reflects its
position in the orbit (and remains with it if it is transplanted to form, say, a
compound eye). This set of positional values has the following effects: the
orientation of the partial map made by each part of the retina is specified by its
positional values, and so is independent of the orientation in which the remainder of the eye projects; fibres from cells of similar embryonic retinal origin (i.e.
with similar positional values) are made to share the same piece of tectum
whereas fibres of dissimilar origin project onto different tectal regions.
These conclusions raise a number of questions:
(1) To what extent is the eventual organisation of the map determined by these
positional values?
(2) Are the positional values distributed uniformly around the circumference of
the eye or are they restricted to specific regions?
(3) Can the positional value of a retinal fragment be changed?
(4) How accurately are fibres of similar retinal origin distinguished from those
of dissimilar origin?
Two attributes of a retinal graft have special relevance for these questions: its
position of origin and its handedness. In particular, a 'pie-slice' of tissue transplanted from the right to the left eye will be of opposite handedness to the tissue
of the host eye. In this paper we discuss the electrophysiological maps from pieslice compound eyes involving a change in handedness. Graft experiments in
which the operation does not involve a change in handedness will be discussed
elsewhere (Cooke & Gaze, in preparation).

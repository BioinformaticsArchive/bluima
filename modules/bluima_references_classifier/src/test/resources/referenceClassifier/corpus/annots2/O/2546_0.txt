Discussion
Our results demonstrate that control of sympathetic fning,
arterial pressure and heart rate by neurons in the pons
was very well maintained during infusion of the lower
doses (doses 1 and 2) of propofol which were sufficient
to provide light to surgical planes of anaesthesia. However, propofol had moderate to large effects on tonic sympathetic control of the circulation at higher doses.
Previous studies of the central nervous system effects
of propofol have focused on changes in the electroencephalogram, cerebral blood flow or local cerebral glucose
utilization in different brain structures. 2,6,23 In contrast
to these investigations, we have studied the effects of pro-

chiasm and tract. Microscopically, the tumor consists of thin, elongated cells that characteristically
sheathe the blood vessels longitudinally. The cell
bodies and their processes stain strongly positive
for GFAP. Rosenthal fibers, cystic degeneration, and
eosinophilic hyaline granules are frequently seen,
as in the present case [6,19].
Although the pineal gland contains a significant
number of astrocytes [ 181, the occurrence of a primary astrocytoma of the pineal gland is exceedingly
rare. Burger et al [7] presume that pilocytic astrocytomas originate as astrocytes, which are inconspicuous in the normal parenchyma but are readily apparent as a gliotic response to lesions such
as craniopharyngiomas and hemangioblastomas.
These astrocytes may be of particular importance
in the first case presented, in light of the pineal

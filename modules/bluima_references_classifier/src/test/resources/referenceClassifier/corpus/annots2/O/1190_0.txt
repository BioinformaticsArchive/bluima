Analysis of striatal interneuron densities
Large aspiny interneurons constitute approximately 10% of
the total population of striatal neurons and can be demarcated into subclasses by the neurochemical markers CR,
PV, SOM and ChAT. The remaining neuronal population is
composed of striatal projection neurons. These mediumsized spiny cells have been described and identified by
their expression of CB (DiFiglia et al., 1989; Gerfen, 1992;

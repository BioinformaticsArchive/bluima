8, and 24 h) after drug injection. Heads were cooled by rapid
immersion in liquid nitrogen; thereafter, striata of both sides
and the brain stem (including the substantia nigra) were rapidly removed. The striata of the left side were immediately
processed for synaptosomes preparations and those on the
right side and the brain stem were frozen at -4OOC; thereafter, striata of the right side and the brain stem were weighed
and homogenised in EDTA 1 mM containing meta-H,PO,
1%. After centrifugation (17,500 x g for 10 min at 4OC),
the supernatant was divided into three aliquots. The first was
filtered and immediately injected into the HPLC system for
DOPAC, HVA, 3-MT, DA, NA, uric acid, and AA determinations. The second aliquot was adjusted to pH 7.0 with
K,PO, 45% and DL-homocysteine 1% was added to reduce
DHAA to AA. The sample was incubated for 30 min at 25OC,
then adjusted to pH 3.0 with meta-H,PO, 30%, filtered, and
injected (20 ~1) for total AA determination. DHAA concentration was calculated from the difference in AA content between
the first and second aliquots.
On the third aliquot MPTP and MPP+ determinations
were performed directly by injecting 50 ~1of the filtered supernatant. Liquid chromatography was performed using a highpressure pump (Varian 9001 with a Rheodyne injector), column (15 cm x 46 mm i.d. TSK-ODS-80 TM) and similar
precolumn, UV detector (Star 9050 Varian) (MPTP 295 nm,
MPP+ 245 nm) and integrator (Spectra-Physics SP 4290). The
mobile phase was composed of H,SO, 0.1 M, triethylamine
0.075 M, and acetonitrile 10% at pH 2.30; the flow was 1.5
ml/min. MPTP-3-01 (260 nm) was the internal standard.
Analysis of samples spiked with free MPTP or MPP+ yielded
recovery 2 99%.
Crude synaptosomes of striata on the left side were prepared according to a modification of the Gray and Whittaker
(17) method. Striata were homogenised in 30 vol. of ice-cold
0.32 M sucrose buffered at pH 7.4 with phosphate, using a
Teflon-glass system. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4OC
for 10 min at 1500 x g to remove nuclei and debris, and
crude synaptosomes were isolated from the supernatant by
centrifugation at 4OC at 22,000 x g for 20 min. To lyse synaptosomes, the pellet was resuspended by sonication in 0.9 ml
ice-cold metaphosphoric acid and an aliquot of 50 ~1 was
taken for protein analysis. After centrifugation (17,200 rpm
for 7 min), 20 ~1 of the supernatant was divided into three
aliquots for the above determinations.
PC12 cells were grown routinely in 35 cm' plastic tissue
culture dishes under an atmosphere of 5% COJ95% air in
Dulbecco-MEM containing 10% horse serum. DA determination was performed by HPLC as above, and GSH and GSSG
analysis according to the enzymatic recycling method of An-derson (4).
All values were expressed in nmol or pmol/mg protein and
given as mean * SD. Biochemical data were analysed with
ANOVA, and then with Student's two-tailed f-test or Bonferroni t-test. Pearson's correlation coefficient was also calculated in some instances.
All studies were carried out in accordance with the Decreto
No. 116/1992 of the Italian Ministry of the Public Health
(Directive 86/609/EEC).

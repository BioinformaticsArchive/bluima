processing center for both monaural and binaural auditory
signals. The data presented in this paper describe age-related
changes in the single-unit response properties observed in
aged animals. In the aging IC, there have been reports of a
loss of neurons, an increase in myelin thickness, a reduction
in protein synthesis, a possible reduction in glucose utilization, and a broadening of the laminar organization of 2-deoxyglucose uptake (Caspary et al. 1995; Hoeffding and
Feldman 1989; Ingvar et al. 1985; Keithley et al. 1994; Smith
et al. 1980). In mouse studies, no change was found in the
organization and number of projections from the superior
olivary complex to the IC with age (Byrd et al. 1995)) but
there is some debate about cochlear nucleus projections to
the IC. Willott et al. ( 1985) found no change, whereas
Lynch-Armour et al. ( 1995) found an apparent reduction in
anteroventral cochlear nucleus and dorsal cochlear nucleus
projections to the central nucleus of the IC (CIC) in aged
CBA mice.
Age-related neurotransmitter system changes have also
been noted in the IC. In neurochemical studies, choline transferase and glutamic acid decarboxylase levels have been
reported to decrease with age (Gutierrez et al. 1994; McGeer
and McGeer 1975; Raza et al. 1994) as did aspartate, y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine levels (BanaySchwartz et al. 1989a,b). GABA immunolabeling decreased
with age, as did the release of GABA (Caspary et al. 1990).
Changes were not seen in the levels of glutamate or glutamine ( Banay-Schwartz et al. 1989a,b), the activity of GABA
transaminase (Raza et al. 1994)) or the release and uptake of
glutamate, aspartate, or acetylcholine (Caspary et al. 1990).
Although somewhat controversial, the binding to GABA,
receptors did not appear to decrease much beyond the age
of -3 mo, but the activity of those receptors may change
and the distribution of immunoreactive terminals appeared
to change (Gutierrez et al. 1994; Helfert et al. 1994; Milbrandt and Caspary 1995; Milbrandt et al. 1993). The binding to GABAB receptors was reduced with age (Milbrandt
et al. 1994). Preliminary results also indicate some agerelated changes in excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter
binding in the ICs of F344 rats (Helfert et al. 1995).
To our knowledge, the only studies on the physiology of
single neurons in the aged IC have been conducted in mice:
C57 mice, which show a rapid peripheral degeneration
within the 1st yr of their life, and CBA mice, which maintain
their hearing well into their 2nd yr. The F344 rat is probably
more similar to the CBA mouse model than the C57 model.
Previous work in the aged CBA mouse has indicated an agerelated increase in the percentage of poorly responsive units,
a higher level of spontaneous activity in the ventral IC and
a lower level of spontaneous activity in the dorsal IC, an
increase in thresholds, and small changes in characteristic
frequency (CF) and tuning (Willott 1986, 199 1b; Willott
et al. 1988a,b, 1991). Preliminary results also indicate a
reduction in the percentage of units sensitive to short gaps
in the stimulus and an alteration in amplitude-modulated
signal best modulation frequencies (Walton et al. 1994,
1995). A reorganization of the frequency laminae and
changes in rate/intensity functions (RIFs) noted in the aging
C57 mouse were not observed in the CBA mouse (McFadden and Willott 1993; Willott 1986; Willott et al. 1988a,b,
1991).

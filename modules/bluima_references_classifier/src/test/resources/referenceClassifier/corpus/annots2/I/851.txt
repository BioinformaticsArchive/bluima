values. On a total activity basis GAD was reduced in
cortex, hipocampus septum, striatum and hypothalamus.
In type-2 lesion GAD activity was markedly reduced in
all structures studied. The reductions observed in hippocampus and cortex are most probably due to a direct
toxic effect of L-cysteine, whereas the reductions ob-served in the other brain structures may be due to transneuronal degeneration8. Whether the reduction in GAD
activity observed in the cerebellum is due to a direct
toxic effect or due to transneuronal degeneration is un-clear.
The toxic effect of L-cysteine on the retina has previously been described 17'is. Morphologically, the lesion
was dominated by a 50% reduction in the number of
ganglion cells and a reduction in the thickness of the in-ner plexiform layer by 40%. This lesion was not accompanied by any reduction in the HA-uptake of L-glutamate and in ChAT and GAD activities.
In conclusion, it can be stated that the brain dystrophy induced by LÂ°cysteine treatment of infant rats produces a complicated picture both on the anatomical and
on the biochemical level. We are unable to explain the
dramatic difference between the effects on the posterior
and anterior cortex. It is apparent that structures receiving strong glutamergic input are severely affected. A
goodexample,aspointedoutinourpreviouspaper11,is
the massive degeneration observed in caudato-putamen
compared to the well-preserved globus pallidus and substantic nigra which receive few glutamergic fibres. The
recent suggestion 17 that the toxic effect of cysteine is
primarily mediated though the NMDA receptor and to
a lesser extent through the quisqualate receptor receives
some support with our observations both in this and in
thepreviouspapersTM.TheeffectonGAD,butnotthe
lack of an effect on CHAT, in the neostriatum and the
effect on neostriatum compared to globus pallidus would
support such a view. We found two types of lesions
where type 2 may be regarded as an extended form of
type1.Accordingtotheinvitroresultsfromretina17this
could mean that the cysteine in animals of type 2 en-countered locally a slightly higher bicarbonate concentration and a slightly higher pH. The L-cysteine brain Ie-sion may be a tool in further understanding of the toxic
action of excitatory amino acids.

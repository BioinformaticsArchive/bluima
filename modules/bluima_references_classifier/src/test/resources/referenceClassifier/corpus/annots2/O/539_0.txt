Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) Superfrost Plus slides at a sampling in-terval of 100 to 105 m, and stored at 80°C. Slides were brought to
room temperature, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.5, and
rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. The remaining steps, including
proteinase K treatment, acetylation, dehydration, overnight hybridization in a humidified chamber (60 – 62°C), RNase A digestion and
washes to a final stringency of 0.1 standard saline citrate, 0.1%
dithiothreitol, 60°C for 30 min, were performed as previously de-scribed (Simmons et al., 1989). Between 1.4 and 2 106 cpm of probe
solution were used per slide.
Antisense, 35S-labeled riboprobes were synthesized as follows. The
rat prepro-CRF plasmid (K. Mayo, Northwestern University, Evanson, IL) was linearized with PvuII and transcribed with SP6 polymerase to generate a 593-base probe. The rat CRF intronic plasmid
(A. Ericcson and P. Sawchenko, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) incorporating bases 565 to 1094 of the genomic CRF sequence was linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T3 polymerase. The rat
CRF-R1 plasmid (W. Vale, Salk Institute) was linearized with BsaHI
and transcribed with T3 polymerase to generate a 189-base probe.
The rat CRF2A plasmid (T. Lovenberg, Neurocrine Biosciences, San
Diego, CA) containing a 275-base pair fragment of CRF2A cDNA was
linearized with HindIII and transcribed with T3 polymerase. Sensestrand probes of equivalent specific activity did not hybridize to
brain sections (data not shown).
Slides were apposed to X-ray film (Biomax; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for a sufficient time to reveal hybridization in the nuclei of
interest without producing saturation. Images were digitally captured, in random order and blind to treatment groups. Consistent
shapes were drawn around the brain regions of interest, and the
pixel density determined (Scion Image; Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Density measurements were converted to tissue-equivalent-specific activity by using 14C standard curves (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ; American Radiolabeled Chemicals,
St. Louis, MO). Four sections in the central nucleus of the amygdala
(CeA) or three sections from other regions containing the highest
expression were averaged to obtain a single value for each nucleus.
Finally, the left and right bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)
and CeA nuclei from each brain were averaged except where otherwise noted.
CRF Radioimmunoassay. Brains were thawed on a chilled glass
plate and dissected into brain regions according to anatomic landmarks. The locus coeruleus was obtained as a bilateral micropunch
dissection (0.8 mm in diameter, 0.6 – 0.9 mm in thickness per side);
two locus coeruleus samples from the same group were pooled in
each tube. CRF was extracted from tissue dissections in 1 M HCl
with protease inhibitors as previously described (Ladd et al., 1996).
CRF content was determined in duplicate by radioimmunoassay,
using a rat/human CRF antiserum obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA) (final dilution 1:23,000). Synthetic peptides
were used for the CRF standard (Bachem, Philadelphia, PA), and
125I-0Tyr-r/hCRF tracer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA).
The limit of sensitivity was 2.5 pg/tube. Data were normalized with
respect to protein content as determined by the Lowry method with
bovine serum albumin as the standard (Lowry et al., 1951).
CRF Receptor Autoradiography. Brain sections (20 m) were
incubated with 0.1 nM [125I-Tyr0]-sauvagine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), a radioligand with similar affinity to both the rat CRF1 and
CRF2 receptors (Primus et al., 1997); doubling this concentration did
not yield any additional specific binding. Serial sections were processed with 0.1 M CP-154,526 (Pfizer, Groton, CT), a specific CRF1
receptor antagonist, with CP-154,526 plus 1 M unlabeled sauvagine, or in the absence of competing ligand. Slides were apposed to
X-ray Film (Biomax). Image analysis was conducted as described in
the in situ hybridization section, by using 125I (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) rather than 14C standards. Subtraction was used to
determine CRF1 or CRF2 receptor signal.
Corticotropin (ACTH) and Corticosterone Assays. Plasma
concentrations of ACTH were determined using a two-site immuno-

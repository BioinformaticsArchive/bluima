Beam-walking test. An evaluation of motor coordination
was performed by placing each rat on a 2 200-cm wooden beam
elevated 80 cm above the floor and divided into four 50-cm
segments. One extremity of the beam was connected to the home
cage. A net was spread out 15 cm underneath the beam in order
to catch the rats that fell from the beam. All rats were trained
according to the protocol previously described by Galani et al.
(2002). In the first session, the rats were placed on the beam
50 cm away from the home cage on five consecutive occasions. In
the next session, the rats were placed 50, 100, 150 and 200 cm
away from the home cage, successively, with one trial for each of
the four distances. In the third session, the rats were placed twice
100 cm and then twice 200 cm away from the home cage. In the
fourth session, the rats were placed 200 cm away on three con-

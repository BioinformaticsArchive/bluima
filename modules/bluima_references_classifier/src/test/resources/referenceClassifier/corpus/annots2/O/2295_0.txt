Expression in Neural Crest 3305
cranial neural fold or migrating mesencephalic crest cells were grown
in medium containing either lo%, 5%, or 2% EE. Regardless of the
EE concentration, melanocytes differentiated in both types of cultures. Adrenergic differentiation, however, occurred only when the
medium contained 5% or 10% EE (Table I) for both cranial neural
fold cultures and migrating mesencephalic crest cultures. When the
concentration of EE was lowered to 2%, no adrenergic cells were
detected. These results are analogous to those reported above for
cranial neural crest cultures (containing the mesencephalic neural
tube for the first 24 hr in culture) and, therefore, suggest that the
initial presence of the neural tube is not necessary for the expression
of adrenergic and melanotic derivatives. Thus, embryo extract concentrations of 5% and 10% appear to be sufficient for both adrenergic and melanotic expression of mesencephalic neural crest cells
with or without the initial presence of the neural tube.
Trunk region. Trunk neural fold explants that lacked associated
neural tube cells were prepared from the posterior neural folds prior
to neural crest migration. Similar to the results observed with cranial
neural crest cells, the trunk neural fold cells gave rise to both
pigmented and adrenergic cells in the presence of 5% or 10% EE.
When the EE concentration was lowered to 2%, no catecholaminecontaining cells were detected although pigment cells did differentiate (Table I). Thus, for all dissections of cranial and trunk neural
crest, regardless of the initial presence or absence of neural tube
cells, medium containing 5% or 10% EE resulted in adrenergic
differentiation whereas medium containing 2% EE was unable to
support adrenergic differentiation.

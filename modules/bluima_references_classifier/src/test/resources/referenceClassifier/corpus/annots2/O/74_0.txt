MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antisera. Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits to synthetic peptides
from the deduced amino acid sequence of mPer1 and mTim cDNAs. The
mPER1 peptide (EGADGGGDPRPGEPFC) corresponding to amino
acids 6 –21 (Sun et al., 1997) was synthesized at the Massachusetts
General Hospital Biopolymer Core Facility. The mTIM peptide
(MQNGEK SPRDPWQEDPEC) corresponding to amino acids 951–967
(Zylka et al., 1998b), plus a C-terminal C residue to permit conjugation,
was synthesized at Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Five milligrams
of each peptide were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for
immunization. Primary immunizations were performed using Freund's
complete adjuvant, whereas boosts (at 2– 4 week intervals) used Freund's
incomplete adjuvant. Immunization protocols were conducted at Co-vance Research Products (Denver, PA) (mPER1) and Research Genetics
(mTIM). Sera described in this report were from bleeds dated December
31, 1997 (preimmune) and June 15, 1998 from rabbit 1177 (mPER1) and
July 9, 1998 (preimmune) and September 14, 1998 from rabbit 84730
(mTIM).
Animals and immunocytochemistry. All experimental manipulations
were conducted under license by the Home Office, in accordance with the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, and the University of Cambridge code of practice for scientific procedures on animals. Adult male
CD1(ICR) or C3H mice (Harlan Olac, Bicester, UK) were housed in
groups of 6 –10 with food and water available ad libitum in light-proof,
ventilated chambers under a 12 hr bright white light (220 μW/cm 2), 12 hr
dim red light (<5 μW/cm 2) schedule. Z eitgeber time (Z T) was defined
relative to lights on (ZT0) and lights off (ZT12). To confirm entrainment
and to monitor free-running activity patterns on release to constant dim
red light (referred to as DD), the cages were equipped with passive
infrared movement detectors linked to a computerized activity recording
system (Dataquest IV; Data Sciences Inc., Frankfurt, Germany). Circadian Time (CT) was initially defined relative to predicted lights off
(C T12) and on the day of sampling was confirmed by the coincident onset
of group activity, as observed on the actograms. The samples for analysis
of free-running cycles were taken after 12 (CT0)–34 (CT22) hr in
constant dim red light. At the selected intervals, animals were killed with
a barbiturate overdose and perfused through the aorta with saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, post-fixed,
transferred to cryoprotectant buffered sucrose solution (20%), and then
sectioned at 40 μm on a freezing microtome. Free-floating sections were
processed for immunostaining using standard procedures described previously (Ebling et al., 1991). Alternate sections were incubated with
anti-mPER1 (1:8000) or anti-mTIM (1:16,000) primary sera, which were
then visualized by avidin–biotin–peroxidase in conjunction with diaminobenzidine chromogen (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Initial comparisons showed that the two strains of mice had comparable
spatial and temporal patterns of expression of mPER1-ir in forebrain and
pituitary; so all subsequent studies were conducted on CD1(ICR) mice.
Sections were viewed on a Leitz (Wetzlar, Germany) microscope fitted
with a Hamamatsu (Hamamatsu City, Japan) CCD camera (C3077)
linked to an Apple (Cupertino, CA) Macintosh computer running Image
version 1.49 software (a gift from Dr. W. Rashband, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD) to count the number of immunoreactive nuclei
above thresholded background in defined regions.
For dual immunostaining, the nuclear reaction was intensified with
nickel, and sections were then processed using DAB to reveal cytoplas-

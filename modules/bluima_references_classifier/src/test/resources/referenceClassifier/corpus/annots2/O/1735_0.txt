Introduction
A central concept in contemporary research is how we
identify objects in our visual environment (what) and
how we locate those objects (where, or more recently called
`vision-for-action') [1,2]. But an equally important ability is
how we compute when visual events occur. In the past few
years, there has been a growing interest in understanding
the psychological and neuronal bases of the temporal
dimension in the normally functioning brain and in
the neurological population. In addition to behavioral
measures and functional imaging studies, several research
groups have begun to investigate the mechanisms that
register time at the neuronal level [3â€“5].
The relative timing of events underlies an enormous
range of neural functions, from the microsecond delays of
auditory processing to the measure of the seasons. Many
theories have been proposed to explain how the brain
incorporates time into its computations. In particular, when
the timing of two events are separated in space and time
beyond the range of classic receptive fields and temporal
integration periods, other neural mechanisms must be
considered. Some suggest a common neuronal mechanism
for all timing operations, from visual to speech perception
to timing a wide range of motor tasks (the internal clock

Figure 5. 3H-GABA uptake by NG2-labeled cells grown in N2 me-dium. Cells (7 DIVl were labeled with anti-NG2 antibodies and `H-GABA as described'under Materials and Methods. In A, C, and E, the
plane of focus is on the cell surface to reveal the anti-NG2 HRP reaction
product and in B, D, and F, the plane of focus is on the emulsion to
reveal the silver grains. A and B, Anti-NG2 and 3H-GABA label, no
inhibitors. C and D, Cell labeled in the presence of 2 mM p-alanine. E
and F, Cell was labeled in the presence of 1 mM DABA. 7 DIV. Bar,
20 Mm.

Fos-positive cells were found throughout the
brainstem, extending from the spinal cord to the
parabrachial region. Generally, in most brainstem
regions, there was more label in the stimulated
animals versus the control animals (Table 1, Fig. 2).
Fos-positive neurons were detected within the
rostral cervical spinal cord, especially laminae I and
II of the spinal dorsal horn. However, there were no
diVerences from control in these areas after either
ammonia or water stimulation.
In laminae I and II of the ventral MDH, and
ventral paratrigeminal nucleus, ammonia produced
significantly greater Fos expression than either water
or no stimulation (Table 1, Fig. 3). There were no
significant diVerences in Fos label in dorsal aspects of
these areas. In more rostral portions of the spinal
trigeminal nucleus, there was a significant increase
in label in subnucleus interpolaris, but not in subnucleus oralis, after ammonia stimulation. There was
no Fos expression in the principal trigeminal nucleus
in any animal. In the area ventromedial to the caudal
spinal trigeminal nucleus, there was a significant
increase in label in the ammonia group. There was no
significant increase in the number of Fos-positive
cells anywhere within the trigeminal sensory complex
after water stimulation of the nasal passages.
In non-trigeminal brainstem regions, substantial
Fos expression was found in most NTS subdivisions,
but especially within the commissural and medial
NTS (Table 1, Fig. 4A). Other areas substantially
labelled were the DRF, VLM and lateral parabrachial nucleus. However, there were no significant
increases in the number of Fos-positive neurons
compared with control in any NTS or parabrachial
subdivisions, rostral DRF, VLM, or raphe nuclei. No
Fos-positive cells were found within the compact
formation of the nucleus ambiguus. In the area of the
A5 catecholamine region, there was a significant
increase in Fos expression in both the ammonia and
water stimulation groups (Fig. 4B). Additionally,
there was a significant increase within the caudal
DRF after ammonia stimulation.

Figure 10. Irreversible and cumulative increase of respiratory drive potentials and action
potential firing of a bulbospinal expiratory neurone by intracellular caesium
Effect of 4 successive caesium injections (Cs', filled bars under trace: 525, 945, 735 and 315 nC) on the
amplitude of respiratory drive potentials (continuous line, calibration on the left) and on the
discharge frequency (filled area, number of action potentials per cycle, calibration on the right). One
measurement corresponds to one respiratory cycle (no measurements were made during
ionophoretic applications). There is a progressive increase of the respiratory potential from 7 to
11 mV and expiratory firing from 0 to 12 spikes per cycle during the experiment.

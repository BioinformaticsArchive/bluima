EFFECT OF SECTION THICKNESS. In vitro ARG with
[11C]nemonapride was performed according to the method of
Przedborski et al. (19) with a slight modification. Coronal rat brain
sections with 10-, 20-, 30-, 75-, 100-, and 150-μm thickness near
the bregma (17) were prepared. The brain sections were preincubated in 100 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 120 mM
NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the same buffer
containing 100 kBq/mL (25 TBq/mmol) [11C]nemonapride was
prepared (t = 0 min, 29 min after EOB), in which all the sections
were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After being washed with
ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM NaCl, the
brain sections were dried on a hot plate at 60°C, and then contacted
on an imaging plate (t = 58 min) until the activity decayed out (t =
20 h). The binding of 11C was measured as the PSL/mm2 over the
ROIs placed in the same manner as in the ex vivo ARG, and the
effect of section thickness was evaluated. The other set of the brain
section was also assayed as described above and the radioactivity
(cpm) of the whole section was measured with a gamma counter.

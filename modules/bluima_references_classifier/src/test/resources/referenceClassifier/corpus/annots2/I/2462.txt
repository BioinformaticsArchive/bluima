Previous studies from this laboratory have suggested
that susceptibility to NaCl hypertension in S rats is
associated with a reduced natriuretic capacity for a given
renal arterial inflow pressure (27) and also with a circulating antinatriuretic humoral effect (28)) both producing
a tendency . toward sodium retention. Moreover, Dahl S
rats have a 25% reduction in the plasma flow to the renal
papilla compared to Dahl R rats, with all rats on a lowNaCl intake (12). This reduced plasma flow may also
contribute to reduced sodium excretion. The AV3V lesion
that prevents 60% of NaCl-induced hypertension in S
rats could affect these concomitant features in Dahl S
rats. In fact, the AV3V lesion significantly increased the
renal papillary plasma flow in S rats by 14%, although it
did not completely normalize the 25% reduction in renal
papillary plasma flow in S rats compared with R rats.
It is uncertain how the AV3V lesion manages to in-crease the renal papillary plasma flow. The AV3V region
may influence the kidney through the release of neurohumoral agents that affect sodium transport or renal
hemodynamics. The AV3V region is reportedly related
to the elaboration of a natriuretic hormone (1). Another
report indicates that the AV3V lesion does influence the
vascular Na-K pump activity (22). The AV3V neurons
could also regulate the sympathetic nervous outflow that
can clearly affect renal hemodynamics and the rate of
natriuresis (8, 14). As indicated above, electrical stimulation of the AV3V region elicits an integrated peripheral
cardiovascular response consisting of vasoconstriction in
the renal and mesenteric vascular beds and vasodilatation in the hindquarters (9).
In conclusion, the AV3V lesion significantly attenuated
the NaCl-induced hypertension in Dahl S rats. Furthermore, vasopressin replacement partly overcame the ef-fect of the AV3V lesion. These findings indicate that the
NaCl-induced hypertension in Dahl S rats requires the
integrity of the AV3V region for its full expression, and
attenuation of vasopressin release may partly account
for the antihypertensive effect of the AV3V lesion.

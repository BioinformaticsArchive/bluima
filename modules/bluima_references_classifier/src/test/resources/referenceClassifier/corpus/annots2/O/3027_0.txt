Discussion

The present study revealed several important findings that
are relevant to the concepts of agonist efficacy and receptor
reserve at G-protein-coupled receptors. First, the relationship between receptor occupancy and G-protein activation by
mu opioid receptors depended on receptor density, as predicted from classical receptor theory (Furchgott, 1966;
Kenakin, 1993). Second, the absolute magnitude of the stimulation was higher in the system with the higher receptor
density. This also was expected because increases in the
magnitude of agonist-stimulated responses with increasing
receptor density has been reported in cells transfected with
other G-protein-coupled receptors (Boddeke et al., 1992;
Varrault et al., 1992; Prather et al., 1994; MacEwan et al.,
1995). However, it should be noted that increases in maximal
response as a function of receptor density at one level of the
signal transduction pathway do not necessarily result in
similar increases in the magnitude of downstream responses
(Law et al., 1994; Prather et al., 1994). Third, the relative

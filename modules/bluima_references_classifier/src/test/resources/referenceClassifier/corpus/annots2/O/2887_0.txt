the nerve terminals, not in the cell body. Second,
l-arginine and SNP increased the EPSCs without
causing a significant change in the holding currents,
indicating that the passive membrane properties of
SPNs were not aVected by NO and/or NO-forming
agents. Third, l-arginine, SNP and most noticeably
dbcGMP caused, in addition to an enhancement of
evoked EPSCs, bursts of mEPSCs in some of the
SPNs. Another membrane permeable cGMP analogue, 8-bromo-cGMP, has been found to increase
mEPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons and the
increase was attributed to a presynaptic eVect of
cGMP.1 Lastly, nitroprusside-induced formation
of cGMP was localized to nerve fibers projecting
into the IL , implying that stimulation of soluble
p

guanylate cyclase occurred in neural elements presynaptic to the NOS-containing SPNs. The complementary rather than parallel arrangement of
NOS- and cGMP-containing neural elements in the
rat IL is similar to that reported in other areas of the
p

rat brain.24 It is noteworthy that a facilitation of
neurotransmitter release including glutamate has
been reported in the rat hippocampus in vitro and
in vivo using biochemical assays.15,22
The ability of NO to stimulate the soluble guanylate cyclase is well documented.14,17 Activation of
soluble guanylate cyclase is believed to be a key
intermediary underlying a variety of cellular eVects of
NO including long-term potentiation in the guineapig hippocampus.31 Here, superfusion of the slices
with the membrane permeable cGMP analogue
dbcGMP resulted in a potentiation of EPSCs with
a time-course comparable to that produced by
NO-forming agents. Contrary to the potentiating
eVect of NO-forming agents, the potentiation
induced by dbcGMP was not antagonized by hemoglobin, indicating that the eVect is probably exerted
downstream from NO production.
Collectively, the results are consistent with the
hypothesis that the synaptic potentiation observed in
SPNs may be associated with a NO-stimulatedguanylate cyclase signalling system located presynaptic to the neurons in question.

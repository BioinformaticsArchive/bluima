FIG. 1. SN56 cells are susceptible to infection with three mouseadapted scrapie strains. (A and B) SN56 cells were treated with various
amounts of PrP-res as contained in crude brain microsome fractions
(Chandler [A, lanes 1 to 4] or ME7 [B, lanes 1 to 4 and 7 and 8] or
purified form (22L [A, lanes 7 to 9]) from mouse-adapted scrapieinfected animals. Mock-infected control cultures were treated with
normal brain microsomes (A, lane 5) normalized for total protein
versus a scrapie brain microsome sample (A, lane 2) or a buffer control
(A, lane 6; B, lanes 5, 6, and 9). After the indicated number of passes,
the cells were assayed for PrP-res by immunoblotting. Chandler-in-fected cells (from A, lane 2) were analyzed at passage 60 for comparison with ME7-infected cells in panel B (lane 10). Purified PrP-res
standards (B, lanes 11 to 13) were used to provide semiquantitative
estimates of PrP-res levels. The lanes in panel A represent cell equivalents from 1 well of a 24-well plate ( 150 to 160 g total cell lysate
protein). In panel B, the lanes represent 500 g (lanes 1 to 6), 733 g
(lanes 7 to 9), and 100 g (lane 10) of cell lysate protein/lane. Molecular mass markers are indicated in kDa. Brackets indicate PrP-res
bands. (C) Cell blot analysis of infected cells. Cells infected with 20 ng
of PrP-res from panel A (Chandler, passage 14; 22L, passage 11) were
assayed for PrP-res (left). The membrane was then stained with
ethidium bromide to visualize transfer of the cells (right).

Alkaline phosphatase histochemistry

Serial sections were analyzed by alkaline phosphatase histochemistry to assess the presence, location, migration, and morphology of graft-derived cells in the spinal cord and striatum.
Sections were washed with PBS, heated at 60 °C for 1 h to
inactivate endogenous enzyme activity, washed briefly in alkaline
phosphatase buffer [(Tris; 100 mM, pH 9.5; Fisher), (NaCl;
100 mM; Fisher), (MgCl2; 50 mM; Fisher)], and finally incubated at
room temperature in the dark with alkaline phosphatase staining
solution [(NBT; 1.0 mg/ml; Sigma), (BCIP; 0.1 mg/ml; Sigma),
(levamisole; 5 mM; Sigma) in alkaline phosphatase buffer] for
1.5–2.0 h. Slides were coverslipped in hard-set Vectashield (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA) and visualized by light
microscopy.

in critically ill patients.3 The encephalopathy is not thought to
be a direct effect of the infecting organism and/or toxin, but
rather that it arises from the action of inflammatory
mediators on the brain or a cytotoxic response by brain cells
to these mediators.3 This is supported by a recent post
mortem study on four of 14 patients with SE in whom no
microabscesses were found.2
The presence of a predisposition to sepsis, particularly
urosepsis, in a patient with polycystic kidney disease, along
with immunosuppression and prior urinary tract infection in
the context of an unexplained encephalopathy and progressive febrile illness might have suggested the diagnosis of SE.
Absence of positive blood or urine cultures and failure to
identify a septic focus further complicated the diagnosis in
our case. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment on admission the patient worsened.
The pathophysiology of the systemic inflammatory reaction
in SE is unclear, but it is most likely multifactorial and
related to release of inflammatory mediators. A unique
lipopolysaccharide, endotoxin, is pre-eminent among products implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and is well
established as a trigger for the cellular and pathophysiological response to sepsis. Lipid A, a component of endotoxin, is a
diglucosamine based phospholipid that induces a wide range
of proinflammatory responses, including release of cytokines
from macrophages and neutrophils, activation of the complement cascade, and upregulation of the adhesive capacity
of neutrophils and endothelial cells.4 These factors result in
reduced cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction, cerebral
oedema, disruption of the bloodâ€“brain barrier, impaired
astrocyte function and neuronal death.1 3 Oxygen delivery to
the brain is further limited by damaged erythrocytes from
free radicals released by leucocytes. Coagulation abnormalities are a common feature of sepsis. Activation of the
coagulation cascade and the subsequent deposition of fibrin
can impair organ function by microvascular thromboses.
Furthermore, products of coagulation are chemotactic for
neutrophils and monocytes and hence may potentiate
inflammatory processes.4
Published findings of MRI in SE are limited to a single
report of non-specific white matter changes.5 The MRI

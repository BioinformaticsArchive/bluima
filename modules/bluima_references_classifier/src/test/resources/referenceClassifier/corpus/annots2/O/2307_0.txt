MONOAMINES ON THALAMIC NEURONES 717
(Fuxe, 1965a) and it is therefore reasonable to assume that monoaminecontaining synaptic terminals are present in the feline thalamus.
The present report concerns the actions of monoamines and related
compounds on cells in dorsal and ventral areas of the feline thalamus. A
subsequent paper will deal with the actions of cholinergic compounds on
thalamic neurones. The papers form part of a sequence dealing with the
actions of monoamines and cholinesters on neurones in the central nervous
system (Krnjevi6 & Phillis, 1963 a, b, c; Phillis, Teb6cis & York, 1967a, b).

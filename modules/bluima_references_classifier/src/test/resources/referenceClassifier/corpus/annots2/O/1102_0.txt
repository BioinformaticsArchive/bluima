Increase of Ischemic/Hypoxic Neuronal Injury by
Treatment With Anti-VEGF Antibody and VEGF
Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide
To identify the significance of neuronal VEGF in-duction, anti-VEGF antibody and VEGF antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (VEGF antisense) were used to neutralize and knockdown endogenous VEGF, respectively
(Bao et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2002; Qiu et al., 2003).
Anti-VEGF antibody injected into the lateral ventricle of
rat brains after ischemia markedly increases infarct volume
(Bao et al., 1999). Both brain and cultured neurons treated
with VEGF antisense are more sensitive to ischemic/
hypoxic injury. VEGF antisense treatment increases
ischemia-induced neuronal damage, including increased

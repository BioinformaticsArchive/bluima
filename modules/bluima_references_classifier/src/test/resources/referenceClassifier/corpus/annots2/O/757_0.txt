Objective: To study the difference in the facial
canal anatomy in terms of the severity of microtia and
deformity of the middle ear in patients with microtia
using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
Study Design: Forty-six ears with microtia were ex-amined by HRCT. These ears were graded based on
two systems of classification and scoring, respectively. The HRCT findings of each group were compared with those of other groups by multiple comparison using the Tukey honestly significant difference
test. Methods: Forty-six ears with microtia (unilateral
microtia, n 12; bilateral microtia, n 34) were ex-amined by HRCT. These ears were graded based on
two systems of classification and scoring, respectively. The HRCT findings and age distribution of
each group were compared with those of other groups
by multiple comparison using the Tukey honestly significant difference test. Results: The mastoid portion
of the facial nerve was 3 mm more anteriorly displaced in patients with grades II and III microtia than
in those with grade I microtia (P <.01). From the scoring system that was used, the course of the facial
nerve was not significantly different between pa-tients with a score of 5 points or less and those with a
score of 6 points or more. Conclusion: The mastoid
portion of the facial nerve in patients with grades II
and III microtia would be more anteriorly displaced
because of hypoplasia of the second genu. Key Words:
Facial nerve, high-resolution computed tomography,
microtia, aural atresia, second genu.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we describe the CNS distribution of mRNA encoding seven two-pore-domain potassium channel family members.
We found widespread and differential distribution of all transcripts except TASK-2, which was expressed at high levels in the
dorsal root ganglia but was present only at uniformly low levels in
the CNS. The expression of these KCNK genes was to a large
extent complementary; nevertheless, there was substantial overlap of these transcripts in multiple brain areas and likely in
individual neurons. Thus, not only do the data suggest that these
channels contribute to neuronal diversity, but also that multiple
two-pore-domain K channels may provide contributions to the
physiological properties and modulatory potential of individual
neurons. In addition, the likely coexpression of different subunits
suggests the possibility of coassociation (i.e., the formation of
heterodimeric channels), particularly by genes that share higher
degrees of sequence homology. However, to date there are no
reports of heterodimerization among two-pore-domain K channel family members.
Currently, 14 two-pore-domain K channel genes have been
identified by molecular cloning, although three (KC N K6/7,
THIK-2, and TASK-5) have not generated functional currents in
heterologous expression systems (Salinas et al., 1999; Rajan et al.,
2000a; Girard et al., 2001; Kim and Gnatenco, 2001). In addition,
three (TAL K-1, TAL K-2/ TASK-4, and TASK-5) were cloned
very recently from human tissues; they do not appear to be
expressed to an appreciable extent in the human brain, and
corresponding rodent orthologs have not been identified (Decher
et al., 2001; Girard et al., 2001; Kim and Gnatenco, 2001). Of the
two remaining genes that we did not examine, TWIK-2 appears
to be absent from the rodent brain (Patel et al., 2000). Thus, in the
present report, we describe seven of eight functional two-poredomain potassium channel members with known CNS expression. The exception is the recently cloned THIK-1, which along
with the presumed channel THIK-2, is expressed in multiple
brain regions in the rat (Rajan et al., 2000a; see below).

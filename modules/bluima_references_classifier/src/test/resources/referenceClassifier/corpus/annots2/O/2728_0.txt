NEUROPATHOLOGY
Grossly, the specimen was removed en-bloc and
consisted of a yellow-tan soft tissue nodule. Histologic sections revealed a glial background with nu-merous large neurons containing abundant cytoplasm, Nissl substance and numerous processes
(Figure 2). No satellite cells were seen. The background contained scattered glial filaments and oc-casional reactive astrocytes. A Bodian silver stain
showed neuronal processes which were normal in
appearance.

To test the effect of MCH on the remaining calcium
currents made up of R- and probably T-type currents,
nimodipine (8 mM), v-conotoxin GVIA (4 mM), and
v-conotoxin MVIIC (2 mM) plus v-agatoxin IVA (50 nM)
were applied simultaneously to block L-, N- and P/Q-type
currents. A residual current of 26.6 ± 3.3 % (n = 11) of the
control current remained in the presence of the blockers.
When MCH (100 nM) was applied to the recorded
neurons in the presence of all these blockers, the residual
calcium current showed no further decrease (from
26.3 ± 3.3 % to 24.0 ± 2.9 %, statistically not significant;
t test, n = 5, P > 0.5). This experiment demonstrates that
about 26 % of the calcium current in made up of T- and
R-type currents, and that MCH has little effect on these
currents.

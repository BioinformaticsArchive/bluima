Bridge grafts of GDNF-secreting Schwann cells combined with
homotopic nigral graft placement
A second batch of 36 animals all found to satisfy the post-6-OHDA
lesion criterion of more than seven turns per minute ipsilaterally after an
amphetamine challenge (as above) were used as subjects for the bridge
graft experiment. Animals were divided into three groups of 12 animals.
Three different bridge graft substrates were tested: the parent Schwann
cell line (SCTM41), the GDNF-secreting variant of this line (SCTM41
GDNF), and a control bridge (grafting medium; vehicle).
Bridge graft surgery. All 36 animals received bridge grafts of one of the
three above cell types using a technique modified from that of Dunnett
et al. (1989) (Fig. 1). Rats were mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus
(Kopf), with the incisor bar set at 10.0 mm above the level of the ear bars.
A burr hole was drilled through the frontal bone ipsilateral to the
previous 6-OHDA lesion, and subsequently through the pterygoid bone,
to allow free access of a blunt-ended 23 gauge grafting needle to the
nigrostriatal pathway. This needle, attached to a 10 ml glass syringe
(Scientific Glass Engineering), was mounted at an angle of 44° to the
vertical and lowered to the following coordinates (relative to the midaural point): A, -0.5 mm; L, 2.4 mm; V, 4.8 mm. A total of 8 ml of graft
suspension (containing either SCTM41 cells or SCTM41 GDNF cells at
a density of 5 × 105 cells/μl in grafting medium; 0.002% DNase in L-15)
or vehicle (grafting medium alone) was injected in deposits of 0.5 μl
spaced at 0.5 mm intervals along the needle track. At each of the 16
locations, the deposit was gently extruded, and the needle was left in
place for 30 sec before withdrawing it by 0.5 mm. Animals were immunosuppressed from this point on with daily intraperitoneal injections of
2 mg of cyclosporin A (Sandoz) in 0.2 ml of normal saline solution to
prevent graft rejection.
Homotopic nigral graft surgery. Two days after bridge grafting, all
animals received two grafts of dissociated embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue (see above preparation techniques) (Fig. 1). One ventral
mesencephalic fragment was suspended in 5 μl. Cell viability and density
counts of aliquots of the suspension in a cytometer, using the trypan blue
dye exclusion method, indicated a cell density of ;6.9 × 10 5 cells/μl and
a viability of >92%. All rats were reanesthetized and placed in a
stereotaxic apparatus, with the incisor bar set 2.3 mm inferior to the
interaural line. They received two 2.5 μl of intrastriatal deposits of graft
suspension by direct injection via the 23 gauge needle of the same 10 μl
glass syringe (Scientific Glass Engineering) positioned at stereotaxic
coordinates within substantia nigra: A, -5.0 mm from bregma; L, -2.9
and -1.9 mm from bregma; V, 7.2 and 7.8 mm from dura mater. Each
graft deposit was infused over 2.5 min, with an additional 2 min allowed
for diff usion before retraction of the needle.
Fluorogold injections. All animals received tracer injections of fluorogold into their striata. Two days before each animal was to be killed, it
was reanesthetized and placed once again into a stereotaxic frame, with

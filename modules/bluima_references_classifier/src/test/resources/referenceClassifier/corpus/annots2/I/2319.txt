common carotid arteries were occluded distal or proximal
to the location of the carotid bodies.
There have been other studies investigating the ventilatory responses to acute reductions of BBF by clamping the vertebral and/or the common carotid arteries (6,
18). Following total or partial reduction of BBF, ventilation is usualIy increased and, depending on the degree
of BBF reduction, apnea may develop. Again, these studies are difficult to relate to the present data because the
animals were anesthetized and the contribution of the
carotid chemoreceptors to the ventilatory response was
unknown.
In summary, the present data have shown that in
awake animals brain ischemia 1) produces reversible
apnea at approximately the same venous 02 tension as
does inhalation of carbon monoxide, 2) produces multifactorial hyperpnea (i.e., systemic hypermetabolism and
brain acidosis) at approximately the same venous 02
tensions as does inhalation of carbon monoxide, and 3) is
associated with indirect evidence of hypoxic depression
of ventilatory control over a broad range of levels of
brain hypoxia, again in a manner similar to that shown
for inhalation of carbon monoxide. It would therefore
appear, by inferential comparison with the carbon monoxide studies, that the predominant ventilatory effects of
brain ischemia in unanesthetized animals are related to
hypoxia rather than hypercapnia.

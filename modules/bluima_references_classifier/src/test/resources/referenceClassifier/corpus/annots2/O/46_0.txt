py. Therefore, radical surgery appears to be the
most critical factor in determining favorable
outcome.
Several terms have been coined to describe these
entities, such as ganglioneurocytoma and ganglioglioneurocytoma (5). However, according to Funato
et al (2), the term ganglioneurocytoma should only
be used when extensive ganglionic differentiation
is present throughout the tumor, excluding those
tumors in which such differentiation is restricted to
focal areas, such as in our case. Regardless of the
adopted terminology, it appears that neoplasms
with neurocytic components can be found throughout the CNS (5), and that their identification broadens the spectrum of neuronal and mixed neuronalglial tumors.
While intraventricular neurocytomas usually
present with headache and raised intracranial pressure (3), the presentation of cerebral neurocytoma
varies according to tumor location. Almost 20% of
patients with complex partial seizures have an un-derlying primary brain tumor (7). In a study by
Wolf and Wiestler (8), ganglioglioma, pilocytic as-trocytoma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor
were the neoplasms most commonly associated
with complex partial seizures. However, a case of
cerebral neurocytoma of the temporal lobe presenting with long-standing complex partial seizures
has also been reported (7). The cause of precocious
puberty in our case remained unexplained. Isosexual precocious puberty may be the presenting sign
of hamartoma of the tuber cinereum, hypothalamic
glioma, and pineal gland tumors; however, the sellar/suprasellar and pineal regions were normal in
our patient. Only rarely may hemispheric tumors
be responsible for precocious puberty, probably be-cause of raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus producing compression of the hypothalamus with premature activation of its pathways (9).
However, there were no signs of increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus in our patient,
and the mass effect produced by the tumor was
very limited without distortion of midline structures. On the other hand, the possibility that neuronal tumors may induce puberty by producing go-nadotropin-releasing factors is speculative and, to
our knowledge, has not been reported.
While the neuroradiologic appearance of intraventricular neurocytomas has been described in de-tail (3), only few CT and MR descriptions of ce-rebral neurocytoma can be found in articles dealing
primarily with their neuropathologic features; we
are aware of only five reported cases of cerebral
neurocytoma located in the temporal lobe (4, 5, 7,
10). Cerebral neurocytomas have been described as
hypodense or isodense relative to gray matter on
CT scans (4); as for intraventricular neurocytomas,
coarse or punctate calcification is common. On MR
images, cerebral neurocytomas appear hypointense
on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2-weighted studies (4); contrast enhancement is mild,

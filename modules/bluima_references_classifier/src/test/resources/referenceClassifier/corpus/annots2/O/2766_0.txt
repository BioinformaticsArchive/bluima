DISCUSSION
A principal goal of this study was to examine the colocalization of
immunoreactivity for c-Jun with TdT-labeled nuclei in AD brain.
The colocalization of c-Jun immunoreactivity with TdT labeling
supports the hypothesis that c-Jun may participate in an
apoptosis-related gene program. If this hypothesis is true, there
are at least two factors likely to contribute to the lack of complete
colocalization between c-Jun-positive and TdT-positive cells.
First, c-Jun is a transcriptional regulatory protein that forms
homodimers with itself or heterodimers with other IEG proteins
(Morgan and Curran, 1991). Thus, cJun may regulate different
processesin different cells/cell types, depending on the other IEG
transcription factors available. This point is particularly relevant
in regard to the ratio of c-Jun-positive cells that also were TdTpositive, because this c-Jun antibody labels both neurons and
astrocytes in AD brain (Anderson et al., 1994). As described in
Results, however, cells double-labeled for c-Jun and TdT in the
present study were morphologically neuronal in type. Because
counts of all c-Jun-positive cells include both neuronal and glial
labeling, these counts provide only a conservative estimate of the
degree of colocalization between cJun and TdT in the neuronal
population. Second, the lack of detectable evidence for either
apoptosis or necrosis by gel electrophoresis suggests that TdT

Theta is a rhythmic, electrical field activity of the
hippocampus with a well-established behavioural
correlation.50,56 Theta activity can be elicited by
high-frequency stimulation of the reticular formation,14,37,46 most eVectively in the nucleus pontis
oralis of the reticular formation (RPO).51 The
supramammillary nucleus (SUM) is a relay nucleus
within the ascending pathway connecting RPO to the
hippocamposeptal complex.53,54 The SUM has aVerent connections, beside the reticular input, from
numerous other brain areas, e.g., hypothalamus,
cortex, limbic structures, midbrain and the basal
forebrain.19

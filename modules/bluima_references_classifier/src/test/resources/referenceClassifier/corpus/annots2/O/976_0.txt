General Characteristics
Body weight increased similarly in TGR and SD rats (Table
1). After the sham-MI surgery, mortality was minimal in both
TGR and SD rats (1 out of 22 TGR, and 0 out of 22 SD).
After MI, a moderate level of mortality was noted, occurring
mainly in the first few days and similar for the TGR and SD
rats. At 8 weeks after MI, 31 out of 41 (76%) SD with MI had
survived and 34 out of 43 (79%) TGR with MI (for both
protocols combined). At 8 weeks, plasma electrolytes and
hematocrit did not differ among groups (see online Table B).

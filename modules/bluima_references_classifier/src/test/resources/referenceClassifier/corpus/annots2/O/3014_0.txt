fastigial nucleus may play a prominent role both in the
initial acceleration of smooth pursuit and in its maintenance.
Purkinje cells in the oculomotor vermis may modulate pursuit
velocity both in the initial acceleration phase and in the
steady-state tracking phase through the fastigial nucleus,
when target velocity is abruptly changed. The results of the
present study support this hypothesis.

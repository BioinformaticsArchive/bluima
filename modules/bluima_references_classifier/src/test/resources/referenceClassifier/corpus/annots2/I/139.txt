of the rat SI map (for example, the forepaw representation27). Recent intracellular studies of cat primary
visual cortex (VI) have also observed large subthreshold
receptive fields, with a similar decrease in the strength
of input as a function of distance from the center of
the response28.
Simons and colleagues have studied spatial and temporal integration in rat SI neurons during multi-vibrissa
stimulation, and have found that inter-vibrissa suppression predominates21,22,25,29,30. Comparable results have
also been reported at the level of the cortical map, using
optical imaging techniques that integrate information
over several square millimeters of cortex [intrinsic-signal
optical imaging31 (see Box 1) and voltage-sensitive dyes32;
see also Ref. 33 for similar findings using electricalpotential recordings following stimulation of the thalamus]. By stimulating two vibrissae simultaneously or

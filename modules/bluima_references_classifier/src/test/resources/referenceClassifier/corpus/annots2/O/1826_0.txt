Effects of IKVAV PA on cell death
The waves of apoptotic cell death that occur after SCI are also
detrimental to functional recovery (Crowe et al., 1997; Beattie et
al., 2002). We quantified cell death late in the second phase of
apoptosis using cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry at 10 d
after SCI (Liu et al., 1997; Beattie et al., 2002). In IKVAV PA-injected animals, there were significantly fewer cells undergoing
apoptosis both in the area of maximal cell infiltration (lesion;
44.7 3.06 for vehicle vs 34.3 2.02 for IKVAV PA; p 0.008)
(Fig. 5b,d) and on either side of the lesion (30.8 4.26 for vehicle
and 16.3 1.25 for IKVAV PA; p 0.001) (Fig. 5a,d). Because
there is typically significant oligodendroglial (OL) death at this

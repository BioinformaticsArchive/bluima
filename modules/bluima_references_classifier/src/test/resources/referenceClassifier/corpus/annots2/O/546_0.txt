through basal ganglia may sustain damage resulting in decreased
input to hippocampal subregions. For example, both thalamicocortical and corticof ugal neurons can pass through the lateral and
medial ganglionic eminences en route to and from the hippocampus. Although we cannot discount the role of projection neuron
destruction in the HIVE SCID mouse model, inflammationmediated damage to projection neurons appears unlikely to be
involved in human HAD on the basis of radiologic (Chrysikopoulos et al., 1990; Aylward et al., 1993, 1995; Jernigan et al., 1993;
Marcus et al., 1998) and postmortem histopathologic evidence
showing that HIV E is a dif use process preferentially afecting
subcortical white matter and deep brain structures but lacking
discrete foci of injury (Gray et al., 1988; Masliah et al., 1992a,b,
2000).
Third, the major antecedent to impaired synaptic physiology and
morphology appears to be the presence of MDMs in brain. Viral
infection of injected MDMs augments the magnitude of hippocampal pathophysiology, probably by increasing the levels of secreted
proinflammatory cytokines, but is not necessary for development
of disease. The ability of brain MDMs to cause dementia indepen-

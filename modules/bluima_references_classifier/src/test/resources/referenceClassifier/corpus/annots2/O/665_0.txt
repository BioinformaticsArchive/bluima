Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of single voxel 1H-MRS
of the CNS structures contained in the posterior cranial
fossa and to determine the distribution of the normal me-tabolite ratios, concentrations, and T2 relaxation times in
the midbrain, pons, medulla, dentate nucleus and cerebellar vermis.

Materials and Methods: A total of 147 single voxel 1H-MR
spectra with a point-resolved proton spectroscopy se-quence (PRESS) sequence and echo time (TE) of 136 or 272
msec were obtained in the midbrain, pons, medulla, dentate, and vermis of 31 healthy volunteers. In seven additional patients; the concentrations and T2 relaxation times
of metabolites were obtained in the same locations (except
the medulla) with an external phantom calibration method
and a four TE PRESS technique.

Results: Ten (27%) of 36 spectra acquired in the medulla
were of poor quality. A similar ranking of the N-acetyl as-partate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio and choline(Cho)/Cr ra-tios in the five locations for the two TEs was observed, with
the highest values in the pons (mean NAA/Cr 4.16 0.6
and Cho/Cr 2.66 0.6 at TE 272) and the lowest values
in the dentate and vermis (mean NAA/Cr 1.66 0.2 and
Cho/Cr 1.20 0.2 at TE 272). The analysis of variance
showed significant regional differences of the NAA and Cr
concentrations, which had the highest values in the dentate. Non-significant regional differences were observed for
the concentration of Cho and for the T2 of the metabolites.

Conclusion: With the exception of the medulla, single voxel
1H-MRS enables an in vivo biochemical analysis of the CNS
structures contained in the posterior cranial fossa. Re-gional differences in the metabolite ratios and concentrations must be considered when employing 1H-MRS for evaluation of diseases of the brainstem and cerebellum.

Figure 9. The effects of kynurenate on the responses of a dorsal
horn neuron to DRG explant stimulatron and pressure applicatron of
L-glutamate and ATP. The first traces in each row show the responses
to an intracellular current pulse followed by strmulation of a nearby
DRG explant. The next two traces are chart records of the responses
to pressure ejectron of L-glutamate (1 set X 20 PM) and ATP (1 set
X 20 PM). The responses in the second row were recorded in the
presence of 0.4 mM kynurenate. The responses in the third row were
recorded after washing out kynurenate. Each EPSP trace is the
average of 16 records. Restrng potential = -68 mV.

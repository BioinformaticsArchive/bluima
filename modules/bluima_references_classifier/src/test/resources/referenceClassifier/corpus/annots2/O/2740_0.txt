Occupational Judgment
In multiple-choice occupational judgments of past famous
names (presented in full form), EK was severely impaired
(44% correct) relative to controls (as well as DR and SAM),
although somewhat above chance levels due to her comparatively good classification of recent U.S. presidents' names. A
much higher level of occupational judgment for famous faces
was evident (80.5% correct), but even this level was below
the normal range. DR showed entirely normal occupational
judgments for famous names (100% correct), with mild im-pairment for famous faces (89% correct). SAM's performance
levels were all within normal limits.

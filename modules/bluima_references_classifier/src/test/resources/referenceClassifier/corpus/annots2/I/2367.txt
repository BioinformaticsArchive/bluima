Those thalamic regions which contained labeled
neurons following precentral gyrus protein injections were unlabeled following postcentral gyrus
injections. If there were thalamic neurons which
project to both gyri, it is difficult to understand
why they are labeled from only one site, especially in light of the evidence that other thalamic
neurons which project to two different cortical
areas can be labeled by protein injections into
either area (19, 21, 22). The possibility that the
VL arm area might serve as a relay for peripheral input will be discussed in an accompanying
paper on the response properties of these neurons. At present there is no plausible alternative
to the postcentral gyrus as a relay for shortlatency peripheral information to the motor cortex.

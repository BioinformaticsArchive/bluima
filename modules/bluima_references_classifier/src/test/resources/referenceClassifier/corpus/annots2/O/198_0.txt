Experiment 1: mean correlations with normal ratings
In the first study, we investigated the recognition of emotion in
108 subjects with focal brain lesions that sampled the entire
telencephalon, using a sensitive, standardized task that asked
subjects to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed (Adolphs
et al., 1994, 1995, 1996). Sampling density in different brain
regions as well as background demographics and neuropsychology
of subjects is summarized in Table 1. Figure 1 shows histograms
of the distribution of subjects' correlations with normal ratings for
each emotion, as well as their mean correlation score across all
emotions (higher correlations indicate more normal ratings; lower

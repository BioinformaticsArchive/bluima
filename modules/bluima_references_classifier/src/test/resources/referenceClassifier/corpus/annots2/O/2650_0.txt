Tissuepreparation. Eight adult male New Zealand White rabbits (Birchwood Valley Farm, Red Wing, MN), 15 male adult Sprague-Dawley
rats (250 gm; Holtzman, Madison, WI), and three adult Macaca ne-mestrina monkeys (Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, Madison, WI) were overdosed with Nembutal and perfused transcardially
with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 4°C. The animals were placed
on ice and the dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia, and spinal cords
were rapidly dissected out. The tissue was then frozen on dry ice in
Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Miles, Elkhart, IN), serially sectioned
at 15 pm, thaw-mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stored for up to
3 months at -70°C.
Sciatic nerve injury was produced in 22 male Sprague-Dawley rats
(180 am: Charles River. Boston. MA). Under Nembutal anesthesia (35
&/kg, i:p.), the right sciatic nei-ve was exposed in midthigh proximal
to the trifurcation and freed from connective tissue by sharp dissection.
Sixteen animals received an experimental cuff neuropathy produced by
applying four nonconstrictive 0.5 mm segments of polyethylene tubing
(inner diameter = 0.030 inches; Clay Adams) to enclose the sciatic nerve.
Six additional animals received complete sciatic nerve transection.
Proximal stumps were tightly ligated, and a l-2 mm segment of nerve
was removed to prevent regeneration. Neuropathic and axotomized rats
were killed on 7 d (N = 2 neuropathic, 1 axotomized), 14 d (N = 12,
4) or 28 d (N = 2, 1) postsurgery and both the ipsilateral and contralateral L4, L5, and L6 ganglia were dissected out on ice, frozen on dry
ice in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Miles, Elkart, IN), and processed
for quantitative autoradiography.
Cuff neuropathy produced behavioral alterations similar to those re-ported in rat and human painful neuropathies, including hyperalgesia
and allodynia (Bennett and Xie, 1988). Quantitative analysis of alterations in axon fiber spectrum revealed a progressive decrease in the
number of large myelinated axons with a maximum deficit apparent at
14 d postsurgery (77% below the untreatedcontralateral nerve) (Mosconi
and Kruger, 1992). By 28 d, many axons with extremely thin myelin
sheathes are evident, presumably reflecting regeneration and/or remyelination, and coinciding with behavioral evidence of functional recovery. In contrast, operated limbs of the transected animals were flaccid
and anesthetic and showed no signs of functional recovery by 28 d
postsurgery.
Receptor binding protocol. The slide-mounted tissue sections were
brought to room temperature and preincubated in a Krebs-Ringer buffer
(118 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM MgSO,.7H,O, 1.2 mM KH,PO,, 5.6 mM glucose, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl,), pH 7.4, for 1 hr prior to incubation
with the radioligand (Allen et al., 1993). The sections were then incubated at 22°C for 2 hr in a solution of 100 PM 12sI-PYY in Krebs-Ringer
buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05%
bacitracin. To estimate nonsaturable binding, paired serial sections were
incubated as described except that 1 FM nonradioactive PYY or NPY
was present in the incubation medium. In all experiments the unlabeled
peptides were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). After incubation,
the slides were washed four times in incubation buffer, pH 7.4 (4°C 4
min each), rinsed once in distilled water (4°C 5 set), and then quickly
dried in the cold room under a stream of cold air. After 3 hr of further
drying at 4°C sections were stored over desiccant at room temperature
overnight before being apposed to x-ray film or dipped in nuclear emulsion.
Pharmacological characterization of the NPY binding sites. The specificity of the 1251-PYY binding sites was characterized by performing
the binding as described above except that nonradioactive NPY, PYY,
PP, L~u~~,P~~~~-NPY (a selective Y 1 receptor agonist), or NPY,,.,, (a
selective Y2 receptor agonist) was added to the incubation medium in
various concentrations. The slides were then processed for autoradiography and the density of the Hyperfilm silver grains was analyzed by
image analysis as described below.
Autoradiography. The slide-mounted tissue sections were placed in
apposition to p-max Hyperfilm (Amersham) alongside iodinated standards (Amersham). After l-3 weeks the film was developed in D-19
developer, fixed, and washed. When a higher degree of histological
resolution was required, the tissue was processed for standard emulsiondipped autoradiography. The emulsion-dipped autoradiograms were
developed, stained with Nissl or thionin, and mounted with Permount.
Dark-field and bright-field photomicrographs were then taken of the
silver grains and counterstained sections, respectively. This approach
generated three complementary images: the Hyperfilm autoradiograms,

this criterion, and they received three additional days of
conditioning (the expression sessions) with ( )MK-801
injections (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). When the injection solution was
switched from saline to ( )MK-801, the CR% of the
GluR 2 / mice decreased markedly, while that of the
wild-type mice decreased only marginally (Fig. 3A). A
paired t-test revealed a significant difference between the
average CR% over the last three days with saline injec-

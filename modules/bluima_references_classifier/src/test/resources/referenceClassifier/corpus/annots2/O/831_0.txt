perinatal brain samples (Fig. 1C). In both samples, 10% of
Src was in the raft fraction. The same results were obtained
using fyn / yes / and yes / brains (data not shown).
Therefore, the quantity of Src in rafts is not limited by competition from Fyn and/or Yes.
Consistent with the possibility that Fyn is the prevalent SFK
in brain lipid rafts, fyn / brain lipid rafts contained much
less tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the molecular size
range of Src and Fyn (Fig. 1D) and less material that reacted
with antibodies to the phosphorylation sites conserved across
the Src family, phosphotyrosine 418 and 529 (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, other proteins contained in lipid rafts from fyn /
brains were tyrosine- phosphorylated at levels similar to those
in lipid rafts from wild-type controls (Fig. 1D). This implies
either that Fyn is responsible for little of the tyrosine phosphorylation of raft proteins or that Src or other tyrosine kinases
can replace Fyn when Fyn is absent, even though Src distribution does not change.
The major form of Src present in brain has been reported to
be NSrc (38, 39). However, distinguishing NSrc from cSrc by
SDS-PAGE is difficult (e.g. see below, Fig. 4C) because they are
very similar in size (541 and 535 residues, respectively). To test
which form of Src was present in brain lipid raft and soluble
fractions, we made use of a modified S. aureus V8 protease
digestion (55) protocol. The modifications included dephosphorylating the proteins to prevent possible phosphorylation-de-pendent mobility changes and then labeling with radioactive
phosphate at Ser-17, using protein kinase A in the presence of
a specific Src inhibitor (54). For markers, we used NSrc and
cSrc that were expressed in SYF fibroblasts, which contain no
endogenous Src (49). As seen in Fig. 2, cSrc and NSrc immunoprecipitated from fibroblasts differ only slightly in apparent
size before digestion, but after V8 protease digestion, the sizes
of the V3 and V4 NH2-terminal fragments (Fig. 2A) are significantly different (Fig. 2B). Based on these markers, the “Src”
proteins immunoprecipitated from both the lipid raft and nonraft fractions of mouse brain are predominantly NSrc. Therefore, NSrc is partitioned partly into the lipid raft fraction in
mouse brain.

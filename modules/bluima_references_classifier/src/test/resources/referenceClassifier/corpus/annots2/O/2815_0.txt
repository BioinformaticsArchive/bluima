AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs and
NMDARs) mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the basal
ganglia and may contribute to excitotoxic injury. We investigated the functional properties of AMPARs and NMDARs ex-pressed by six main types of basal ganglia neurons in acute rat
brain slices (principal neurons and cholinergic interneurons of
striatum, GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons of substantia
nigra, globus pallidus neurons, and subthalamic nucleus neurons) using fast application of glutamate to nucleated and
outside-out membrane patches. AMPARs in diferent types of
basal ganglia neurons were functionally distinct. Those ex-pressed in striatal principal neurons exhibited the slowest gating (desensitization time constant t = 11.5 msec, 1 mM glutamate, 22Â°C), whereas those in striatal cholinergic interneurons
showed the fastest gating (desensitization time constant t =
3.6 msec). The lowest Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs was
observed in nigral dopaminergic neurons (P /P = 0.10),

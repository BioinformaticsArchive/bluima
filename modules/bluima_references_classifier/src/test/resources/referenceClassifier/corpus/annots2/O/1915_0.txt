Stimuli
The artificial complex sounds used during both
scanning and training were grouped into four
auditory categories. Each sound category was
comprised of sounds with two spectral peaks
with rapid onset or offset frequency transitions
combined together additively (see Fig. 1).
Across all four categories the acoustic source of
the lower frequency spectral peak was a 143 Hz
square-wave. For two of the categories the
source of the higher spectral peak was a 150 Hz
sawtooth wave whereas for the other two categories it was derived from uniform random
(white) noise. These source signals were filtered
to create spectral peaks approximately paralleling formant resonances of the human vocal
tract in their change in frequency across time.
Despite this similarity to speech, these sounds

speech-like (Wade and Holt, 2005). Category
exemplars varied along several spectrotemporal
dimensions with some overlap across categories, as is observed in human
speech categories (Kuhl, 2004). To successfully recognize a sound as an
exemplar of a specific category, participants needed to simultaneously
make use of multiple cues, i.e., to solve a nonlinear mapping involving both
second spectral peak onset frequency and second spectral peak steady-state
frequency (see Wade and Holt, 2005 for full details). Each category contained 11 sounds (see supplemental materials, available at
www.jneurosci.org; http://www.psy.cmu.edu/ lholt/WadeHolt2005/
gallery_irfbats.php). Six of the sounds (those in Fig. 1) were used both in
training and scanning and an additional five novel sounds (spanning ap- proximately the same spectral range) were heard only in scanning and during a behavioral posttest auditory categorization task.

Procedure
Training paradigm. Auditory training consisted of participants playing
five or more hours of a space-invaders-type computer game (Wade and
Holt, 2005) (see Fig. 2). Participants played the game unsupervised at
home with records of both game performance and time playing logged.
(For four participants, this information was lost because of data transfer
errors). In the game there were four different visually presented aliens
that participants had to either capture or shoot. Each alien was associated
with a different auditory category, an exemplar of which was played
repeatedly while the alien was on the screen. As the game progressed, the
aliens moved faster and originated further from the center of the screen.
Each alien consistently came from a particular direction, e.g., blue aliens

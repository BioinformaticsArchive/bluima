a Whatman GF/B filter under vacuum, the
filter being washed 2 times with 5 ml of the
same buffer, and finally, vigorously shaken in
scintillation vials containing 5 ml of Univer
gel® (Nakarai) for radioactivity counting.
Non-specific binding was determined by
incubating similar samples with 10 i M 5-HT.
The specific binding to 5-HT1 A subsites was
obtained by subtracting the non-specific
binding, which was defined as the binding in
the presence of 0.3 /iM 8-OH-DPAT, from
the total 3H-5-HT binding. The specific
binding to 5-HT,B subsites was calculated
as follows: the radioactivity bound in the
presence of 0.3 aM 8-OH-DPAT minus that
persisting in the presence of 10 aM 5-HT.
4.2. 3H-8-OH-DPAT: The measurement of
3H-8-OH-DPAT binding to postsynaptic 5
HT1Asites was performed as follows: a 0.8 ml
aliquot of membrane suspension was in
cubated for 10 min at 37°C in 50 mM Tris
HCI plus 0.1% ascorbate, pH 7.4, containing
0.1 ml of 3H-8-OH-DPAT solution (0.1-50
n M) . The reaction was stopped by the ad
dition of 5 ml of ice-cold Tris-HCI buffer.
They were then rapidly vacuum-filtered
through Whatman GF/B filters and rinsed 2
times with 5 ml of the same buffer. The filters
were placed in vials with 5 ml Univer-gel®
(Nakarai) scintillation cocktail. The radio
activity in the filter was determined by a liquid
scintillation spectrometer at an efficiency of
40-50%. Non-specific binding was defined
by adding 10 ,aM 5-HT. For the measure
ment of 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding to pre
synaptic 5-HT3 sites, membranes were sus
pended in 0.8 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCI plus 0.1%
ascorbate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM N-ethyl
maleimide (NEM) to inactivate postsynaptic
sites, and 0.1 ml of 3H-8-OH-DPAT (1-50
nM) (6). Samples were incubated for 10 min
at 37'C. The subsequent procedures were
carried out as described for 3H-8-OH-DPAT.
Every determination of binding was performed
in triplicate. Protein was assayed by the Lowry
method (10).
5. Calculations
Data from the saturation experiments
(Scatchard) were evaluated by non-linear
computer-assisted curve fitting. Control and
treated rats were compared using a two
tailed Student's t-test.

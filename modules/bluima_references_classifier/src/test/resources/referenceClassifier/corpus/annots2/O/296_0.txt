of a stimulus and the next spontaneous seizure (i.e., in the epoch
after a stimulus-on period), which was 7.59 6 1.29 sec. Thus, the
average delay between the end of a period of stimulation and the
next spontaneously occurring seizure is an average of 24% longer
than the interseizure interval during control experiments where no
stimulation was present.

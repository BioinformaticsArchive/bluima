Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (E.C.1.15.1.1) level in cytosolic
fractions of liver and brain was estimated using Ransod Kit supplied by Randox laboratories, Ardmore, northern Ireland, U.K.
Briefly, xanthine and xanthine oxidase were used to generate su-peroxide anion which reacts with 2-(4-indophenyl)-3(4-nitro-phenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (INT) to form a red formazan
dye. One enzyme unit of superoxide dismutase is defined as the
amount, which inhibits the INT reaction by 50%. Specific activities
are defined as units/mg protein. Protein content were measured ac-cording to the method of (Lowry et al. 1951) using bovine serum
albumin as standard.

Identification of EYFP-labelled cells
Our observations that Mbh2 is expressed by EYFP-positive cells
strongly suggest that these cells are PC neurons. Mbh2 is expressed
in the rhombic lip early in development (Bulfone et al., 2000), and
its expression pattern corresponds to the anatomically defined

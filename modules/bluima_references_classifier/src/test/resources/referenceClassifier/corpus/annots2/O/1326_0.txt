1996; O'Malley et al., 1996; Liu and Fetcho, 1999; Eaton et al.,
2001; Zottoli et al., 1987). However, even the apparently simple
startle circuit is complex: stimuli eliciting escapes activate many
other RS neurons in addition to these three pairs (Gahtan et al.,
2002), and even triple ablations do not eliminate startle responses
altogether (Liu and Fetcho, 1999).
Here, we investigated the neural substrate of capture of prey, a
complex visually evoked behavior characterized by a unique pattern of axial muscle movements (Budick and O'Malley, 2000;
Borla et al., 2002). We discovered that the tectum, in conjunction
with two identified pairs of RS neurons, MeLr and MeLc, are
required for normal prey capture performance. Our studies have
allowed us to identify essential neuronal elements of a dedicated
visuomotor pathway in the vertebrate brain.

ducedby the quail nuclei is locally depositedand is associated
with basallamina elementsthat mediatereceptor clustering.
If proteoglycansdo play a role in AChR clustering,one possibility is that they stimulate clustering directly. Another possibility is that they anchor other componentsof the basalamina
that are responsiblefor clustering. An attractive idea, for ex-ample, is that they help mediatethe effectsof agrin on muscle
cells.Their role in clusteringcould beanalogousto the suggested
role of proteoglycansin the action of two growth factors, basic
fibroblast growth factor (Rapraegeret al., 1991; Yayon et al.,
1991) and transforming growth factor-p (Lopez-Casillaset al.,
1991; Wang et al., 1991). In each case,the proteoglycan, a
componentof the extracellular matrix, forms alow-affinity componentof the receptorsystemthat concentratesthe growth factor
or assistsits binding by the high-affinity receptor. Nastuk et al.
(1991)have recently describeda high-affinity receptor for agrin
that appearsto be a membrane-boundprotein.
Agrin is a basal lamina protein that was originally purified
from Torpedoelectric organson the basisof its ability to increase
the number of AChR clusters in chick myotubes (Godfrey et
al.,1984).Theprotein,whichhasrecentlybeencloned(Rupp
et al., 1991; Tsim et al., 1992),is a large protein with multiple
proteaseinhibitor and epidermal growth factor-like domains.
Becauseagrin causesAChR clustersto appearwithin several
hours of application even in the absenceof protein synthesis
(Godfreyetal.,1984)theclustersarethoughttoarisebyaggregationofpreexistingAChRsinthemusclecellmembrane.
The AChR clustersare associatedwith heparansulfateproteoglycan, and the action of agrin on chick myotubes can be in-hibited by exogenousGAGS (Wallace, 1990).
OurexperimentsshowthatTorpedoagrinalsoincreasesthe
number of AChR clustersin C2 myotube cultures(Fig. 9); Torpedoagrin fails to induceAChR clustering,however, in cultures
of S27 cells. Preliminary experiments suggesthat this failure
may arise from the inability of S27 myotubes to bind Torpedo
agrin (H. Gordon, Z. Hall, and J. Fallon, unpublished observations). The S27 cell line is not unresponsiveto all forms of
agrin, however. In the rat, severalforms of agrin are generated
by RNA splicing; four of thesediffer in the presenceor absence
of two short contiguoussegmentso, ne of 8 amino acidsand one
of 11amino acids(Rupp et al., 1992).Although all of the splice
variants areactive on C2 cells,only thosecontaining the 8 amino

form containing the 8 amino acid insert in beingactive on chick
myotubes (Fernset al., 1992).
Although S27 myotubes are unable to support the spontaneousclustering of AChRs or the 43 kDa protein, clustersof
both were readily formed when the myotubes were cocultured
withmousespinalcordneuronsorwithchickCGcells.The
effect appearsto be specificfor neurons,ascultures of Schwann

How the neuronsinduce the formation of clustersis unclear.
They do not increasethe overall synthesisof proteoglycansby
the muscle,nor were we able to obtain evidence for local se- cretion of proteoglycan by the nerve. One possibility is that the

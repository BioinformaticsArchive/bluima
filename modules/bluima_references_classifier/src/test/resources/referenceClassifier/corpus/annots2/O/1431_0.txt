Measurement of TIMP-1, TGF-b1, TGF-b2,
MMP-2, and proMMP-1
TIMP-1 in the astrocyte supernatants was measured at
different time points using a commercial ELISA kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). MMP-2, proMMP-1,
TGF-b1, and TGF-b2 levels in astrocyte supernatants or brain
extracts were measured using commercial ELISA kits (R&D
Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The TGF-b molecules
were stimulated to the immunoreactive form by acid activation and neutralization, and the samples were diluted as per
manufacturer's recommendation. The results were normalized
to cell number based on MTT activity (Manthrope et al.,
1986). For brain extracts, the ELISA results were normalized
to their total protein content. The protein determination was
done using a BCA method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Statistical
analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software,
with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and NewmanKeuls post-test for multiple comparisons.

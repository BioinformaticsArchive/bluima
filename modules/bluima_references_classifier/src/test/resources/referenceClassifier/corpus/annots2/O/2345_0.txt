RESULTS

Hypoglossal motoneurones. Intracellular records were obtained from
thirty-seven hypoglossal motoneurones. The kind of synaptic responses
produced by single 4 msec surface anodal pulses delivered to a point on the
cortical surface is indicated in Fig. 1. In this figure the position of the focal
anode is shown by the black dot on the tracing of a photograph of the
frontal poles made after fixation of the brain in situ at the end of the
experiment. The synaptic responses produced by surface anodal shocks of
the indicated intensities between 0-6 and 1-2 mA are illustrated in the
single oscillograph traces on the right. With a shock of 1-2 mA the cell was
caused to discharge an impulse, but only the base of this is seen on the
photograph. A characteristic feature of the synaptic responses evoked in
hypoglossal motoneurones by stimuli above threshold values was that the
depolarization reached its maximum amplitude in a series of steps. Such
steps are seen clearly in some of the records of Fig. 1. They bear a close
resemblance to the steps on the synaptic depolarizations already described
in hypoglossal motoneurones and resulting from stimulation of lingual
nerve afferents (see Porter, 1965, Fig. 6). The amplitudes of the individual
steps and the frequency of occurrence of steps on a large synaptic potential
were also closely similar to those caused by electrical excitation of lingual
nerve afferents. Hence, in the cell illustrated in Fig. 1, a shock of 1-05 mA
produced a depolarization of 4 mV, reached in three major steps at a
frequency of about 800/sec. However, the steps were not so regularly produced as those caused by lingual nerve shocks and superimposed less well
in repeated observations.
The latency of the beginning of the synaptic potential depended on the
intensity of the cortical stimulus. For a threshold response the latency was
frequently between 6 and 12 msec. Increasing the stimulus intensity caused
a reduction in the latency of the earliest depolarization. This is seen in
Fig. 1 and also in Fig. 2 where the numbers alongside the points on the
graph indicate the latency from the beginning of the cortical shock to the
onset of the synaptic potential. In this case an increase in surface anodal

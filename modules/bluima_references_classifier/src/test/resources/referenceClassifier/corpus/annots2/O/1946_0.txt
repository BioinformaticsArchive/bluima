CLCA, and bestrophin channels, bestrophin channel appears to be the best candidate for CAAC because the Cl currents

many of the properties of native CAAC

2004; Barro Soria et al., 2006), such as
Ca 2 activation, sensitivity to niflumic
acid, and outwardly rectifying current–

genes, because it has been reported that
ClC3-deleted mice displayed the impaired
CaMKII-activated but intact Ca 2 - activated anion conductance (Hartzell et
al., 2005). Our results showed a lack of
expression of CLCA in astrocytes, and
CLCA possesses properties that are inconsistent with astrocytic CAAC (Fig. 4 A)
(Eggermont, 2004). Despite their strong
expression, Ttyh1 and Ttyh2 are insensitive to Ca 2 (Suzuki and Mizuno,
2004). Ttyh3, one of the Ttyh family
genes showing Ca 2 -dependent generation of maxi-anion current when ex- pressed heterologously in CHO cells, was
also unlikely to mediate CAAC because
Ttyh3 response displays a linear current–

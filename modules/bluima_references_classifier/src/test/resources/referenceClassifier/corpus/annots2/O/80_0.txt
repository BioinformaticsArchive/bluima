be more sensitive to NGF than rat sympathetic neurons, we
initially performed survival assays to determine an appropriate
NGF concentration. Neurons were maintained for 5 d in 50 ng /ml
NGF and were switched to concentrations of NGF ranging from
0.1 to 10 ng/ml NGF for 3 d, and survival was then measured
using MTT assays. These experiments revealed that 5, 7.5, and 10
ng/ml NGF were all able to mediate maximal mouse sympathetic
neuron survival (Fig. 5A). To ensure that BDNF had no apoptotic
effect under these survival conditions, we performed similar ex-periments with 7.5 or 10 ng/ml NGF plus or minus 100 ng/ml
BDNF. MTT assays revealed that, as for rat neurons (Fig. 1A),
BDNF did not affect mouse sympathetic neuron survival in the
presence of optimal concentrations of NGF (Fig. 5B). On the
basis of these data, we selected 7.5 ng/ml NGF for our experiments, a concentration that was optimal for survival and in which
BDNF had no significant effect on survival.
We then examined sympathetic neurons from p75NTR-/mice to determine first whether the lack of p75NTR imparted to
p75NTR-/- neurons an intrinsic ability to extend more neuritic
processes, and second, whether BDN F was acting through
p75NTR to inhibit TrkA-mediated growth. To perform these
experiments, sympathetic neurons were cultured from
p75NTR-/- versus control mice on the same day, were maintained for 3 d in 50 ng /ml NGF, and were subsequently switched
to 7.5 ng /ml NGF plus or minus 100 ng /ml BDN F. Measurement
of neuritic process density revealed that p75NTR-/- neurons
exhibited an almost twofold increase in neurite outgrowth relative to their wild-type counterparts (Figs. 5C,D, Fig. 6 A,C), a
result similar to that observed with the REX and anti-BDNF
antibodies in experiments using rat sympathetic neuron cultures
(Fig. 4). Moreover, although BDN F decreased the degree of
neuritogenesis in wild-type mouse cultures by an average of 35%
(Figs. 5C,D, 6 A,B), a result similar to that observed with rat
neurons(Fig.1B,C),exogenousBDNFhadnoeffectongrowthof
p75NTR-/- neurons (Figs. 5C,D, 6C,D). Thus p75NTR is re-quired for BDNF to inhibit NGF-mediated sympathetic neuron
growth, and NGF is more effective at eliciting growth in the
absence of p75NTR.

INTRODUCTION

It is commonly believed that in the visual cortex experience can induce permanent
changes of neuronal response properties during a critical period of early development.
Just when experience can induce such changes has so far been investigated only with
the paradigm of monocular deprivation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1970; Blakemore, 1976;
Blakemore & Van Sluyters, 1974; Blakemore, Garey & Vital-Durand, 1978; Olson
& Freeman, 1978, 1980). Recently Cynader & Mitchell (1980) showed that raising
kittens in the dark before monocular deprivation can considerably extend the period
during which striate cortex is susceptible to monocular deprivation. Thus, the period
during which cortical plasticity is demonstrable does depend on the way in which
experience is manipulated.
The hypothesis leading to the present investigation was that paradigms other than
monocular deprivation might be capable of revealing long-term plasticity even in
adult striate cortex. Rather than merely deprive the system of its natural input, we
manipulated retinal signals in a way that we thought would force the visual system
to change. As in the preceding study (Singer, Tretter & Yinon, 1982) we employed
surgical eye rotation, expecting that the mismatch between retinal co-ordinates and
other sensory-motor maps would disturb visually guided behaviour of adult cats at
least to the same extent as it did in kittens. The results, some of which have been
published in short form previously (Singer, Yinon & Tretter, 1979c), confirm our
expectancy and demonstrate a remarkable degree of functional plasticity in the
mature visual system.

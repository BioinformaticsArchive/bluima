site of Fig. 7A. Saccades initiated near the centrally located goal (open arrow in Fig. SD) had
longer latencies, on average, than did saccades
originating from more eccentric positions on
either side of the OMR. Latencies of contraversive and ipsiversive saccades beginning at
comparable distances from the midline did not
differ significantly from each other (MannWhitney U). Unfortunately, only one stimulus
site in this study was associated with a goal
sufficiently near the center of the OMR to permit observation of large numbers of ipsiversive
saccades of various sizes. Further work is
needed to confirm these findings.
Paired stimulation of opposite colliculi
Combined stimulation of opposite colliculi
also produced saccades that were markedly
dependent on initial eye position (Fig. 9). Eye
movements evoked from two anterior sites
converged toward a vertically elongated zone
that shifted horizontally as the ratio of stimulus
intensities on the two sides was varied. Stimuli
applied while gaze was directed at this zone
yielded small, slow movements, but no saccades. The eye movements evoked with bilateral stimulation at anterior sites were often
composed of several unit saccades, which
drove the line of sight to (Fig. 9C) or through
(Fig. 9F) the zone of saccade failure. Simultaneous stimulation at opposite posterior sites
yielded similar results, except that multiple

Paz electrometrically (Radiometer PHM71 MK2) at
38‚ÄùC, and for 02 saturation and hemoglobin content
spectrophotometrically (Instrumentation Laboratories
CO-oximeter).
Experimental procedures. Three separate sets of ex-periments were done. In the first (group 1) we sought to
determine the ventilatory responses to decreases in brain
blood flow without the interference of additional instrumentation and also to determine whether acute ischemia
could produce an intense hyperpnea similar to that ob-served with inhalation of carbon monoxide. For these
studies, six goats were prepared as indicated above. Ventilatory responses, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate
were determined during the control state and during
reduction of BBF to 85 and 70% of control. Data were
obtained 7-10 min after final adjustment of the screw
clamps to achieve the new level of BBF. In addition,
BBF was gradually reduced below 70% of control until
intense hyperpnea was observed. The average BBF at
which this hyperpnea occurred was 42% of control. Be-cause this was found to be an inherently unstable state,
measurements were made 3-5 min after the final BBF
adjustment.
In another group of six animals ( group Z), we sought
to relate the ventilatory and circulatory changes during
BBF reduction to changes in gas tensions of cerebral
venous blood and to 02 consumption of the brain. To
accomplish this, we implanted a plastic cannula into the
sagittal sinus. The surgical procedure was done under
general anesthesia at least 24 h prior to study. A small
incision was made in the skin and muscle between the
horns. Then a burr hole was placed in the skull just
anterior to the junction of the sagittal and coronal su-tures. The sagittal sinus thus exposed was punctured
with a needle, through which a plastic catheter was
threaded. The catheter was sutured firmly to the skin,
and flushed periodically with heparinized saline.
In these studies, achievement of the steady state was
important. Therefore, measurements were made and ar-terial and cerebral venous blood were sampled from 7 to
10 min following reduction of BBF to 85, 70, and 50% of
the control value. The last level (50% of control) was the
lowest BBF level that allowed maintenance of steadystate conditions for the above measurements. Brain ox-ygen consumption was calculated in a standard manner
assuming an 02 capacity of goat blood of 1.34 ml 02/g
hemoglobin.
A third study was done to determine whether certain
systemic factors could be related to the hyperpnea ob-served at low levels of BBF. Specifically we wanted to
test whether the hyperpnea was associated with an in-crease in systemic metabolic rate due to adrenergic stimulation. Five goats (group 3) were prepared for measurement and control of BBF as described for group 1. Baseline studies were done as for group 1 at 100 and 50%
BBF, except that in this study we also added the collection of expired gas with analysis of the gas for volume
(dry gas meter) and CO:! and 02 tension (electrodes,
periodically checked by the micro-Scholander method).
Thus, we were able to measure oxygen uptake and CO2
elimination. After base-line studies were done, P-adrenergic blockade was achieved by slow (l-h) intravenous

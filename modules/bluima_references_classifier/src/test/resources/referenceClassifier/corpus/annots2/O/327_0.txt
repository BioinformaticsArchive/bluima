cence analysis of PC12 cells transiently transfected with the indicated
GFP fusion constructs. Panel C, immunoblotting analysis of PC12 ly-sates from cells transiently transfected with empty vector (control) or
the GFP fusion constructs indicated. Antibodies employed for the im-munoblots are shown on the left (SGS antibody, upper panel; anti-GFP,
lower panel), and the positions of the major immunoreactive bands at
;65 kDa are shown on the right. For both antibodies, faint nonspecific
staining (present even in control cells) of faster migrating bands is
evident in all lanes. Panel D, PC12 cell lysates prepared 2 days after
transient transfection were divided and incubated with either goat
anti-RGS7 C-terminal antibody C-19 or normal goat IgG. After precipitation, the washed immunoprecipitates were analyzed for RGS7 (upper
panel) and Gβ (SGS antibody, lower panel) immunoreactivity by im- 5

munoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative mobility of the specific immunoreactive bands (in kDa) and the
goat immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) is indicated on the right. Cells
were transfected with either vector alone or with cDNAs encoding
GFP-Gβ + RGS7, or GFP-Gβ -L22P,L26P + RGS7 as indicated below

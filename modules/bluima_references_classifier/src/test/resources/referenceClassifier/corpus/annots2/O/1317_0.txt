Four days after the occlusion of the carotid arteries, perfusion
fixation was performed. The gerbils received an overdose of
pentobarbital (200 mg / kg) intraperitoneally. The animals were perfused first with 120–150 mL PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 500 mL of 4%
paraformaldehyde solution, pH 7.4, at a rate of 40 mL / min. The head
of the gerbil was then removed and the brain was postfixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 h. The brain was then cut into
coronal blocks using a rodent brain matrix. Blocks containing the
hippocampus were embedded in paraffin wax and sliced coronally
with a microtome at 40 lm thickness. Sections were stained with
haematoxylin–eosin for histological evaluation. The total number of
intact neurons in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus was counted by
unbiased stereology (Gundersen et al., 1988; Olsen et al., 1994) using
the CAST GRID System (Olympus, Denmark). Briefly, every sixth
section (f1 = 6) throughout the hippocampus was sampled and viable
hippocampal neurons were counted in the CA1 region in eight sections
in each animal. A viable neuron was defined as a neuron with a
clear and distinct nuclear membrane and nucleolus. In each selected
section only a fraction (f2 = asampling / aframe; counting frame
area aframe = 286.1 lm2) of a sampling area (sampling area
asampling = 16 900 lm2) was counted. The first counting frame in a
sample area was selected randomly and the step size to the next
sampling area was x = 130 lm, y = 130 lm. Only a fraction in depth
(hdis = 15 lm, f3 = section thickness / hdis) into the selected section
was counted.
The total number of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus was
estimated by multiplying the sum of the counted number of neurons
with the fraction factors (Olsen et al., 1994).

Electrode evaluation
Of the 20 electrodes aimed at cochlear
nuclei, 15 proved suitable for use in the de-tection experiments, the remaining electrodes having open or shorted leads or failing to give stable thresholds. Figure 1 shows
the placement of the 15 electrode tips as
confirmed in the histological material. Tips
D, E, and F were centered within the cellular
region of the anteroventral division of cochlear nucleus (AVCN). Electrode tips I, L,
M, N, and 0 were located beyond the boundaries of the cochlear nucleus complex.
The remainder of the electrodes, A, B, C,
G, H, J, and K, were found at the medial
and ventral margin of the nucleus. The de-tection thresholds in silence for the 15placements are given in Table 1.
Effect of noise bursts on electrical
detection threshold (expt Z and IA)
Acoustic masking noise presented simultaneously with the electrical stimulus pulses
(condition I) caused a consistent elevation
in electrical detection threshold at many of
the stimulation sites tested. Compared to
thresholds obtained in silence, thresholds
in noise were elevated by 4.0 dB or more
at 8 of the 15 sites (Fig. 1: electrodes A, B,
C, D, E, F, G, H-striped bars). At four
stimulation sites (Fig. 1: electrodes A, B, H,
L.-solid bars), thresholds were slightly but
consistently lower when the masker was
presented between the stimulus pulses than
when the stimulus pulses were presented
in silence. At the remainder of the stimulation sites, the thresholds obtained with the
masker between the stimulus pulses did not
differ markedly from those obtained in si-lence. The cats bearing electrodes A, B, and
D were selected for further study in expt
II-IV on the basis of the results of this ex-periment.
Stimulation site and effects of
acoustical noise
Comparison of the upper and lower panels
of Fig. 1reveals that the amount of threshold
elevation produced when masker and pulse
were synchronized varied systematically
according to the location of the stimulating
electrode tip. Specifically, threshold elevation tended to be large (4.1-10.6 dB) for
those stimulation sites that were located

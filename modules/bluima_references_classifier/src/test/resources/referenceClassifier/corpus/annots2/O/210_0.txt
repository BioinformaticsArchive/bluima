The use of viral vectors to transfect genes into specific brain-cell populations is a novel approach that
can be used to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of brain function. Ideal vectors should
be targetable and capable of regulated transgene expression. From the viral vectors developed so
far, this article focuses on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based vectors. HSV-1 vectors can be
engineered for gene transfer to the brain, which makes them suitable for neuroscience research
applications.In particular,genetic manipulations of the virus can almost eliminate toxicity and allow
expression of multiple transgenes simultaneously. In some instances, transfection of selected
neuronal populations is also possible. Specific alterations in behaviour and in disease models have
been described after the viral-vector-mediated expression of specific genes within highly localized
brain regions.

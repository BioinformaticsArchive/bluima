threshold and declining to about one-quarter
of this value at the highest level studied (37
dB SPL; 41 dB above threshold).
A sharp peak occurred with the 27-dB function for unit 84-3-24 at contralateral 20° (Fig.
1B); spike counts were very low at 60-80'
contralateral as well as at 0' and further ip-silaterally. At higher intensities the azimuth
functions changed from this bounded shape
to a plateau-shaped function at 47 dB SPL.
Maximum spike counts for this unit were
monotonically related to tone intensity over
the range studied.
A less common form of azimuthal selectivity to high-frequency tones was manifested in
bounded azimuth functions with relatively
constant best azimuths (7 units). In the ex-ample in Fig. 1C, peak firing occurred at contralateral loo for unit 84-10-19 stimulated at
24 dB SPL and 17.4 kHz. At higher intensities
(27-47 dB above threshold) the best azimuth
shifted to 20”, and the functions became
broader. A sharp notch persisted in all azimuth
functions at contralateral 60' azimuth, and
firing rate was monotonically related to intensity until 54 dB, 47 dB above threshold.

Cell size (reciprocal of input resistance)
of TA motoneurons is related to the
maximum tetanic tension of TA motor
units (16). Figure 3 relates the summed
group Ia EPSP to the maximum tetanic
tension of TA motoneurons. Large tetanic
tension type-FF units tended to have small
group Ia EPSPs, while small-tension typeFR and -S units had larger group Ia EPSPs.
The F(int) units occupy the area of overlap between type-FF and -FR units. A
least-squares line that was fitted to these
data was significantly different from zero
(P < 0.001, Y = -0.60). Data points from
individual experiments showed the same
general trend. A somewhat stronger relationship between tetanic tension and ho-.
monymous group Ia EPSP amplitude was
observed for MG motor units (8).
The cumulative tension profiles that are
generated by summing the tetanic tension
of TA motor units under three different
“recruitment” orders are illustrated in
Fig. 4. The tetanic tension produced by
each motor unit was expressed as a percentage of the total tension of the entire
sample. A linear relationship between
cumulative tension (plotted on logarithmic

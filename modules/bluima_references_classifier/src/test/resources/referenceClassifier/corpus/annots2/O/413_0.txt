Fig. 4. LY404187 selectively potentiates AMPA receptor-mediated currents. A, the response to application
of 100 μM glutamate (GLU) was
blocked by 50 μM LY300168. Following elimination of LY300168, subsequent application of 3 μM LY404187
potentiated the GLU response. This
potentiated response was blocked by
50 μM LY300168. B, when the membrane potential of neurons was held
near 0 mV, application of 200 μM
NMDA (in the presence of 30 μM glycine) evoked an inward current that
was not potentiated by LY404187. In
these same neurons, when the membrane potential was held at -80 mV,
the response to 5 μM AMPA was po-tentiated by 3 μM LY404187. C and
D, plots of the average peak amplitudes for each condition in A and B. E
and F, plots of the peak whole-cell
potassium and sodium currents re-corded during control conditions and
in the presence of LY404187 (0.1–
10.0 μM). No change in these conductances was observed.

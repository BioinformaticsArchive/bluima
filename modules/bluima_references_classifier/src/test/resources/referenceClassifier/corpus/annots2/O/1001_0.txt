transporter reversal) or impaired uptake (possibly due to
decreased transporter function or expression). It was also
not clear to what extent neuronal (apart from glial) glutamate transporters contributed to this increase. We show
here that at least synaptosomal glutamate transporters are
impaired in TLE patients. Under basal conditions, they
operate mainly in a reversed mode, as indicated by the
2

increased basal and decreased K -stimulated, Ca -independent glutamate release (Fig. 1A), decreased sensitivity to tPDC (Fig. 3), and decreased 3H-glutamate up-take (Fig. 5A).
We have shown previously that these human TLE
synaptosomes exhibit a K -induced increase in B-50/
growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) phosphorylation, a
K -induced raise in intracellular Ca2 concentration, and
an incorporation of 32P-labeled phosphate into phosphoproteins that was similar to that in rat synaptosomes
(Hoogland et al., 1999). We therefore concluded that
human TLE synaptosomes have an active energy metabolism, a normal ion gradient, and a normal protein kinase
C activity. To exclude, however, that reversal of synaptosomal glutamate transporters merely resulted from hypoxia in the biopsy, which may have developed in the
course of the excision, we carried out control experiments
in rats and in peritumoral cortical tissue from nonepileptic
patients. Indeed, synaptosomes from hypoxic tissue exhibited less glutamate uptake compared to that in freshly
isolated synaptosomes, suggesting that hypoxia causes
more transporters to operate in their reversed mode (Fig.
5A). Glutamate uptake and sensitivity to tPDC in synaptosomes from neocortical biopsies (usually excised within
15 min), however, was similar to that in synaptosomes
from hippocampal biopsies (usually excised within
60 min). We therefore conclude that the surgically in-duced hypoxia contributed only partially to the increased
transporter reversal found in TLE synaptosomes.
In synaptosomes, tPDC has been suggested to act as
a competitive glutamate transport inhibitor that is transported into the cytoplasm and, by displacement, induces
some glutamate efflux from this compartment (Waldmeier
et al., 1993). We demonstrated previously that rat cortical
synaptosomes contain twice as much glutamate compared
to that in neocortical synaptosomes from TLE patients
(Hoogland et al., 1999). If tPDC could induce as much
glutamate efflux in rat as in TLE patient synaptosomes, it
would thus be shown as a higher percentage of the total
content in TLE patients compared to that in the rat.
Instead, we found the opposite (Fig. 3), indicating im-paired tPDC-induced heteroexchange by the transporter
from the cytosolic pool in TLE patients. Similarly, by
microdialysis Ghijsen et al. (1999) have shown recently
that tPDC was less effective in kindled rats than in controls. We therefore conclude that the reduced tPDC sensitivity observed in synaptosomes from TLE patients re-flects impaired glutamate transport (possibly due to
reduced activity of the transporter or increased transporter
reversal).

Figure 2. Intermediate neural progenitor
domains and neuronal progeny are altered in
XtJ/XtJ embryos. (A,B) The expression of
Nkx6.2 (red) expands dorsally in XtJ/XtJ em- bryos (B) compared to Wt (A), and scattered
Nkx6.1- (green) expressing cells are detected
within the Nkx6.2 domain. (C,D) Whereas
Nkx6.2 (red) expression is expanded in XtJ/
XtJ embryos, the domain of Pax7 (green) ex- pression is unchanged, resulting in a significant increase in the number of cells expressing both Pax7 and Nkx6.2 (yellow cells in B)
in mutant embryos. (E,F) The domain of
Dbx1 expression (green) is also expanded
dorsally in XtJ/XtJ embryos (F), and in contrast to Wt (E), cells coexpressing Nkx6.2
(red) and Dbx1 are evident (yellow cells).
(G,H) The generation of Evx1-expressing, V0
neurons (green) from Dbx1+ progenitors (red)
is expanded dorsally in the absence of Gli3
(H) compared to Wt embryos (G). (I,J) The
ectopic dorsal expression of Nkx6.1 (green)
in XtJ/XtJ embryos (J) results in the generation of Chx10- (red) expressing V2 neurons in ectopic dorsal positions. (K,L) En1-expressing V1 neurons (red) and Evx1-expressing V0
neurons (green). In XtJ/XtJ embryos (L), V1 neuron generation can be detected dorsal to the normal limit, intermingled with V0 neurons.
(M,N) The generation of Lmx1b- (green expressing dI5 neurons is significantly reduced in XtJ/XtJ embryos (N), and the region in which
these neurons are usually specified generates Lim1/2- (red) expressing neurons. (O,P) The generation of dI6 neurons which express Lbx1
(red) and Lim1/2 (green) is expanded dorsally in the absence of Gli3, whereas the generation of dI4 neurons is reduced (P). (Q) Summary
indicating the relationship between progenitor proteins and neuronal subtype identity. Images shown are of forelimb levels with the
exception of I and J, which are from rhombomere 8 of the hindbrain. Similar data were obtained from sections of neural tube at
hindbrain and hindlimb levels (not shown).

The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is a major recipient
of autonomic information from more caudal regions
of the brainstem and is implicated in the regulation of
a number of physiological functions.3,7,19,20,26,33 We
have previously reported that receptors for excitatory
amino acids [N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), nonNMDA] and kainate exist on lateral PBN (LPBN)
neurons and play an important role in controlling
neuronal excitability within this region.35 Recently,
we have also demonstrated that excitatory neurotransmission in the LBPN is mediated principally

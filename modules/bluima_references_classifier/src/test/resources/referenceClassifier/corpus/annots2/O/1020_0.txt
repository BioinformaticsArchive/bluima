RMg between the MPB and ventral respiratory neurons
has been demonstrated (Gang et al., 1990). These hypotheses are reinforced by the DPCPX results. Indeed, the
decrease in c-fos expression in MPB and RMg induced by
DPCPX is in favor of an excitatory effect of adenosine via
A1 receptors on these neurons. The decrease in MPB
neuronal activity could be due to the suppression of the
presynaptic adenosine inhibition of the GABAergic transmission discussed previously. Consequently, excitatory in-puts from MPB relayed to RMg would be reduced. This
could explain, at least in part, the decrease in Rf
observed in presence of DPCPX. Moreover, on these
pontomedullary–spinal cord preparations, the decrease in
neuronal activity in the vlNTS, the AP and the ROb previously described for medullary–spinal cord preparations is
still present after R-PIA exposure. We can then suppose
that the excitatory action of the MPB added with the re-moval of AP and ROb inhibitory influence surpasses the
direct inhibitory influence of the adenosine A1 receptor
activation on the respiratory neurons of the VLM.

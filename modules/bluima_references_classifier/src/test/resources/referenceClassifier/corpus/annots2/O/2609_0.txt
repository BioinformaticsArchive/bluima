FIG. 7. Polarity of the HM DNA. The total cellular DNA from the spinal
cords of moribund mice that were infected with ts1 was pooled, and samples of
32 μg each were digested with HaeIII (lanes 2 and 3). A Southern blot of the
DNA was probed with minus-sense single-stranded DNA (ss) that was complementary to M13-env-SB (lanes 1 and 2) and with plus-sense single-stranded
DNA that was complementary to M13-env-BS (lanes 3 and 4). Lanes 1 and 4,
controls that contain 32 μg each of total cellular DNA from the pancreas of a
paralyzed moribund mouse (no. 280). ds, double-stranded DNA.

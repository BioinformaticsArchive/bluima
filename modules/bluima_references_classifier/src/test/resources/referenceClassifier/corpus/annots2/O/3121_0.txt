In lower animals with simpler nervous systems, single types of
cells can be recognized and studied in living and fixed neurons,
particularly during development. The elegant studies on axonal
growth and neuronal development in grasshopper (Goodman and
Spitzer, 1979; Keshishian and Bentley, 1983) and other species
with simple systems, including Drosophila and nematodes, have
benefited significantly from being able to identif y repeatedly
selected cells and their axons in related experiments. To allow
some of the same advantages in the mammalian brain, we generated transgenic mice that have strong expression of a marker
gene, green fluorescent protein (GFP), that is expressed throughout the processes in restricted subpopulations of neurons in the
brain and spinal cord.
Viral vectors that express GFP have been used to label neurons, but some viruses have the problem of being potentially
toxic, and virally induced GFP is generally transient (Moriyoshi
et al., 1996). Biolistics works nicely to shoot GFP gene-coated
particles into brain slices, but which cell expresses the gene is
partially random, and biolistics does not work well with cultured
cells (L o et al., 1994).
In some previous experiments, the intensity of GFP expression

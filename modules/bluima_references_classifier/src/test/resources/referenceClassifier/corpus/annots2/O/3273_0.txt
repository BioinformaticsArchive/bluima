gery. A small burrhole was placed in the right
parietal bone of five animals; thereafter, 0.05 ml
of a 2% nutrient agar solution contaminated with
pure cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis (penicillin sensitive) was injected intracerebrally through
the intact dura mater using a 30 gauge needle
(Hassler and Forsgren, 1964). The agar had
cooled to the point of early solidification at the
time of injection so that the agar would not
flow through the needle tract and contaminate the
subarachnoid space. Three control animals underwent similar trephination procedures and direct
intracerebral instillation of 0.05 ml of sterile 2%
nutrient agar. These intracerebrally inoculated
monkeys then underwent scalp closure and re-ceived a single intramuscular dose of 600 000 units
of procaine penicillin G in oil.
Eight monkeys underwent right carotid arteriotomy and embolisation with 1.5 mmX8 mm
cylinders (Microfil, Canton-Biochemical Products,
Boulder, Colorado) using the technique described
by Molinari (1972) and Laurent et al. (1975). These
pliable cylinders were contaminated with pure cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis (penicillin
sensitive) before carotid arterial injection. Five
control animals were embolised in a similar way
with sterile silicone cylinders. These embolised
animals received a single 600 000 unit dose of
intramuscular procaine penicillin G in oil to prevent mycotic aneurysm formation and fatal subarachnoid haemorrhage (Molinari et al., 1973).
During the sixth week fafter operation the
animals were anaesthetised with incremental
intravenous sodium thiamylal and needle aspiration of the brain abscesses was attempted through
right parietal burrholes. Specimens, when available, were cultured aerobically and anaerobically.
The animals were then perfused with physiological
saline followed with 10% buffered formalin.
After removal, the brains were stored in 10%
formalin for one week. Thereafter, the brains
were cut into standard 4.5 mm thick coronal sec-

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) belong to a class of extracellular proteinases responsible for maintaining and remodeling the
extracellular matrix. In addition to multiple functions in normal
physiology, abnormal MMP expression and activity may also
participate in the pathophysiology of cerebral disease. Here, we
show that MMP-9 (gelatinase B; EC.3.4.24.35) contributes to the
pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury. After controlled cortical impact in mice, MMP-9 was increased in traumatized brain.
Total MMP-9 levels at 24 hr were significantly increased as
measured by a substrate cleavage assay. Zymograms showed
that MMP-9 was elevated as early as 3 hr after traumatic brain
injury, reaching a maximum at ;24 hr. Increased MMP-9 levels
persisted for up to 1 week. Western blot analysis indicated
increased profiles of MMP-9 expression that corresponded with

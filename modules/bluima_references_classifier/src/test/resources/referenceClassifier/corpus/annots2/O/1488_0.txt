permeable membrane with a controlled pore size,
allowing the inward diffusion of nutrients and the
outward diffusion of the secreted bioactive agents.
Also, this encapsulation technique provides
immunoprotection by selectively restricting the
passage of cellular and humoral elements of the
host immune system, and prevents tumor formation by physically isolating active dividing cells
from host parenchyma. Although this encapsulation cell therapy supposed to be a promising technique, one problem has been pointed out about
the possibility that endogenous retrovirus present
in xenogeneic cells could infect human cells and
lead to new, transmissible human diseases
(Lysaght and Aebischer 1999). To solve this
problem, we encapsulated allogeneic, non-infected IHAE cells for transplantation cell therapy. It
is confirmed that encapsulated IHAE cells can
secrete lysosomal enzymes outside capsule.
Although Tohyama et al. (1997) reported the
tumorigenesis of IHAE cells after the implantation into the rat subcutaneous tissue, no tumor
formation was detected in the presenting experiments.
In the present study, we confirmed that the
encapsulated AxCAhGUS-transduced IHAE cells
can secrete significant amount of GUSB into the
cerebral parenchyma of C3H mice. In the treatment of MPSVII, deficient enzyme replacement
therapy cannot correct the lysosomal distension in
adult brain because infused GUSB did not cross
the blood-brain barrier in mice after 2 weeks of
age (Vogler et al. 2003). Subsequently, the braindirected gene therapy, in which viral vectors were
introduced directly into the brain, has been developed to bypass the BBB and correct CNS pathology. Although this direct intracerebral injection
of GUSB-encoding viral vectors using adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAV), and lentiviruses showed evidence of clearance of CNS
storage, some disadvantages of gene therapy were
reported. The effect of adenovirus as a vector is
generally transient. Donsante et al. reported that
a significant incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and angiosarcomas was discovered after
GUSB encoding recombinant AAV in the murine
experiment of MPSVII (Donsante et al. 2001).

reflexive saccades by a mechanism such as that described above
has been supported by the results of studies in human patients
with lesions restricted to the prefrontotectal pathways. These pa-tients commit more antisaccade errors when the visual stimulus
is presented in the hemifield contralateral to the side of the lesion
(Gaymard et al., 2003; Ploner et al., 2005), suggesting a lateralized
failure of top-down control. Results of inactivation studies in the
monkey are less clear (Condy et al., 2006). Muscimol inactivation
of the area surrounding the principal sulcus lead to an increase in
antisaccade errors when the visual stimulus was presented ipsilateral to the inactivated hemisphere, the exact opposite of what
our findings would predict. A possible explanation for this is that
the inactivated sites corresponded to areas 46 and 9/46 (Petrides
and Pandya, 1999), whereas our corticotectal neurons were re-corded primarily from area 8a, anterior to FEFs. This area corresponds closely to that identified by Hasegawa et al. (2004), as
containing neurons coding saccade suppression.

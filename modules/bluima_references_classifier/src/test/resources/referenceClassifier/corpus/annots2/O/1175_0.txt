CNS fatty acid profile reflects expected
changes with DHA depletion and repletion
DHA deficiency can be confirmed by assessing the levels of other
C22 fatty acids that coordinately change in rodent brain in re-sponse to DHA depletion and repletion. For example, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (22:5n-6) shows a compensatory increase
in rodent brain with DHA-deficient diets (Youyou et al., 1986;
Salem et al., 2001). We reported previously that the DHA content
in the frontal cortex of Tg2576 mice was depleted when animals
were placed on this low-DHA diet paradigm, which resulted in
DPA increasing 3.1-fold ( p 0.001), but with DHA, supplementation resulted in an 8.4-fold decrease ( p 0.0001) (Calon et al.,
2004). Another 22 carbon fatty acid, adrenic acid, C22:4 (n-6), is
also increased by DHA depletion and restored to normal levels by
DHA supplementation (Ikemoto et al., 2001; Greiner et al.,
2003). Hence, we measured the levels of adrenic acid in frontal
cortex of all animals (Table 1). Adrenic acid was significantly
increased by 15% in transgenic mice on low-DHA diets ( p
0.01) compared with control diet; there was no significant in-crease in nontransgenic animals. When placed on high-DHA di-ets, adrenic acid levels decreased by 29 â€“37% ( p 0.0001).
Therefore, adrenic acid changes were consistent with transgeneand diet-dependent DHA depletion that was restored with DHA
supplementation.

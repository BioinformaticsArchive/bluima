Ventral midbrain dopamine neurons send efferent projections to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that establish
connections with pyramidal cells [7]. In turn, efferent
projections from PFC pyramidal cells innervate the ventral
midbrain and establish synaptic connections with dopamine and non-dopamine neurons [8,9]. These anatomical
findings are consistent with previous reports showing that
subcortical dopamine neurotransmission is modulated by
dopamine in the PFC, via its action on efferent inputs to
the ventral midbrain [11,13]. Recent studies also suggest
that neurotensin may play an important role in the modulation of ventral midbrain neuronal activity by PFC efferent
projections. Neurotensin is co-localized, and co-released,
with dopamine in the PFC [2,10], and activation of
neurotensin receptors in this region stimulates firing of a
subpopulation of ventral midbrain dopamine neurons [5].
This latter finding is consistent with the existence of
asymmetrical (excitatory) synaptic contacts between presumed dopamine neurons and PFC efferent terminals [8].

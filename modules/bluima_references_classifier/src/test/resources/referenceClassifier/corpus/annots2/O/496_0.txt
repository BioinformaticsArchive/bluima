this regulation is more complex and varies depending upon
the experimental model. This latter finding indicates that
[7]
estrogen is just one of the ovarian factors that regulates
GnRH gene expression. During reproductive aging, effects
of estrogen on GnRH gene expression change. In middleaged intact animals, the preovulatory LH surge is dam- [8]
pened as is the increase in GnRH gene activation.
In ovariectomized animals, effects of estrogen replacement are actually greater in old compared to young
animals. For the NMDAR system, again, age and ovarian [9]
status interact in a complex manner in their regulation by
estrogen. In intact animals, NMDAR gene expression in [10]
the POA-AH is decreased in animals that are acyclic
compared to those that are cycling. In the POA-AH of
OVX animals, NMDAR gene expression does not change
[11]
much, but is down-regulated by estrogen, particularly in
young and middle-aged compared to old animals. Again,
these results indicate that the effects of reproductive status [12]
on expression of molecules in the POA-AH involve factors
other than estrogen that are produced by the ovary.
Moreover, they demonstrate a differential sensitivity of the [13]
aged compared to the young brain to estrogen feedback
and challenge the use of the young OVX model as a
representation of the menopausal transition, as these young
animals do not respond in the same way as old animals to [14]
estrogen replacement.

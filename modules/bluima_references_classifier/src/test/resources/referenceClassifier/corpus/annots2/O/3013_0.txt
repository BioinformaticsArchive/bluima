processing of incoming sensory information, thereby preventing
processing of the C S during footshock administration.
Neuroanatomical studies have demonstrated that circuitry that
could mediate such a dlPAG– amygdala inhibitory connection ex-ists. First, the amygdala receives aferents from the dlPAG. Al-though the majority of these projections originate in the rostral
PAG, there are some PAG fibers that project to the amygdala in the
caudal dlPAG (Rizvi et al., 1991). The caudal dlPAG lesions made
in the reported experiments may either disrupt intra-PAG communication necessary for this inhibitory signal to the amygdala or
damage a sufficient number of fibers to disrupt the inhibition of the
amygdala. Furthermore, throughout the rostral – caudal extent of
the PAG, fibers originating in the PAG innervate various forebrain
areas through the medial forebrain bundle (C ameron et al., 1995).
In summary, the anatomical connections between the PAG and the
amygdala and other forebrain structures exist that could mediate
the kind of inhibition proposed by Fanselow (1994).
There are other data that indicate the f unctional relevance of
this kind of inhibitory circuit as well. C ircastrike attack is not one
of the responses elicited by direct stimulation of the central nucleus
of the amygdala. Indeed, stimulation of the lateral amygdala and
central nucleus of the amygdala produces long-lasting, opioidmediated inhibition of the afective defensive response elicited by
dlPAG stimulation in the cat (Shaikh et al., 1991). Importantly, this
inhibition was selective to defensive behavior, because circling
behavior elicited by dlPAG stimulation in one cat was unafected by
amygdala stimulation. Thus, it may be necessary for the amygdala
to be inhibited in order to engage in active defensive behaviors like
circastrike attack. It may be that in times of physical contact
between predator and prey, the defensive needs of the animal are
best served by complete midbrain control and activation of circastrike behaviors. Once the organism is no longer under direct
physical attack, forebrain activity mediating freezing reduces the
attractiveness of the prey to the predator (Sargeant and Eberhardt,
1975; Thompson et al., 1981). Also, forebrain activity is necessary
to monitor the environment and to allow for retreat to a safer area
and eventual return to the preferred activity pattern once the
predator has departed the immediate area (Fanselow and Lester,
1988).
The results obtained here suggest that the dlPAG inhibits acquisition of conditional fear. However, Walker and Davis (1997)
eliminated the attenuation of fear-potentiated startle seen in the
presence of a cue fear-conditioned with high footshock intensities
using post-training lesions. Walker and Davis correctly conclude
that the role of the dlPAG in potentiated startle seems to be during
performance of fear-motivated behaviors and not during acquisition. They suggest that the dlPAG inhibits presynaptic amygdalar
inputs to the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis, a critical part of
the fear-potentiated startle circuit. Walker and Davis (1997) also
point out that other behaviors like defecation do not decrease when
elicited by cues trained with high shock intensities. This would not
be possible if the dlPAG inhibits the expression of fear during
testing.
Considering the lack of an efect on defecation elicited by cues
fear-conditioned with high shock intensities and the efect of posttraining lesions on fear-potentiated startle, it seems that the results
reported here are inconsistent with those provided by Walker and
Davis (1997). However, the results of both sets of studies are
consistent if what is considered is the participation of the dlPAG
during extreme fear. Ratner (1967) proposed a description of
defensive response topography that varied as a f unction of the
distance between predator and prey. Defensive behaviors varied

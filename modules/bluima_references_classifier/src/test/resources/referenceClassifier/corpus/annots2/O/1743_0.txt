treatment in monkeys [17,20] and also in the striatum
in patients with Parkinson's disease [18], suggesting a
compensatory upregulation. In 6-hydroxydopaminelesioned rats and MPTP-treated mice, few TH-immunoreactive cells (1–3 cells/section) have been described to
appear in ventral striatum, mostly within or close to the
nucleus accumbens and the anterior commissure [19,21–
23]. Although these cells express the DA transporter
(DAT), the vast majority of them do not express any
detectable levels of either AADC or DA [10,19,23,24]. In
both rodents and primates, they have morphological features of GABAergic interneurons and express both GAD

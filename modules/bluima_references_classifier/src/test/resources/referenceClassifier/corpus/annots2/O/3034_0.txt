(1) Paraventricular fibers to the ventral amygdalofugal path leave the nucleus in a lateral direction
together with other fibers which have lateral
hypothalamic or lower brainstem destinations
(Fig. 7a). From the fine network of fibers in the
lateral hypothalamus, labeled axons can be followed further in the lateral direction, and they
enter the amygdala between the optic tract and
the internal capsule (Fig. 7b). PHA-L fibers
form a fine network in the ipsilateral CeA
(Fig. 7b, c).
(2) The other group of paraventricular fibers runs
in a rostral direction through the hypothalamic
and preoptic periventricular nuclei until the
level of the anterior commissure crossover.
Then, fibers move laterally and branch oV in the
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Fig. 8b).
From here, some of the labeled axons enter the
stria terminalis and run in the direction of
the amygdala. PHA-L-labeled fibers in both
the ventral amygdaloid path and the stria
terminalis were confined ipsilaterally to the side
of the injection; no labeled fibers were seen
contralaterally.

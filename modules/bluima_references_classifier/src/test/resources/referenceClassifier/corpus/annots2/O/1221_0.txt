34) and our laboratory's previous observation that this relatively low
dose is sufficient to increase central neurotransmitter release (26).
Sampling. During the experiments, microdialysis samples (20 l)
were collected every 20 min for 180 min. The samples were protected
from oxidation by addition of 5 l of antioxidant solution: L-cysteine
(3.3 mM), Na2EDTA (0.27 mM), acetic acid (100 mM), ascorbic acid
(0.0125 mM). Tbrain, Tcore, and Ttail, an index of heat loss response
(10, 13), were measured every 20 min.
Chromatographic assays for the determination of NE, DA and
5-HT in dialysates from PO/AH. For the analysis of NE, DA, and
5-HT, an offline microbore liquid chromatography assay was used
with automatic injection (10 l) of the samples, as described previously in detail (5, 31). In summary, the assay was based on ion-pair
reverse-phase chromatography (C8, 5 m; 100 1 mm), coupled to
single-channel electrochemical detection (Decade, Leiden, The Netherlands). The mobile phase consisted of 27 ml acetonitrile and 200 ml
of the following aqueous buffer: sodium acetate trihydrate (0.1 M),
citric acid monohydrate (20 mM), decane sulfonic acid (2 mM), and
sodium EDTA (0.5 mM) adjusted to pH 5.5. The flow rate through the
column was 90 l/min. Because of the high pH 5.5 of the mobile
phase, a low oxidation potential was set (450 mV vs. Ag-AgCl). The
retention times for NE, DA, and 5-HT were 3, 6, and 12 min,
respectively with quantification limit for all compounds between 30
and 60 pM.
Histological examination. At the end of each experiment, rats were
killed with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium, and the brain was
removed. The position of the microdialysis probe was verified in
coronal sections (100 m thick) stained with Chinese ink according to
the coordinates described by Paxinos and Watson (23). We confirmed
the location of the tip of microdialysis probe in the PO/AH. A
photomicrograph of a sample section is shown in Fig. 1A, where the
tip of location (arrow) and the width of the probe can be seen. Figure
1B is a diagrammatic representation of the tip locations in 12 experiments, where the tips are correctly positioned into the PO/AH.
Data collection and statistical analysis. The average concentration
of three microdialysis samples and temperature values for 1 h before
drug administration was considered as the baseline and was defined as
100% or 0Â°C, respectively. Microdialysis samples and temperature
values were expressed relative to this baseline value (means SE).

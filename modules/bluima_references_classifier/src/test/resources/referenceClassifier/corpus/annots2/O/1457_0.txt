INTRODUCTION
Cells in the developing embryo undergo complex morphogenetic
movements that establish the adult body plan. In Xenopus, the dorsal
mesoderm and posterior neural ectoderm are the first cell types to
display these activities. Movements in these tissues are essential for
normal embryonic patterning and defective morphogenesis leads to
multiple defects in all vertebrates, including spina bifida in humans
(Mitchell et al., 2004). In Xenopus, the dorsal mesoderm and
posterior neural ectoderm undergo a specialized type of cellular
movement called convergent extension (CE), whereby a field of cells
narrows (converges) mediolaterally and then lengthens (extends)
anteroposteriorly (Keller, 2002; Wallingford et al., 2002). These
movements are the driving force that elongates the anteroposterior
axis of the embryo and closes the neural tube (Keller and Danilchik,
1988; Keller et al., 1992b).
Two types of non-canonical Wnt pathways have been described
that mediate both posterior neural ectodermal and dorsal
mesodermal CE; the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (Keller,
2002; McEwen and Peifer, 2000; Peifer and McEwen, 2002) and the
Wnt/Ca2+ pathway (Kuhl et al., 2000). These pathways, under
control of the secreted ligands Wnt11, Wnt5a and Wnt4, do not
activate -catenin signaling (Moon et al., 1993; Torres et al., 1996),
but rather either function to release calcium (Wnt/Ca2+ pathway)
(Slusarski et al., 1997a; Slusarski et al., 1997b) or regulate PCP
pathway members like strabismus, prickle, JNK, Daam1 or
dishevelled (Wallingford et al., 2002). Although the PCP and
Wnt/Ca2+ pathways instruct morphogenesis in both the neural
ectoderm and dorsal mesoderm, the behavior and morphology of
cells undergoing CE is different within these cellular populations. It
remains unknown how these two pathways are integrated into
coordinating distinct cellular movements, although as these

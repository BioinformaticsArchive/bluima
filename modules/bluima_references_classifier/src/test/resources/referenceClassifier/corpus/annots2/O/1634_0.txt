Blink Reflex. The latency of the R1 response was
prolonged on the left side in 16 of 20 patients and
on the right in 16 patients. Only three patients had
a normal R1 response bilaterally (Table 1, Fig. 1).
The ipsilateral R2 response was abnormal on the left
in eight patients and on the right in seven, but was
normal bilaterally in 10 patients (Table 1, Fig. 1).
The contralateral R2 response was prolonged on the
left in eight patients and on the right in three, could
not be evoked in two patients, and was normal bilaterally in 11 (Table 1, Fig. 1). The latencies of the
direct, R1, and R2 responses in CIDP patients were
significantly prolonged compared with those of normal subjects (P 0.001).

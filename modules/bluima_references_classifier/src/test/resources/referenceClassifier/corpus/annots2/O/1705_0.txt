Neuroprotection after inhibition of MMP-9 activation has
been demonstrated previously in the adult brain after focal cerebral ischemia in both the mouse and rat, either by using MMP-9-deficient animals or MMP-9 inhibitors (Romanic et al., 1998;
Asahi et al., 2000, 2001; Jiang et al., 2001). This is the first study to
show activation of MMP-9 in immature animals after HI and
neuroprotection in neonatal MMP-9-deficient mice. The neuroprotection was strongly dependent on the severity of the insult;
pups exposed to severe HI (60 min) showed no difference in brain
injury between WT and MMP-9 KO mice. In contrast, when pups
were exposed to 50 min HI, there was marked reduction in brain
injury in the MMP-9 KO animals compared with wild type. Similar severity of injury-dependent treatment effects after HI have
also been noted in mice deficient in IL-1 converting enzyme (Liu
et al., 1999)
In addition to the reduction in tissue loss, the injury to MBP
and NFs was also attenuated in MMP-9-deficient animals, which
is similar to studies of focal cerebral ischemia in adult MMP-9
gene KO mice that show reduced damage to white-matter components (Asahi et al., 2001).

DISCUSSION

The participation of Dyrk1 or other Dyrk-related kinases in
any particular signal transduction pathway has not been elucidated so far. The selective recognition of the correct substrate
by protein kinase is an important biochemical mechanism that
underlies the specificity of cellular responses to various stimuli
(13). It is therefore important to determine the nature of Dyrk
substrate to understand its function in the regulation of cellular responses. Previously, Dyrk was shown to be required for
the proliferation of distinct neuronal cell types during postembryonic neurogenesis in Drosophila (4). Mutant flies with a
reduced Dyrk1 expression have a reduced number of neurons
in distinct areas of the adult brain and exhibit specific behavioral defects (4). In the present study we examined the cellular
Dyrk1 substrate and its functional role during neuronal differ-

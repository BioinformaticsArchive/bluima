Behc ̧ et's disease represents a clinical triad of oral and genital
ulceration associated with uveitis. The Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behc ̧ et first identified the disease in 1937 [1].
Minor symptoms include CNS involvement, arthritis or
arthralgia, gastrointestinal features, epididymitis, arterial
occlusion or aneurysms, thrombophlebitis and deep vein
thrombosis. The previously reported frequency of neurological involvement in Behc ̧ et's disease ranges from 4 to
49% [2].
Neuro-Behc ̧ et's disease (NBD) usually shows three clinical
patterns: a brainstem syndrome, a meningomyelitic syndrome and an organic confusional syndrome [3]. Radiologically, NBD involves the white matter, brainstem, basal
ganglia and thalamus; neurological symptoms are generally
correlated with radiological findings [4]. This study describes
the pattern of radiological involvement and follow-up
changes that correlated with neurological involvement.

output organization, with subsequent changes occurring at the
level of M1 itself and/or within the terminal structures to which
M1 vibrissa cortex projects. Vibrissa motor cortex receives extensive connections from S1 and S2 (Donoghue and Parham, 1983;
Izraeli and Porter, 1995), which arise from layers that, in S1 of
neonatally trimmed animals, display anatomical abnormalities in
GABAergic circuitry (Micheva and Beaulieu, 1995a,b). Such an-atomical alterations are evident bilaterally, strongly suggesting
that M1 vibrissa cortex of both hemispheres receives abnormal
activity from S1, which might be one basis for the bilateral effects
observed in M1. Abnormal somatosensory feedback could also
reach M1 directly through thalamic projections of the centrolateral nucleus or posterior complex (Donoghue and Parham, 1983;
Miyashita et al., 1994), although effects of vibrissa trimming on

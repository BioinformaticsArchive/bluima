Fig. 2. BDNF has differential effects on tau phosphorylation levels during
P19 neuronal differentiation. (A) Neuronally differentiated P19 cells from Day
5, 6 or 8 of differentiation were stimulated with BDNF for 15 min. Cell extracts
were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed
using Tau1 and Tau5 antibodies. (B) Quantitative analysis, from four
experiments (n = 4), represented as mean Â± SEM. Tau1 immunoreactivity
was normalized against level of Tau5 signal detected (*P < 0.05, unpaired
Student's t-test).

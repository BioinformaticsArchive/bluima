and xenobiotic compounds in organs such as the kidney but
also alter the extent of drug delivery to key tissue compartments such as the brain, thereby contributing to inter-individual variability in drug responsiveness.
In summary, we report the identification and functional
characterization of polymorphisms in human SLCO1A2. To our
knowledge, this represents the first detailed examination of
tissue-selective expression and characterization of polymorphisms in human OATP1A2 and creates the framework for
further investigations of the consequences of SLCO1A2 polymorphisms in vivo. Considering its substrate specificity and
expression in organs such as the brain and kidney, genetic
variations in SLCO1A2 may be an important contributor to
inter-individual variability in drug disposition and central
nervous system entry of substrate drugs.

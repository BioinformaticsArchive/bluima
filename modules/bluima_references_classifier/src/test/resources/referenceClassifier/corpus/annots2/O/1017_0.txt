RESULTS
As previously observed, the overall shape of the brain in both western
lowland and mountain gorillas is dorsoventrally flattened, with a less globular
frontal lobe than that in other great apes [Connolly, 1950]. The external sulcal
patterns of mountain gorillas (n 1‚ÅÑ4 8) also closely resemble those of western
lowland gorillas (Fig. 1). In specific, both taxa tend to have a continuous inferior
precentral sulcus that runs parallel to the central sulcus. Chimpanzees, on the
other hand, exhibit a greater degree of variation in the pattern of sulci in the
region of the inferior frontal gyrus, with more frequent bifurcations and
discontinuities of the inferior precentral sulcus [Sherwood et al., 2003]. Other
aspects of mountain gorilla sulcal anatomy closely resemble patterns observed in
other great ape species. The superior parietal lobule is highly fissurated, and the
lunate sulcus can be seen on the dorsolateral surface of the occipital lobe in the
typical anterior location of most anthropoid species. Unfortunately, postmortem

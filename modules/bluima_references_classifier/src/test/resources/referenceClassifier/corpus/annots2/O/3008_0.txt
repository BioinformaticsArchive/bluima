The function of the protein products encoded by this class of
genes could be to bind to repetitive DNA sequences (1).
Common structural motifs other than the zinc finger characterize the second class of genes. These include the fingerassociated box (FAX; Ref. 3), finger-associated repeats (FAR;
Ref. 4), and Kru ̈ ppel-associated box (KRAB)1 domains (5). The
KRAB region is almost always found at the NH2 terminus of
Kru ̈ ppel-like zinc finger proteins (ZFPs). The KRAB domain is
estimated to be present in about one-third of all C2H2 type zinc
fingers (5) but has also been found in two non-zinc finger genes
(6). It has been subdivided into a conserved A region and a
more degenerate B domain, which are often encoded by two
different exons. Accumulating evidence supports a function for
the KRAB domain in transcriptional repression (7–10). Be-cause of this the KRAB ZFPs are generally assumed to be
DNA-binding transcriptional regulators.
We are interested in neuronal nuclear architecture and are
investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ad-aptations in gene expression and protein synthesis patterns
allowing these postmitotic cells to function in complex neuronal
circuitries. The murine Zfp-37 gene encodes a protein that
potentially plays a role in these processes. It was described
originally as a gene transcribed exclusively in testis and encoding a protein with 12 zinc fingers at its COOH terminus (11,
12). We then showed that it is a member of the KRAB zinc
finger gene family and that it is not only expressed in testis but
also in the developing and adult central nervous system and, at
lower levels, in a number of other tissues (13). In adult brain,
the Zfp-37 message is specific to neurons, with regional differences in expression levels found throughout the brain. Multiple
protein isoforms of the Zfp-37 gene can be generated through
the use of different promoters and alternative splicing of
pre-mRNAs. The major isoforms have a predicted molecular
mass of 67 kDa, and they contain a truncated KRAB-A and a
complete KRAB-B region. The minor form is 62 kDa and lacks
the truncated KRAB-A region. By virtue of sequence elements
located in its 3'-untranslated region Zfp-37 was predicted to be
an immediate-early response gene (13). This combination of
highly regulated expression in neurons of a potential immediate-early transcription factor provided the basis for a further
analysis of the role of Zfp-37.
Here we show that ZFP-37 isoforms of ;67 kDa are ex-

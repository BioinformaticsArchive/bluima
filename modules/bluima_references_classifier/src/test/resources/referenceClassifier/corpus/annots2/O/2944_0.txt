TECHNIQUE: PLACEMENT AND
USAGE
All lumbar subarachnoid catheters were inserted
via 13 gauge Touhy needles in the lateral decubitus
position immediately prior to final positioning [28].
Perioperative antibiotics had been initiated prior to
puncture, and after placement of the drain the pa-tient was immediately placed supine, and positioned for craniotomy. Drains were taped in place,
and connected to a three way stopcock for withdrawal of fluid. Care was taken to keep fluid loss to
a minimum during placement and connection of the
drain, and blood pressure was rigorously maintained in the low normal range.
Twenty milliliters were drained in concert with
mannitol administration (1 g/kg Lv.), and hyperventilation (end tidal PCO, = 28-32) as the craniotomy
was begun. Additional 20 cc aliquots were removed
as necessary at the time of dural opening until ad-equate relaxation was achieved for placement of
the lobar retractors. The average total amount of
CSF withdrawn was from 80-120 cc, but occasionally up to 180 cc was withdrawn. Catheters were
removed prior to leaving the operating room. If
catheter malfunction occurred intraoperatively,
and cerebral relaxation was inadequate, cisternal
drainage was initially attempted. In the rare event
that this was insufficient, a transfrontal ventriculostomy was placed [26].

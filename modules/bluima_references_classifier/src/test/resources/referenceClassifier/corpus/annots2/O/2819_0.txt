DISCUSSION
Sixty-hour intracerebroventricular infusion of an AS ODN to the
mRNA for rGH-R decreased somatogenic binding sites in the
choroid plexus at the level of the dorsal part of the third ventricle
and the lateral ventricle. In parallel, rGH-R mRNA levels were
increased in the PeV but not in the ARC, suggesting some
regional selectivity in translational arrest and ongoing transcriptional activity. In the same animals, AS treatment significantly
increased pulsatile GH secretion and decreased SRIH mRNA
levels in the PeV, without affecting GHRH mRNA levels in the
ARC. These effects seemed specific and not caused by neuronal
toxicity or general protein synthesis blockade, because infusion of
an AS ODN to the mRNA for rPRL receptor, a protein closely
related to the rGH-R, was without effect.
It was shown previously that in vivo application of AS ODN to
neuropeptide receptor mRNAs such as neuropeptide Y
(NPY)–Y1 (Wahlestedt et al., 1993b) and angiotensin AT1 receptors (Sakai et al., 1994) or neurotransmitter receptors such as the
NMDA-R1 (Wahlestedt et al., 1993a) or the dopaminergic D2
receptor (Zhou et al., 1994) can diminish respective binding levels
by 10 –70%. In the case of the rGH-R, it resulted in a 40%
decrease in the somatogenic binding sites located in the choroid
plexus visualized in the dorsal part of the third ventricle and the
lateral ventricle, thus indicating that AS ODN treatment was
effective. We were not able to detect reproducible GH binding in
the hypothalamus of adult male rats by autoradiography, and
others were also unsuccessful in adult female rats (Crumeyrolle-

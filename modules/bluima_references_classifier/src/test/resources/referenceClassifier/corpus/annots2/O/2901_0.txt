Both α-DTx and 4-AP induce epileptiform bursting
in hippocampal slices in vitro and increase the release of
amino acid neurotransmitters from synaptosomes (Weller
et al., 1985; Tibbs et al., 1989a; Barbeito et al., 1990;
Perreault and Avoli, 1991; Lallement et al., 1995). The
bursting induced by 4-AP can be blocked by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), but not by NMDA
antagonists such as D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid
(D-AP5) and (6) 3-3 (2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonate (6CPP) (Perreault and Avoli, 1991), but
similar studies have not been performed with α-DTx. In
vivo, the non-NMDA antagonists 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzoquinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) and GYKI52466 have
been found to delay the onset of seizures induced by
injections of α-DTx into the dorsal hippocampus and to
reduce neuronal damage, whereas the NMDA antagonists
dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), CGP 37849, D-AP5, and
(6)CPP gave no protection (Gandolfo et al., 1989b;
Bagetta et al., 1992, 1994, 1996; Coleman et al., 1992).
The NMDA antagonists (6) CPP and MK-801 were
found to be ineffective against seizures induced by 4-AP
in mice, as was NBQX (Yamaguchi and Rogawski, 1991;
Coleman et al., 1992), although D-AP5 and other NMDA
receptor antagonists have been reported to block or
reduce 4-AP seizures in rats (Gandolfo et al., 1989b;
Morales-Villagra ́n et al., 1996).
The results of previous studies suggest that there
may be significant differences between the mechanisms
of action of α-DTx and 4-AP in eliciting seizure activity.
In this study, therefore, we have tested the actions of
excitatory amino acid antagonists against α-DTx-induced
epileptiform activity and changes in neurotransmitter
release in the hippocampus in vitro, and we have compared our results with those for 4-AP and with the in vivo
pharmacology of α-DTx.

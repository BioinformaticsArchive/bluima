frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex,
ventral and dorsal striatum, and amygdala, because these areas have been
implicated previously in reward-related processing and learning
(O'Doherty et al., 2004).
For the time course plots, we located functional ROIs within an individual subject's medial and central OFC and extracted event-related re-sponses from the peak voxel for that subject. These single-subject time
courses were then averaged across subjects.
In addition to the analysis of the test session data, we also conducted an
analysis of goal-directed learning during the training session by contrasting action choices associated with reward (tomato and chocolate) and
action choices associated with neutral outcomes. We performed a smallvolume correction using the resulting image from the main contrast at
test.

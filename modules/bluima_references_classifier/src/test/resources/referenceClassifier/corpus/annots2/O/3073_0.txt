cancer cells, activation of PKA reduces the antagonist activity of
tamoxifen as measured using ERE-containing reporter constructs, reducing the antagonist effects of tamoxifen in cells in
proportion to the degree to which PK A was activated. Conversely, the agonist activity of tamoxifen was enhanced. This
effect was also shown to be promoter-specific and was not noted
in all ERE reporter constructs tested. Thus, it is possible that by
virtue of the cAM P increases induced by estrogen in SK-N-SH
cells (and perhaps in M PON neurons), PK A activation modulates the agonist and antagonist potency of tamoxifen on transcription of the N T/ N gene. Alternatively, the estrogen receptor
present in these cells may differ from the classical estrogen re-ceptor. This potentially novel estrogen receptor appears to have
the ability to transactivate an ERE to a small degree, and it
appears to be capable of eliciting increases in intracellular levels
of cAMP. Recently, a novel estrogen receptor, termed ERβ, has
been cloned from the rat prostate, having significant homology in
the DNA binding domain but not in the ligand binding domain of
the estrogen receptor protein (Kuiper et al., 1996). Thus, there is
evidence suggesting the existence of at least one alternate receptor for estrogen, potentially possessing different ligand specificities. A further possibility is that tamoxifen may be acting as an
agonist through its previously documented ability to augment
transactivation via AP-1 sites present in the promoters of certain
genetic origin (Webb et al., 1995). This interaction has been
described in uterine cells but does not appear to occur in cells of
breast. In HeLa cells, Webb et al. (1995) showed that the estrogen
receptor forms a protein complex with c-Jun and c-Fos proteins
and acts to facilitate transcription of AP-1-containing reporter
constructs but not of ERE-containing constructs. A raloxifene
response element (RRE) has been elucidated recently that differs
in nucleotide sequence from the ERE and appears to support
transactivation induced by metabolites of estrogen and by the
estrogen receptor antagonist raloxifene (Yang et al., 1996). Se-quence analysis of the N T/ N reporter used in our studies revealed
that a segment of DNA is present that exhibits 75% identity to the
RRE. It is therefore possible that some of the agonist effects of
the estrogen receptor antagonists and of estrogen itself we ob-serve on the N T/ N gene might partly be mediated through this
homologous site. Another potential explanation for how the es-trogen receptor antagonists f unction as agonists of the N T/ N
response is given by a recent report that transactivation by ERβ
at AP-1 sites occurs when the receptor is complexed with ER
antagonists (Paech et al, 1997). Thus, there are several potential
explanations for the agonist effect of the estrogen receptor an-tagonists used in our experiments. It will be necessary to further
characterize the estrogen receptor present in SK-N-SH cells to
determine which of these mechanisms is involved in the effects
noted here. It is conceivable that the estrogen receptor present in
these cells also exists in vivo and may be responsible for the
estrogen-dependent modulation of cAM P reported in the literature for several decades.
A role for PKA in mediating the effects of estrogen in vivo is
implied by the fact that the knock-out mice deficient in the RIIβ
subunit of the PKA holoenzyme, but not those for the Cβ1
subunit, lack the ability to induce N T/ N gene transcription.
RIIβ-/- mice show a 50% decrease in cAMP-stimulated PKA
activity in the hypothalamus, whereas PK A activity in the same
region of CB1 -/- animals are similar to the wild-type controls.
Estrogen does, however, elicit increases in PR mRNA in the
RIIβ-/- animals, an effect that is believed to be via EREmediated events (Savouret et al., 1991). This strongly suggests

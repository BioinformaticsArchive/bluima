In contrast to the relatively widespread occurrence of calpain transcripts, the corresponding protein shows a much more
restricted pattern of expression, as detected by calpain-specific
antiserum. In immunostained sections, a very strong signal was
apparent in a few individual cells in the central nervous system,
in the midgut, and in association with larval fat body cells (Fig.
7 and 8).
In the brain (Fig. 7), two paired clusters of neuronal cell
bodies were strongly recognized by antiserum. Dorsally, in the
posterior protocerebrum, a group of 12 to 14 large neurons was
seen in each hemisphere (Fig. 7A). These cell bodies appear to
give rise to immunostaining processes in the dorsal protocerebrum (pars intercerebralis) and a basal layer of the fan-shaped
body of the central complex (Fig. 7B). In the anterior tritocerebrum, a second immunostaining cluster of 10 to 12 cell bodies is located in each hemisphere. These cell bodies give rise to
processes in the tritocerebrum. In addition, several small neurons in the cell body rind of the brain are more weakly labelled
(Fig. 7C, arrows). The expression in the brain is summarized in
Fig. 7D.
Calpain expression in the ventral ganglion in the thorax is
reminiscent of the pattern in the brain. A single pair of strongly
stained cells is localized ventrally in the posterior portion of
the abdominal neuromeres of the ventral ganglion (Fig. 8A). In
addition, as in the brain, individual cells in the cell body rind
are weakly immunostained, although their number in the ventral ganglion is lower. Stained neural processes are found in
some parts of the abdominal neuromeres (Fig. 8B, arrows).
In the midgut, strong immunostaining is restricted to scattered cells with a characteristic morphology (Fig. 8D, arrows).
This cell type has a triangular cell body and is located near the
basal lamina at the outer side of the gut wall, with a long
narrow extension to the lumen. These cells are probably identical to endocrine cells of the so-called open type described
from the midgut of D. melanogaster and other insects (55).
Finally, a strong signal was detected for a few small cells
associated with the larval fat body cells that persist in young
adults (Fig. 8C). We believe that these cells may be hemocytes.
Indeed, hemocytes from blood preparations, as well as the
mbn-2 cell line of hemocyte origin, were stained with antiserum (Fig. 9).
The expression of immunostaining material corresponds to
only a small subset of cells that express calpain transcripts, and
it is therefore important to know that the antibody does not
cross-react with a second unrelated protein. Several observations indicate that this is not the case. First, no staining was
seen with preimmune serum. Second, since antiserum was produced against a bacterially expressed protein, the most likely
cross-reactivity would be against bacterial antigens that are
unlikely to show the observed distribution. Third, affinity-pu-rified antibody recognized a single major band in an immunoblot, and a band of the same size was also detected by anticalpain antisera from two other rabbits. Fourth, when the same
antiserum was used for an immunoscreen, all positive clones
encoded calpain. The question of whether the RNA probe may
cross-hybridize with other transcripts, explaining the wider distribution in tissue in situ hybridizations, may also arise. However, we think that this is unlikely since these hybridizations
were done at high stringency and since no cross-hybridization
was detected between the cal1-1 probe and other genes on
genomic Southern blots or chromosome squashes.
The subcellular distribution of calpain in mbn-2 cells was
studied further (Fig. 9). Much of the cell body is stained,
whereas stain is excluded from the nucleus and a few large
vacuoles that may correspond to the phagocytic vacuoles commonly observed in this cell line (37). In cells spread on the

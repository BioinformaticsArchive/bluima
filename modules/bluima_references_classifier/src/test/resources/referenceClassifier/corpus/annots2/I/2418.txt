This study demonstrates that vagal afferent
stimulation also inhibits responses to SPL
stimulation. Previously, we have emphasized
the integrative function of upper thoracic STT
neurons. The finding, in this study, of many
cells with multiple visceral and multiple so-matic inputs even more dramatically reveals
this integrative function. Clearly the activity
and responsiveness of these STT neurons re-sults from a complex variety of tierent signals
from many sources. An understanding of how
these different inputs contribute to STT cell
activity is an important key to understanding
mechanisms involved in pain.

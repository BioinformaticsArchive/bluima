Marked pulmonary congestion and alveolar edema
were the chief extraneural lesions in these dogs. Ap-pearing in all that died and in some acutely ill cases
that were killed, these lesions are thought to reflect the

Leptomeningeal hyperemia and occasional petechiae were the chief gross neural lesions in acute cases.
Moderate localized swelling of the cerebrum was present in a few acute cases, resulting in some asymmetry.
Grossly apparent yellow or tan depressed cortical foci,

Microscopic study disclosed a non-suppurative
meningoencephalitis characterized by its marked necrotizing nature and striking affinity for the cerebral
hemispheres. In the hemispheres, the inflammatory
and necrotic changes were severe and extensive, in-volving both gray and white substance. Any part of the

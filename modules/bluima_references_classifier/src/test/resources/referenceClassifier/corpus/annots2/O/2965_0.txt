Perf usions and tissue preparation
Rats were euthanized by an overdose of chloral hydrate (1000 mg/kg,
i.p.) and perfused intracardially with 0.9% heparinized saline followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Spinal cords
and brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
room temperature for 2 hr, followed by cryoprotection in a graded series
of sucrose (10%–30%) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4°C. Brains and
cervical spinal cords were blocked separately, placed in OCT compound
(Miles, Elkhart, IN), and frozen on dry ice. Spinal cord tissue was cut in
serial horizontal or transverse 16 μm sections and thaw-mounted onto
gelatin-chrom alum-subbed slides. The brains and brainstems were sectioned at 20 μm in the coronal plane in a 1:3 series.

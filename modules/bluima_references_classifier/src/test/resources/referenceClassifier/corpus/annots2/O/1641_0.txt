ongoing train of painful electric stimuli when the pain became
intolerable. During externally controlled trials, participants were
told that the train of stimuli would either be stopped at some
point by another person (external control by a “powerful other”)
or by a computer that followed a random sequence (external
control by “chance/fate”). The stimulation during the externally
controlled trials was yoked to the self-controlled trials such that
the participants received the same number and intensity of stimuli in both conditions (see Materials and Methods). At the end of
each stimulation period, participants rated the perceived mean
intensity of the stimulation during the previous trial. Ratings of
the average anxiety perceived during painful stimulation in the
three conditions were given at the end of the experiment. Subjects
also provided a measure of their degree of belief in control over
life as assessed by a questionnaire administered before the
experiment.
We hypothesized that factual controllability in the selfcontrolled trials would attenuate the subjective intensity of pain
and that this would be associated with activation in voluntary
reappraisal-related brain areas. We specifically predicted activation in the contrast “self-controlled externally controlled pain”
in a right anterolateral prefrontal cortex (alPFC) area proposed
recently by us (Kalisch et al., 2006b) as being crucial for reappraisal. We further predicted that activation in this area would be
negatively correlated with subjective pain intensity. Finally, we
explored whether and how the relationship between controllability and a control-related brain response would be moderated by
the individual control belief.

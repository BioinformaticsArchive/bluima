A. culbertsoni is found worldwide and causes opportunistic
infections in humans, including GAE, which is most prevalent
in immunocompromised individuals. Although the mode by
which this amoeba causes disease has not been fully elucidated,
there is accumulating evidence that it has evolved strategies to
evade host immunity. It has been reported that A. culbertsoni
can target and destroy macrophages, macrophage-like cells,
microglia, and neuroblastoma cells in a cell contact-dependent
fashion (29, 31, 45). For example, using electron microscopy, it
has been demonstrated that trophozoites destroy nerve cells by
cytolysis and also by ingestion of whole nerve cells using food
cups or amoebastomes (45). In addition, electron microscopy
has revealed that A. culbertsoni appears to target macrophagelike cells by projecting fingerlike processes known as digipodia
(29).
Recent studies have indicated that cell contact-independent
processes may also play a role in Acanthamoeba-mediated
pathogenesis and that peptidases may be linked to these
events. Acanthamoeba serine peptidases have been implicated
in the induction of blood-brain barrier permeability (2). In
addition, it has been reported that pathogenic Acanthamoeba
spp. secrete more phospholipase A and peptidases than nonpathogenic Acanthamoeba spp. (12, 15, 21, 36).
In the present study, it was demonstrated that peptidases
that are secreted by A. culbertsoni are primarily serine peptidases. Gel zymography of medium in which A. culbertsoni was
maintained indicated that the secreted peptidases corresponded to molecular masses of approximately 150, 100, 90, 70,
50, and 40 kDa. Of these, the preponderant bands of activity
corresponded to molecular masses of 150, 70, and 50 kDa. The
pattern of peptidase activity resident in A. culbertsoni-conditioned medium, i.e., Neurobasal-A medium in which only A.
culbertsoni cells were cultured, was also observed in medium in
which A. culbertsoni cells were cocultured with BV-2 cells. That
is, major bands of activity were identified at positions corre-

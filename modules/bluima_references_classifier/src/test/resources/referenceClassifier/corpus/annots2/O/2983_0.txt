Fig. 1. (a–g) Frontal sections through a rat brain two days after lesioning immunostained with antibody
against NOS-I. The core was lost during sectioning and strong background staining occurs in the
demarcation zone (b, c). The NOS-I-positive neurons in the perilesional cortex show granular immunoreactivity in the soma and weak staining for NOS-I exists only in thick proximal processes (d–f; e and f are
enlargements of c and d, brackets and arrows). NOS-I-positive neurons more than 400 μm away from the
demarcation zone show normal morphology with uniform immunoreactivity in their somata and within
their proximal and fine distal processes (a–d, g; star marks position in d; overview in b). Note the slight
compression of the hippocamus under the lesioned cortex (b). Scale bars = 50 μm (a, c–g), 1 mm (b).

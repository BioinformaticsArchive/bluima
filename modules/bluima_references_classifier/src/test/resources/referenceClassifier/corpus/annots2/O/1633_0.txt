Immunohistochemistry analysis

Ten to 12 sections per animal were analyzed. The number of
pCREB and PSA-NCAM positive cells were counted using Olympus Optical (Tokyo, Japan) BX50 and MicroBright-Field (Colchester, VT, USA) Stereo Investigator software. Scion Imaging software was used to quantify the intensity of GAP-43 staining in the
regions of interest. The intensity values were then normalized
against the background staining of the section. Results are presented as mean S.E.M.
The effects of acute or chronic imipramine treatment were
analyzed by one-factor ANOVA. Comparison of individual treatment groups with their respective control group was conducted
using Dunnett's t-test. SPSS software (12.0.1) was used for all
analyses. For all comparisons, P 0.05 was used as the criterion
for statistical significance.

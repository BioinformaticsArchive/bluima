MK 801, we conclude that fluoroquinolones probably do not
act via an agonism of the glycine binding site.
Interestingly, Tanaka et al. (36) showed that fluoroquinolones decreased the blocking effects of Mg2+ and MK 801 binding to the receptor channel. They therefore characterized the
fluoroquinolones as “open channel blockers.” This is supported by our findings on the effect of Mg2+ on the population
spike amplitude, again underlining the involvement of the
NMDA receptor in the fluoroquinolones' convulsive action.
Considering the Mg2+ chelating properties of fluoroquinolones, which have been also postulated as a mechanism for fluoroquinolone action in juvenile cartilage (7, 24, 35), it is tempting to speculate that the excitatory potency of fluoroquinolones
might be based on activation of the NMDA receptor by abolishing the Mg2+ block in the ion channel. This would prolong
the opening time of the channel, thus increasing intracellular
Ca2+ concentrations and the excitability of the neuron.
In summary, the determination of field potentials in the
hippocampus slice offers a fairly simple mechanistic model for
the convulsive properties of fluoroquinolones. It not only is
useful for a rapid screening of fluoroquinolones with regard to
this relevant endpoint but also enables more-detailed insight
into the underlying mechanisms of this effect.

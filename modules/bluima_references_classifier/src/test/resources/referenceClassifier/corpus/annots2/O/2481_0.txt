Peripheral nerve grafts as 'bridges' for regenerating CNS axons
The sciatic and optic nerve graft experiments described above provided the basis
for more recent studies designed to determine the potential of axons injured in the
CNS to elongate for distances equivalent to some of the long projecting neurone
systems in the intact CNS (David & Aguayo, 1981).
Autologous segments of the sciatic nerve (2 cm in mice and 3-5 cm in rats) were
used to prepare ' bridges' between the medulla oblongata and the lower cervical or
upper thoracic spinal cord in a series of adult C57BL/6J mice and Sprague-Dawley
rats. The bridging nerve grafts were placed extraspinally within the subcutaneous
tissues in the back of the animals (Fig. 1). Through a small laminectomy an incision
was made with a 150 /*m glass rod into the dorsal spinal cord and medulla to insert the
ends of the nerve 'bridges'. The spinal cord between these two levels was left intact.
Animals survived without apparent neurologic deficits and were sacrificed between 1
and 7$ months after grafting.
Examination of the grafts by light and electron microscope showed that they were
well innervated by axons ensheathed by Schwann cells (Fig. 2). The origin and
Â£rmination of these axons was determined by transecting the regenerated grafts and
^plying horseradish peroxidase to the cut ends (Mesulam, 1978; Richardson et al.

dominant phenotype observed in the TR-infected NPCs was
that of large multinucleated syncitia. Although sporadic small
syncitia were observed at late times in the Towne-infected
NPCs as well, they were the exception, not the norm. This
difference may be a result of the more cell-associated phenotype of the TR strain compared to Towne. It should also be
noted that in infections using either strain, the long processes
present in mock-infected NPCs were absent once the cells
flattened back out.
Since all the cells displayed the classic signs of CPE development, we followed them to determine the extent of expression of different temporal classes of viral Ags and, further, to
look for the true test of full permissiveness, the production of
infectious virions. We began by assessing the percentage of
cells that expressed different classes of viral Ags over time.
Figure 2A shows staining for IE1, one of the main viral transactivating proteins, and the E protein UL44, the viral processivity factor, which localizes to viral replication centers. Shown
in Fig. 2A are NPCs infected with Towne. Similar results were
obtained using TR. The large majority of cells infected with
Towne or TR showed strong IE1 positivity in their nuclei by
24 h p.i. Quantitation of the percentage of IE1 cells is shown
in Fig. 2B. UL44 was used to assess the expression of E proteins and the development of replication centers in these cells.
All stages of viral replication centers that have been previously
described (28) were seen in the NPCs infected with either
Towne (Fig. 2A) or TR (not shown). It was important to show
that all stages of centers, from small multiple foci (which represent prereplication sites) to large single foci (which represent
fully developed sites), were seen in these cells to establish the
presence of active viral genome replication. However, as can
be seen in Fig. 2C, the development of these replication centers lagged significantly behind during infections with the TR
strain compared to Towne for the first 48 h. Quite obvious in
the figure is the very low percentage of cells expressing viral
replication foci at 24 and 48 h p.i. in the TR infections compared to Towne. Additionally, while larger centers (bipolar
and single foci) began to be observed after 48 h p.i. in the
Towne infections, they were essentially visible only after 72 h
p.i. in the TR infections. Unlike the commonly used HFFs,
which exhibit a markedly synchronous sequence of replication
center development (4, 28), not all NPCs showed large single
foci, but instead, a mix of sizes remained present even out to
the relatively late time point of 96 h p.i. This could be reflective
of the asynchrony of the initial infection, but more likely it is a
consequence of slightly different permissiveness of these cells
compared to HFFs.
The NPCs were then assayed for the localization of structural proteins by staining them for pp65, a major component of
the viral tegument (Fig. 2D). Very early localization (4 h p.i.)
of input pp65 revealed rapid transit of the protein to the
nucleus in the very large majority of Towne-infected cells (data
not shown), and by 24 h p.i., all nuclei were strongly positive for
pp65 in both Towne (Fig. 2D, top) and TR (not shown) infections. This 24-h p.i. staining likely represents a combination of
input and de novo-synthesized proteins and is similar to that
observed in permissive fibroblasts at this time point (4). Be-tween 48 and 72 h p.i., pp65 localization began to shift into the
cytoplasm, and by 72 h p.i., the viral assembly complex could be
clearly visualized as a bolus of pp65 in the cytoplasm close to

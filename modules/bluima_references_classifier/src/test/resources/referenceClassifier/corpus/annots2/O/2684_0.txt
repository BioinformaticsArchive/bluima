High-power light microscopic comparison of IP,R and RyR
Differences in IP,R and RyR localization at the cellular level
are evident under high-power magnification (Figs. 4, 5). In the
cerebellum both IP,R and RyR as well as the Ca2+ pump are
localized to Purkinje cells and their dendritic trees, with IP,R
being especially prominent. Marked differences in the localizations of IP,R and RyR are evident in deep nuclei of the
cerebellum. As reported previously, IP,R immunoreactivity is
concentrated in punctate nerve terminals surrounding large cell
bodies (Fig. 4; Mignery et al., 1989; Sharp et al., 1993). On the
other hand, RyR is localized exclusively to neuronal cell bodies.
Ca2+ pump immunoreactivity occurs most prominently in cells
with only weak staining visible in neuropil in the deep cerebellar
nuclei.
In the hippocampus, high-power views confirm the striking
differences in RyR and IP,R that were evident at lower magnifications (,Fig. 4). Specifically, IP,R is highly concentrated in
pyramidal cells of CA1 with much lower densities in CA3 and
the dentate gyrus. RyR displays an inverse pattern in that the
highest concentrations are in the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions.
Ca2+ pump immunoreactivity is evident throughout the hippocampus but is highest in the CA3 region and is comparatively
less dense in the dentate gyrus than RyR and less dense in the
CA1 region that the IP,R.
High-power microscopy of the substantia nigra shows substantial differences in the cellular distribution of RyR and IP,R.
IP,R is concentrated in terminals, consistent with earlier studies
(Worley et al., 1989), while RyR is densest in cell bodies of
intemeurons within the zona reticulata.
High-power evaluation of the cerebral cortex differentiates
cellular patterns for IP,R and RyR (Fig. 5). In the motor cortex
IP,R immunoreactivity is most prominent in cell bodies and
their proximal dendrites in superficial, intermediate, and deeper
layers. By contrast, in all of these layers RyR is most evident
in long, thin dendritic processes, with little immunoreactivity
in cell bodies. The pattern of Ca2+ pump immunoreactivity
tends to resemble most that of IP,R, though for the Ca2+pump,
immunoreactivity is greatest in cells in the intermediate layers.
In the posterior parietal cortex similar differences in IP,R and
RyR are evident. In superficial layers IP,R is concentrated in
the perikarya and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells while
in deeper cells very intense staining is evident in a population
of nonpyramidal cells. On the other hand, RyR is most evident
in long, thin dendrites with much less cellular immunoreactivity. Ca2+pump immunoreactivity closely resembles IP,R in the
pyramidal cells in more superficial layers with less staining than
IP,R in the nonpyramidal cells of deeper layers.
To ascertain whether IP,R and RyR might be colocalized in
the same cells in certain areas, we conducted some doublelabeling studies (Fig. 6). In the CA1 layer of the hippocampus
IP,R and RyR appear to be localized to many of the same
pyramidal cells with virtually identical patterns of immunoreactivity in dendrites. On the other hand, in the retrosplenial
cortex distinct differences are evident. Thus, RyR is concentrated in pyramidal cells and their dendrites in a relatively deep

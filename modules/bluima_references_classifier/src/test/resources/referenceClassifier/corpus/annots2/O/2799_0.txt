plate to approximate the brown histochemical stains
for AChE. Solution ODs at 560 nm were determined in
a plate-reader against an ``air-blank.'' Video images of
the same plate were also captured at the magnification
used for brain sections. Pixel values were proportional
to optical density up to an OD value of 0.4, and they
followed a smooth curve beyond that point. Specific pa-rameters fitted to the pixel-OD curve were used to correct subsequent video readings.

After 7 or 8 days survival following cochlear lesion, animals were
deeply anaesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital
(0.8 mL / kg; Narcodorm-n; Alvetra, Germany). After respiratory
arrest, they were perfused transcardially with Tyrodes-Ringer followed
by ice-cold fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 15% saturated picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB,
pH 7.4) for 1 h. For cryoprotection, brains were soaked in PB
containing 30% sucrose overnight and cut in the frontal plane on a
cryostat (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) into 30-lm-thick sections. For
immunostaining, series of free-floating sections were exposed to three
preincubation solutions: 30 min in 0.05% H2O2; 30 min in PB
containing 1% milk powder; and 30 min in PB containing 0.05%
Triton X-100 (PB-Triton), 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5%
normal horse serum, all at room temperature. The sections were then
exposed to antibodies raised in mouse against GAP-43 (1 : 5000,
Chemicon, Temecula, USA) and in goat against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; 1 : 500, Chemicon) in PB-Triton. The monoclonal
mouse antibody directed against GAP-43 is specified by the manufacturer to recognize the antigen independent of its state of
phosphorylation. The polyclonal goat antibody directed against ChAT
recognizes cholinergic neurons. After incubation for 48 h at 4 C,
binding sites of the antibody were detected with the avidin-biotin
technique (Elite-ABC; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA), with
0.05% 3.3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) in
50 mm Tris buffer pH 7.2 and 0.3% ammonium nickel sulphate for
the colour reaction. Finally, sections were mounted on gelatin-treated
slides, dehydrated and covered with Entellan (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany).

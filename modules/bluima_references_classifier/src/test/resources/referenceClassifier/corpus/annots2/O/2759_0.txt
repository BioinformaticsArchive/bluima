dNTP pools in infection of ndk mutant host strains. Several
lines of evidence indicate that nucleoside diphosphokinase, the
ndk gene product in E. coli, interacts specifically with T4
phage-coded enzymes as part of the T4 dNTP synthetase multienzyme complex (13, 17). Accordingly, we were surprised to
learn that QL7623, a host strain with a deletion in the ndk
gene, supports T4 phage growth. Even more surprising was the
viability of cells lacking this important housekeeping enzyme.
Both of our laboratories detected NDP kinase activities in ndk
mutants in amounts of about 15 to 20% of that of the wild type,
apparently sufficient to maintain pools as large as or larger
than those seen in wild-type cells. After completion of the work
described here, one of our laboratories found that E. coli
adenylate kinase (adk gene product) contains nucleoside
diphosphokinase activity as well and is responsible for the
activity seen in ndk mutant strains (10).
Another unexpected property of E. coli QL7623 is a strong
mutator phenotype. In a collaborative effort (11), we asked
whether these cells have a nucleotide pool imbalance that
could explain why mutation frequencies are elevated. We

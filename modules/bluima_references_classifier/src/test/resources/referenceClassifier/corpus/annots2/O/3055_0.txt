gene expression, and release of intercellular signaling molecules.
Several developmental processes are known to be influenced by
the amount or rate of calcium influx into cells, including neuronal
cell migration (Rakic and Komuro, 1995; Goldman, 1996;
Komuro and Rakic, 1996), growth cone migration (Cohan et al.,
1987; Neely and Gesemann, 1994; Williams and Cohan, 1995),
Schwann cell migration (Letourneau et al., 1991; Anton et al.,
1995), cell–cell adhesion (for review, see Damsky et al., 1993;
Marrs and Nelson, 1996), and neuronal differentiation (for re-view, see Moody et al., 1991; Emerit et al., 1992; Finkbeiner and
Greenberg, 1996). Although calcium-dependent mechanisms are
well established, it is possible that Kv1.1 expression may affect
transduction of other developmental signals or may be involved in
direct cell–cell recognition.

Possible cellular processes regulated by Kv1.1
When one considers the tissue- or cell-specific localization of
Kv1.1, the timing of its expression, and our current knowledge of
the cellular processes taking place in tissues or cells expressing
Kv1.1 during development, there is evidence to support roles for
Kv1.1 in at least three distinct cellular processes: cell–cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation.
Kv1.1 might play a role in cell – cell adhesion in the rhombomeres, which are periodic bulges in developing vertebrate hindbrains that underlie the segmental patterning of the hindbrain
and delineate molecular compartments of restricted gene expression (for review, see Nieto et al., 1992). Pairs of rhombomeres
give rise to associated sensory ganglia, brachiomotor nerves, and
other neural crest derivatives such as glia, bone, cartilage, and
pigment epithelium (for review, see Lumsden and Keynes, 1989).
For example, rhombomeres 2 and 3 give rise to the trigeminal
ganglion, motor roots of the trigeminal nerve, and associated glial
components, whereas rhombomeres 4 and 5 give rise to the
facial / vestibular ganglion, its motor roots, and glia. In chick
embryos, clonal analysis indicates that only a minor degree of
cellular mixing occurs between rhombomeres (Fraser et al.,
1990), and rhombomeres also exhibit differential adhesiveness
that is cadherin-mediated (Guthrie et al., 1993; Wizenmann and
L umsden, 1997), suggesting there may be differential expression
or regulation of cell adhesion molecules in alternating rhombomeres. C adherins are a large family of calcium-dependent
adhesions molecules that mediate homophilic interactions be-tween cells (for review, see Grunwald, 1993), and their adhesive

DNA Sequence Analysis, Data Analysis,
and Signal Quantitation
DNA sequence analyses identifying putative cisacting DNA regulatory elements in the mouse, rat, and
human COX-2 gene promoters were performed by using
Kodak/IBI/Pustell subsequence analysis (version 2.04;
Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), Hitachi oligo-DNA
sequence-analysis software (version 5.0; Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan), and COX-2 promoter DNA sequences obtained
from GenBank accession S82456, U03389, and D28235.
Dried COX-2, β-actin RT-PCR, and EMSA gels were
exposed to phosphorimaging storage screens, and the
resulting signals were analyzed on a GS-250 Molecular
Imager (Molecular Analyst software, version 1.4.1; BioRad, Cambridge, MA) or a Fuji FLA2000 Bio-Imaging
Analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Relative intensities of EMSA
gel-shifted species (NF-kB- or AP-1-DNA binding signal
levels) or COX-2/β-actin RNA message were quantitated
by using the phosphorimager analysis and data acquisition/
statistical analysis packages provided with each instrument. All P values were derived from protected t-tests or

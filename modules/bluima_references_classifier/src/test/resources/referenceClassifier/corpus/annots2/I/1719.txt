accords with the proposal that oscillatory activity in corticostriatal circuits is part of a neural timing mechanism for encoding short intervals (Buhusi and Meck 2005).
The lack of a consistent relation between either velocity or
acceleration and the power of the theta-band activity suggests
that the striatal LFP rhythms may not be strictly linked to
sensorimotor parameters, but rather to other behavioral-state
characteristics engaged during exploration and instructed running. The modulation of both power and cross-striatal coherence during the tone-turn period of the T-maze task is consistent with this conclusion. During this period, the animals were
required to use the tone cues to choose which way to turn to
reach the baited goal. The heightened power and coherence
could, in this view, be related to behavioral decision and
execution.
There is strong precedent for the presence of oscillatory
activity in other nuclei of the basal ganglia, particularly in the
pallidum and recurrent subthalamo-pallidal circuits (Bevan et
al. 2002; Plenz and Kitai 1999; Ruskin et al. 1999; Terman et
al. 2002; Wichmann et al. 2002). In these basal ganglia circuits,
oscillatory activity is greatly augmented by dopamine-depleting lesions mimicking parkinsonian states and in Parkinson's
disease itself (Boraud et al. 2005; Brown et al. 2001; Goldberg
et al. 2004; Levy et al. 2002; Ni et al. 2000; Raz et al. 2001).
The functions of such oscillatory activity in normal basal
ganglia circuits are unknown. However, our findings, together
with those in behaving monkeys (Courtemanche et al. 2003),
provide strong evidence that they are systematically modulated
by behavioral context in the striatum and are coordinated
across functionally different striatal regions. This result ac-cords with the possibility that they reflect a dynamic process
integral to a range of cortico-basal ganglia circuits.

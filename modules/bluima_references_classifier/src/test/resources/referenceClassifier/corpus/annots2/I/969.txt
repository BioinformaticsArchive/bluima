activity of effector cells (5, 41, 52). Experimental studies with
different host genetic backgrounds showed that this also influences T helper cell differentiation (20, 47). CBA/J and CB-17
mice normally develop a Th1-type response to C. neoformans,
while C57BL/6 mice develop Th2-type responses during pulmonary cryptococcal infection (19, 20, 25). A logical next step
will be to study the cytokine messages in the brains of different
mouse strains, infected with different Cryptococcus strains (differing in virulence and serotype), to characterize differences in
their immune responses in cerebral cryptococcal infection. The
activities of cytokines may not directly correlate with mRNA or
protein levels, as their function may be further modulated at
the level of posttranslational modification, processing multimer assembly or release from the cell of origin, or presentation
or sequestration by specific carrier molecules and as a result of
varying receptor types on neighboring target cells. It will be
interesting to correlate the mRNA levels shown here with the
results of future studies measuring cytokine protein expression
to determine whether they correlate in the brain similarly to
the correlations described for expression in the lungs during
murine cryptococcosis (28).
In summary, we present new detailed information on the
timing of the mRNA expression of specific immune modulatory molecules in intracranial cryptococcal infection in the
murine experimental system. This should prove useful to other
investigators for studying the genetic bases of host resistance
or point to new interventions via therapy with cytokines (or by
elimination of cytokines with antibody or other inhibitors) to
promote more efficient elimination of the fungus from the
CNS.

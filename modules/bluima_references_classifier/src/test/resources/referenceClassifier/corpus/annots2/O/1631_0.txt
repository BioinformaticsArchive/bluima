Escape behavior evoked by facial mechanical stimulation

A variety of animal models has been developed to clarify the
mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain induced by nerve injury
(Bennett & Xie, 1988; Seltzer et al., 1990; Kim & Chung, 1992;
Decosterd et al., 2002; Song et al., 2003). The CCI model is known
to cause behavioral changes that are similar to those in clinical
neuropathic pain (Bennett, 1994; Decosterd et al., 2002). In
particular, CCI of the sciatic nerve induces a hypersensitivity to
mechanical and thermal stimuli that has been termed mechanical or
thermal allodynia (Bennett & Xie, 1988; Bennett, 1994; Miki et al.,
2000; Obata et al., 2003). It has also been reported that CCI of the
ION induces neuropathic behavior analogous to that observed in CCI
of the sciatic nerve (Vos et al., 1994; Imamura et al., 1997; Obata
et al., 2003). We have clearly demonstrated that the escape threshold
to mechanical stimulation of the whisker pad, which is innervated by
the ION, was significantly reduced at 3 days after ION-CCI as

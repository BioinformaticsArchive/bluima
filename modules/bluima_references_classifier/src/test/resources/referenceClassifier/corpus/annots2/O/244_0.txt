Discussion
The clinical presentation of the patients reported
here illustrates the development of a cerebellar
syndrome as the initial manifestation of HTLV
infection. With time, these patients evolved towards
the more characteristic neurological manifestations
of HTLV myelopathy, indicating a rostral-caudal
progression of the disease in a pattern clinically
consistent with a spinocerebellar syndrome. Review
of the literature revealed 14 previous reports (Table
1) of patients with HTLV-I or II presenting with
cerebellar signs at onset. In Japan, Iwasaki et al.
(24) and Kira et al. (25) first described a spinocerebellar syndrome clinically similar to the one we
report here in patients with HTLV-I infection.
More recently, Oger et al. (26) informed the case of
a 52-year-old Caucasian woman from British
Columbia, Canada, with HTLV-II infection and a
chronic spinocerebellar syndrome. We were unable
to find previously published instances of this clinical
syndrome in the tropics.
The first 2 patients reported here presented with a
typical midline or vermian cerebellar syndrome
characterized clinically by loss of balance, widebased stance and gait, slight instability of the trunk,
and mild ataxia of the legs, in the absence of
dysmetria of the upper limbs, dysarthria or
pyramidal signs. These symptoms and signs are
very similar to those described in patients with
alcoholic cerebellar degeneration (27). Also, Patient
1 had postural tremor made worse in certain
positions, severe enough to interfere with handwriting. A similar postural tremor has also been
described in patients with alcohol-induced lesions of
the cerebellar vermis and anterior lobes (27).
Downbeat nystagmus, present in Patient 2, has
been reported with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration (28), although its presence usually suggests
either Arnold Chiari malformation or OPCA. The

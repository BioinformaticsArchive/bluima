and Table 1A). When compared to unhandled controls,
animals exposed to a 3-week DMI treatment followed by a
3-week washout period had 12.7% fewer spines per
dendritic length (t=0.71; P=0.005) in CA1 (Table 1A). In
addition, animals treated for 21 days with fluvoxamine and
left undisturbed for 3 weeks had 9.4% fewer spines per
dendritic length (t=2.96; P=0.025) compared to unhandled control animals (Table 1A). Total number of secondary
dendrites, average length per secondary dendrite, and
summed dendritic length per neuron were examined to
determine whether the observed changes in spine density
reflected changes in these dendritic factors. None of the
chronic antidepressant treatments or washout periods af-fected dendritic length in stratum radiatum of CA1 (Table
3B). In dentate gyrus, there were no significant differences
in secondary dendritic length, number or spine density
among animals administered fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,
DMI, or saline for 21 days followed by a washout period
(Table 1B).

theta activity contralaterally, associated with a reduction in anxiety ratings
(Schutter, 2001).
In this open pilot study, we have aimed to assess the effects of high frequency
rTMS over the left DLPFC in schizophrenic patients with predominant negative
symptoms on the psychopathological ratings of these symptoms. We also assume
that rTMS under these conditions will lead to altered activities of the different
frequency bands in topographical EEG. On the basis of the cited previous studies
on EEG activity in negative symptoms, we assume both local effects as well as
effects in remote cortical regions. We hypothesize a decrease in low frequency
bands in anterior regions, together with an improvement in negative symptoms.
In this respect, the whole cortical volume will be examined using Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) (Pascual-Marqui, 1994).

Bacteria and plasmids. Bacteria and plasmids used in this
work are listed in Table 1.
Media and growth conditions. E. coli strains were grown at
37°C in Luria broth or Penassay broth (Difco Laboratories)
medium. R. meliloti was grown in TY medium (1% tryptone,
0.1% yeast extract, 2 mM CaCl2) at 30°C. The prototrophic
phenotype of Tn5-induced R. meliloti mutants was determined in a medium containing, per liter, 10 g of mannitol,
2.05 g of K2HPO4, 1.45 g of KH2PO4, 0.15 g of NaCl, 0.7 g
of NH4NO3, 0.5 g of MgSO4 * 7H20, 0.01 g of CaCl2, 6.7 mg
of iron citrate, and 1 ml of a solution of vitamins (1 mg/ml
each of biotin, thiamin, and calcium panthothenate) was
added. Antibiotics were added at the following final concentrations ([Lg/ml): ampicillin, 200; chloramphenicol, 50; streptomycin, 400; and tetracycline, 5. To determine TnSencoded resistance, kanamycin (25 ,ug/ml) for E. coli and
neomycin (100 ,ug/ml) for R. meliloti were added.
DNA biochemistry. Plasmid DNA was isolated by the
method of Ish-Horowicz and Burke (19) adapted to a largescale preparation. DNA was purified by dye buoyantgradient ultracentrifugation (4). To map the Tn5 insertions in
multicopy plasmids, plasmid DNA was obtained by the rapid
isolation method described by Birnboim (5). R. meliloti total
DNA was prepared essentially as described by Meade et al.
(27). Restriction endonucleases were used as suggested by
the manufacturers. Calf alkaline phosphatase treatment,
exonuclease Bal 31 digestions, filling-in reactions, and ligation of restricted plasmid DNA were performed as described
by Maniatis et al. (26).

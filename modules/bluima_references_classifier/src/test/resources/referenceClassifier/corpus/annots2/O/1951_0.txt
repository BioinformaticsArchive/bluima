map of recruitment, ablation of only the ventral-most excitatory interneurons perturbs slow swimming movements
(McLean et al., 2007).
In zebrafish, the dorsal-most motoneurons and excitatory in-terneurons that participate in the most powerful movements are
also the earliest born (Myers et al., 1986; Westerfield et al., 1986;
Liu and Westerfield, 1988; Beattie et al., 1997; Kimura et al.,
2006). This suggests that the regular dorsoventral pattern of re-cruitment we observed might be a reflection of developmental
order, with neurons participating in faster larval circuits emerging first and occupying more dorsal positions, and progressively
slower circuits being added ventrally as the animal develops.
While the evidence from earliest born neurons is consistent with
this idea, the relationships between the emergence of motor be-havior, the timing of neuronal differentiation, and the later topographic map of speed have not been explored.
Here, we examine the development of motor activity and behavior in zebrafish and relate these to the temporal order of differentiation of neurons in the map. Our data show that large-amplitude
movements and the neurons that later drive fast larval movements emerge first during development, with a gradual layering
on of slower larval networks and behaviors with age. Because the
position of the neurons in the spinal cord reflects their time of
differentiation, the result is an orderly map of movement speed in
larvae that also represents the temporal emergence of the circuits.
An examination of the literature in light of this work reveals
evidence suggesting that this might reflect a broad pattern of
circuit development among vertebrates, including humans.

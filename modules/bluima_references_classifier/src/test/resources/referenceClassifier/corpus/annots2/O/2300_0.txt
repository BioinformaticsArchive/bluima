within the stimulus strength maximal for the first component of the afferent volley,
attributed to group Ia afferents (Bradley & Eccles, 1953, cf. B and C). Records in
D and E show that the interneurone was inhibited following stimulation of L7 VR
and that it could fire at a rate of 300/sec.
Experimental procedure. The experiments were done under chloralose anaesthesia
(50-70 mg/kg). The preparation and the general techniques of recording and stimulation were as described previously (Hultborn et al. 1971 a). The micro-electrodes
used for recording and dye injection were ordinary glass micropipettes with tips
broken to 15-2-5 gim. They were filled with a freshly made 5-6 % solution of Procion
Yellow M-4R (I.C.I.) in distilled water and had resistances of 15-25 MQ.
The Ia inhibitory interneurones were sought mainly within an area dorsal and
dorsomedial to the motor nuclei where they were found in the previous study
(Hultborn et al. 1971 b). The electrodes were introduced either from the cord dorsum
(close to the dorsal-root entry zone) or from the lateral aspect of the cord and
advanced slowly while stimulating a number of hind limb nerves. Usually the Ia
inhibitory interneurones were identified from extracellular records after which a
systematic tracking, guided by changes in the amplitude of their spike potentials,
was performed until they were successfully penetrated. Intracellular records were
then taken for final identification (see Text-fig. 1), and the staining proceeded. The
dye was injected microelectrophoretically by passing a weak (5-10 nA), constant
hyperpolarizing current through the micro-electrode (Jankowska & Lindstrom, 1970,
1971). If the cells seemed to tolerate the current well, after a few minutes its intensity
was slowly increased to 20-25 nA. Currents stronger than 25 nA were not used
because of an increased risk of losing the cells. The monosynaptic e.p.s.p.s were
recorded during the whole period of dye injection in order to ascertain that the
electrode remained inside the cell. The amplitude of these e.p.s.p.s gradually de-creased during the dye injection (cf. C and F in Text-fig. 1) which was usually continued as long as any clear synaptic response was seen. The maximal amount of dye
used for staining the cells corresponded to that ejected by 20 nA during 20 min
(400 nA. min), but about one fourth of this proved to be sufficient for staining
somas, dendrites and initial parts of the axons. Usually a few cells were stained in
each experiment, and the time period between the dye injection and sacrificing the
animal varied between 1 and 11 hr. In order to have longer times for diffusion of the
dye along the axons the spinal cords were perfused in situ with cold Ringer solution
and then kept for 16-32 hr at low temperature (about + 40 C) before fixation (Jankowska & Lindstrom, 1970).
Histological procedure and reconstruction of cells. The spinal cords were fixed in
10% neutralized formalin, dehydrated in ethyl alcohol, and embedded in paraffin.
Serial sections (15 #um) were cut either transversely or sagittally (cf. Table 1). The
sections containing stained cells were deparaffinized and mounted in Entellan
(Merck). The cells were viewed through a Leitz microscope with an incident light
fluorescence illuminator of Ploem with a dichroic beam-splitting mirror, K 495, an
exciting filter, BG 12 (3 or 5 mm), and an absorbing filter, K 510 or K 530. Photomicrographs were taken with Kodak Ektachrome high-speed (daylight) colour film
or Ilford FP 4 black and white film. The dendritic tree and the axonal trajectory were
reconstructed using a Leitz binocular tracing devise based on the split-image principle. Examples of such reconstructions are given in Text-fig. 3 and 4. For some cells
a partial photomontage reconstruction was made from photomicrographs of a few
neighbouring sections (P1. 2).
All the dimensions are given without correction for shrinkage during the histological procedure and are therefore underestimated. The over-all shrinkage was
about 10-15 %, as judged from changes in distance between two electrodes introduced into the spinal cord before sacrificing the animal.

Photomicrograph production

For immunohistochemistry, high-resolution microscopic images
were digitally captured using a digital CCD color video-camera
(TK-C1381, JVC) on an optical microscope (Eclipse E400, Nikon)
connected to a PC via an Image Pro Plus frame grabber (Image
Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics). For AChE histochemistry and
mAChR binding, high-resolution images were produced from
slides and autoradiographic films respectively, scanned using a
CanoScan 8000F scanner (Canon). Composite photomicrographs
were prepared with the Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems,
USA).

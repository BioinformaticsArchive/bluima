minus by the action of peptidylglycine -amidating monooxygenase enzyme (5).
Hypophysiotropic TRH neurons in the PVN project to the
median eminence (ME), where they are in close proximity to
the capillaries of the hypophysial-portal system. TRH re-leased in these capillaries stimulates biosynthesis and secretion of TSH from the pituitary (6, 7), which, in turn, stimulates biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones, T4 and T3, and
their release from the thyroid gland. The maintenance of
euthyroidism is dependent on a highly regulated balance of
positive and negative feedback, in which TRH positively
regulates TSH (6, 7), and thyroid hormones suppress preproTRH expression and TSH secretion (8). ProTRH is also
abundantly expressed in hypothalamic neurons outside the
PVN and in extrahypothalamic brain regions. This extrahypophysiotropic TRH is believed to function as a neuromodulator of known neurotransmitters (8, 9). It probably has an
important role in appetite control, arousal and sleep, cognition, locomotion antinociception, thermoregulation, and
psychological function (10). Little is known, however, about
the regulation of extrahypophysiotropic TRH and its biosynthesis by thyroid hormone status.
The important role of PC1/3 and PC2 in hormonal biosynthesis has been elucidated by the studies of PC1/3- and
PC2-null mice and in a patient with defective PC1/3. PC1/
3-null mice are small due to impaired proGHRH processing

We reviewed data from polysomnographic studies available in the literature. To date, a total of 29 PSGs have been
performed in 23 HH patients, reported in 9 studies. The
reports included between 1 and 10 patients each [10,
16–23]. Eleven PSGs failed to record an attack. A total of
20 attacks have been recorded in the remaining 18 PSGs.
An association with REM sleep was found in 15 out of
the 20 recorded attacks (75%). Two attacks occurred during stage 2 [18] and 3 during stage 3 of non-REM (NREM)
sleep [21]. Sleep-disordered breathing, defined as apnoeahypopnoea index ≥5, was found in 7 out of 23 (30.4%)
patients who undergo PSG (4 of them in the Manni's
series, 1 patient in the Dodick's series [10], the Capuano's
patient [17] and the Kacasoy Orhan's patient [23]).
However only in 1 attack out of the 20 recorded headache
onset was clearly time-related to a severe hypoxia [10].
The above findings indicate that REM sleep, but not
sleep-disordered breathing, is to be considered a major
trigger of HH attacks and that the role of nocturnal hypoxia in HH pathogenesis may be less relevant then generally
believed.

EEG RECORDINGS. Scalp recordings were performed using DC am-plifiers with long-term stability better than 1 V/h and bandwidth
DC-300 Hz (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA). We used sintered Ag/
AgCl electrodes (E220N-LP, In Vivo Metric, Healdsburg, CA) with
12-mm2 active area placed in a holder above the skin, forming a
closed space that was filled with a chloride-containing electrode gel
(Berner, Helsinki, Finland). The skin beneath the electrodes was
incised to short-circuit skin generated potentials. These measures
ensured stable DC recordings (Vanhatalo et al. 2002).
DC scalp electrodes were placed as shown in Fig. 1: on the median
line [in frontal (F), central (C), and occipital (O) locations] and
symmetrically with respect to the midline [2 temporal electrodes (TL,
TR) and 2 mastoid electrodes (ML, MR)].
Bone and epidural potentials were recorded with ball Ag/AgCl
electrodes and intraparenchymal potentials were recorded by means of
glass microelectrodes (impedance 1â€“10 M ).

To further study debris elimination through capillaries we used various experimental models in frogs. In
one approach, neurons or axon terminals were filled
through the transected axons by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or cobaltous lysine complex (CLC). We
searched for cells containing labeled phagocytozed
neuronal particles. The ultrastructure of phagocytozing cells in the brain has been described in detail by
several authors (Bignami & Ralston, 1969; Blakemore,
1972; Matthews & Kruger, 1973; Prineas & Wright,
1978; Kida et al., 1993; Ko Ìˆ sel et al., 1997), but none of
them reported clearing of debris into blood vessels.
Therefore, we concentrated our attention on capillaries, since here the blood is separated from the brain
parenchyma by the capillary endothelial cell and a
basal lamina only. We looked for debris-containing
cells or their processes in the vicinity of capillaries,
especially inside the basal lamina or in the capillary
lumen.

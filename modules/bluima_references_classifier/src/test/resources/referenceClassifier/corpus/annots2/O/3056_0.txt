Figure 5. Characterization of α2A-AR-IR fibers in rat spinal cord. Single sections of lumbar spinal cord were double-labeled with α2A-AR antisera in
combination with various other antisera. The first column (A, E, I, M, Q, U ) depicts α2A-AR-IR (red). The second column (B, F, J, N, R, V ) depicts
immunoreactivity obtained with other antisera used in double-labeling ( green). The third column (C, G, K, O, S, W ) depicts digitally merged images of
the first two columns. In merged images, the appearance of yellow may indicate colocalization, although higher magnification is required to distinguish
colocalization from close apposition. The fourth column (D, H, L, P, T, X ) depicts merged images obtained at higher magnification. Row 1 (A–D)
demonstrates that α2A-AR -IR and α2C-AR-IR are rarely colocalized. Row 2 (E–H ) demonstrates that α2A-AR-IR and SP-IR are highly colocalized.
Row 3 (I–L) demonstrates that α2A-AR-IR and CGRP-IR fibers are highly, but not exclusively, colocalized. Row 4 (M–P) demonstrates that α2A-AR-IR
and ENK-IR are rarely colocalized. Row 5 (Q–T) demonstrates that α2A-AR-IR and DβH-IR are closely apposed, but not colocalized. Similarly, row
6 (U–X ) demonstrates that instances of colocalization between α2A-AR-IR and TH-IR could not be detected. SP, Substance P; CGRP, calcitonin
gene-related peptide; EN K , leuenkephalin; DβH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase.

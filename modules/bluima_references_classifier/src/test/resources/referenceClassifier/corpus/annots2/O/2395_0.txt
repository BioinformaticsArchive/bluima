the fetal chest becomes stabilized by recruitment of intercostal activity and there is
an increase in lateral thoracic width, though the sternum continues to be sucked in.
These movements resemble those in human infants delivered prematurely and
suffering from the respiratory distress syndrome due to deficiency of pulmonary
surfactant. Abnormal deep inspiratory efforts are accompanied by enhanced activity
of the diaphragm, intercostal and laryngeal abductor muscles; substantial quantities
of fluid can then be inhaled (10-30 ml), accounting for the presence of meconium in
the lungs of babies asphyxiated during delivery.

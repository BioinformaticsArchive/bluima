Significance of Bupropion Blockade and Early
Nicotine-Induced Up-Regulation of Type III nAChRs.
The present results indicated that type III nAChRs are the
first among the three identified subtypes in the hippocampus
to be readily desensitized by smoker's level of nicotine, significantly up-regulated by in vivo nicotine in less than a day,
and potently blocked by clinically relevant concentrations of
bupropion (Fryer and Lukas, 1999; Slemmer et al., 2000). It
is unlikely that a high-potency inhibition of type III response
by bupropion is due to measurement of an indirect rather
than a direct response because the magnitude of the indirect
response was directly proportional to the agonist concentrations (Fig. 4). The type III nAChRs when activated by exogenously applied agonists triggers both AMPA receptor- and
NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs (Figs. 3 and 4) and thereby
forms one of the means by which endogenous cholinergic
impulse could regulate the excitability of interneurons
(Alkondon et al., 2003). ACh-induced excitation of GABAergic
interneurons is an important signal that improves attention
and encoding by suppression of background activity in the
cortical circuits (Hasselmo and McGaughy, 2004). It has been
established that the activity of GABAergic interneurons is
critical in setting up various hippocampal rhythms, indicative of the process of learning and memory (Cobb et al., 1999).
Because a single injection of nicotine is able to induce rapid
synaptic changes that underlies cue-related learning (Saal et
al., 2003) and is also able to functionally up-regulate the
nAChRs (Fig. 6), we propose that early up-regulation of type
III nAChRs by nicotine may be a key mechanism involved in
early cue-related learning associated with nicotine addiction.
It is also likely that blockade of up-regulated type III and

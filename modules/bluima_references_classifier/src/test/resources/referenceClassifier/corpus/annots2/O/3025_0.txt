Fig. 2. Telencephalic ependymal cells in culture: Phase contrast able membranes coated with fibronectin in SFM-T conditions display,
microscopy. A: When cultured for 14 days on plastic + fibronectin after 14 days in vitro, a similar organization in monolayers composed
substrate in SFM-T conditions, telencephalic ependymal cells are of polygonal cells. ×320. C: In telencephalic 30-day-old cultures, large
organized in monolayers constituted of regularly polygonal epithelioid ependymal cysts can be observed (star) in the cell layer as a consecells. ×320. B: Telencephalic ependymal cells, attached to semiperme- quence of cell migrations and reorganizations in culture. ×320.

I. Single-unit recordings were obtained
from the supplementary motor area of the
cerebral cortex of two monkeys during execution of learned movements.
2. Monkeys were required to push or pull
a cast attached to the right forelimb in re-sponse to a sudden perturbation delivered
via the cast. An instruction as to the direction of the monkey's movement was delivered 2.5-5 s prior to the occurrence of the
perturbation and correct performance, therefore, required the animal to develop a preparatory state prior to the perturbation.
3. Of many hundreds of neurons re-corded, 201 exhibited instruction-induced
changes of activity during the period intervening between the instruction and the perturbation-triggered movement.
4. In 94 neurons, effects of the instruction
were differential depending on which of the
two instructions was given, whereas in 107
neurons, effects were nondifferential. The
latencies of the differential responses ap-peared to be shorter (starting as early as
140 ms after the instruction).
5. The magnitude of the instruction ef-fects varied in parallel with development of
enhanced motor skill asthe monkeys gained
more experience in responding to the triggering stimulus.
6. These observations substantiate the
hypothesis that the supplementary motor
area plays a part in modifying a sensorytriggered motor output.

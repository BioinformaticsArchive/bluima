Second, it is possiblethat the passivestimuli used in this study were too weak or
inappropriate to excite the peripheral receptors that may send information to these
striatal cells. For example, spindle discharge
during isometric musclecontraction is greater
at any joint angle than during muscle relaxation (49, 50). Additionally, golgi tendon
organswould be much more responsive during active contraction than passivestretch of
forearm muscles(28). Thus it is possiblethat
the elevated levels of proprioceptive occurring
during active movement could be sufficient
to contribute to the excitation of putamen
cellsthatarenotresponsivetopassivemovement.
A final factor that could influence the
sensory responsesof putamen neurons is the
possibility that behavioral contingencies that
were not evaluated in the present experiments
modulate the responsiveness of putamen
neurons to peripheral inputs. Such interactionsinthebasalgangliahavebeendescribed
with respect to visual evoked responsesin
the substantia nigra (25), and similar mechanisms may modulate the responsivenessof
striatal neurons to somesthetic inputs.

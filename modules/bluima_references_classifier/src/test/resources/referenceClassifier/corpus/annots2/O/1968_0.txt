number evoked by each impulse counted 10 min following the TS
onset in OVXV (white bar) or OVXE (black bar). No statistical significance was found in mean spike numbers evoked by TS between these
groups (TS, p > 0.05, n = 7). Mean spike numbers evoked by TS in
association with intrathecal NMDA injections were significantly in-creased in OVXE compared with OVXV (TS + NMDA, **p < 0.01 to
OVXV, n = 7). Mean spike number increases caused by intrathecal
NMDA were significantly reversed by pre-treatment with APV and Co-101244 (TS + APV + NMDA and TS + Co + NMDA, respectively.
##p < 0.01 to TS + NMDA, n = 7).

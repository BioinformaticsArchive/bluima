motoneurons of lumbosacral segments has been
reported following peripheral nerve lesions (Gonzalez
et al. 1987 ; Lowrie & Vrbova! , 1992 ; Li et al. 1993 ; Wu
et al. 1994). Previous studies (Gonzalez et al. 1987 ; Li
et al. 1993 ; Wu et al. 1994 ; Yu, 1994) have also shown
that physical contacts between motoneurons and their
targets are crucial in the maintenance of motoneuronal development. It is significant in this study
that neither the motoneurons nor their axons were
traumatised, yet NADPH-d and NOS were noticeably
induced in these cells. This therefore argues against
the possiblity that damage to the motoneuron and its
disconnection from the target are contributing factors
leading to the induction of these enzymes in motoneurons after knee joint immobilisation.
There are several possible explanations for the
induced expression of NADPH-d and NOS after
RKJI in the present study. It is conceivable that with
immobilisation of the knee joint, the activities of the
muscles acting on the joint would be drastically
reduced. This may affect the normal functional
interaction between the motoneurons and their targets. Recent studies have shown that target-derived
neurotrophic factors may be involved in the in-teraction between muscles and motoneurons (Sendtner et al. 1990 ; Koliatsos et al. 1993). It is possible,
therefore, that with the reduction of target activities,
the normal retrograde axonal transport of such factors
to the perikaya would be disrupted resulting in the
expression of NADPH-d}NOS in motoneurons. An-other mechanism leading to the increase of motoneuronal NADPH-d}NOS activities could be reduced
muscular tension due to muscular atrophy after RKJI,
which might in turn lead to a reduction in synaptic
contacts and a loss of axon terminals in the affected
muscles. Previous studies have shown that normal
muscle activity is critical for the differentiation of the
developing neuromuscular junction (Hamburger,
1958 ; Pittman & Oppenheim, 1978).

EVects of diagnosis, area, hemisphere and sex were investigated by ANOVA. The potential confounders of age, pH,
post mortem interval (PMI) and freezer storage time4,32,39
were included as covariates. The Pearson coeYcient was
used to examine correlations of GAP-43 mRNA between
areas; significance was set at P<0.01 for this analysis, given
the large number of correlations to be determined.
The ratio of GAP-43 mRNA to synaptophysin mRNA
was calculated in each area for five of the schizophrenics
(age: 59&5.0 years; PMI: 38&5 h; brain pH: 6.39&0.09)
and eight of the controls (age: 61&6 years; PMI: 30&3 h;
brain pH: 6.50&0.08) from Table 1, who had also been
included in a study of synaptophysin mRNA.20

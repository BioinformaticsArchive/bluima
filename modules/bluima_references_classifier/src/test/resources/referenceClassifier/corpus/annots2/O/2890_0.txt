erodimerization with other membrane-associated proteins by
coiled coil interactions (Phillips et al., 1991b). In the region
corresponding to that encoded by mouse exon 3 (residues 178 –
230) five tyrosine residues are conserved in chick rapsyn (Fig. 3,
asterisks) and could serve as substrates for tyrosine kinase phosphorylation accompanying AChR clustering (Hall and Sanes,
1993). The entire mouse exon 4 encodes a region (residues 231–
263) that is particularly well conserved among chick, mouse,
Xenopus, and Torpedo ('88% identity) and includes a hydrophobic domain (Fig. 3, HY ) speculated previously to form nonionic
interactions with AChR subunits independent of any leucine
zipper interactions (Phillips et al., 1991b). Consistent with the
functional importance of rapsyn's central region, a truncated
mouse protein lacking the leucine zipper and hydrophobic do-mains (residues 16 –254) failed to cluster AChRs but formed
normal rapsyn aggregates (Phillips et al., 1991b). Finally, mouse
exons 7 and 8 encode two tandem zinc-binding motifs (residues
363– 402) conserved among chick, mouse, Xenopus, and Torpedo
rapsyns (Fig. 3, ZF ) that fit the CCCH-HCCC two-finger se-quence (Froehner, 1991). These “zinc-finger” motifs have been
implicated in mediating rapsyn homoaggregation, because mutations in the region greatly reduce rapsyn clustering (Scotland et
al., 1993).

Detection of multiple rapsyn transcripts in muscle and
neuronal tissues
Synthetic oligonucleotide primer pairs derived from Ch43K.1
cDNA (Fig. 2 B) were used to amplify rapsyn-like cDNAs from
chick muscle and neuronal templates obtained by reverse transcription of total cellular RNA (Fig. 4). Using the outer (S1 and
A1) or inner (S2 and A2) PCR primer pairs in separate amplifications of Ch43K.1 template revealed single ethidium-stained
products on agarose gels (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2, 3) having the expected
sizes of ;1470 or 1350 bp. When amplifications were performed
using the S1 and A1 primer pair on chick muscle cDNA templates,
three products of ;1350, 1150, and 500 bp were detected in
addition to the expected product of ;1500 bp (Fig. 4 A, lane 4 ).
The muscle products were judged to represent amplified cDNA
rather than genomic DNA templates, because RNA was always
pretreated with DNase, and because no products were detected in
amplifications where reverse transcription was omitted from the
initial reverse transcription reaction (e.g., Fig. 4 A, lanes 5, 7, 9). In
addition, the products do not arise from a general cellular transcript, because control experiments using the same S1 and A1
primer pair revealed no ethidium-stained products using cDNA
templates generated from liver or dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
(see below). The latter control is noteworthy, because whereas
chick DRG neurons express functional nicotinic AChRs (Margiotta and Howard, 1994) and AChR α-subunit mRNA (Boyd et al.,
1991), they are not known to receive synaptic inputs and do not
form aggregates of mAb35 immunoreactivity that would be indicative of clustered AChRs (J. Margiotta, unpublished observations). The RT-PCR detection of several muscle-derived rapsyn
cDNAs, in addition to the expected 1500 bp product, suggests that
multiple rapsyn transcripts are expressed in chick muscle.

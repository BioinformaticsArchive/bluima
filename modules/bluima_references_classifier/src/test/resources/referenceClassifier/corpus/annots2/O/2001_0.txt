Neurochemical analysis
Sequential in vivo 1H NMR spectra (12–16 spectra per rat)
were obtained, beginning at 44 ± 11 min after insulin
administration and continuing until 270 ± 23 min (range:
247–306 min). Data from one rat in the hypoglycemia group
was excluded because of the presence of irregular heart rate,
persistent hypothermia and elevated lactate, suggesting
unstable physiology during the study. Thus, the final analysis
included data from 5 hypoglycemic and 2 control rats.
The heart rate (beats per min) increased from 375 ± 15 to
410 ± 14 within 60 min of insulin administration and was
maintained at 445 ± 19 thereafter. The heart rate rapidly
decreased to 395 ± 19 following 10% dextrose administration. The heart rate did not alter during the entire experimental period in the two control rats.
A representative in vivo 1H NMR spectrum obtained
during hypoglycemia and the typical location of the VOI in
hippocampus is shown in Fig. 2. The water signal linewidth
decreased from approximately 9 Hz to 7 Hz within 120 min
after insulin administration in all rats. The concentrations of
alanine, b-hydroxybutyrate and glucose decreased below
detection threshold (0.5 lmol/g) within 120 min after insulin
administration (i.e. during the initial 60 min of hypoglycemia, arbitrarily labeled Phase I). Lac concentration decreased
50% during this period.
The sequential changes in Cr, PCr, aspartate, glutamate,
glutamine and lactate concentrations over time in a rat are
shown in Fig. 3. During the initial 60 min of hypoglycemia
(i.e. Phase I), other than a slight decrease in PCr and a
corresponding increase in Cr concentration, the neurochemical profile was unaltered. Between 120 and 160 min after
insulin administration (i.e. 60–100 min of hypoglycemia,
Phase II), first glutamine and then glutamate concentrations
decreased steadily with a corresponding increase in aspartate
concentration. The PCr/Cr ratio was maintained between 1.1
and 1.2 during this period. During the subsequent, very brief
period (160–180 min after insulin administration, Phase III),
a precipitous decrease in PCr with an equally rapid reciprocal
increase in Cr was observed that resulted in very low PCr/Cr
ratio (≤ 0.14). The concentration of glutamine decreased
below the detection threshold (0.5 lmol/g), glutamate
decreased by 75%, and aspartate increased approximately
300% of the corresponding pre-hypoglycemia levels, respectively, during this phase (100–120 min of hypoglycemia).
These dramatic changes were clearly visible in the 1H NMR
spectra acquired during this period (Fig. 4). During the
subsequent period (180–240 min after insulin administration,

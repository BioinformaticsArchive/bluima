GluR3 is widely expressed in neurons of the intermediate and ventral horn of the grey matter, with the highest
level of immunostaining in the cytoplasm of the motor
neurons; this is consistent with immunocytochemical studies
in rats, using nonselective antibodies (Tachibana et al., 1994;
Kerr et al., 1998; Popratiloff et al., 1998). GluR4 was also
expressed in all neurons of the grey matter. Unexpectedly,
however, the immunoreactivity was much higher in the
nucleus than in the cytoplasm. So far, we have no explanation for this specific nuclear localization of GluR4.

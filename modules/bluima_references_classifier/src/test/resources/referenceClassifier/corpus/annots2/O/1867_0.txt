Anatomical dichotomy between medium spiny neurons
Three-dimensional reconstructions of biocytin-filled MSNs re-vealed that the total dendritic length of D1 MSNs was significantly
greater than that of D2 MSNs in adult mice. Although measures of
whole-cell capacitance derived from somatic voltage steps underestimate membrane surface area, they were strongly correlated
with our anatomical measures of total dendritic length. Furthermore, the number of branch points and terminal endings (“tips”)
was significantly higher in D1 MSNs. However, normalizing the
branching parameters (tips, intersections) by the number of primary dendrites eliminated the difference between MSNs. We also
found the length of each segment and the number of segments to
be the same in each primary dendritic branch, regardless of the
cell type from which it emerged. These results argue that the
branching structure within individual primary dendrites or
branchlets is the same in the two MSN types. This conclusion was
consistent with the electrotonic length equivalence of the dendritic tree in the two MSN populations (Rall, 1969, 1977; Brown

Survival of the daughter cell population was assessed
by BrdU immunohistochemistry 7 and 30 days after the
last BrdU injection. At 7 days (Fig. 1B,C) the vast majority
of BrdU-positive cells remained in the subgranular zone
and the GCL inner zone, but clusters were rare. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopic analysis of cells
stained with anti-BrdU and anti-TUC 4 showed doublelabeled cells localized preferentially to the GCL inner zone
in both control and treated animals (Fig. 3A). At 30 days,
(Fig. 1D) many BrdU-positive cells were found throughout the GCL and some cells were located in the upper
rows of the layer. No clusters of BrdU-positive cells were
observed. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the occurrence of BrdU-NeuN and BrdU-calbindin D28K doublelabeled cells (Fig. 3B,C).
A significant decrease in BrdU-labeled cell density in
the GCL over time was detected in controls (KW, P
0.05) (Fig. 2A). This decrease occurred during the first

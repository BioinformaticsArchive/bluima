MMCs observed were propagated from the duodenum to
the terminal ileum.
During cerebroventricular perfusion with either S-CCK-OP or 1251-CCK-OP (1.2 pmol*kg-l*mir+ at 0.15
ml/min), continuous spike activity occurred at all recording sites along the small intestine. An example is shown
in Fig. 7A. The time to onset of the effect of the
octapeptide was 10.1 t 1.0 min (n = 20). The onset of
the effect of S-CCK-OP was nearly simultaneously
throughout the small intestine. The effect lasted for as
long as the ventricles were perfused with either S-CCK-OP or 1251-CCK-OP. During a 65min perfusion
period with S-CCK-OP, - 1.5 x 10VIO M of S-CCK-OP
was delivered to the left lateral ventricle. As measured
by radioimmunoassay (RIA), - 53% was recovered in
the outflow from the fourth ventricle. Thus -0.71 x
lo-lo M (n = 12) S-CCK-OP was unrecovered. MMC
activity returned 28.7 t 7.9 min (n = 20) after the
perfusate was changed to artificial CSF alone (Fig. 7A).
The first MMC occurred in the upper jejunum.
Cerebroventricular perfusions with a lower concentration (0.12 pmolkg-l smin-l) of S-CCK-OP had no effect
on spontaneously occurring MMCs whereas perfusion
with a higher concentration (12 pmol kg-l emin-l) re-sulted in earlier onset of continuous spike activity
(Table 1).
Cerebroventricular perfusion with NS-CCK-OP (0.12,
1.2, and 12 pmol l kg-l l min-l; n = 8 for each concentration) had no significant effect on either the propagation
time or the cycle time of MMCs (Table 1).

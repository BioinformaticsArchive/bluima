following 1.0 mg/kg, estimated to yield peak plasma concentrations at the high end or above the range associated with
clinical efficacy, the suppression of tonic activity was more
pronounced ( 58%). Oral administration of low-dose MPH
also elicited a modest suppression of tonic LC discharge [from
27 to 38%; dose, F(2,46) 2.92, p 0.066; time, F(3,108)
15.70 p 0.001; and dose time, F(6,108) 4.94, p 0.001].
LC Burst Activity. Burst discharge of tonic LC activity is
associated with more efficient NE release (Page and Abercrombie, 1999). In general, both i.p. [dose, F(3,38) 5.56, p
0.003; time, F(3,114) 11.82, p 0.001; and dose time,
F(9,114) 1.69, p 0.099] and oral MPH [dose, F(2,25) 1.39,
p 0.269; time, F(3,75) 1.26, p 0.296; and dose time,
F(6,75) 1.42, p 0.22] had relatively mild effects on burst
discharge (Fig. 4). The only exception to this was observed
with the highest dose of i.p.-administered MPH, which significantly suppressed burst activity to a maximum of 41%.

FIG. 7. Sucrose gradient analysis of lysates from cells infected with hr81-1
lacking UL15. Gradients similar to those described in the legend to Fig. 3 were
collected into nine fractions. Fraction 6 contains B capsids. (A) Immunoblot
analysis was performed to detect VP5 (panel A), UL6 (panel B), UL25 (panel
C), and UL28 (panel D). (B) Quantitative analysis was performed as described
in the legend to Fig. 3.

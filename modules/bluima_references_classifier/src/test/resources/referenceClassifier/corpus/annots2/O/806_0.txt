reversed by the competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, LY
293558 (Kest et al., 1997), suggesting a role for AMPA
glutamate receptors in analgesia that is mediated by the
opioid receptor. Morphine-induced catalepsy was also in-hibited by GYKI 52466, the AMPA receptor antagonist
used in the present study (Tzschentke and Schmidt, 1996),
as was morphine-induced conditioned place preference
(Tzschentke and Schmidt, 1997) and behavioral sensitization (Tzschentke and Schmidt, 1997). Further studies by
Carlezon et al. (1999) also showed an inhibition of both the
acquisition and expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization by LY 293558. In the present study, we
did not observe the inhibition of morphine-induced catalepsy reported by Tzschentke and Schmidt (1996); however, this could be due to differences in the doses of both
morphine and GYKI 52466 used in these studies.
The AMPA glutamate receptor is believed to be a
pentamer that may be composed of a combination of
four subunits, referred to as GluR 1– 4 or GluR A–D
(reviewed by Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994). Of
these, the role of the GluR 1 or GluR A subunit has been
best characterized in relation to the effects of morphine.
In mice with a disruption of the gene encoding GluR A,
reduced morphine tolerance was reported by Vekovischeva et al. (2001), as well as decreased behavioral
sensitization; these findings are similar to those seen in
animals treated with AMPA receptor antagonists (e.g.
Kest et al., 1997; Tzschentke and Schmidt, 1997). Re-peated administration of morphine has been shown to
increase expression of GluR1 in the ventral tegmental
area (Fitzgerald et al., 1996) and viral-mediated expres-

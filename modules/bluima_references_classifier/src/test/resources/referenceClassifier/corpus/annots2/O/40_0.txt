2.4. Nuclear extract preparation and gel retardation assays
Cells were grown as described previously to 70^80% con£uence and
fresh media containing 2% FCS were then added. After 24 h cells were
stimulated for 15 min with indicated factors. Nuclear extracts were
prepared as described [18,19]. A double stranded DNA fragment containing the high a/nity sis-inducible element of human c-fos promoter
(SIE) [20] was labeled by ¢lling in 5P protruding ends with Klenow
enzyme using [K-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Gel retardation assays
were carried out according to published procedures [21,22]. 2^5 Wg
of nuclear extracts and approximately 10 fmol (10 000 cpm) of probe
were used. Some samples were incubated in the presence of a 50-fold
molar excess of speci¢c unlabeled oligonucleotide probe as a competitor. Protein-DNA complexes were separated in a 4.5% polyacryl-

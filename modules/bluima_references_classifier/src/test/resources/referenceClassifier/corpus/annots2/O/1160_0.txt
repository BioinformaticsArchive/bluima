We have previously demonstrated behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression using cyclosporin A as an unconditioned stimulus and
saccharin as a conditioned stimulus. In the current study, we examined the central processing of this phenomenon generating excitotoxic
lesions before and after acquisition to discriminate between learning and memory processes. Three different brain areas were analyzed:
insular cortex (IC), amygdala (Am), and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH). The results demonstrate that IC lesions
performed before and after acquisition disrupted the behavioral component of the conditioned response (taste aversion). In contrast, Am
and VMH lesions did not affect conditioned taste aversion. The behaviorally conditioned suppression of splenocyte proliferation and
cytokine production (interleukin-2 and interferon- ) was differentially affected by the excitotoxic lesions, showing that the IC is essential
to acquire and evoke this conditioned response of the immune system. In contrast, the Am seems to mediate the input of visceral
information necessary at the acquisition time, whereas the VMH appears to participate within the output pathway to the immune system
necessary to evoke the behavioral conditioned immune response. The present data reveal relevant neural mechanisms underlying the
learning and memory processes of behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression.

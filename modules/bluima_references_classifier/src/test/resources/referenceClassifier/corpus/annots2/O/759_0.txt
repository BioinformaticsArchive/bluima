These concepts go on to indicate that 'more im-portant than the anatomic type of conus that is
present (subpulmonary, subaortic, bilateral, absent)
is the amount of conal musculature beneath each
semilunar valve' (Van Praagh, 1973). These statements are often not supported by anatomical findings, since there are specimens of crossed great
arteries with a larger amount of subaortic than of
subpulmonary conal musculature (Fig. 2C) and
specimens with transposition of the great arteries
with a larger amount of subpuhnonary conal than
subaortic musculature (Fig. 2D).
We interpret the presence of the muscular
posterior conus as a result of a developmental disorder in which the posterior wall of this conus
instead of differentiating as happens normally into
connective tissue, does so into muscular tissue.

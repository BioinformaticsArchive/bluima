Figure 5. Time-dependent reduction in Aβ levels after PM A treatment.
Aβ levels were unaffected by 4αPM A. A, Significant reductions in Aβ40
at 6 hr (P6, p < 0.001) were gone by 12 hr (P12). V, Vehicle; P, PM A.
Number of animals per group: V6, 6; V12, 6; P6, 11; P12, 12. B, 4αPM A
(4αP) did not lower cortical Aβ40 levels after 6 hr compared with the
active analog PM A (P, p < 0.03). Number of animals per group: V, 6; 4αP,
7; P, 6.

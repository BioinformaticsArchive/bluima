substratum of a direct brainstem–spinal cord inhibitory
projection that is activated during AS.
We also examined the possibility that segmental glycinergic neurons are responsible for inhibiting spinal motor
neurons during AS, but we have thus far been unable to
observe any specific population of spinal cord glycinergic
neurons that express c-fos during AS-carbachol (Rampon
et al., 1997). At present, it appears as if the medullary
inhibitory region is the sole source of the motor inhibitory
processes within the spinal cord and certain brainstem
motor nuclei that occur during AS. In the abovementioned
work by Kodama et al. (2003) an increase in GABA release
during AS was also described. The neuronal origin of
GABA during this state is unknown to us because we did
not find any premotor interneuron stained for GABA or
GAD. Moreover, picrotoxin, a GABAA antagonist does not
block postsynaptic inhibition of motoneurons during AS
(Soja et al., 1990). We doubt that the data obtained with
microdialysis permit the temporal distinction between phasic or tonic inhibition that takes place during AS episodes
(Chase and Morales, 1982; López-Rodriguez et al., 1990).
The synaptic bombardment on motoneurons during phasic
episodes of AS is extremely complex (ibid.) and likely
GABA is released during phasic presynaptic inhibition that
takes place mainly during REMs.

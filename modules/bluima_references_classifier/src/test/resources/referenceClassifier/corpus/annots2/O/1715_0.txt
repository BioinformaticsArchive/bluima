All quantitative analysis was conducted using Neurolucida (Microbrightfield, Williston, Vermont, USA) software equipped with a
confocal module on a custom-built computer. First, the confocal stacks
obtained in a given cell were examined, and it was confirmed that the
stack contained a third-order or above terminal branch that was at least
50 lm in length. Those that did not were discarded. Next, the stack
with the most intense GFP signal throughout the length of the
dendrite, and with spines best resolved, was selected for detailed
analysis. First, the entire dendrite was traced and its length was
calculated using the neuron-tracing feature in Neurolucida . Next,

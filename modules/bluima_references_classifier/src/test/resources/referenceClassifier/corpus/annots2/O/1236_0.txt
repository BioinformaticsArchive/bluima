very good level of efficacy compared with other compounds
tested under similar conditions in this setting (Buccafusco
and Terry, 2000). The observation that on average the effect
was largely relegated to trials associated with short-delay
intervals suggests the possibility that lecozotan may have a
selective action to improve attentional aspects of cognition
(Paule et al., 1998). Further studies using behavioral paradigms more suited to assessing drug effects on attention
should be used to confirm this contention. The lack of effect
on task response latencies was consistent with no effect of the
drug on psychomotor speed. No untoward effects of the drug
were noted before or after testing. Together, these data demonstrate the efficacy of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists in en-hancing cognitive function in both rodents and primates.
Together, the heterosynaptic nature of the effects of lecozotan imbues this compound with a novel therapeutic ap-proach to the treatment of the cognitive deficits associated
with AD, and possibly other psychopathological disease
states in need of improved therapies to treat cognitive- or
memory-associated loss. Lecozotan has completed phase 1
clinical trials and is continuing clinical investigation in phase
2 as an agent to reverse cognitive loss in AD.

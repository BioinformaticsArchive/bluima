delayed onset times with respect to the onset
of phrenic nerve activity projected laterally.
However, there are also axons in the lateral
funiculi from neurons that have early onset
times.
The positions within the descending tracts
of the 10 axons that were located at two
cervical segments remained approximately
the same. Axons that were below the ventral
horn remained below, and axons in the lateral
columns remained in the lateral columns.
In six cases, the axonal projections of a
pair of neighboring medullary neurons were
mapped. In each case, the somata of the two
neurons were located close together, within
300 pm dorsoventrally in the same recordingelectrode track. Individual cells in neuronal
pairs were distinguished by their firing patterns, locations in a medullary recording
track, or spike amplitudes when recorded
simultaneously and conduction velocities of
their axons. Axons from five of the six neuronal pairs projected in close proximity to
one another (within 350 pm) in the cervical
spinal cord (see Fig. 6). These neurons also
had similar firing patterns. In the one exception, the neurons had very different firing
patterns. The late-onset neuron had its axon
located in the lateral funiculi, and the earlyonset neuron has its axon located in the
ventral funiculi. These results may suggest a
microorganization of the descending inspiratory tracts; that is, the spinal cord, axons
arising from neighboring bulbospinal neurons
seem to travel within the descending tracts
in close proximity to one another. In the
exception, the neurons may be functionally
different because they had markedly different
inspiratory phase firing onsets. In the corticospinal system, a microorganization of py-ramidal tract cells has also been hypothesized (1).
Comparison ofantidromic activation and
spike-triggered averaging
The two methods employed in this study,
AA and STA, each determined the same
position for a descending inspiratory bulbospinal axon in white matter of the cervical
spinal cord. However, each method has its
distinct advantages. Spike-triggered averaging
appeared suitable for more precisely locating
an axon. In particular, the results show that

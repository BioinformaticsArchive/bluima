Figure 1. C luster transplantation results in remyelination. A, Phase micrograph of PSA-NCAM+ neural clusters after 10 d in vitro on a nonadherent
surface (immediately before transplant). Grafts consisted of ;60,000 cells in clusters. B, Toluidine blue-stained transverse section of an x-irradiated
ethidium bromide lesion in the dorsal f uniculus after 30 d. Besides macrophages containing myelin debris ( M ), the lesion contains naked axons tightly
apposed to each other with no evidence of remyelination or glial cell nuclei. C, Toluidine blue-stained transverse section of an x-irradiated ethidium
bromide lesion 30 d after transplantation of PSA-NCAM+ neural clusters. Macrophages containing myelin debris ( M ), oligodendrocytes ( O), astrocytes
( A), and Schwann cells ( S) are present, and virtually all axons are remyelinated. D, Electron micrograph of an x-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion 30 d
after transplantation of PSA-NCAM+ neural clusters. An oligodendrocyte ( O) is present among remyelinated axons, characterized by thin myelin
sheaths. Schwann cells ( S), with their nuclei closely apposed to myelin sheaths, are also evident. E, Electron micrograph of an x-irradiated ethidium
bromide lesion 30 d after transplantation of PSA-NCAM+ neural clusters. The myelin sheaths produced by Schwann cells have a greater periodicity than
oligodendrocyte myelin and are surrounded by basement membranes (BM ). Magnification: A, 400×; B, C, 600×; D, 12,000×; E, 25,000×.

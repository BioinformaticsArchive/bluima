Figure 1. Electrophysiological responses from stratum radiatum interneurons in area CA1. A, A stratum radiatum interneuron is visualized,
along with a potassium gluconate-filled patch electrode (right) and a drug
pipette containing 1 mM ACh (lef t). The tip of the drug pipette was placed
within 5 μm of the cell body. Scale bar, 20 μm. B, In a current-clamp mode
recording from an interneuron, a 10 mV, 250 msec depolarizing pulse
induced rapid firing of action potentials. Relatively little accommodation
of the rate of firing was observed during the pulse. C alibration: 100 msec,
20 mV. C, In current-clamp mode, ACh application (5–20 msec) resulted
in a depolarization sufficient to generate bursts of action potentials.
C alibration: 100 msec, 100 pA. D, In voltage-clamp mode, pressure
application of ACh to these cells produced a fast, rapidly decaying inward
current (smaller trace), which was insensitive to treatment with 5 μM
atropine (larger trace). The average response amplitude after treatment
with atropine in five cells tested in a similar manner was 101 6 9.4% of
control. C alibration: 50 msec, 20 pA. E, ACh application at 5 sec intervals
dramatically reduced current amplitude (small trace) relative to responses
tested at 15 sec intervals (large traces). C alibration: 50 msec, 10 pA. F, I–V
plot for the ACh-induced current in a stratum radiatum interneuron. The
cell was voltage-clamped at -66 mV and then stepped from -106 to +36
mV in 20 mV increments. Voltage steps lasted 4 sec. ACh application
occurred 2 sec after the onset of the voltage step. The resulting I–V curve
indicates a reversal potential for the ACh-induced current of ;0 mV and
strong inward rectification at depolarizing potentials. Traces in D and E
are signal averages of four to nine individual responses.

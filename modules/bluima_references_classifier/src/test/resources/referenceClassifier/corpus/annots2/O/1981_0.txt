Discussion
The present study demonstrates that reversal learning is de-pendent upon proper numbers of GABAergic interneurons.
Mice with a null mutation in Plaur have reduced numbers of
PV GABAergic local interneurons in the OFC and striatal
regions, with normal interneurons in the BLA. The PV in-terneuron populations in the OFC and striatum along with the
reversal learning impairment are restored with postnatal
HGF/SF supplementation in the Plaur/HGF mice. These re-sults show that GABAergic local circuitry in the OFC and
striatum are critical for modulating behavioral flexibility and
that birth defects can be corrected by replenishing crucial
growth factors.

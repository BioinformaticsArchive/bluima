The ANOVA performed on the weight measurements
revealed a significant treatment (capsaicin vs. vehicle
treated) effect [F(1,242) = 81.629, P < 0.0001], as well
as a significant interaction between the effects of
treatment Ã— age [F(11,220) = 4.97, P < 0.0001;
F(11,220) = 2.78, P < 0.0001, for males and females,
respectively]. The post hoc analysis revealed that the
body weights of capsaicin-treated subjects were significantly lower than those of the controls between days 28
and 35 for the females and between days 28 and 42 for
the males (see Fig. 1).

dopaminergic neurons emerged, namely the existence of 2 tiers
of neurons, a dorsal tier including the ventral tegmental area
and dorsally situated pars compacta neurons, and a ventral tier
of lateral ventral tegmental area cells and ventral pars compacta
neurons (Fallon and Moore, 1978). The dendritic morphologies
of the 2 tiers of pars compacta neurons are distinct; those in the
dorsal tier extend dendrites mediolaterally in the plane of the
nucleus (Fallon et al., 1978) whereas those in the ventral tier
extend dendrites ventrally into the pars reticulata (Bjbrklund
and Lindvall, 1975). Initially, the dorsal tier neurons were thought
to correspond to the mesolimbic system and the ventral tier to
the nigrostriatal system. However, more recent studies show
that some dopaminergic neurons provide collaterals to both
limbic cortex and striatum (Fallon and Loughlin, 1982; Loughlin and Fallon, 1984; Takada and Hattori, 1986) and that both
the dorsal and ventral tier systems provide inputs to the striatum
(Veening et al., 1980). Our data suggest that the 2 tiers of midbrain dopaminergic neurons project differentially to the striatal
patch and matrix compartments.
Compartmental mesostriatal projections
Non-dopaminergicprojections to the matrix. The present results
describe the distribution of nigrostriatal non-dopaminergic type
C fibers to the striatal matrix compartment. The existence of a
non-dopaminergic nigrostriatal system was previously inferred
from the findings that (1) 6-OHDA fails to destroy all nigrostriatal projections (Fibiger et al., 1972) (2) glyoxylic acid-in-duced catecholamine fluorescence is not present in 5-10% of
retrogradely labeled nigrostriatal neurons (van der Kooy et al.,
1981), (3) some 5-15% retrogradely labeled mesostriatal neurons do not express TH immunoreactivity (Swanson, 1982), and
(4) nigral neurons with collaterals to the thalamus and striatum,
unlikely to be dopaminergic, can be demonstrated electrophysiologically (Deniau et al., 1978). The present study uses another
means of identification of non-dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections, namely, failure to express TH immunoreactivity in
PHA-L-labeled fibers (Gerfen and Sawchenko, 1985). Results
using this method are consistent with previous reports in that
the origin of such labeled non-dopaminergic afferents is from
areas previously identified as containing non-dopaminergic ni-grostriatal neurons, i.e., either in the rostra1 mediodorsal pars
reticulata or in the ventrolateral tier of the pars reticulata (van
der Kooy et al., 1981; Swanson, 1982).
Mesostriatal afferents that do not display TH immunoreactivity, which we have designated type C, are morphologically
distinct from those that do. Type C fibers are characterized by
their thickness (0.4-0.7 pm), arborization pattern, and large
bulbous boutons (up to 2.0 wm). The very rare labeling of type
C fibers with TH immunoreactivity in the normal or partially
dopamine-depleted striatum supports the suggestion that type
C fibers are most often non-dopaminergic. Also, in electron-

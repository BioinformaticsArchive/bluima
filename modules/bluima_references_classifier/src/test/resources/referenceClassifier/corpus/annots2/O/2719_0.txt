As mentioned in Materials and Methods the optic
nerves of the three controls were well-developed
fibres that could be handled as usual, whereas
the nerves of the three mutants were thin and
fragile, and had to be handled with special
precautions. At first glance, the fragility and
transparency of the nerves increase in the order
quaking : shiverer : jimpy.
The spectra from the three controls are similar to
those obtained with the optic nerves from wild-type
mice and rats (see for example, Mateu et al., 1995).
The spectra from the controls were analysed and
averaged according to the procedure used for the
sciatic nerves (see above): the results are presented
in Tables 1 to 3 and in Figures 1 and 2. Note, as in
sciatic nerves, the presence of significant differences
between the three controls. For example (see
Table 1), D, Dcyt and Dext are larger in jimpy than in
both shiverer and quaking control nerves. As
discussed for sciatic nerves, these differences are to
be ascribed to the difference of genetic background.
The X-ray scattering spectra from the optic nerves
are far more affected by the mutations than those
from the sciatic nerves. In jimpy and shiverer the
mutation nearly eliminates the signal, leaving a pair
of very weak and diffuse bands barely visible above

Opposite effects of iv amiodarone on cardiovascular vagal
and sympathetic efferent activities in rats. Am J Physiol

It is unknown whether amiodarone exerts a direct central
action on the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. This
study was designed to evaluate the effects of acute amiodarone administration on vagal and sympathetic efferent nerve
discharges. Experiments were carried out in 25 decerebrate
unanesthetized rats. In one group, vagal activity was re-corded from preganglionic fibers isolated from the cervical
vagus nerve. In another group, sympathetic recordings were
obtained from fibers isolated from the cervical sympathetic
trunk in intact conditions or after barodenervation. Recordings were performed before and for 60 min after amiodarone
(50 mg/kg iv) administration. In all groups, amiodarone in-duced bradycardia and hypotension. Vagal activity increased
immediately, reaching a significant difference after 20 min
(260 131% from 16.4 3.3 spikes/s) and was unmodified by
the barodenervation. At difference, sympathetic activity after
an initial and short-lasting increase (150 83% from 24.8
5.7 spikes/s) began to decrease significantly after 20 min
(36 17%) throughout the experiment. The initial increase
in sympathetic activity was not observed in barodenervated
animals. These changes in vagal and sympathetic activity
could play an important role in contributing to the antiarrhythmic action of amiodarone.

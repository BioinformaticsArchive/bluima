Figure 3. Overexpression of TGF- 1 reduces the ischemic lesion and
improves the neurological outcome of ischemic mice. The brains were
removed from the saline-treated and lacZ- and TGF- 1-transduced mice.
The cryostat sections were cut continuously and stained with cresyl violet.
A, Photographs of the ischemic lesion 1 d after tMCAO. B, Quantitative
analysis of the ischemic lesion 1 d after tMCAO. Data are expressed as
means SD of 10 animals for each group. There was no difference
between saline-treated and lacZ-transduced mice. ***p 0.001 compared
with lacZ-transduced mice. C, Improvement of the neurological outcome
in TGF- 1-transduced mice after ischemia. The neurological deficiency
was evaluated by a beam test before cerebral injection on the fifth day
after cerebral injection without ischemia and 1 d after tMCAO. Intracerebral injection did not cause neurological deficiency in nonischemic mice
(shaded columns) of all three groups in comparison with those before
injection (open columns). Thirty minutes of MCAO led to a severe
neurological deficiency in saline-treated or lacZ-transduced mice at 1 d
after ischemia but to a lesser extent in TGF- 1-transduced mice as
evidenced by the significant decrease in the falls from the beam (on the
sixth day after cerebral injection; filled columns). Data are expressed as
means SD of 13â€“20 animals for each group. There was no difference
between saline-treated and lacZ-transduced mice. *p 0.05 compared
with lacZ-transduced mice.

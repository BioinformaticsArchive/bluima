FIG. 2. CAPS mRNA expression in selected rat organs. Blots
containing poly(A) -enriched RNA from the indicated rat tissues (Clontech) were hybridized at high stringency with uniformly labeled probes
from the coding regions of rat CAPS1 and mouse CAPS2 and exposed to
film for 20 h. Arrows indicate the specific CAPS1 and CAPS2 mRNA
bands. Note that CAPS1 mRNA is expressed in a brain-specific manner,
whereas CAPS2 mRNA is also expressed outside the nervous system.

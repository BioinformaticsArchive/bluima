there is an inverse correlation between brain levels of A ,
synaptic density, and cognitive functions (13–15). Oligomeres
of A , proteofiblils, and fibrillar forms of A are neurotoxic
(16 –22). This toxicity may be mediated by oxidative stress
(23–26). Injections of A fibrils into mammalian brains causes
neuronal loss accompanied by microglial proliferation, abnormal tau phosphorylation, loss of microtubule binding, and the
formation of neurofibrillary tangles (1, 27, 28). Transgenic ex-pression of the familial AD-causing mutant APP in brains of
mice increases A generation causing both amyloid plaque
formation and abnormal phosphorylation of tau. However, neither neurofibrillary tangles nor neuronal loss were consistently
observed in these mice (11, 29 –38). The reasons for this discrepancy to AD pathology are unknown but may involve the
young age of the mouse neurons along with the absence of
pathogenic factors that may occur while aging.
To examine whether transgenic expression of SwAPP in
mouse brain increases the vulnerability of neurons to cellular
stress, we induced seizures in mice expressing SwAPP and
analyzed the neurodegeneration and apoptotic cell death in
brains at different times following the seizures (39 – 41). We
determined whether the increased levels of A mediated the
increased vulnerability of the SwAPP neurons. We report that
brain neurons of SwAPP mice were more vulnerable than nontransgenic littermates, even before the onset of amyloid plaque
formation, and that passive immunization with antibodies
against A protected the neurons from degeneration.

WESTERN BLOT
Postnatal mice (129/SvlmJ) of ages P0, P5, P7, P26 and adults
(P56-60 days) were euthanized and the OB, nasal septum and
turbinates were rapidly removed and placed on dry ice. The
tissues from 3–5 mice at each age were pooled, weighed and
sonicated on ice in a disruption buffer containing 0.05 M
tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane (Tris), 0.02 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 μM leupeptin, 0.5 units aprotinin, 0.02 M phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and 0.18 mM calpain in-hibitor in 100 ml of PBS. After centrifugation at 100, 000 × g
for one hour, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet
was resuspended in 500 μL of the above buffer, containing
0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. After 30
min on ice, samples were centrifuged at 16, 000 × g for 30 min
at 4◦ C. The supernatant membrane extract was collected and
the protein content determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Ten μg aliquots of the membrane protein extracts were
subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Ready-gels, Bio-Rad) under standard reducing
conditions, followed by electrophoretic transfer (60 V, 2
h) onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Danbury, CT).
Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in 50 mM Tris-HCI pH7.4, 0.15 M NaCI, containing
0.05% Tween-20 (BSA-TBST) for a minimum of three hours at
room temperature followed by incubation with anti-CAR an-tibody (rat anti-mouse p-46 1:2,000, generously provided by
L. Philipson) in BSA-TBST overnight at 4◦ C. The Immobilon-P membrane was washed in BSA-TBST followed by TBST
and then incubated in peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat
antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 1:20,000) for two hours at
room temperature. After washing in BSA-TBST, and TBS (pH

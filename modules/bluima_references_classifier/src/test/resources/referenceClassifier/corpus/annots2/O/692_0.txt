Histology
Upon completion of testing, all rats with cannulae
were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with isotonic saline followed by a 10% formalin solution (FS),
their brains removed and postfixed with a 10% FS for 2
days, at which time the solution was replaced with a
10% FS-30% sucrose solution until sectioning. Sections
(50 m thick) were cut on a cryostat and stained with
cresyl-violet.

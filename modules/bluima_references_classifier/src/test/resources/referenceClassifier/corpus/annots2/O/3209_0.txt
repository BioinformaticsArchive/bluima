We therefore chose a non-random systematic sample at a
set number of degrees of cerebellar tissue for both the paravermal and lateral zones: a sample 108 from the vermis into
each paravermal region and a sample 208 from the lateral
edge into each lateral zone. Thus, for each case, two 50-mm
sections (one from the left, one from the right) were sampled
from each of these functional zones.
Consequently, to accurately measure neuronal density in
functional zones of the cerebellum other than the flocculus,
a volume between 19 and 172 mm3 was non-randomly
sampled within each zone (representing 0.2â€“2% of the
volume of these zones). This sampling technique is similar
in principle to the optical disector (unbiased, three-dimensional technique with methodological variance within
biological variance); however, it also accounts for the longitudinal arrangement of the functional units perpendicular to
the cerebellar folia, allowing for a more accurate assessment
of these non-anatomically defined cerebellar regions.

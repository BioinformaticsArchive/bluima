Fig. 2. The brat mutation affects larval central brain proliferation
in a cell-autonomous manner. Wild-type (A,B) and brat11 (C,D)
MARCM clones labelled with CD8::GFP in third instar larval brain
hemispheres (A,C) and ventral ganglia (B,D), counterstained with the
DNA dye TOTO-3. When induced at low frequency in newly hatched
larvae, wild-type clones contain progeny of a single neuroblast
occupying a small area of third instar larval brain (single clone shown in
A). Similar heat shock conditions generate brat11 mutant clones of large
size, which appear difficult to resolve as single neuroblast lineages (two
or more merged clones are shown in C). In ventral ganglia, brat11
mutant clones (D) are recovered at similar frequency as in wild-type
clones (B) and appear indistinguishable in size and shape. Scale bars,
50 m. Genotypes: (A,B) hsFLP/+; FRT40A, UAS-mCD8::GFPLL5, UASnlslacZ20b/FRT40A, tubP-GAL80LL10; tubP-GAL4LL7/+; (C,D) hsFLP/+;
FRT40A, brat11, UAS-mCD8::GFPLL5, UAS-nlslacZ20b/FRT40A, tubPGAL80LL10; tubP-GAL4LL7/+.

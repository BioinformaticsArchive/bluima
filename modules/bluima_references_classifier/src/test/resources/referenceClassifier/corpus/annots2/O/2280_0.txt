The resultant model of striate cortex was encoded in computer memory
as a set of coordinates for the vertices of all 6000 compartments in the
visual fields (x,y space) and a set of coordinates for the corresponding
compartments in the cortex (u,u space). These data arrays formed the
basis for projecting ocular dominance stripes onto the visual field. The
first step was to enter the outlines of all stripes onto computer disk
memory using a grpahics tablet. (The minimum spacing between data
points correspond to 0.3 mm in the cortex, and the complete set of
stripes was represented by approximately 10” points.) A separate computer program treated each data point from the ocular dominance
outline as a pair of U,U coordinates, identified the cortical compartment
within which the point was contained, and determined the location of
the point relative to the vertices of the compartment. The point was
then assigned visual field (x,y) coordinates on the basis of this information about its location within an identified compartment. Points
belonging to the same outline were connected together, and the resultant back-transformed stripes were displayed on a graphics plotter.
Because of the wide range (50-fold) in dimensions of the back-transformed stripes, it was necessary to make several partial plots at different magnifications and then combine the images after appropriate
photographic enlargement.
Other hemispheres. The right hemisphere from the main experimental animal was sectioned tangential to the opercular cortex, and photographic montages were prepared of the pattern of stripes over much
of the operculum and the roof of the calcarine fissure. These montages
are in effect planar projections, and to avoid marked distortions they
were not extended to regions of high curvature.
Besides the one monkey used for the detailed reconstruction, several
other monkeys that had received eye injections of [“Hlproline were
studied. In order to confirm our observations about the layout of ocular
dominance stripes in the representation of the peripheral visual field,
photographic montages of the labeling pattern in the roof of the
calcarine fissure were prepared from one of these monkeys.

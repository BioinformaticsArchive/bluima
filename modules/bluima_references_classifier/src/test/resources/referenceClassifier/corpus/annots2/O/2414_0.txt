a narrow range of binaural intensity differences. Thus
they were “IID tuned.” Their optimal intensity differences ranged from about 10 dB (contra > ipsi) to 10 &I
(ipsi > contra). Furthermore, effective stimuli for spacespecific units had to contain both correct intensity and
phase differences, either parameter alone being ineffective (Fig. 9C). Their sensitivity to both of these binaural
parameters distinguished them from the brainstem neurons that were sensitive either to interaural intensity or
to phase differences. Latencies of space-specific units'
responses varied greatly, but were always greater than 7
msec.

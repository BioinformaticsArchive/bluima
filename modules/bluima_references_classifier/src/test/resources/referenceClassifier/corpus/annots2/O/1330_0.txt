Fig. 11. Comparison of tonotopic organization
in the IC of three species of bats. White areas,
frequencies below 60 kHz; gray areas, frequencies
above 60 kHz. In Pteronotus, the light gray area
represents the expanded 60 â€“ 63 kHz region corresponding to the acoustic fovea, and the dark gray
area represents frequencies higher than 63 kHz.
AL, anterolateral region of IC; DP, dorsal posterior
region of IC; M, medial region of IC. In Antrozous,
ICd, dorsal region of IC; ICl, lateral region of IC;
ICv, ventral region of IC. Arrows indicate the tonotopic axis from low to high frequencies. Reproduced with permission from Covey and Carr

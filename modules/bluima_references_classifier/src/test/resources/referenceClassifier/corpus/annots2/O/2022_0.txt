Relationships between neural sensitivities to proprioception
and vestibular compensation
The presence of neck proprioceptive responses on VOR interneurons was observed immediately after but never before labyrinthectomy. The fact that VOR interneurons show significant
modulation in response to stimulation of proprioceptors after
lesion, suggests that the unmasking of this extravestibular input
plays a role in the compensation process. To further investigate
this possibility, we examined two possible, non-mutually exclusive roles, namely that the unmasking of neck proprioceptive
inputs (1) results in the enhancement of neck-driven ocular
responses to improve gaze stabilization and/or (2) reflects a ho-meostatic mechanism that ensures continued dynamic stimulation of individual neurons after lesion.
Proprioceptive driven ocular responses, such as the COR, do
not make significant contribution to gaze stabilization in normal
subjects (Dichgans et al., 1973; Bronstein and Hood, 1986;
Ju Ìˆ rgens and Mergner, 1989; Roy and Cullen, 2002). If the un-masking of proprioceptive inputs enhanced neck-driven ocular
responses to compensate for the defective VOR, then we would
have expected more robust behavioral responses during neck
proprioceptive stimulation after vestibular lesion. This prediction was contradicted by our quantification of behavioral performance (i.e., the cervico-ocular reflex) measured during the same
paradigms used to compute neuronal neck sensitivity above (i.e.,
as in Fig. 3). Average behavioral gains were computed by measuring eye movements evoked by sinusoidal rotation of the monkey's body beneath its earth-stationary head. Figure 4 A1 shows

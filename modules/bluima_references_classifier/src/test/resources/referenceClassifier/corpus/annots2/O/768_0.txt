Fig. 2. Western blot analysis of antisera against recombinant MUPP1 proteins. (A) Approximately 5 ng of the mup3–4-GST, the mup5–6-GST and the
GST fusion proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE and transferred to an immobilon membrane. Filters were first incubated with primary raw antisera and
immunoreactivities of antibodies were detected by anti-rabbit HRP-coupled antibody with enhanced chemiluminescence. Dilutions of the primary antisera
are indicated above each lane. (B) Lysates from HEK239 cells expressing the respective Xpress-proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred to
immobilon membrane, and incubated with sera (1:50,000 for the anti-mup3–4, 1:100,000 for anti-mup5–6, 1:5000 for anti-Xpress). Anti-mup3–4 and
anti-Xpress, or anti-mup5–6 and anti-Xpress recognized the same band that contain epitopes for anti-mup3–4 or anti-mup5–6.

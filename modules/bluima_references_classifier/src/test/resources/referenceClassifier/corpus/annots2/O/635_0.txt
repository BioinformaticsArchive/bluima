Patients and Methods
Patients
We evaluated cortical activation patterns using NIRS imaging technique during hemiplegic gait on treadmill in six pa-tients with severe hemiplegia due to initial stroke (four men,
two women; four with right and two with left hemiplegia,
two with cerebral infarction, four with cerebral hemorrhage;
57 13 years old on average, and 81 31 days after
stroke). All were right-handed. Sites of lesion in each patient
are summarized in the Table. All had severe hemiplegia and
needed maximal assistance in walking. Fugl-Meyer scale18 for
the lower extremity (mean standard deviation [SD]) was
8 3 (full score 34). This study was approved by the
ethical committee of the hospital. Written informed consent
was obtained from each patient.

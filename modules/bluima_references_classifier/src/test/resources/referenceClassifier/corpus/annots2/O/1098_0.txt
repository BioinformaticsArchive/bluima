Figure 5. Double labeling for PKG and neuronal markers after PKG plasmid injection. Immunofluorescence confocal micrographs of brain cells transfected with the p513 vector containing
PKG-I cDNA. Only cells inside the overexpression sphere were considered. A, Plasmid was
injected into the VTA; brain sections were incubated with antibodies against PKG and against
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Secondary labeled antibodies against PKG (Alexa Fluor 488; green)
and TH (Cy3; red) were used. B, Plasmid was injected into the VTA; sections were incubated with
antibodies against PKG and against parvalbumin. The secondary labeled antibody against PKG
was as above. An antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (red) against parvalbumin was used. C,
Plasmid was injected into the CPu; sections were incubated with antibodies against PKG and
against parvalbumin. The secondary labeled antibodies were as in B. D, Plasmid was injected
into the CPu; sections were incubated with antibodies against PKG and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The secondary antibodies were as in B. Scale bars: A, B, 10 m; C, D, 5 m.

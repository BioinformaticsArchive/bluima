Figure 4. Timm scores of individual B
kindled rats as a function of evoked seizures. A, Plot of Timm scores of individual rats perfused on days 0,2,4, and
10 after the initiation of kindling stimulation of the perforant path. Horizontal bars represent the group mean at
each time point. Each dot corresponds
to the mean score of each rat of the
group, obtained from the individual
scores of three examiners who were un-aware ofthe identify and seizure history
of the animal. The differences of group .
scores on days 4 and 10 were statisti- .
cally significant (see Results). B, Plot of
Timm scores of individual rats exam- . . . .
ined 24 hr after the last evoked seizure . . . . .
as a function of the number of after- . . . .
discharges. Horizontal bars and dots . . .
correspond to group means and indi- - H.‚Äù
vidual scores as in panel A. There was I *
a significant correlation of Timm score 0 5
and number of after discharges (see Re-sults).

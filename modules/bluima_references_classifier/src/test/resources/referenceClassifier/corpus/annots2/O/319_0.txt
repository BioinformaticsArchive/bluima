FIG. 2. Proportions of mouse PrP res glycoforms after Western blot analysis using RB1 antiserum. Proportions of glycoforms are expressed as
arithmetical means 6 standard error of high-glycosylation (H), low-glycosylation (L), and unglycosylated (U) PrP res. Groups were inoculated as
described in Table 1.

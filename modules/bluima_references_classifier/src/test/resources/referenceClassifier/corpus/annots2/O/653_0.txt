Discussion

Our data suggest that the relief of parkinsonian symptoms by oral levodopa
application as well as STN-DBS bases on an improved neural processing from
thalamic nuclei to the frontal motor association areas. Dopaminergic stimulation with apomorphine has previously been shown to rely on the same mechanism (Jenkins et al., 1992). In addition, we found a bilateral deactivation
within the primary motor cortex in both on-conditions, which is in accordance
with recent H15O-PET studies demonstrating a decreased regional cerebral
2

blood flow in this area under effective STN stimulation (Limousin et al., 1997;
Ceballos-Baumann et al., 1999). This may be explained by a decreased proprioceptive input to the primary sensorimotor areas due to reduced PD motor
symptoms in the on-states.
Previous PET studies revealed an increased lentiform FDG uptake in PD
patients, presumably reflecting high afferent synaptic activity and consecutive
complex alterations of the basal ganglia network due to dopamine depletion
(Eidelberg et al., 1994). In our study, the increased lentiform PET signal
largely corresponded to the patient's putamen on the coregistered MRI indicating its particular contribution to the intense PET signal. While levodopa
application shifted this increased activity towards normal, it was obviously
unaffected by STN-DBS. This finding suggests that STN-DBS interferes with
basal ganglia motor loops in a more focal manner downstream of the putamen
as the basal ganglia's input structure, e.g. with the pallido-thalamic pathway.
No significant changes of local activity in the STN targets were observed
under effective stimulation, which does not, however, allow to draw direct
conclusions concerning the stimulation's mechanism of action on the cellular
level.
According to the model of frontostriatal circuitries proposed by
Alexander et al. (1990), surgery of subcortical targets is expected to change

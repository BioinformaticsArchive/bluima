synaptic cleft (Sherff and Carew, 1999). Our results might seem
especially surprising in light of the observation of Calabresi et al.
(1992) that LTD could be restored by acute application of DA in
DA-depleted rat striatum. However, it is well known that DA
depletion induces supersensitivity of DA receptors (Araki et al.,
2000), and this may facilitate activation of receptors that play key
roles in LTD induction. The difference in age of the animals in
the present study in relation to that of C alabresi et al. (1992)
might also contribute to the different results we have obtained.
It was reported previously that DA receptors can participate in
striatal long-term potentiation (LTP) (Wickens et al., 1996;
Calabresi et al., 1997; Centonze et al., 1999), and this observation
suggests that activation of DA receptors plays a role in synaptic
changes that may run counter to LTD. It is interesting to note that
induction of LTP required local, transient DA application in the
Wickens et al. (1996) study. The necessity for tight temporal and
spatial linkage of DA release with other events involved in the
induction of plasticity is intuitively attractive because the depression of synaptic transmission should only occur during coordinated activation of glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission
and possibly cholinergic transmission as well.
If nACh receptors facilitate LTD induction by stimulating DA
release, then the receptor subtypes that most likely play this role
are the 3 2 and 4 2 subtypes that are known to enhance
striatal dopamine release (Kulak et al., 1997; Sharples et al.,
2000). The observation that DH E inhibits LTD induction is
consistent with this idea, because this antagonist blocks 3-containing receptors in preference to those containing 7 (Brioni
et al., 1997). However, more extensive pharmacological studies
will be needed to determine the role of different nAChR subtypes
in striatal LTD. Interestingly, it has been reported that 7-containing nicotinic receptor activation can induce long-term
potentiation in the ventral tegmental area (Mansvelder and
McGehee, 2000). In this study, the 7 nicotinic receptors were
suggested to reside on presynaptic glutamatergic terminals. Re-cent evidence suggests the presence of 7-containing nicotinic
receptors on glutamatergic terminals in striatum, and it has been
suggested that these receptors indirectly modulate dopamine
release in striatal slices by enhancing glutamate release (Kaiser
and Wonnacott, 2000). However, we did not observe any evidence
for participation of this mechanism in striatal synaptic transmission in our preparation, because nAChR antagonists did not alter
pre-HFS glutamatergic transmission or PPR (Fig. 6) in the
present study.
Our findings may have significant clinical relevance, because
intake of nicotine may inadvertently reinforce the learning and
performance of motor sequences associated with smoking or
tobacco intake. Acute activation of striatal nAChRs during an
initial smoking session could lead to the onset of plasticity leading
to the reinforcement of smoking behaviors. In these individuals,
motor habits learned during a smoking session could be associated with increased release of DA and a stronger “reward” signal.
Alternatively, desensitization of nAChRs during continuous
smoking could disrupt normal LTD induction and affect normal
habit formation. Furthermore, our findings suggest potential co-operative effects between tobacco and cocaine on the expression
of synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum in humans.
It is important to note that we have examined the modulatory
role of nAChRs in LTD in the developing striatum and thus our
findings have implications for the onset and progression of habit
learning. Increases in nAChR density, in areas of the brain
including the striatum, occur in human smokers and rats chron-

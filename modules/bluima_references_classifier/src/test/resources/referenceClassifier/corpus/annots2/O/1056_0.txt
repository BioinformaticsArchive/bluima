(Fig. 5A). Insertion of a 10-bp sequence between the SOX and
POU binding sites of Nes30, or the swapping of these sites in
the 30-bp stretch, completely inactivated the core enhancer
(Fig. 5C), although individual proteins bound to these se-quences (Fig. 5B). Selective combinations of SOX and POU
proteins in transactivation through binding to their unique
configuration of the Nes30 sequence extend and confirm the
diverse regulatory functions generated by the combined action
of SOX and POU proteins binding to adjacent sites.
It is conceivable that there are various interactions between
SOX and POU proteins to elicit gene activation synergistically,
presumably employing different interfaces of the SOX and
POU proteins. In support of this model, recent crystallographic analysis of SOX2-POU complexes indeed indicates
recruitment of distinct interaction sites of SOX2 and Oct3/4,
depending on the binding site sequences (39, 55).

Abstract. Prion protein (PrP), which is involved in the pathogenesis of scrapie, occurs in 2 forms. The form
extracted from scrapie brain is protease resistant (PrP-res), whereas PrP from normal brain is protease sensitive
(PrP-sen). This study examined whether PrP-res could be detected in brains of sheep with scrapie by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A suitable IHC procedure was developed using brain tissue from hamsters that had
been inoculated with the transmissible mink encephalopathy agent. Tissue samples were fixed in PLP (periodate,
lysine, paraformaldehyde) that contained paraformaldehyde at a concentration of 0.125%. Before application
of the IHC technique, tissue sections were deparaffinized and treated with formic acid to simultaneously enhance
PrP-res immunoreactivity and degrade PrP-sen. Primary antibody was obtained from a rabbit immunized to
PrP-res extracted from brains of mice with experimentally induced scrapie. Brains from 21 sheep with histopathologically confirmed scrapie were examined by IHC. In all 21 brains, PrP-res was widely distributed
throughout the brain stem. Staining was particularly intense in neuronal cell bodies and around blood vessels.
The IHC technique successfully detected PrP-res in brain samples that had been frozen or that were severely
autolyzed before fixation in PLP. Brains from 11 scrapie-suspect sheep that were not considered histologically
positive were also examined by IHC. PrP-res was found in 4 of these brains. Sections of brains from 14 clinically
normal sheep did not have detectable PrP-res. Results of this study indicate that IHC detection of PrP-res is
equivalent, and perhaps superior, to histopathology for the diagnosis of scrapie in sheep. Furthermore, IHC is
applicable to tissues that have autolytic changes or processing artifacts that prevent satisfactory histopathologic
evaluation for lesions of scrapie.

that appears to be absent from astrocytes (Guillemin et al., 2001). In contrast,
microglial cells seem to contain very little KAT. It follows that under physiological conditions astrocytes account for the vast majority of cerebral KYNA
synthesis, whereas the competing L-KYN metabolism to quinolinate takes
place preferentially in microglial cells (see Guillemin et al., 2001 for discussion). This dichotomy is further accentuated in the diseased or injured brain,
which frequently shows structural and functional changes in glial cells. Thus,
microglial activation, which is seen after traumatic injury, infections and other
immunological impairments, results in substantial and often dramatic in-creases in brain 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinate levels but causes only
modest elevations in brain KYNA (Heyes et al., 1992, 1993). In contrast,
extracellular KYNA levels rise rapidly and substantially when astrocytes are
activated, for example following prolonged seizure activity (Steward et al.,
1991; Wu and Schwarcz, 1996) or cortical spreading depression (Kiss et al.,
2001), or in the early phases after an excitotoxic insult (Ceresoli-Borroni
et al., 1999). Notably, and in agreement with this concept, human astrocytomas produce more KYNA than quinolinate when exposed to L-KYN
(Vezzani et al., 1991).
In summary, the present study provides evidence that human astrocytes
produce KYNA, and that the characteristics and regulation of this process are
very similar to those that exist in rodents. In humans as in other mammals,
astrocyte-derived KYNA might therefore act as an inhibitory modulator of
catecholaminergic, glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission (Parsons
et al., 1997; Moroni, 1999; Erhardt et al., 2000, 2001a,b; Hilmas et al., 2001;
Stone, 2001). In pathological situations, in particular when their function
is up-regulated in localized areas of the brain, astrocytes can be expected
to efficiently deliver KYNA to the synapse to exert anticonvulsant or
neuroprotective effects (Scharfman et al., 1999). The demonstration that
human astrocytes can also form 7-Cl-KYNA from 4-Cl-KYN suggests that
they are capable of providing this potent glycine receptor antagonist in situ
B

when required for clinical benefit (cf. Lee and Schwarcz, 2001). The present
results should encourage appropriate assessment of these testable hypotheses
in humans before too long.

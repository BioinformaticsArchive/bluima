INTRODUCTION
Historically, metastatic melanoma has been highly resistant
to treatment. Single-agent chemotherapy regimens have produced response rates of 10 –20%, with median response durations of only 4 –5 months (1). DTIC3 remains the most active
single agent, with a response rate of approximately 20%, but the
majority of DTIC-induced responses are partial and transient (2,
3). Combination chemotherapy regimens have produced higher
response rates and apparent prolongations of median survival in
some single-institution Phase II trials, but large-scale Phase III
trials have failed to show significant benefits relative to DTIC
alone (4 – 8).
Immunotherapy, specifically IL-2 and/or IFN-α, has also
shown activity in metastatic melanoma (9, 10). High-dose bolus
IL-2 alone has produced responses in 15–20% of patients, with
5–10% of patients achieving durable complete remissions (11).
Similar response rates have been seen with single-agent IFN-α,
but the quality and durability of these responses have, in gen-

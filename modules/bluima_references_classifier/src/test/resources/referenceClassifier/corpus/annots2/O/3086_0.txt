the cells appeared healthy in the 6-OH DA-treated telencephalon,
and no debris or scars were observed (Fig. 7G,J ). These observations indicate that 6-OHDA treatment ablates lot cells without
affecting the other major cell population, although some loss of
Cajal-Retzius cells might be accompanied.
To determine whether the lot cell ablation affected guidance of
mitral cell axons, the telencephalon hemispheres cultured for 2 d
after 6-OHDA treatment were immunostained with antineuropilin-1 antibody. In the control telencephalon that had been
treated with vehicle solution, mitral cell axons grew on the lot cell
array and formed a L OT-like bundle during culture (Figs. 6 F,G,
7Eâ€“G). On the other hand, in all the 6-OH DA-treated telencephalons, mitral cell axons abruptly stalled in the piriform cortex
where lot cells were absent (Fig. 6 H,I ). In these specimens, a
small number of mitral cell axons occasionally strayed from the
other axons and grew for a short distance (Fig. 6 H). These axons
were associated with lot cells that remained after 6-OHDA treatment, and often connected to small islands of lot cells (Fig. 6 D).
The 6-OHDA treatment did not seem to toxically affect mitral
cells themselves, because mitral cell axons grew normally to the
point where lot cells were absent (Fig. 6 H,I ). Furthermore, when
the olfactory bulbs were treated directly with 6-OHDA and then
cultured on poly-lysine-coated culture dishes, neurite outgrowth
of the mitral cells occurred to the same extent as that in the
untreated olfactory bulbs (data not shown).

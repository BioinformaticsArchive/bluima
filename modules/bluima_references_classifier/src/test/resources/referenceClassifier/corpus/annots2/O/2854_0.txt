action of synaptojanin with the membrane has to be proposed.
Such behavior would be compatible with many other “mem- 9.
brane-interacting” proteins (e.g. protein kinase C (29)) and
“membrane-metabolizing” proteins (e.g. PtdIns-phospholipase 10.
C (30)) involved in regulatory processes. The ability of am- 11.
phiphysin to interact with synaptojanin and so tether it to
neurotransmitter granules may be a crucial element in the 12.

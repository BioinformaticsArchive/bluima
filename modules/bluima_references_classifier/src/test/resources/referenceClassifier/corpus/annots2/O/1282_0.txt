Prior to single staining of VGLUT2 or double-label staining with
VP or SV2 (a marker of synaptic vesicles and SLMVs) in the
neurohypophysis, sections were irradiated with microwave in
10 mm citrate solution (pH 6) for 5 min. In immunoperoxidase
staining, the sections were incubated in a guinea pig anti-rat
VGLUT2 serum (1 : 10 000, Sakata-Haga et al., 2001) for 15 h at
4 C and biotinylated secondary antibody (1 : 200; Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex.
Immunoreaction was visualized with 0.01% diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. To
explore whether VGLUT2 is localized in hormone-containing
granulated vesicles or SLMVs within neurosecretory terminals,
sections were incubated in a mixture of anti-VGLUT2 (1 : 10 000)
and a rabbit polyclonal anti-VP (1 : 20 000, Hisano et al., 1987) or
SV2 (1 : 20 000, developed by Dr K. M. Buckley and obtained
from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of
Iowa) for 15 h at 4 C, incubated in a mixture of Cy3-conjugated
donkey anti-guinea pig secondary antibody (1 : 100; Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA) and Alexa fluor-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (1 : 100; Chemicon) for 1 h at 37 C and
mounted with PermaFluore mounting medium (Thermo Shandon,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The sections were observed in a confocal
laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). All images taken
from these sections were adequately processed using Photoshop 5.5
software (Adobe System, San Jose, CA, USA).

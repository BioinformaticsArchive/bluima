Table 1 summarizes a statistical comparison of the logarithmic inputoutput regressions from sixteen cats before and during the effects of C02
(F-test, Snedecor (1956)). The slopes were either unchanged or increased
by 4% CO2. They did not change significantly (P > 0.05) during the
inhalation of 10 and 20 % C02 in sixteen of twenty cats where there was
full recovery. When control and recovery slopes were dissimilar, there was
in most cases also no decrease in slope when C02 was given.

Figure 10. A, The average (AVE.) number of geniculate ganglion cells innervating single
buds in the palate (P) is similar to the number innervating fungiform buds (F). B, The numbers
of taste buds per side in the fungiform lingual field (F) and in the palate (P) are equivalent. C,
Regions of the ganglion in which labeled neurons were counted after fungiform or palatal bud
injections (results in D). Each ganglion was mapped by dividing it into quadrants as follows: C,
central region (i.e., toward the brain); G, GSP region (at its origin); P, peripheral region (the
lateral ganglion); I, internal region. The locations are as follows: A, anterior; L, lateral; P, posterior; M, medial. The triangular quadrants were defined by lines connecting the midpoint of the
central surface of the ganglion (x) with the midpoint of the lateral surface (y) and the midpoint
of the surface adjacent to the facial nerve (z). Scale bar, 100 m. D, Topographic differences are
for the peripheral region (P), where fungiform-innervating neurons were more prevalent than
palate-innervating neurons, and the GSP region (G), where palatal neurons predominated. The
asterisk marks the GSP nerve, whereas the symbol marks the central (toward brain) corner of
the ganglia. VIIn marks the facial nerve. Error bars represent SDs.

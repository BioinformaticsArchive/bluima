DISCUSSION

We have isolated and characterized a gene, N27K, whose
expression is regulated both in mouse NS20Y cells by dbcAMP
and in mouse brain during development. N27K encodes a novel
form of the N23K protein (9), a precursor protein for the newly
discovered neuropeptide nociceptin, which resembles opioid
dynorphin A (10, 11). The expression of the N27K protein in
both NS20Y cells and mouse brain shows remarkable redistribution during development, suggesting that the protein has a
dual role as both a source for nociceptin in the mature brain
and a regulatory molecule during neuronal differentiation.
Nociceptin was identified as a ligand for an orphan hetero-

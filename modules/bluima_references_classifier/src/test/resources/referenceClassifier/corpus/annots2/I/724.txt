an extensive brain penetration may explain these results. Be-floxatone was shown to be very potent in inhibiting the rat
brain MAO-A activity (increase brain concentration of monoamines ED50 0.06 mg/kg, p.o.; decrease monoamine metabolites ED50 0.03 mg/kg, p.o.) (Curet et al., 1996).
In conclusion, the in vivo properties of befloxatone may bring
new insights for the therapeutic use of befloxatone. The knowledge of the brain pharmacokinetics of befloxatone may be of
great interest for a better control of the intensity and the duration of the enzyme inhibition. This, together with the determination of the dose of befloxatone that inhibits its target, may
lead to a better definition of the therapeutical doses. Moreover,
the competitivity of befloxatone binding to its target, demonstrated in vivo, tend to minimize the interaction with tyramine
absorbed with the food and thus to avoid the cheese effect in
patients, a major side effect of irreversible MAO inhibitors. All
these features may provide a significant improvement in the
therapeutic use of befloxatone.
The present article shows that in vivo [11C]befloxatone
enters readily the brain and binds to MAO-A in a potent,
selective, and reversible manner. Moreover, [11C]befloxatone
presents a very low, nonsaturable uptake and is metabolized
rather slowly. All these biochemical characteristics suggest
that [11C]befloxatone is a unique tool for the in vivo study of
MAO-A brain.

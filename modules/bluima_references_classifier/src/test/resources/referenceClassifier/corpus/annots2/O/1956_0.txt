commercially available ELISA kits from eBioscience per the instructions of the manufacturer.
Statistical analysis of data was performed using an
unpaired ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer post hoc
comparison. Data are represented as mean SD
(*p 0.001).
Proliferation assay. To assess effects of APP
crosslinking on cellular proliferation, we used
Cyquant NF cell proliferation assay (Invitrogen). Cells were stimulated overnight, and
the proliferation assay was performed ac- cording to the instructions of the manufacturer. Statistical analysis of data was performed
using an unpaired ANOVA with Tukey–
Kramer post hoc comparison. Data are represented as mean SD.
Cell viability assay. To determine cell viability after 24 h crosslinking stimulation, the cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

Stamper–Woodruff adhesion assay. To assess tissue adhesion, a modified
Stamper–Woodruff adhesion assay was used (Stamper and Woodruff,
1976). Briefly, serial aortic sections from apoE / , APP / , APP / , and
APP / (wild-type/control) aortas (40 m) were mounted onto subbed
slides, three aortas per background. Sections were incubated with/without 22C11 (anti-APP) or mouse IgG (isotype control) antibodies in PBS

solution (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2% FBS) for 1 h at room temperature to bind surface APP. Sections were rinsed with PBS solution before
a 1-h-long incubation with stimulated and labeled THP-1 cells (as described
above) at room temperature with gentle agitation (50 rpm). Sections were
rinsed three times with PBS solution, and adherent cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37°C. Images were captured using a Carl
Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope.
Quantification of adherent cells. Number of adherent cells was determined in a double-blinded manner by counting the number of cells adherent

SD values, and statistical significance was determined by unpaired ANOVA
with Tukey–Kramer post hoc comparison (*p 0.001).
Adhesion assay. To assess cell– cell adhesion, a monolayer of HUVECs
was plated in 96-well plates and then incubated with or without the
N-terminal anti-APP antibody or IgG isotype control to bind APP

and/or downregulate cell surface APP for 1 h at 37°C. HUVECs were then
incubated with a cell suspension of labeled THP-1 cells (as described
above) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by three rinses with ECM. Adhesion was
quantitated by measuring fluorescence of adherent (fluorescently la- beled) cells at 490 nm. Statistical analysis of data was performed using an

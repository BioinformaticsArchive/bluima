swallow-related in the cat interstitial nucleus lateral to the solitary
tract. The intermediate nucleus in the mid-NTS is rostral to the
interstitial nucleus, receives afferent projections from the glossopharyngeal nerve, and relays sensory information from the palate
and pharynx. The ventral and ventrolateral subdivisions of the NTS
receive pulmonary afferents (Kalia and Richter, 1985, 1988).
Kawai and Senba (1996) were able to maintain and study the
local circuitry of the caudal solitary nucleus in a rat thin-slice
preparation. They describe 3 different cell groups: (1) local circuit
neurons with axon collaterals restricted to the solitary nucleus but
with the main axon leaving the nucleus, (2) presumed interneurons
with axons restricted within the solitary nucleus, and (3) projection
neurons whose axons leave the nucleus. The projection neurons
have a somal surface area > 150 pLm2, whereas both the local circuit neurons and the putative interneurons have smaller cell bodies, < 150 pLm2. Projection neurons have few, if any, axonal collaterals, whereas both local circuit neurons and the putative interneurons have extensive arborization of their axonal collaterals.
Vagal and glossopharyngeal efferents to the oral cavity, pharynx,
and larynx have their cell bodies in the nucleus ambiguus (NA).
Furusawa et al. (1996) have shown that rat SLN efferents are localized
to a 1-mm segment of the NA between 1.5 and 2.5 mm rostral to the
obex. Bieger and Hopkins (1987) localized the PhN motoneuron pool
to the caudal aspect of the semicompact formation of the NA, whereas the SLN motoneuron pool is in the rostral aspect. Altschuler et al.
(1991) used cholera toxin-HRP to characterize pharyngeal efferent
neurons in the NA semicompact formation into 3 shapes: multipolar
(20-30 x 25-35 Rrm), oval (15-20 x 20-25 Rrm), and fusiform (15 x 30
Rm). Their functional significance is not clear.

proximately half that seen near body temperature, in agreement
with previous work (Guatteo et al., 2005). However, application
of isradipine (5 M) for 10 –15 min failed to significantly slow the
discharge rate at 25°C (control median, 0.67 Hz; plus isradipine,
0.78 Hz; n 4; p 0.05) (supplemental Fig. S1, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Again, this was
not because isradipine had failed to antagonize L-type channels,
because the SOPs were absent when the membrane patch was
disrupted to monitor transmembrane voltage (supplemental Fig.
S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
One interpretation of these results is that the dendrites or axon

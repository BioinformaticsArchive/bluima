Introduction
The deposition of aggregates of peptides or proteins in specific
organs or tissues is a key event in the pathogenesis of many de-generative diseases (Huff et al., 2003; Selkoe, 2003; Stefani and
Dobson, 2003). Such species, or their precursors, can be highly
cytotoxic, suggesting that they could play crucial roles in disease
pathogenesis (Conway et al., 2000; Goldberg and Lansbury, 2000;
Nilsberth et al., 2001; Bucciantini et al., 2002). In particular, disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes are characterized by the presence in the affected tissues of proteinaceous
fibrillar deposits (Kelly, 1998; Merlini and Westermark, 2004;
Selkoe, 2004). Such fibrils and their precursors result from
polypeptide chain misfolding, leading to the formation of or-dered polymeric assemblies built around a core of -sheet structure (Serpell et al., 2000; Tycko, 2004).

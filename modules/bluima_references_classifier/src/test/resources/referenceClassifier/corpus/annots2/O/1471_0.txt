FIG. 3. (A) Autoradiograph showing a time course of Us9 expression in BHV-1, BHV-5 Us9-1, and BHV-5. Virus-infected cell proteins
were labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine at 3 or 6 hpi. Cell monolayers were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium, and detergent extracts were prepared. Radiolabeled lysates were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Us9 antibody. After labeling and
washing of cell monolayers as above, 10-h chase samples (*) were further incubated for 10 h at 37Â°C in complete growth medium without labeled
cysteine and methionine. (B) Immunoblots showing BHV-1 and BHV-5 Us9 expression in untreated (PAA ) and PAA-treated (PAA ) BHV-1-,
BHV-5-, and BHV-5 Us9-1-infected cell lystaes. MDBK cells were infected with the viruses indicated above. Infected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Us9 antibody. Western blots containing immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Us9 antibody.

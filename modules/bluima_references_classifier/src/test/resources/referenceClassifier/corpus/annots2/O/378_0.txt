Mammalian brain development requires the transmission of electrical signals between neurons via the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) class of glutamate receptors. However, little is known about how NMDA
receptors carry out this role. Here we report the first
genes shown to be regulated by physiological levels of
NMDA receptor function in developing neurons in vivo:
NMDA receptor-regulated gene 1 (NARG1), NARG2, and
NARG3. These genes share several striking regulatory
features. All three are expressed at high levels in the
neonatal brain in regions of neuronal proliferation and
migration, are dramatically down-regulated during
early postnatal development, and are down-regulated
by NMDA receptor function. NARG2 and NARG3 appear
to be novel, while NARG1 is the mammalian homologue
of a yeast N-terminal acetyltransferase that regulates
entry into the Go phase of the cell cycle. The results
suggest that highly specific NMDA receptor-dependent
regulation of gene expression plays an important role in
the transition from proliferation of neuronal precursors
to differentiation of neurons.

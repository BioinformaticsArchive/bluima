three layers (Fig. 11A). Some of the CCK-IR cells in the
stratum oriens had long horizontal dendrites remaining in
the same layer (Fig. 7A). Beginning with the 8th postnatal
day, most of the intact CCK-IR dendrites crossed the hippocampus from the parent soma to the distal parts of the
strata radiatum or oriens. Dendrites reaching the border of
strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare often turned

3200-dpi resolution (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). DIG
signals were isolated by uniformly subtracting the counterstaining color component using Photoshop version 7.0.1.
(Adobe) and displayed in 8-bit grayscale without further correction (Fig. 3, B and D).
Immunocytochemical Analysis of CL1 and CL2 Expressed in
HeLa Cells and in Central Neurons—Cerebelli and hippocampi
were obtained from postnatal day 0 –1 ICR mice, and cerebellar
granule neurons and hippocampal neurons were cultured as
described before (39, 40). Plasmid transfection was carried out
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), at 0 day in vitro for cerebellar granule cells or at 9 days in vitro for hippocampal neurons, essentially as described (17, 41). About 48 h after
transfection, HeLa cells and neurons were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose/Ca2 /Mg2 -free phosphatebuffered saline (PBS( )) at 37 °C for 15 min, washed with 0.1 M
glycine/PBS( ) at room temperature. Blocking and permeabilization was carried out as described (11). Primary and secondary antibody reactions were performed overnight at 4 °C and 1 h
at room temperature, respectively. Antibodies used were:
rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
mouse anti- -tubulin monoclonal (Sigma), and Alexa488- or
Alexa555-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies
(Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescent images were acquired
using an Olympus DP-70 charge-coupled device camera (Fig. 4)
or a Zeiss LSM510META confocal microscope (Supplemental
Fig. S2). For the latter, maximal projection images were
obtained from z-stacks of 10 –15 confocal sections covering the
entire depth of cells within the field of view.
Luciferase Assay—Dual luciferase assay was carried out in
COS-7 cells essentially as described (17), except that 24-well
plates were used for assays and luciferase activities were monitored using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate reader (ThermoLabsystems), with EF1-Rluc as a control vector (42). CRE-luc, Gal4CREB, UAS-luc, and PKAcat constructs were from Stratagene.
An SRE-luc (3D.Aluc) vector was obtained from Richard
Treisman (Imperial Cancer Research Foundation). A V14Rho
expression vector was used as described (39). A lacZ expression
vector was created as a mock control in the pDEST26 backbone,
based on SinRep/LacZ (Invitrogen). CaMK4 C and CaMK2 C
were constructed in pIRES-EGFP vectors (Clontech) as de-scribed (43), based on CaMK4DA and CaMK2DA vectors (33)
kindly provided by Richard Maurer (Oregon Health and Sciences University). A full-length CBP cDNA (44) was obtained
from Akiyoshi Fukamizu (Tsukuba University), with permission from Marc Montminy (Salk Institute) and subcloned in-frame immediately downstream of Gal4-(1–147) in a mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid vector pM (Clontech) to yield a
Gal4-CBP vector. To construct TORC2-GFP, an open reading
frame of human TORC2 (OriGene clone TC107319) was subcloned by PCR into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). All point mutants were constructed using PCR and the
QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Gal4-CREB-DA
(pRc/RSV-GAL4-CREB ) and Gal4-CREB-WT (pRc/
DIEDML
RSV-GAL4-CREB) (45) were kind gifts of Richard Goodman
(Vollum Institute), and EF1-Rluc was kindly provided by Akiko
Tabuchi and Masaaki Tsuda (Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University).

Arcuate neurons project to several other hypothalamic
nuclei implicated in the control of energy balance, such as
the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the PFH, and other
regions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Cells in these
projection areas also bear receptors for leptin and insulin.
Thus, these hormones may act directly on cells in arcuate
projection areas. Of particular interest are LH=PFH neurons
containing orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone
(MCH). To our knowledge, the modulation of BSR by the
orexins or MCH has not been reported.
Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is another peptide implicated in the regulation of energy balance. Like
MCH and the orexins, it is produced by neurons that receive
input from the arcuate nucleus. Moreover, leptin administration can stimulate CRH release. Thus, we were interested
in determining whether CRH mediates the influence of
leptin on BSR. Our results12 do not support this hypothesis.
We found that administration of 5 Î¼g of CRH into a lateral
cerebral ventricle could indeed alter BSR, and, as was the case
with leptin, the influence of the peptide depended on
whether or not the rewarding effect was modulated by
chronic food restriction. However, the direction of the
changes in BSR produced by CRH administration was different than the direction of leptin-induced changes. In the
case of the restriction-insensitive sites, CRH shifted the
rate-frequency curves rightward. Such a decrease in reward
effectiveness is consistent with the results of studies in which
self-stimulation thresholds have been increased following
exposure to stressors.13 In contrast, CRH failed to significantly shift the rate-frequency curves at seven of eight
restriction-sensitive sites. The stability of the rewarding
effect of stimulating the restriction-sensitive sites in the
face of CRH administration could reflect insensitivity to
this peptide in the circuitry responsible for the rewarding
effect of stimulation at those loci. Alternatively, perhaps CRH
produced a weak reward potentiation that was just sufficient
to offset a stress-like reward-attenuating influence such as
that observed in the case of the restriction-insensitive sites.
One reason for entertaining the possibility of cancellation between opposing influences of CRH on BSR is the
striking result obtained at the remaining restrictionsensitive site. Large leftward curve shifts were seen at
this site, an effect indicative of reward potentiation and
opposite to the direction of the shifts seen in the case of
the restriction-insensitive sites. One might be tempted to
dismiss the single instance of a large leftward curve shift.
However, there are several reasons to think that the leftward
shift is meaningful. First, the rewarding effect of stimulating this site was unusually sensitive to the potentiating
effect of chronic food restriction: the restriction-induced
curve shifts were larger than those seen in any other
subject in our studies of the modulation of BSR by CRH,
leptin, and NPY. Second, a consistent effect of CRH was
observed on two separate occasions, once during a period of
ad libitum feeding and again following restriction-induced
weight loss.

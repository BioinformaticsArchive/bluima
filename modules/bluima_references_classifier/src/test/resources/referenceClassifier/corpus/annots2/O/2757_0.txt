Figure 4. Effect of myelination on ax-onal area and neurofilament accumulation. Top, The cross-sectional areas of
axons at the 700 μm level ( filled circles),
the percentage (X ) of myelinated axons
(see Fig. 3), and the number of neurofilaments ( filled triangles) in the total
population of axons was determined.
The cross-sectional areas (μm2) of my-elinated ( filled circles; n = 3632) and
unmyelinated (open circles; n = 6098)
axons were determined from electron
micrographs at 20,000× (bottom). Neurofilament numbers in 829 myelinated
(open squares) and 1676 unmyelinated
( filled squares) axons of caliber sizes
representative of the total optic nerve
population were determined at the 700
μm axonal level, also included (bottom).
SEs are negligible (see Fig. 3). At all
postnatal ages, the neurofilament numbers and axonal areas between myelinated and unmyelinated axons differ
significantly (Wilcoxon/Kruskal–Wallis,
p = 0.01– 0.001).

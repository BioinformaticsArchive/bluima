It is not known whether the visual cortex,
particularly the extrastriate areas, will prove
of comparable importance in deep collicular
function in other species. This is particularly
so for primates, in which frank visual responses are less robust and presaccadic activity
less dependent on visual input than seems
true for deep-layer cells in the cat (20, 22,
28, 5 1, 54, 60, 72, 80, 93). The similarities
between feline and primate corticotectal or-ganization are nonetheless striking. As in the
cat, extrastriate areas in monkeys project to
deeper tectal layers than does the striate
cortex (21), and may therefore contact deeplayer cells directly. Corticotectal cells in the
visual cortex of the macaque are driven by
the “Y-like” (magnocellular) geniculocortical
stream (74), and silencing these cells (73, 75)
effectively eliminates the visual responses of
deep collicular neurons (75). Finally, collicular ablation abolishes saccades evoked by
electrical stimulation of the parieto-occipital
cortex in the monkey (41, 7 l), just as it does
in the cat. These parallels identify the role of
the visual cortex, especially that of the ex-trastriate areas, in colliculo-oculomotor function as a promising avenue for further re-search.

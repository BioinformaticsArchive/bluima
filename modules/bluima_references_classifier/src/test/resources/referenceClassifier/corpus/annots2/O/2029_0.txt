Figure 1. Whole-brain homotopic RSFC pattern. A multiple linear regression models the mean of VMHC at each voxel. One-sample tests on the individual VMHC values were performed. Correction
for multiple comparisons was performed within one hemisphere (only one correlation for each pair of homotopic voxels) based on Gaussian random field theory (minimum Z 2.3; cluster level, p
0.05, corrected). The final statistical maps are visualized as six hemispheric surfaces (cortical regions) and six symmetric axial slices (subcortical regions) for both 6 mm FWHM (A) and 0 mm FWHM
(B) spatial smoothing preprocessing strategies.

in a wide range of frequencies from < 10 kHz
to > 100 kHz. As in many different species of
mammals, the male mustached bats tend to
be slightly larger than the females and their
sounds are slightly lower in frequency than
those of females.
Sounds produed by males and females in
many species are commonly different in frequency and/or structure. But a difference in
the auditory system between males and fe-males has been found only in the tree frog,
Elentherodactylus coqui. The communication sound of the male tree frog consists of
two notes: “Ko” and “Ki,” which are respectively emitted for territorial maintenance
and female attraction. The male's ear is sensitive to the low-frequency note Ko, but not
to the high-frequency note Ki. In contrast,
the female's ear is sensitive to Ki, but not to
Ko (9). This is the best example of sexual
dimorphism of the auditory system. It
should also be noted that in the zebra finch,
the auditory response of the vocal system
is quite different between males and fe-males (29).

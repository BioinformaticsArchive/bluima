The level of in vivo formation of macromolecular
adducts of EF5 depends on the degree of oxygen
depletion and the redox state of a tissue. Since the
temporal threshold (290 min) for eliciting a significant increase in EF5 adduct formation coincides with
the duration of HI required to cause subsequent
cerebral infarction, the presence of EF5 adducts in
cells, at times much earlier than methods demonstrate apoptotic and necrotic cell death, may serve as
an early marker of regional cellular vulnerability and
disrupted redox state (abnormal mitochondrial
function) after neonatal HI.

detection limit. In contrast, 3 of the 4 patients with normal
ICP showed values within the normal range (Figure 1). In
previous works (Molins et al 1991; Catalan et al 1994) we
hypothesized that the thinning of the cerebral cortex
caused by increased ICP or prolonged ventricular dilatation could explain the reduced brain neuropeptide levels in
these patients. The present study provides evidence that
the ICP alterations contribute to neuropeptide reduction,
and consequently are implicated in the neuronal dysfunction occurring in ACHS.
In conclusion, although we cannot attribute to CCK-8 a
role in the specific clinical alterations of ACHS patients,
we believe that the octapeptide CSF levels, together with
NPY and SOM, should be included in the neurochemical
profile of ACHS. Neuropeptide basal values can be useful
for evaluating brain damage, such as that coming from ICP
alterations. With the values obtained after surgery, studies
on the degree of parallelism between clinical improvement
and biochemical recuperation may be performed. CSF
analysis carried out during the postsurgery period can
provide valuable information on the contribution of bioactive peptides to different neuronal dysfunctions, and
may prove to be a valuable model in neuropeptide re-search.

iv) plus L-NAME (6 mg/kg iv) in rats microinjected with
vehicle into the DMN did not influence gastric lesions
induced by 60% ethanol (Fig. 5).
Effect of RX-77368 microinjected into the DMN on
PGE2 ZeueZsin gastricperfusate. The PGEZ output in the
gastric lumen was increased from basal levels of 180 t
20 to 280 * 50 pg/30 min at 30 min after microinjection
of RX-77368 (3 ng) into the DMN (Fig. 6). At 60 min,
values were still maintained elevated, although the
difference compared with basal or saline group was no
longer significant. There was no change in the PGEZ
output (pg/30 min) after microinjection of saline into
the DMN (basal: 150 t 30; 30 min: 140 t 40; 60 min:
120 * 30) (Fig. 6).

abolish the synchronous discharges (i.e., high-voltage spindles) of
genetically prone rats (Buzsaki et al., 1988). Also, work using
thalamic slices has shown that when thalamic GABAA receptors
are blocked, GABAB-mediated responses are observed (von
Krosigk et al., 1993; Bal et al., 1994). This seems to be caused
primarily by a reduction of intra-nRT inhibition (Huntsman et al.,
1999), resulting in the production of longer and higher frequency
bursts in nRT neurons. Bursting in nRT produces long-lasting
GABAB-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in thalamic
relay neurons (Kim and McCormick, 1998), resulting in reboundbursts at ;3 Hz. Logically, blockage of thalamic GABAB receptors results in the abolition of the 3 Hz synchronous oscillatory
activity.
A surprising result of thalamic disinhibition was the occurrence
of 12 Hz discharges. They occurred either during GABAA receptor block or complete disinhibition. Under the conditions during
which 12 Hz discharges appeared, the nRT could be f unctionally

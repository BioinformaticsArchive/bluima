RESULTS
Optical odor maps obtained from intrinsic signal
imaging in the anterior PC
Odor-induced cortical activation appeared in a narrow
band beneath the rhinal sulcus over the LOT (“a” in Fig.
2A), which was defined as the dorsal part of the aPCd in
the rat PC (Haberly, 1998; Ekstrand et al., 2001). Differential images demonstrated optical response to 1.0% AA
(“c” in A) but no response to mineral oil (“b” in A). Black
spots calculated to be significant (P 0.05) are superimposed on the image (“a” in A) of the surface and blood
vessels (“d” in A).

Extracellular recordings were made from single neurons in the CeA
with glass insulated carbon filament electrodes (3–5 M ) using the
following stereotaxic coordinates (cf. Paxinos and Watson 1998):
1.6–3.2 mm caudal to bregma; 3.8–4.4 mm lateral to midline; depth
of 7,000 –9,000 m. The recorded signals were amplified and displayed on analog and digital storage oscilloscopes. Signals were also
fed into a window discriminator, whose output was processed by an
interface (CED 1401) connected to a Pentium III PC. Spike2 software
(CED, version 3) was used to create peristimulus rate histograms
on-line and to store and analyze digital records of single-unit activity
off-line. Spike size and configuration were continuously monitored on
the storage oscilloscopes and with the use of Spike2 software.
CeA neurons were orthodromically activated by electrical stimulation (square-wave current pulses, 50 –500 A, 150 s; monopolar
stimulation electrode) in the ipsilateral pons, using the stereotaxic
coordinates that correspond to the lateral pontine parabrachial area,
where the monosynaptic connections of the spino-ponto-amygdaloid
pain pathway to the CeA originate (Bernard et al. 1993, 1996): 1–2
mm rostral to the lambda and 2.2 mm lateral to midline at the depth
of 7.3 mm. We refer to the activity evoked by these orthodromic
electrical stimuli as parabrachial input for simplicity. Once an individual CeA neuron was identified and its spike size optimized, we
carefully searched for a receptive field in the knee joint(s) and determined size and threshold of its total receptive field in the deep tissue
and skin.
Configuration, shape, and height of the recorded action potentials
were monitored and recorded continuously using a window discriminator and Spike2 software for on-line and off-line analysis. Only
those neurons were included in this study whose spike configuration
remained constant and could be clearly discriminated from background activity throughout the experiment, indicating that the activity
of one neuron only and from the same one neuron was measured.

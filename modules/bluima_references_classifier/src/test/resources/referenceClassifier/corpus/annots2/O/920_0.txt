embryonic to the adult AA-NAT transcription pattern,
in 7–11-day-old embryos, all three melatonin receptor
transcripts (mel-1a, mel-1b, and mel-1c) were ob-served in the pineals, without consistent modifications
of the band intensity. In the adult pineal, a single
mature AA-NAT transcript was present as well as all
three melatonin receptor transcripts, usually with preferential expression of the mel-1a band. The transition
time from the embryonic to adult AA-NAT expression
pattern coincides well with the acquisition of functional
activity and the appearance of melatonin synthesis in
the embryonic pineal reported for chicken, as related to
quail. We suggest that the change in transcription
pattern of the AA-NAT gene may reflect another, still
unknown mechanism of regulating AA-NAT activity
during ontogenesis, at the level of mRNA processing,
whose specificity (or not) for embryonic development
we wish to establish in the future. Mol. Reprod.

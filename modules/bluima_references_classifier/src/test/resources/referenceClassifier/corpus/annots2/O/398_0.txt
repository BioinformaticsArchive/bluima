courses of [C apre]t and fEPSP in response to the manipulation of extracellular C a 2+ concentration ([C a 2+]o ) in a typical experiment. At the
end of each experiment, two glutamate receptor antagonists, C NQX and
APV, were routinely applied to isolate the stimulation artifact and presynaptic fiber volley. This allows subtraction of the stimulation artifact
and presynaptic fiber volley from the raw recording trace for a more

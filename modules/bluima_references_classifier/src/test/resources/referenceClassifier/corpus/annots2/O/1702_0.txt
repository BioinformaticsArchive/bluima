Schizophrenia is a disease of disordered thought
processes and, as such, is a fundamentally human
disease. Although the MAG knockout mouse model
cannot be expected to show the behavioural deficits
observed in the human disease, it can still provide a
vehicle for studying the morphological and anatomical abnormalities that may result from a genetic
abnormality known to be linked with schizophrenia.
All research performed on mice was approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
We are currently examining the repercussions of
deficient myelination resulting from absence of the
MAG gene on the morphology of pyramidal neurons
in the frontal cortex of mice at different developmental

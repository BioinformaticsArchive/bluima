hippocampal region showing intermediate or high
levels of signal include the subiculum, presubiculum
and parasubiculum.
Resides the hippocampal region, several other
allocortical regions were enriched in m2 MChR
mRNA. Intense signals were seen over the insular,
anterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Weak
signals were observed in some amygdaloid nuclei, viz.
the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract and the
basolateral amygdaloid nucleus.
In the neocortex, a bilaminar pattern was observed
in most regions, with high levels of hyb~d~tion
signal over layer IV and outer part of layer VI.
Transcripts for m2 MChR were prominent all
along the brainstem. Several nuclei of the reticular
formation presented moderate to high levels of
hybridization. In a rostrocaudal progression, these
include the deep mesencephalic nucleus, the oral and
caudal parts of the pontine reticular nucleus, pedunculopontine, anterior and ventral tegmental nuclei,
retic~o~~~l nucleus of the pons, gigantocellular, gigantocellular pars cL,paragigantocellular

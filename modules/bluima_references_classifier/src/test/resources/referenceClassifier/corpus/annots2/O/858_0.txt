DISCUSSION

The auditory cortex of the rat consists of several distinct
cytoarchitectonic zones situated in the posterolateral neocortex. On the basis of cytoarchitectural differences and
patterns of thalamocortical connections, Patterson ( 1977 )
subdivided the auditory cortex into an area characterized
by a proliferation of granular cells in layer IV, which he
termed “core cortex,” and a surrounding, less granular re--gion principally on the lateral and caudal borders, termed
“belt cortex.” The core-belt regions correspond approximately with primary-secondary cortex or area 41-36 and
20 of Kreig ( 1946) or Tel-Te2 and Te3 of Zilles ( 1990).
Using the method of Fink and Heimer ( 1967 ) for staining
degenerating axons and terminals, and retrograde axonal
transport of horseradish peroxide (HRP), it has been demonstrated that the ventral division of the medial geniculate
body (MGB) projects almost exclusively to core cortex, the
shell nuclei consisting of the dorsal division, the caudal di-vision, the ventrolateral nucleus, and the marginal zone
project topographically to the belt cortex, and the medial
division projects diffusely to core cortex and possibly re-gions of belt cortex as well. The present data suggest that
these anatomic distinctions between core and belt cortex
are directly reflected in the neurogenesis of spatially overlapping short-latency components of the MAEP complex.
The first cortical response to either auditory click stimulation or direct electrical stimulation of the MGB is a brief
positive epicortical potential. Previous laminar studies of
the MAEP in rat area 41 have suggested that this early positivity is the result of deep depolarization of the supragranular pyramidal cells, resulting in a passive current source and
positive extracellular potentials at the cortical surface
(Barth and Di 1990). The initial positive component of the
evoked potential therefore probably reflects the initial excitatory response of the middle cortical layers, mediated either
directly through monosynaptic connections of thalamocortical fibers at proximal regions of the supragranular pyramidal cells or indirectly through similar excitatory connections on layer IV stellate cells. This conclusion is in good
agreement with the known terminations of fibers from the
dorsal and ventral divisions of the MGB in layer IV and the
lower part of layer I (Kelly 1990; Patterson 1977; Ryugo
and Killackey 1974; Vaughan 1983 ) . Spatial distributions
of the early positive response therefore most likely represent the location and extent of populations of cells within
auditory cortex receiving direct thalamocortical afferent
fibers.
Epicortical distributions of the early positive response to
electrical stimulation of the MGB conform closely to the
parallel connections between this nucleus and core and belt
cortex. With MGv stimulation, the cortical response is concentrated in the rostra1 and ventral region of the recording
array, in the approximate location of area 41. Stimulation
of the MGd results in a systematic shift of the surface positive response to a more caudal and dorsal location of the
array, centered on the approximate region of area 36. The

Open field behavior was measured and correlated with TPH2 in a
previously published study (Hiroi et al., 2006); 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B
mRNA from the same animals were analyzed in the present study.
Behavior in the open field was tested 2 weeks after capsule
implantation using a start box procedure (Hoplight et al., 2005).
Briefly, animals were tested using a 100 cm square black Plexiglas enclosure with 30 cm tall walls under a low-illumination red
light to simulate darkness and minimize stress levels. After a
pre-test acclimation of at least 30 min in the testing rooms, animals were placed in a closed 9 12 cm start box located on one of
the walls of the open field. After a 2-min acclimation period rats
were allowed access to the arena and latency to exit the start box
was recorded. Behavioral data in the OFT were collected for 10
min (SMART video tracking software, San Diego Instruments, San
Diego, CA, USA). In an OFT arena, center time is considered a
reliable index of anxiety, responds to anxiolytic agents (Ramos et
al., 1997), and is sensitive to stress-induced anxiety states (Pare,
1994; Izumi et al., 1997; Durand et al., 1999). There are also
number of studies examining corner time in the open field (Po-horecky et al., 1989a,b; Bouwknecht et al., 2007; Clark et al.,
2007; Anderson and Hughes, 2008) and we have shown, using
the same apparatus, that diazepam increases center time and
decreases the corner time in the open field (Hoplight et al., 2005).
We quantified the following parameters: percent time spent in the
center and corners of the OFT arena (anxiety-like behavior) and
total distance traveled (overall locomotor activity). Animals were
briefly narcotized with CO2 before decapitation, and the brains
were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at 70 Â°C.

7.5, 8.0, or 8.5]), and the most efficient pH for protein elution (7.5) was selected.
The fractions containing proteins from the column were collected and subjected
to SDS-PAGE and far-Western analysis using the p24 probe as described above.
Microsequence analysis. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were stained for protein with
Ponceau S (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), and the 30- and 26-kDa bands
were excised. The N-terminal sequence of the protein in the excised membrane
was analyzed by Biologica Co., Tokyo, Japan. A basic local alignment search tool
search (1) of the nonredundant protein database at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information was used to identify sequences homologous to those
obtained by amino acid sequencing.
Plasmid construction. The BDV cDNA expression plasmids used for mammalian two-hybrid analysis were generated as follows. BDV cDNAs corresponding to BDV p24 open reading frames were amplified with sense (5'-TGC GGA
TCC GTA TGG CAA CGC GAC CAT CGA GTC-3) and antisense (5'-TTG
ACG CGT TTA TGG TAT GAT GTC CCA TTC AT-3') primers using sample
RNA from MDCK cells persistently infected with BDV (MDCK/BDV) (17) by
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The PCR products were digested with
BamHI and MluI and were cloned into vectors for the two-hybrid assay, pBIND
and pACT (Promega, Madison, Wis.), and were designated GAL4-p24 and
VP16-p24, respectively. To generate GAL4-p40 and VP16-p40, the entire BDV
p40 cDNA sequence was digested from pcDL-N. Wild (23) and was cloned into
the BamHI and KpnI sites of pBIND and pACT. Rat amphoterin cDNA was
amplified with sense (5'-TAC GGA TCC GTA TGG GCA AAG GAG ATC
CTA AG-3') and antisense (5'-TCG ACG CGT CAT GCG TAG AAC CAA
CTT ATT CA-3') primers using RNA from C6 cells by RT-PCR. The resulting
cDNA was cloned into the two-hybrid vectors digested with BamHI and KpnI
and was designated GAL4-APT and VP16-APT.
Mammalian two-hybrid assay. COS-7 cells were transfected with luciferase
reporter plasmid, pG5luc (Promega), and test plasmids (1.0 μg) using TransFast
transfection reagent (Promega) in six-well culture plates. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer for 15 min at room
temperature. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 s, the cell extracts were
assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Immunoprecipitation assay. OL cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged
amphoterin (pcD-APT/FLAG) and p24 expression (pP-wild) plasmids. The construction of pP-wild is described elsewhere (46). At 48 h posttransfection, transfected cells were labeled for 6 h in methionine-free Eagle's medium with 150 μCi
of [35S]methionine per ml. After labeling, the cells were lysed by freeze-thaw
cycling in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet
P-40, and 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG MAb for 2 h at 4°C, and
the precipitates were then recovered by incubation with protein G-agarose beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.) for 2 h at 4°C. After thorough washing, proteins bound to the agarose beads were separated by SDSPAGE as described previously (23, 46).
Neurite outgrowth and transfilter migration assays. The culture plates were
coated with the indicated amounts of laminin (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 4°C
overnight. The wells were then washed twice with PBS and blocked with 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA). After FCS starvation for 2 h, the BDV-infected or
uninfected cells were cultured on plates in serum-free DMEM at 37°C for 3 to
4 h to induce outgrowth or extension of the cells. The cells were then fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.05% toluidine blue or hematoxylin, and
proportions of neurite-bearing cells (processes longer than 1 diameter of the cell
soma) in at least four independent fields were counted under a light microscope
(Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan). To determine the viability of cells during the assay,
trypan blue or Hoechst staining was also performed in the C6 cells cultured with
purified p24 protein and antiamphoterin antibody.
The migration assay was carried out in Transwell chambers (filter pore size, 12
μm; Corning Costar) essentially as described previously (15). Briefly, the lower
surface of the filter was coated with the indicated amounts of laminin at 4°C
overnight. The filter was washed twice with PBS and blocked with BSA. Cells
were placed in the upper chamber at 2 × 105 cells/ml and were cultured for 6 h
or overnight. After fixing with cold methanol, the cells were stained with 0.05%
toluidine blue and removed from the upper surface of the filter. The cells that
had migrated to the lower surface were then examined under a light microscope.
Photomicrographs were taken with a Fujix digital camera HC-300Zi (Nikon Co.),
and five independent fields per filter were measured for the proportion of
migrated cells in the observation fields using MacScope software (MITANI Co.,
Fukui, Japan).
Rat amphoterin expression and antibody production. A baculovirus expression system encoding for rat amphoterin protein was prepared as follows. A

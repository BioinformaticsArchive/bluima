Effects of antibodies specific to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
subunits on N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced seizure
Intravenous infusion of NMDA into mice produced convulsions followed by death. The seizure threshold of NMDA was
approximately 210 mg/kg (i.v.). An i.c.v. pretreatment with
antibodies specific to carboxyl-terminal region of the NMDA
receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) one and three
days before treatment with NMDA produced a significant
increase in the seizure threshold of NMDA [Fig. 2; Day 1:
P , 0.05 (NR1, NR2B), P , 0.01 (NR2A)/Day 3 P , 0.001
(NR1, NR2A and NR2B)]. However, these effects of the antibodies were reversed and were not seen at five days after
pretreatment.

shorter than in the center. Because the GCV-transgenic group
had a much smaller molecular layer than the control group and
because this layer was relatively poor in astrocytes, the bias again
would be toward minimizing the difference between the two
groups. It is also possible that the loss of astrocytes produced by
GCV treatment is compensated partially by a decrease in the
extent of natural cell death that occurs during this period
(Krueger et al., 1995). Additionally, because the half-life of GCV
in blood is <1 hr (Paul and Dummer, 1992) and the half-life of the
phosphorylated-GCV is slower but still <24 hr (Biron et al.,
1985), there could be replenishment by proliferation of reactive
astrocytes. These considerations suggest that the ;50% decrease
in astrocyte numbers observed at P19 in treated animals is a
minimal estimate of the initial loss. Compounding the effects of
astrocyte loss, some of the surviving astrocytes may have been
dysfunctional. Such a sublethal effect was demonstrated recently
in a transgenic study of TK expression in thyroid follicular cells
(Wallace et al., 1994).
Although a clear decrease in astrocyte numbers by P19 was
demonstrated, immunostaining for GFAP was not diminished at
this time. This is likely attributable to the upregulation of GFAP
levels and hypertrophy of the remaining astrocytes. Preliminary

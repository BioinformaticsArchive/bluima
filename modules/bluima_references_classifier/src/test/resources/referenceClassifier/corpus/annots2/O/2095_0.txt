The descending serotonergic fibers that
originate from the nucleus raphe, proceeding
to the spinal dorsolateral funiculus, and
terminating on the enkephalinergic neurons
are associated with pain regulation (9-11).
It is, therefore, evident that the spinal
serotonergic system mediated the antinoci
ceptive of morphine (12-14) and its exci
tation elevates the nociceptive threshold (15).
A previous study suggested that the peripheral

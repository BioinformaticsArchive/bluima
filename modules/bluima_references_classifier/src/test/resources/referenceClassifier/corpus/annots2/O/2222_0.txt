Pathway
When the stumps of the h.n. and c.p. nerves were anastomosed, axons from the
regenerated h.n. were able to reinnervate the original end-plates of the c.p. muscle
via the neural tubes of the degenerated original nerve. Stimulation of the h.n. in these
preparations evoked an action potential in 90 % of the fibres examined. The
characteristics of the synapses formed by the h.n. in this series differed from those
formed by hypoglossal axons which had grown across the muscle fibres examined in
our previous study (Sayers & Tonge, 1982; and see Fig. 6). The mean value of m was
significantly higher while the mean latency between hypoglossal nerve stimulation
and the onset of the e.p.p.s was approximately halved. These results suggest that the
pathway taken by the regenerated hypoglossal axons may influence the efficiency of
the synapses formed.

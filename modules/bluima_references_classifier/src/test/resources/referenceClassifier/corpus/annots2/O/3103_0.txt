progenitor cells or dendritic cells can both be generated at
an effective efficiency of 100% for the second gene. Here
transduction with the vector is combined with flow cytometry allowing GFP-positive cells to be sorted from the
untransduced population. Such completely transduced
populations of quiescent CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor
and dendritic cells cannot easily be achieved by other
means, and might thus allow experimental or therapeutic
protocols to be carried out requiring high-level transduction
which would not otherwise be possible. Such an approach
using HSV vectors might also be applicable to other cell
types for which transduction is as yet unreliable or of low
efficiency.

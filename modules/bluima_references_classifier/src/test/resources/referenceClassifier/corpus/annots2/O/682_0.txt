not influence amyloid-beta-42 production. Furthermore,
aspirin did not affect amyloid-beta-42 at the highest concentrations tested171 yet was almost as effective as other
NSAIDs in the Cache County and Baltimore studies. The
Cache County and other studies showed significant effects
of aspirin in reducing AD risk accounted for over-thecounter use, in contrast to the Rotterdam study, which did
not find an effect of aspirin and was largely weighted by
prescription NSAIDs.172
Animal models support these effects of NSAIDs. Oral
ibuprofen attenuated neurodegeneration in APP transgenic
mice173 and lowered amyloid-beta-42 levels relative to
amyloid-beta-40 in vivo171,173 and in vitro.171 We do not
know of studies on aspirin in AD transgenic mice.
One possible molecular mechanism for the proposed
beneficial effects of NSAIDs is their ability to inhibit IL-1 â€“induced IL-6 release from human astrocytes in culture.174
One of their targets, the ligand-activated nuclear receptor
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR ), might
also mediate the potential central antiinflammatory effects of
NSAIDs in AD. PPAR agonists inhibit Ab-stimulated production of IL-6 and TNF- by microglia.175 In addition,
PPAR- -induced inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase can prevent cytokine-induced apoptotic cell death.176

extent (Brown et al., 2005; Izquierdo et al., 2006). Furthermore, stressed males and females showed comparable
attenuation of weight gain, suggesting comparable stressfulness of the manipulation.
The stress-induced increase in apical dendritic length
in females was dependent on estradiol: females with either
sham ovariectomy or ovariectomy plus estradiol replacement demonstrated the stress-induced increase in apical
dendritic length, whereas ovariectomy without estradiol
replacement prevented the stress-induced increase in apical dendritic length. Vaginal lavages performed at the time
of euthanasia indicated that the majority (approximately
83%) of the sham rats were in the diestrous stage at the
time of perfusion. Thus, even the low levels of circulating
estradiol present during this phase are enough to support
the stress-induced dendritic hypertrophy seen in females.
Importantly, ovariectomy failed to produce the male pattern
of stress effects (a marked reduction in apical branch
number and length). Thus, while the stress-induced hypertrophy in females is estradiol-dependent, removal of estradiol is not permissive of the male pattern of stress-induced
changes.
The sex difference in stress-induced dendritic changes
in mPFC is consistent with the sex-dependent stress ef-fects described in other brain regions. For instance, several studies have shown that chronic stress produces re-traction of apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in hippocampal area CA3 (Galea et al., 1997) and decreased spine
density on pyramidal cells in hippocampal area CA1
(McLaughlin et al., 2005) in male rats. The same chronic
stressor does not affect apical or basilar dendritic length of
neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in females
(Galea et al., 1997), and results in altered spine morphology but no change in spine density on CA1 pyramidal cells
(McLaughlin et al., 2005). Just as the preceding studies
indicate that stress effects vary across hippocampal re-gions in both male and female rats, recent studies suggest
both regional and hemispheric variations in the magnitude
and patterns of stress-induced dendritic alterations in
mPFC subregions, and such variations may have implications for psychopathology (Perez-Cruz et al., 2007, 2009;
Cz√©h et al., 2008). Although beyond the scope of the
present study, future studies should assess the potential
for sex-dependent differences is these regional and hemispheric variations in mPFC stress effects on dendritic
morphology.
Furthermore, Experiment 2 demonstrated that estradiol is permissive of the stress-induced dendritic hypertrophy in mPFC of female rats, an effect that is again consistent with the hippocampal literature. For example, the sex
difference in chronic stress-induced dendritic retraction in
hippocampal area CA3 is estradiol-dependent (McLaughlin et al., 2005). In addition, acute stress-induced reductions in spine density in area CA1 of the hippocampus in
females are correlated with circulating levels of estradiol,
with acute stress occurring during the low-E diestrus 2
phase producing greater reductions in spine density
(Shors et al., 2001). This could be seen as contrasting with
the present findings, in which animals, most of which were

in abilities that have been linked to functioning in the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, such as the calibration of
risk and reward (Box 1).
In addition, adolescence appears to be a time of
improved connectivity between regions of the prefrontal
cortex and several areas of the limbic system, a restructuring that further affects the ways in which individuals
evaluate and respond to risk and reward [22,29]. Whether
and to what extent these changes in brain structure and
function are linked to processes of pubertal maturation is
not known. Some aspects of brain development are
coincident with, and likely linked to, neuroendocrinological changes occurring at the time of puberty, but others
appear to take place along a different, and later, timetable.
Disentangling the first set from the second is an important
challenge for the field [9]. It is also important to note that
there are relatively few studies of developmental changes
in brain function (as opposed to structure) in adolescence,
and that conclusions about the putative links between
changes in cognitive performance and changes in brain

23516 Phosphorylation of Tau by Brain Proline-directed Kinase
TABLEI
Sequence determinationof tryptic phosphopeptides derived from tau
The amino acid sequence of each phosphopeptide was determined as described under "Materials and Methods." Yield, indicates pmol of
PTH-amino acid derivative released after each cycle; X , represents the residue whose PTH-derivative could not be identified. The amount of
radioactivity released in each cycle was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter.

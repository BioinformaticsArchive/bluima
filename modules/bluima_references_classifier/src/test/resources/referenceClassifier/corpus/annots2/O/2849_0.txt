specific amino acids13,21,39,43,57,70 probably contribute to increased intracellular neuronal calcium
levels following experimental TBI14,45 and cerebral
ischemia.65 Although relative contributions of
various calcium-regulated enzymes, including
kinases,7,75,77 phosphatases41 and phospholipases,46
to cytoskeletal damage are not known, several lines
of evidence suggest that pathological activation of
the calcium-activated neutral proteases, calpains,40,59 may play a major role in the calcium
cascade of neuronal cytoskeletal degeneration following acute brain injuries in vivo (for review, see
Refs 3, 24, 54 and 74). Degradation of cytoskeletal
proteins, including neurofilaments,48,49,62 microtubuleassociated protein-2 (MAP-2)27 and spectrin (a
membrane skeletal protein),56 all of which are
preferred substrates of calpain, and the appearance
of putative calpain breakdown products (BDPs) to
neurofilaments53 and spectrin58 strongly implicate
the involvement of the intracellular cysteine
protease, calpain, in experimental brain injury. Two
known isoenzymes of calpain exist in the CNS.

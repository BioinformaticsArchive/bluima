(V)) in accordance with previous reports using rat, hamster, and mouse (Fig. 5C, D) (Bartel et al., 2007;
Ganchrow, 2007; Gill et al., 1999; Halsell et al., 1996;
Harrer and Travers, 1996; Whitehead, 1988, 1990; Whitehead et al., 1993; Zaidi et al., 2008) and numbers of
labeled neurons in these regions were quantified. Re-peated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main ef-fect of region (F[3,33] 57.69, P 0.01). Post hoc analysis
(Tukey's test) demonstrated that numbers of labeled neurons in the RC were significantly higher than all other areas
(P 0.01). Neurons with different morphological characteristics such as elongate and stellate cells (Fig. 5A, B), which
have been described in the rat, hamster and mouse rNST,
were also observed in the present study (Bartel et al., 2007;
Halsell et al., 1996; King and Bradley, 1994; Whitehead,
1988, 1990; Whitehead et al., 1993; Zaidi et al., 2008).

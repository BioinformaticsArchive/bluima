and Fe were administered to the intact rats (spectrum 1A).
The cerebellum homogenate of the same animals presented
only the background EPR spectrum of the endogenous
Cuâ€“DETC complex (spectrum 1B). The peak-to-peak am-plitude is a measure of the relative concentration of the
Fe(DETC)2NO signal. Spectra 2A and 2B are taken from
an ischemic brain. Typically, well-resolved triplet signals
are observed in this case. Spectra 3A and 3B are taken from
brain tissue of a rat subjected to ischemia and reperfusion.

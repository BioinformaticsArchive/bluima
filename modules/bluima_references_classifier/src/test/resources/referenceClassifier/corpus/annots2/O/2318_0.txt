is not represented on the residual tectum. The results of proline autoradiography on this animal suggest that some of the retinal fibres destined for the
operated tectum terminated abnormally in the ipsilateral tectum. In each of the
animals with partial tectal ablation, and in a few animals with total tectal
ablation, the right tectum was also examined electrophysiologically. However,
no evoked action potentials from the right eye were recorded despite the
presence of a morphologically identifiable optic fibre projection from this eye.

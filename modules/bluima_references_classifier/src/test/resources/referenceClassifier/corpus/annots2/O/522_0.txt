The medium from the apical and basal compartments
was replaced with 700 μl of brain microvascular endothelial cell-specific medium and astrocyte-specific medium,
-1
respectively. One μCi ml (117 nM) of radiolabeledindinavir into the apical chamber or in the basolateral

3
compartment ([ H]indinavir transport studies with
14
[ C]sucrose were performed consecutively). The filters
were selected on the measurement of electric resistance.
At various time points after the addition of the tracer, we
removed 50 μl from the apical or basal compartment for
scintillation counting, and replaced this volume with 50 μl
of medium without indinavir. Transport is expressed as the
equivalent total amount (pmol) of indinavir diffusing from
to the apical to basolateral compartments or from the
basolateral to apical compartments.
In order to determine if there was indinavir accumulation within the cell layers, cells were treated with indinavir
during 60 min and washed three times with ice-cold PBS.
Cells were dissolved with 3 M NaOH (200 μl), then
neutralized with 6 M HCl (100 μl), and high-capacity
scintillation liquid (Aqualuma Plus, The Netherlands) was
added. The radioactivity of intracellular indinavir was then
determined with a scintillation counter (Packard Instrument, Rungis, France). The amount of protein in cells was
measured by Bradford's method.

Methodological considerations

The present approach relies on the detection of
receptors by radioligand binding in oitro after slight
preflxation of the tissue which was first described by
Hamel and Beaudetz4 and greatly used afterwards for
a variety of neuropeptide binding sites.3,`5,25.5T7he
radioligand [“`I]FK, and the prefixation mixture used
in the present study were the same as those used for
previous ultrastructural localization of opioid receptors in rat neostriatum.24s25 This prefixation mixture
was shown to ensure a good preservation of nerve
tissue ultrastructure without altering the binding
kinetics of [r2'IJFK.” In the present case though, the
prefixation solution was applied by external ice-cold
bathing of the brain which resulted in a better
preservation of the morphology of the ME than that
obtained after delivering it by trans.-aortic perfusion.
The subsequent processing of radiolabeled tissue
slices was shown to ensure retention of more than
50% of specifically bound tracer molecules without
artifactual redistribution of the labeling.” [12'I]FK
constitutes a selective probe for the radioautographic
detection of p-opioid binding sites.44 This subtype of
opioid receptors actually seems to be most frequently
implicated in regulations of anterior hypophysis se-cretion 9.30,35.37.38.47,510,56
n the present study the nonspecific labeling of the ME was almost non-existent
at the electron microscopic level after a 3 month
exposure time. This is in keeping with the low density
of grains observed at the light microscopic level on
corresponding semithin radioautographs. Such a lack
of non-specific binding contrasted sharply with data
previously obtained in neostriatum24v25 and locus
coeruleus (Moyse et al., unpublished observations)
with the same radioligand and the same duration of
radiographic exposure. An explanation for this difference could be that in these structures, non-specific

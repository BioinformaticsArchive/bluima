Ldminar analysis of responsiveness
Responsesof 118 thalamic and 240 cortical neurons from
different laminar positions were compared during the onset
and plateau phasesof stimulation, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Onset responseswere compared by calculating the mean
responseofeachcorticallayerinspikesperstimulusduring
the first 100 ms of air jet stimulation (Fig. 1A). As the
graphindicates,mostneuronsthroughout thecortical column
discharged three or four times during stimulus onset and
meanresponsivenessduring the initial onset of the stimulus
did not differ according to location in thalamus or in the
different layers of cortex (F = 1.13, P < 0.35). Analysis
of responsesduring the subsequentplateau portion of the
stimulus (Fig. 1B), however, revealed significant differencesin mean rate of activity after the initial onset response
hadsubsided(F=3.52,P<0.002).Whereasmostair-jetsensitive neuronsin VPL and in the upper and middle layers
of cortex were able to maintain discharge rates of 15-20
spikes/s, neurons in cortical layers V and VI responded at

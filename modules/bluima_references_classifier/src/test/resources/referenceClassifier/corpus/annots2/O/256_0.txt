Figure 1. Presence of IGF-1 within the corpus
callosum of wild-type and IGF-1 tg mice fed cuprizone. Frozen brain sections from wild-type (A, C,
E) and IGF-1 tg (B, D, F ) mice were immunostained with anti-IGF-1 ( green). Although few
IGF-1 + cells were observed within the corpus callosum of the untreated control wild-type mice ( A),
a substantial number were observed in the IGF-1 tg
mice ( B). At 3 weeks, some IGF-1 + cells were
present in wild-type mice ( C), whereas large numbers appeared in the IGF-1 tg mice ( D). At 5 weeks,
a large accumulation of IGF-1 + cells was observed
in the wild-type mice ( E), whereas in IGF-1 tg mice
the IGF-1 + cells appeared similar in number to
untreated control mice. Scale bar, 15 Î¼m.

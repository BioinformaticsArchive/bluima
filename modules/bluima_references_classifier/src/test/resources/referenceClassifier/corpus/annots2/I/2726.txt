electrographic generalization is often due to rapid propagation
of discharges between hemispheres (Ralston, 1961; Purves
et al., 1988; Spencer et al., 1988) and these may manifest
clinically as generalized seizures. Mesial hemisphere lesions
are especially associated with this pattern. In this study,
two parasagittal meningiomas were associated with bilateral
clonic motor activity and clear preservation of awareness; a
dissociation in the presence of a lesion ideally situated to
cause bilateral motor activity, without generalized
disturbance. Direct intracerebral recordings have also
suggested that in some patients generalized convulsions may
arise from discharges restricted to the prefrontal regions
(Goldring, 1972). The associations of these clinically
generalized seizure types with each other poses questions
regarding the nature of secondary generalization: the
relationships of secondary generalized seizures to primary
generalized epilepsy syndromes which share similar
associations of seizure types and the mechanisms underlying
generalized epileptic manifestations.

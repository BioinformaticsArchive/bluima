ities. P4 progenitors exclusively generated granule cells and
molecular layer interneurons, indicating that they are committed to late-generated cerebellar identities and not responsive to
heterotopicâ€“heterochronic environmental cues. In contrast, E12
precursors had the potential to produce all major cerebellar
neurons, but the repertoire of adult phenotypes generated by
these cells was diferent in distinct host regions, suggesting that
they require instructive environmental information to acquire
mature identities. Thus, cerebellar precursors are able to integrate into diferent foreign brain regions, where they develop
mature phenotypes that survive long after transplantation, but
they are committed to cerebellar fates at E12. Embryonic progenitors are initially capable, although likely not competent, to
generate all cerebellar identities, but their potential is gradually
restricted toward late-generated phenotypes.

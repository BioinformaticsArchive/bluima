brain was left in the skull for an additional 90 min. After
removal, the brain was placed in fresh fixative overnight
at 4°C. On the next day, the caudal brain stem was
isolated and sectioned in the transverse plane on a vi-brating microtome containing cold Siirenson's phosphate
buffer. Individual 100~pm sections were cut and placed
into cubicles filled with fresh buffer.
For visualization of the 5-HT immunoreactivity at the
ultrastructural level, a modification of the Sternberger
(1979) procedure was used. The sections were incubated
in the primary 5-HT antiserum (1: 1000; diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100)
overnight at 4°C. Sections incubated in the primary 5- HT antiserum diluted 1: 1000 in phosphate-buffered sa-line but lacking 0.3% Triton X-100 exhibited morphological characteristics similar to those treated with the de-tergent. However, with the addition of 0.3% Triton X-100, the 5-HT immunostaining extended more deeply
into the tissue (- 10pm). On the next day, the tissue was
rinsed several times with phosphate buffer prior to the
application of sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Antibodies, Inc.;
1: 300 in phosphate buffer). After 1 hr, the sections were
rinsed as before and then incubated in rabbit PAP (Cappel Laboratories, Inc.; 1:500 in phosphate buffer) for an
additional hour. Subsequent to several rinses in phosphate buffer, the tissue sections were reacted with 3,3'-

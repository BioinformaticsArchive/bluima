Enhancement of survival by CEP-1347 in serum-depleted
neurones
In the second set-up, cell cultures were stressed by serum
withdrawal. This lack of trophic factor resembles the second
phase of the transplantation protocol, where the cells have
been transplanted but lack the trophic support of their natural
environment. It was found that CEP-1347 (30â€“1000 nM),
when given during the period of serum withdrawal, significantly increased the number of TH-positive neurones
compared to cultures treated with medium alone. Maximal
protection was observed at 100 nM (Fig. 2).

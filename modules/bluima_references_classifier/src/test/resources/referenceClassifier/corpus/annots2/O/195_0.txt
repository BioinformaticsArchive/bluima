seem to be more direct and it is unlikely that they are me-diated by changes in tissue concentrations of T3.
With respect to the mechanisms underlying the decreases
in serum levels of T4 seen after subchronic treatment with
different psychotropic drugs (15â€“20), both enhanced tissue
uptake with subsequent deiodination to T3 and an increase
in peripheral enzyme induction seem possible, as, for example, a rise in UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity in the liver
was reported after 3 weeks of treatment with the anticonvulsant diphenylhydantoin (33). Furthermore, it should be
noted that we measured protein-bound serum levels of T4
and T3. However, the serum concentrations of free thyroid
hormone may be more relevant for the supply of thyroid

This represents 1.25%of the time.
It is assumed here that the theoretical state in which
PGO n equals zero represents tonic REM. In the case of
unit n this state can be predicted as
unit n = b,,(-M,) + Mx
where bx, is the sample regression coefficient of unit n
on PGO n, M, is the mean PGO n, and M, is the mean
unit n. In the same way it is possible to predict unit int
atPGOn=O.
A second assumption involves the definition of the
theoretical tonic REM state for these neurons. The positive correlations between PGO incidence and respiratory
neuron activation indicate that the state of tonic REM
defined as PGO n = 0 is a state of less respiratory
activation than is actually observed during REM sleep.
Still, tonic REM, as compared to NREM sleep, could be
excitatory to respiratory neurons. Accordingly the nature
of the tonic REM influence was inferred from the difference between the theoretical value of unit n or int with
PGO n = 0 and unit n and int values obtained in NREM
sleep. This comparison is warranted by the temporal
sequencing of sleep states with REM following NREM.

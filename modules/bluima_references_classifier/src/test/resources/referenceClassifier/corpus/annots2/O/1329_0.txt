The elephant hippocampus is large and convoluted
compared to that of either the human or the various
cetaceans that have been studied (Morgane et al., 1980;
Marino et al., 2003, 2004). In our earlier study of primate brain structure volumes (Allman et al., 1993), we
found that the size of the hippocampus in primates is
variable and poorly correlated with lifespan and the
sizes of other brain structures. This suggests that the
genetic regulation of hippocampal neuron number or
volume may be to some extent decoupled from the regulation of other brain structures. In fact, an important
signaling center has been identified at the “cortical
hem” adjacent to the hippocampal primordium in the
developing mammalian telencephalon. This site is rich
in BMP and WNT proteins, which regulate regional
growth and are required for normal development of the
hippocampus (Lee et al., 2000; Shimogori et al., 2004).
Examples of the long-term chemical and social memory
of elephants abound in the popular and scientific literature alike; the matriarch, entrusted with the survival
of her multigenerational family group, remembers geographical information such as the location of seasonal
water sources (Payne, 2003) and social information such
as the calls of familiar elephant groups (McComb et al.,
2001). Remarkably, as documented with separated

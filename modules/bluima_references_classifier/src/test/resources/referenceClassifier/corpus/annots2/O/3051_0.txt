The existence of D1 receptors not coupled to adenylate
cyclase was proposed soon after the introduction of D1
receptor-specific ligands (Andersen et al., 1985; Mailman
et al., 1986), and some electrophysiological effects of D1
agonists are independent of the adenylate cyclase system
(Harvey and Lacey, 1996; Johansen et al., 1991; Martin
and Waszczak, 1994), although others clearly are not
(Cameron and Williams, 1993; Hernandez-Lopez et al.,
1997; Schiffmann et al., 1995; Surmeier et al., 1995). Re-cent evidence demonstrates a link between D1 subfamily
receptors and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (Friedman
et al., 1997; Mahan et al., 1990; Pacheco and Jope, 1997;
Wang et al., 1995), although studies have not yet investigated the effects of full D1 agonists on this effector system,
nor have they investigated the involvement of this system
in the electrophysiological effects of D1 subfamily receptors. It will be of particular interest to characterize the
potencies and efficacies of various D1 agonists for the
stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.
The present findings support the role of D1 receptors in
basal ganglia electrophysiology as previously characterized with SKF 38393. However, the full D1 receptor agonists tested here are distinguishable pharmacologically.
SKF 82958 has D2 agonist activity, most clearly demonstrated at rate-inhibiting autoreceptors. Because of this
effect, and because of evidence demonstrating direct interactions of this drug with voltage-activated K+ channels
(Nisenbaum et al., in press), SKF 82958 effects should be
interpreted as selectively D1 receptor-mediated only with
appropriate pharmacological controls. Although apparently free of D2 receptor effects in the present study, DHX
has been shown to have a complex interaction with this
receptor subfamily in addition to its D1 receptor activity
(Mottola et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1996). In contrast, the
isochroman A-77636 and the benzazepine SKF 81297 are
apparently highly selective D1 receptor ligands in vivo,
based on their lack of inhibition of SNPC DAergic cells and
(when given alone) lack of excitation of GP neurons. Re-cently, these four full DAergic agonists have been tested
for therapeutic potential in unilateral (Johnson et al.,
1995; Vermeulen et al., 1993) and bilateral (Blanchet et al.,
1996; Gnanalingham et al., 1995; Kebabian et al., 1992;
Pearce et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 1991) experimental models of Parkinson's disease in primates, with each drug
demonstrating differing antiparkinsonian effects, and well
as differing adverse side effects (dyskinesias, tachyphylaxis). It is likely that the particular spectrum of dopamine
receptor activity of each of these drugs contributes to these
differences and will mark their usefulness as palliative
agents in clinical Parkinson's disease.

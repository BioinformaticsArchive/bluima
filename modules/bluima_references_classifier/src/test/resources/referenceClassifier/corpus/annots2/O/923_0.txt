adopt a common standard for both hands, all scores were based on the norms for the right hand. In the normative
sample [3] the standard deviations for the left hand were larger than those of the right hand at all ages. Bishop's
point, that the left hand would be “disadvantaged' in a score transformation based on right hand norms, is true in
the sense that differences from the mean would appear greater, in absolute terms, when assessed through the S.D. of
the right hand than the S.D. of the left hand. This would be ofconsiderable importance ifthe scores were to be looked
at from a clinical standpoint and some criterion such as 70 taken as indicating “abnormality”. However, the scores
were not being used for normative purposes. The purpose was to make comparisons between the hands on a
common scale, which could have been the left or the right. No judgements about pathology were being made.
Consider the consequences of not using a common scale. If the scores for each hand were derived from the norms
appropriate for that hand, then both hands would be assigned standardized means of about 100 and S.D. of 15 (on
the usual conventions) and the differences between the hands would be largely removed. That is, the variability it
was wished to study would have been “standardized out” of the data because of experimenter-based assumptions
about “normality”. That might not matter for some purposes, until it is asked what should be done about left
handers; should their scores be calculated on the same hand norms as right-handers? That would make their left
hands appear exceptionally fast and their right hands particularly slow. To avoid this problem, the left-handers
would need to be assessed on the right and left hand norms for their “preferred” vs “non-preferred” hands,
respectively. But what about children of ambiguous handedness, whose preferred hand is uncertain or whose
preferences and hand skill differences are out of synchrony? It should now be evident that the only way to keep
objective standards and avoid the danger ofdistorting the data through experimeter-based assumptions was to treat
both hands of all children in the same way. Evidence that the pattern of hand skill differences found for primary
school children was not an artefact of the score transformation is available in the findings for undergraduates
mentioned above [9]. The new adolescent sample reported here gives further replication.

FIG. 1. Combined cresyl violet (left) and fluorescence (right) images of needle tracks and fluorescein-colchicine are presented for a brain from
each of the four medial hypothalamic cell groups. Fluorescein-colchicine and cresyl violet images were collected from different 30 Î¼m sections.
Needle tracks or evidence of cell damage are visible in the cresyl violet sections in each of the four medial hypothalamic cell groups, and it is
clear that fluorescence impinges within the borders of each nucleus. Paraventricular (PVN), arcuate (ARC), ventromedial (VMN), and
dorsomedial (DMN) nuclei. 3v, Third ventricle.

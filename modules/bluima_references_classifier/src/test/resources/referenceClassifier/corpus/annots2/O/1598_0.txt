PvuII SNP effect on amyloid concentration and
senile plaque number

Another characteristic marker of AD pathology is the presence of SP.
We found that SP number in the Fu was significantly higher in P+
carriers (49.32 ± 4.23 vs. 29.09 ± 4.43 in P– carriers; Fig. 4A)
whereas it was not significant in the PCx (P+ 67.26 ± 7.80 vs.

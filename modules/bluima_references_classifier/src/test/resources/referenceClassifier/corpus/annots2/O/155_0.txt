supports the hypothesis that a thermogenic mechanism is intrinsic to distinct neuronal pathways. To test this f urther, brain tissue
temperature in the face of steady core body temperature was
determined at several dorsoventral and mediolateral locations in
the brains of anesthetized rats (Fig. 5E). Cortical temperature
never reached 35째C. Just lateral to the midline, temperatures of
the dorsal thalamus and the central thalamus were 36.1 6 0.09째C
and 36.3 6 0.12째C, respectively. The more ventrally located
hypothalamic nuclei displayed significantly higher temperatures
(37.1 6 0.09째C; p < 0.01). However, there was only a small
temperature gradient within the hypothalamus along a 2 mm
dorsoventral extent. The significant increase in diencephalic tem-

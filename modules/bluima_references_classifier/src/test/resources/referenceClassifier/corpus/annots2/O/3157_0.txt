Figure 7. Hypocretin axons in mouse spinal cord, C2–T4. C amera lucida
drawings were made in regular intervals from 30 μm cross-sections. The
outline of the cord and the outline of the gray matter are indicated by the
thick lines. To allow visibility of axons when reduced in size, the diameter
of the axons is greater on the drawing than it actually appeared in the
microscope. Axons that were descending the cord, particularly in dorsolateral white matter, and oriented parallel with the long axis of the cord,
which consequently would appear only as a single point in these crosssections, were not included.

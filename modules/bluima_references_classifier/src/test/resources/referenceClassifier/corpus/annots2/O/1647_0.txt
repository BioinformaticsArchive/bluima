GFAP astrocytes among total GFP cells, and this occurred at
the expense of TuJ1 neurons and O4 oligodendrocytes ( p
0.001 for both BMP4 and CNTF) (Fig. 5A). These factors did not
significantly alter the rate of cell proliferation or death of either
GFP or GFP cells in culture (data not shown) and, thus, the
observed effects most likely reflected their actions on differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the extracellular BMP inhibitor noggin decreased the fraction of GFAP cells (Fig. 5A). Retrovirusmediated overexpression of Smad6 and Smad7, which block
intracellular signaling for BMP4, also exerted the same effect (Fig.
5B). Likewise, a dominant-negative (dn) form of STAT3 (Ka-makura et al., 2004), which inhibits the activity of endogenous
STAT3, the major intracellular signal transducer downstream of
CNTF receptors (Sun et al., 2001; Kamakura et al., 2004), in-creased the percentages of TuJ1 and O4 cells ( p 0.001 for
TuJ1 and p 0.01 for O4) (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that
BMP4 and CNTF (or related cytokines) are expressed by NPCs
themselves and/or their progeny, and that such endogenous factors inhibit neurogenesis in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. This could be one of the mechanisms by which neuronal
differentiation of NPCs is attenuated in vivo. However, the effect
of blocking the actions of these endogenous cytokines on neurogenesis was rather weak: 5% of total GFP cells differentiated
into neurons under the conditions in which cytokine signals were
attenuated by Smad6/7, dn-STAT3, or both (Fig. 5B) (data not
shown). Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of noggin on neuronal differentiation of NPCs appears to be variable in vivo (Setoguchi et al., 2004; Enzmann et al., 2005).
We therefore tested another strategy to enhance neurogenesis
by NPCs. Our previous study suggested that signaling through
the cell-surface receptor Notch is involved in the inhibition of
neuronal differentiation of NPCs, and that overexpression of the
neurogenic transcription factor Ngn2 can overcome such inhibition (Yamamoto et al., 2001b). A more recent study has also
shown that Ngn2 enhances neuronal differentiation of grafted,
exogenous NPCs in vivo (Hofstetter et al., 2005). Then, we tested
whether Ngn2 can also stimulate neurogenesis in the presence of
BMP4 and CNTF in vitro. When neurospheres were infected with
Ngn2-expressing retroviruses, 23.9 1.7% of total GFP cells

SK Ca2 -activated K channel blocker:
systemic apamin
In the first groups of experiments, we assessed the effects
of a single dose of apamin (0.4 mg/kg, i.v.) on the spontaneous activity of DA neurons sampled in 33 rats. Only
one cell was recorded per animal. The dose of apamin was
selected on the basis of previous behavioral studies and
represents the highest dose that can be administered to
awake rats without eliciting motoric side effects (Messier et
al., 1991; Deschaux and Bizot, 1997; Deschaux et al.,
1997; van der Staay et al., 1999). The dose appeared to be
well tolerated and did not result in the death of any of the
animals tested.
As a group, DA neurons showed no change in average
firing rate up to 40 min after apamin administration
(F8,229 0.5, P 0.05; n 33). However, the drug produced
a marked change in firing pattern, although its effects on

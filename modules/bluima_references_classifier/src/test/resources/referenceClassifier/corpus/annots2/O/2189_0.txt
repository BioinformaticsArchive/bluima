The [3H]GBR-12935 binding to the post
mortem human putamen was shown to have
some distinct properties from that to the
mouse and rat striatum. Mazindol and
nomifensine were potent inhibitors of the
[3H]GBR-12935 binding in the striatal mem
branes of mouse and rat, in agreement with
the previous report (11 ). In the human
putamen the inhibition of [3H]GBR-12935
binding by mazindol and nomifensine was
not as potent as in the mouse and rat striatum.
The inhibition was 40-50% of the total
binding at the maximal concentrations of

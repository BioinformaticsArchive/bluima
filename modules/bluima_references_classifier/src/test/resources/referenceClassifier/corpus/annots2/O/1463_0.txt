in another. However, I suggest that function might not
necessarily respect regional borders assigned on the basis
of common neuroanatomy, or on the basis of being located
on one side or another of an anatomical landmark.
Recently, Brass, vonCramon and colleagues [34,35]
have argued for the existence of a distinct functional and
anatomical region located primarily in the depth of the
precentral sulcus and inferior frontal sulcus that is a
partial human homologue of the periarcuate region.
Located `within a transition zone between premotor and
prefrontal cortex' ([34], p. 315), they named it the inferior
frontal junction (IFJ), and argue that it `constitutes a
functionally and structurally separable area in the frontolateral cortex' ([34], p. 316; and see Box 1). They rely
heavily on evidence of the functions it subserves, but note
that there is emerging neuroanatomical evidence that the
IFJ can also be distinguished by its cytoarchitectonic and
receptor properties [36].

using VBM (Good et al., 2001b), it has been associated with subtle
changes in the hippocampus (Maguire et al., 2000) and in sulcal topography (Amunts et al., 2000). Therefore, we added it as a covariate to
exclude for possible differences in the relationship between brain density
and intelligence. Age significantly contributes to changes in brain density
as we (Hulshoff Pol et al., 2001) and others have repeatedly found.
When interpreting the findings, limitations of our chosen approach
have to be considered. The VBM procedure involves several steps. VBM
requires registration of the separate brain images onto a model brain to
allow for statistical inferences in focal brain areas. The choice of the
model brain may have influenced the results. However, when comparing
several model brains with a similar dataset in a previous study, we found
that the results remained the same. Thus, the influence of the model brain
on our results seems to have been of minimal influence. Moreover, registration error will occur during this procedure and is unavoidable.
Therefore, some caution in interpreting these results is warranted. However, because we registered each individual brain separately to the model
brain, it seems unlikely that a bias occurred that behaved differently in
MZ and DZ twins other than the similarities that we expected to find
attributable to differences in the overlap of their genetic makeup. Also,
note that, because we were especially interested in the influence of genes
on focal brain densities, thus after correction for the known overall effect
of genes onto GM and WM volumes, we did not include a volumepreserving step (Good et al., 2001a) in the procedure. Thus, the GM and
WM that we now find to be highly heritable include those areas in which
the individual variation is influenced by genes on top of the genetic
influences on global brain volume. One also has to keep in mind that the
focal brain areas that we do not find to be genetically determined may still
be determined by genes that influence overall brain volume. Alternatively, these focal brain areas may be influenced by environmental factors. Finally, our overall age correction may be only relevant for the age
range as included in the sample. Aged and early development samples can
and probably will give different patterns. Recently, a longitudinal study
in children and adolescent singletons revealed a nonlinear trajectory of
change in cortical thickness, which was associated with intelligence
(Shaw et al., 2006). Within the age range of 19 – 69 years, changes in the
genetic and environmental influences on brain morphology and in the
relationship between brain morphology and intelligence may also occur.
Analyses of possible changes in genetic and environmental influences
with age await longitudinal follow-up measurements in these subjects.
Demographics. For magnetic resonance brain imaging, a total number
of 258 family members from 112 families participated in the study after
written consent was obtained (Baare ́ et al., 2001) (Table 1). They consisted of 33 MZ male, 17 DZ male, 21 MZ female, 20 DZ female, and 21
DZ opposite-sex twin pairs, and 19 male and 15 female full siblings.
Subjects were between 19 and 69 years of age at the time of the scan
(mean SD, 30.7 9.6 years). Handedness was determined by the
Cognitive Assessment for Handedness and Laterality Data from the
Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (Andreasen et al.,
1992): 213 subjects were right-handed, 34 were left-handed, and 11 were
mixed-handed. Twins were recruited from the (healthy) twin sample of
the Department of Psychiatry of the University Medical Centre Utrecht
and the Netherlands Twin Registry (http://www.tweelingenregister.org/
index_uk.html). DNA testing using the polymorphic markers D06S474,
D07S1804, D07S1870, D12S811, D13S119, D13S126, D13S788,
D20S119, D22S683, DXS1001, and ELN, or D13S317, VWA, D74520,
D35158, TH01, TP0X, CSF1P0, and D55818 determined zygosity. Except
for one twin pair, all twins and their siblings were reared together. Two
twin pairs were born by cesarean section delivery. Mental and physical
health was assessed by means of the Family Interview for Genetic Studies
(Nurnberger et al., 1994) and a medical history inventory, respectively.
All subjects' consent was obtained according to the declaration of Helsinki. The Scientific and Ethical Committee of the University Medical
Centre Utrecht, in which the study was performed, approved the study.
Image acquisition. Magnetic resonance images were acquired on a Philips (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) NT scanner operating at 1.5 T in all
subjects. T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) fast-field echo scans with
160 –180 1.2 mm contiguous coronal slices [echo time (TE), 4.6 ms;
repetition time (TR), 30 ms; flip angle, 30°; field of view (FOV), 256

FIG. 1. Dose-response kinetics of passive immunity afforded by
monoclonal antibody C14 (gC specific) to i.c. challenge with wildtype HSV-1(KOS-321). Eight DBA-2 mice were passively immunized by i.p. administration of different doses of antibody C14 24 h
before i.c. challenge with 15 (-) or 150 (0) LD50s of wild-type
HSV-1(KOS-321) as described in Materials and Methods. The
antibody dose was derived from the complement-enhanced 50%
endpoint virus neutralization antibody titer. The percent protection
was based on the fraction of animals surviving i.c. infection for at
least 30 days postchallenge.

RESULTS
We first examined whether adult mouse neural stem
cells can be propagated in the presence of amphiregulin as
the only mitogen. Neural stem cell cultures were established from the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles of adult
mice under conditions in which they form clonal spheroid
colonies, referred to as neurospheres (Reynolds and Weiss,
1992). The neural stem cells were cultured under four
different conditions: in the presence of EGF, amphiregulin, EGF and amphiregulin, or without growth factor. The
total number of neurospheres in the four different culture
conditions was counted after 5 days in vitro, and the
average number of neurospheres from five independent
experiments was calculated (Fig. 1A). In each independent
experiment, 150,000 lateral ventricle wall cells from two
animals were divided between the four different conditions. No neurospheres or some very small spheres were

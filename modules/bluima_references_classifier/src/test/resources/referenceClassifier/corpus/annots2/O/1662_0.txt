Prefrontal cortex. Initially, we separately analyzed the three
subregions of the medial PFC (anterior cingulate (ACC),
prelimbic (PL), and infralimbic (IL) cortices)), but because
the outcome of such a detailed analysis would not be as
conclusive as analysis of the combined data, we merged
these three areas and presented the pooled data for the
medial PFC (Figure 1b). Cell numbers were separately
determined for the left and right hemispheres. A modified
unbiased stereology protocol (Keuker et al, 2001) was used
to determine the total number of BrdU-labeled cells. After
randomly selecting a starting point, every sixth section
between Bregma 4.70 and 1.60 mm (Paxinos and Watson,
1986) was analyzed, yielding an average of 10 sections per
animal for quantification. First, the boundaries of the ACC,
PL, and IL were demarcated for stereological analysis using
a low-power magnification lens (  2.5, NA 0.08). The total
number (N) of BrdU-positive cells was estimated with the
optical diector following fractionator rules (Gundersen et al,
1988; West, 1999), and a semiautomated system (StereoInvestigator, version 4.04, Microbrightfield, Williston, VT).
Video images of BrdU-positive cells were acquired with a
40 objective (NA 0.75) on a Zeiss III RS microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera
with its output presented on a high-resolution computer
monitor, and a Ludl X–Y–Z motorized stage (Ludl
Electronics Products, Hawthorn, NY). A BrdU-positive cell
was counted only if it was within the disector area, did not
intersect forbidden lines and came into focus as the optical
plane moved through the height of the disector. After

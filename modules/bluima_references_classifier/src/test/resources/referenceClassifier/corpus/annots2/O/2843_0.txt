NA,Data not available.
*- = Not found; + = sparse; ++ = moderate; +++ = pronounced. The results refer only to examination of the CNS.
t0 = No abnormalities; I = minor abnormalities, with infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes/macrophages in the leptomeninges, and occasional perivascular
infiltrates; II = obvious abnormalities, with, in addition to stage I, more prominent perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes/macrophages and sometimes a sparse, diffuse infiltration in the parenchyma; If1 = more severe brain damage, with, in addition to stage II, necrosis and pronounced diffuse infiltration
in the tissue.
:~Someof the material taken at autopsy could not be found at our review, but according to the original report a massive infiltration of cells was seen in the periventricular region, as well as a prominent glial reaction.

duction of Pax6 and proliferation of ependymal cells were more
prominent proximal ( 1 mm) than distal ( 2 mm) to the lesion
(Fig. 2 J–L). In addition, both changes were transient, almost
disappearing by DAI7 (Fig. 2C, F, I ). Thus, the expression of Pax6
closely paralleled the proliferative response of ependymal cells. A
few Pax6 cells were also detectable adjacent to the ependyma
(Fig. 2 B, C, arrowheads). These cells may reflect migration of
dividing ependymal cells, as suggested in previous studies (Jo-hansson et al., 1999; Namiki and Tator 1999). As shown previously (Frisen et al., 1995; Johansson et al., 1999; Namiki and
Tator 1999), injury enhanced the expression of nestin in the
ependymal layer, and Pax6 ependymal cells coexpressed nestin
(Fig. 2 B, inset). However, no expression of transcription factors
other than Pax6, including Pax7, Nkx2.2, Ngn2, Mash1, NeuroD1,
Prox1, and Olig2 was detected in, or adjacent to, the ependymal
layer (data not shown).
As described above, cells expressing various regulatory molecules could be detected in cultures of both the medial and lateral
parts of the parenchyma. Thus, we next examined whether any
parenchymal cells express specific transcription factors in vivo.
Olig2 and Nkx2.2 were expressed in subsets of glia and their
progenitors in vitro. NG2 glial progenitors remain in the adult
spinal cord and proliferate in response to injury (Dawson et al.,
2000; Horner et al., 2000; McTigue et al., 2001). Consistently,
some Olig2 and Nkx2.2 cells became BrdU in the lesioned
parenchyma (Fig. 3 A, C), and 15–20% of these cells were NG2
(Fig. 3 B, D). Only a minor percentage ( 5%) of the cells coexpressed Nkx2.2 and Olig2 (Fig. 3D, inset), suggesting that they
may constitute distinct populations among NG2 cells in vivo.
However, the majority of Nkx2.2 cells in the lesioned parenchyma were NG2 negative (NG2 ), and a significant fraction
( 10%) of Nkx2.2 cells coexpressed nestin (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, Pax6 and Pax7 cells, which were not detectable in intact
tissue, emerged after injury. Some of these cells became BrdU
(Fig. 3F and data not shown), and the majority ( 90%) were
nestin (Fig. 3G,H ). The expression of nestin is known to be
induced in both astrocytes and NG2 cells in the injured spinal
cord (Frisen et al., 1995; Namiki and Tator, 1999). However,
some of the above transcription factor-expressing cells did not
express markers for neurons or glia, such as TuJ1, MAP2, GFAP,
and NG2.
We further examined the spatial distribution patterns of transcription factor-expressing cells. Many Nkx2.2 cells resided in
the intact parenchyma (71.7 7.6 cells per section; n 3), and
their number increased at DAI2 (173.7 14.8 cells per section;
n 3). The NG2 population among Nkx2.2 cells was mainly
present in the white matter but became detectable throughout the
spinal cord after injury (Fig. 3 I, J ). A similar distribution pattern
was found for Nkx2.2 –nestin cells (Fig. 3K ). In contrast,
Pax6 cells were specifically detected in the lateral aspect of the
parenchyma at DAI2 (Fig. 3L) (16.3 3.1 cells per section; n
3). These Pax6 cells emerged distant from the central canal.
Thus, it is unlikely that migration of ependymal cells could
account for all, if any, of these parenchymal Pax6 cells. One day
later (DAI3), the number of Pax6 cells significantly increased
(43.0 2.0 cells per section; n 3), and they became detectable
in the medial parenchyma (Fig. 3M ). Unlike Pax6 cells, Pax7
cells was specifically detected around the dorsal horn (Fig. 3O).
Their number and distribution pattern did not significantly
change between DAI2 and DAI3 (Fig. 3P) (23.0 5.0 and 29.3
1.2 cells per section at DAI2 and DAI3, respectively; n 3).
Later after injury (DAI7), a few cells expressing Pax6 and Pax7

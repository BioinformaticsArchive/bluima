acterized a selective, high affinity and activation-dependent
binding interaction between GRK2 and Gαq/11. Our data suggest that, in addition to their well characterized role in desensitization of GPCRs, GRKs may also regulate signaling at the
level of the Gα protein directly. As further investigation of
GRK/Gα interactions proceed it will be important to determine
whether Gα binding exerts any regulatory effects on GRKs
possibly directing previously unidentified functions for these
kinases, an area which we are currently investigating. As well,
the possibility that other members of the GRK family may also
exhibit selective binding to Gα proteins remains to be explored.

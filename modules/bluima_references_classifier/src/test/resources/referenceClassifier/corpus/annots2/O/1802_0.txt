In a third analysis (Fig. 4C), we sorted the threshold-level
responses by stimulus amplitude to test whether threshold-level
stimulus amplitude was a better predictor of response magnitude. We found that the average responses to the largest (L) and
smallest (S) threshold-level stimulus amplitudes (Fig. 4C, dark
and light green curves, respectively) (100 trials each; n 6 subjects) showed no statistically significant difference at any time in
the 0 –175 ms response (M70 magnitude minimum 50 –100
ms, p 0.08; L, 81 51 nA m; S, 65 39 nA m; M70
latency, p 0.5; L, 81 13 ms; S, 76 14 ms; slope M70 to
M100 maximum 95–110 ms, p 0.16; L, 4 3 nA m/ms; S,
3 3 nA m/ms; M100 magnitude, p 0.9; L, 21 21 nA m; S,
20 46 nA m; M135 magnitude maximum 120 –175 ms, p
0.5; L, 62 36 nA m; S, 53 31 nA m; M135 latency, p 0.4;
L, 152 9 ms; S, 147 16 ms; average magnitude, 100 –150 ms,
p 0.11; L, 25 16 nA m; S, 14 21 nA m). This analysis
shows that detection probability is a better predictor of variance
in the SI response than peripheral stimulus amplitude.

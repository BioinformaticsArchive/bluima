dilate the cerebral vessels. These data appear to contradict those from the study of Hallenbeck et al. in which
the administration of indomethacin (which would in-hibit production of both TxA2 and PGI2) in conjunction
with the intravenous infusion of PGI2 ameliorated postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion.15 It is possible that
the pharmacologic doses of prostacyclin used in that
study produced levels in the cerebral vessels that were
greater than those produced in our study.
However, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition would also
decrease other potential vasoconstricting products of
the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. In fact, a possible ex-planation for the failure of thromboxane synthetase
inhibition to ameliorate post-ischemic hypoperfusion
may be that inhibition of thromboxane synthesis not
only redirects arachidonate metabolism toward the
production of PGI2 but also increases the amount of
substrate available for metabolism to other eicosanoids. The substrata for thromboxane synthetase, the
cyclic prostaglandin endoperoxides, also cause vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation.30 3I Accumulation of cyclic endoperoxides may explain the surprisingly limited effect of thromboxane synthetase in this
as in other studies.31 Antagonists of thromboxane and
cyclic endoperoxide receptors may produce more useful pharmacologic effects than inhibitors of thromboxane synthesis.30 In addition, just as the quantity of the
prostacyclin metabolite present in jugular venous
blood increased following inhibition of thromboxane
synthetase, it is possible that lipoxygenase products
were similarly increased.28 The role, if any, of lipoxygenase-derived metabolites of arachidonate has not
been well characterized in the post-ischemic state.
Another possible explanation for the failure of
thromboxane synthetase inhibition to ameliorate postischemic cerebral vasoconstriction may be that in-creased levels of TxA2 are not an etiologic component
of post-ischemic cerebral hypoperfusion. Further studies are necessary to determine whether other interventions, such as nimodipine, which clearly increase CBF
following global cerebral ischemia, are associated
with decreased cerebral venous release of TxB2. The
release of TxB2 and 6-keto PGF|Q may serve as useful
markers of the extent of vascular injury following global cerebral ischemia.
In summary, inhibiting the production of TxA2
failed to alter the marked reduction in CBF that followed a 10-min period of global cerebral ischemia in
dogs. Cerebral blood flow remained low despite evidence of markedly decreased production of TxA2 and
reciprocally increased production of PGI2.

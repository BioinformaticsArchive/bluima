start site is linked to the bacterial lacZ gene (Asakura et al.,
1995), were used. These MyoD-lacZ transgenic mice were
bred with MyoD-/- mice (Rudnicki et al., 1992) to generate MyoD-/-:lacZ mice which were subsequently interbred with Myf5+/- (Braun et al., 1992) mice to generate
Myf5+/-:MyoD+/-:lacZ mice. Myf5+/-:MyoD+/-:lacZ
mice were interbred to obtain embryos of 9 different genotypes (Kablar et al., 1997, 1999). Embryos and the fetal
portion of the placenta were collected by cesarean section on
the required embryonic day (E) and embryos prepared for
whole-mount -galactosidase staining. Genomic DNA was
isolated from the fetal portion of the placenta using the procedure of Laird et al. (1991). Embryos were genotyped by
Southern analysis (Sambrook et al., 1989) of placental DNA
using Myf5, MyoD and lacZ specific probes as described
previously (Rudnicki et al., 1992, 1993). Care of animals
was in accordance with institutional guidelines.

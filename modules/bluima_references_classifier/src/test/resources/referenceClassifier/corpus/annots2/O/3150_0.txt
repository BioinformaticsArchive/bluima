Studies of mnemonic f unction in rats frequently employ spatial or
“place” cues to test cognitive forms of learning (Tolman, 1948;
O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978) and discrete cues to measure habit or
stimulus–response (S –R) learning (Thorndike, 1911, 1933; Hull,
1943). Evidence suggests that different neural systems contribute
to each form of learning (Milner et al., 1968; Hirsh, 1974; O'Keefe
and Nadel, 1978). Lesions of the dorsal striatum (caudate putamen; CPu) and hippocampus or fornix/fimbria were previously
shown to have opposite effects on behavior in cued and spatial
versions of the radial maze task (Packard et al., 1989; McDonald
and White, 1993). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a corticostriatal system mediates S –R habit formation,
whereas a hippocampus-based system contributes to cognitive –
spatial learning (Mishkin et al., 1984; Mishkin and Petri, 1984;
Petri and Mishkin, 1994).
Anatomical studies have shown that the dorsal striatum is a
heterogeneous structure, both in terms of its intrinsic compartmentalization of neurochemical constituents (Graybiel, 1990;
Groves et al., 1995) and its regionally diverse connectivity with
other cortical /subcortical structures (Alexander et al., 1986; Mc-

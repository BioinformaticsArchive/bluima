Fig. 2. Glucose transporter (GLUT)1,
GLUT3, and MCT1 mRNA in thalamus
of P14 and P27 rats. Coronal cryosections (16 m) from P14 and P27 rat
brains were analyzed for GLUT1,
GLUT3, and MCT1 mRNA expression
by in situ hybridization with 35S-riboprobes, exposed to photographic emulsion, and counterstained with hematoxylin as described in MATERIALS AND
METHODS. High-power bright-field mi-crographs of thalamus are visualized
with epiluminesence; positive hybridization is in green. mv, Microvessel;
asterisks, neuronal nuclei.

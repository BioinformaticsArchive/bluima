olig2 is required for OPC and abducens motor
neuron specification
To determine the requirement of olig2 in OPC and motor neuron
specification in the hindbrain, we injected into newly fertilized
Tg(olig2:egfp) eggs an olig2 antisense morpholino (MO) designed
to block translation of endogenous olig2 transcripts but not of
egfp mRNA driven by the transgene. This allowed us to assess the
fates of cells that express olig2 in the absence of olig2 function. As
we showed previously (Park et al., 2002), injected embryos produced few spinal cord motor neurons and oligodendrocytes (data
not shown). 33 and 48 hpf MO-injected embryos had few olig2
cells in the hindbrain outside of the r5 and r6 clusters (Fig. 6 A–
D), suggesting that they had a deficit of OPCs. The r5 and r6
olig2 clusters were present in MO-injected embryos, however,
most of the cells appeared to have neuroepithelial morphologies,
and axonal morphologies characteristic of abducens motor neurons were not evident (Fig. 6 E–H ). Labeling MO-injected em-bryos with anti-Sox10 antibody confirmed the near absence of
hindbrain OPCs, both within and outside of the r5/r6 olig2
clusters (Figs. 6 I–L; 7A). Although the general pattern of all other
Isl cranial motor neurons appeared unaffected, including the
anterior somatic motor neurons (Fig. 6 M–P; supplemental Fig.
1 E, F, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material),
MO-injected embryos had few Isl olig2 cells in r5 and r6,
indicating the absence of only abducens motor neurons. Consistent with this, MO-injected embryos also had a deficit of Zn8
olig2 r5 and r6 cells between 48 and 56 hpf (Figs. 6Q–X; 7B). To
further confirm the loss of OPCs and abducens motor neurons in

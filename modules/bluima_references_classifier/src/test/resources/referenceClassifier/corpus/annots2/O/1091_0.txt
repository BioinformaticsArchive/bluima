Figure 1. Auditory stimuli used in this study. A, The oddball design: stimuli consisted of
sequences of standard and deviant tones, differing in frequency. We used three probability
ratios ( p 90/10, 70/30, and 50/50%) and three frequency differences ( f 0.37, 0.10, and
0.04), and their combination defined four stimulus conditions. For each condition, we schematically represent here the three blocks that were used. The stimulus probability is denoted by the
height of bars as well as by their darkness (standard, black; deviant, light gray; 50/50% control,
dark gray), and the frequency difference f is denoted by the horizontal separation. B, The
switching-oddball design, consisting of a basic 40 trial sequence, in which the f /f probability
12
ratio switched in the middle from 80/20 to 20/80% ( f 0.37). This frozen basic sequence,
which is given at the bottom, was repeated 20 times for a total of 800 trials and was
identical for all neurons. C, The response-curve design. We randomly presented 20 frequencies, 10 repetitions each, spanning a total frequency range of 0.97 octaves (each dot
represents 1 stimulus trial).

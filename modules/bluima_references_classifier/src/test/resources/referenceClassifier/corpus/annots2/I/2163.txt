tact animal. It seems that solitary tract axons
of all modalities were probably activated when
maximal PSPs were elicited. These responses
were depressed at high frequency in all neurons
examined. Possibly transmission at synapses
of all visceral afferents onto neurons in this
area has a similar frequency dependence.
A low-pass filtering of afferent information
at synapses made by baroreceptor afferents
would have important implications for the
neuronal control of the cardiovascular system.
The discharge frequencies of myelinated
baroreceptor fibers, while modulated by the
cardiac cycle, fall within the range of frequencies examined in the present study. Thus synaptic transmission may be depressed to some
extent at normal arterial pressures, The activity of second-order neurons may then be more
effectively modulated by falling rather than by
rising mean pressure levels. Furthermore, the
synaptic depression observed in the present
studies may contribute to the adaptation of
sympathetic and cardiac responses to repeated
baroreceptor stimulation (44, 47).

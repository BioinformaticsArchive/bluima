Discussion
In guinea pig brain homogenates,3H-DPR binding has been
pharmacologicallycharacterizedasbinding to adenosineuptake
sites,with adenosinetransport inhibitors suchas DPR, Hexobendine,and Dilazep demonstratingnanomolar,and adenosine
receptorligandslike CHA and 1,3-diethylphenylxanthine showing micromolar potenciesin displacing3H-DPR binding (Ma-rangosand Decker& 1987).In goodagreementwith thesemembranebindingdataareourfindingsinguineapigforebrainand

and of CHA, with inhibition constantsin the micromolar range.
Furtherevidencethat3H-DPRinfactbindstoadenosineuptake

of 3H-DPR in rat (Marangos and Decker?, 1987) and mouse
brain, and the high-affinity binding in brains of guineapig and
pointer dog correspond well to the potencies of DPR in displacing3H-NBIbindingintheseanimals(HammondandClanachan, 1985;Verma and Marangos, 1985).
Also in good agreementwith membranebinding data (Ma-rangosand Decker& 1987)is the finding that NBI inhibits 3H-DPR binding in a biphasic manner. In guineapig, micromolar
concentrationsare necessaryto displacemore than 40% of 3H-DPR binding. A high- and low-affinity component of this in-hibitioncanbedifferentiatedandtheestimatedinhibitionconstantofthehigh-affinitycomponent(about0.5nM)wassimilar
to the dissociationconstant of 3H-NBI binding (0.8 nM). This
indicatesthat 3H-NBI binding representsthe subpopulationof
3H-DPR binding sitesthat is inhibited by NBI with subnanomolar affinity. NBI hasbeenshownby severalgroupsto inhibit
adenosineuptake in guineapig brain by lessthan 50%, while
DPR inhibits practically all of it (Huangand Daly, 1974;Phillis
and Wu, 1983; Davies and Hambley, 1986; Morgan and Ma-rangos, 1987). The good correlation between thesefunctional
data and the binding data obtained in brain membranesand
brainslicessuggeststheuseof3H-NBIasaligandprobefor
NBI-sensitive, and `H-DPR asaligand probefor NBI-sensitive,
aswell asNBI-insensitive, uptake sitesin guineapig brain.
The quantitative autoradiographic studiesin guineapig brain
indicatethatNBI-sensitiveadenosineuptakesites,aslabeled
by 3H-NBI representa varying fraction of the population of
adenosineuptake sites labeled by 3H-DPR. In non-neuronal
structures,numerousNBI-sensitive uptake sitesseemto bepresent in arteriesand choroid plexus,but only relatively few in the
ependymalcellslining the ventricles. In neuron-containingbrain
regions,their density seemsto berelatively higher in basalbrain
areas,suchashypothalamicstructuresandcertainbrainstem
nuclei, than in cortical areas,such as the superficial layers of
cerebral cortex and molecular and Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum,andalsosomehippocampallayers.Thisdistribution is
in goodagreementwith the previously describedlocalization of
3H-NBI binding sitesin autoradiographic studiesin rat brain
(Geigerand Nagy, 1984;Bisserbet al., 1985)and in membrane
binding studiesin guineapig and pig brain (Hammond and
Clanachan,1983;Kalaria andHarik, 1986a).On theother hand,
this would suggesthat NBI-insensitive uptake sitesare relatively more numerousin thesecortical brain regions,which are
ontologically and phylogenetically younger. This distribution
pattern complementsthe above finding that 3H-DPR is a better
ligand probe for adenosineuptake sitesin man (unpublished
observations),dog, and guineapig than in mouseor rat. This

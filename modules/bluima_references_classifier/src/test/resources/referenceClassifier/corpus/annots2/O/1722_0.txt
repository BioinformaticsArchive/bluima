staining was not detected in the hippocampus or cortex of
P1 P21 mice with LacZ knock-in in CRMP-1 gene locus, but
became clearly apparent in the hippocampus while faintly visible
in the cortex of adult mice (Charrier et al., 2006), and that the
LacZ knock-in had negligible effects in cerebellum (Charrier et
al., 2006; Yamashita et al., 2006), are consistent with our hypothesis above.
We observed that CRMP-1 / mice had reduced PSD95 im-munolabeling (Figs. 4d–f, 5), indicative of fewer dendritic spines,
and diffuse GAP-43 labeling, indicative of fewer growth cones
(Figs. 4g–i, 5), as well as decreased PDS95 and GAP-43 protein
levels in CA1 stratum radiatum. GAP-43 knock-out mice have
severe defects and poor survival (Strittmatter et al., 1995).
GAP-43 heterozygotes show abnormal pathfinding of thalamocortical afferents neonatally, but appear normal as adults, apparently rescued, at least in part, by prolonged GAP-43 expression
(McIlvain and McCasland, 2006). We estimated that CRMP-1 / mice had nearly 56% wild-type PSD95 and 50% wild-type
GAP-43 levels in the hippocampus. Although we did not detect
CRMP-1 in the axons by immunohistochemistry as previous
work did not either (Bretin et al., 2005), our study corroborated
previous work showing CRMP-1 expression in primary cultures
of cortical neurons (Bretin et al., 2005), where the developmentally critical GAP-43 protein is prominent, that there may be an
interaction between CRMP-1 and GAP-43 expression during ax-onal development.
Unlike in CA1, MAP2, PSD95, and GAP-43 immunoreactivity patterns in the CRMP-1 / mice in CA3 and DG appeared
normal (data not shown). We did not observe Tau-MAP2 or
Tau-PSD95 colocalization in the CA1, CA3, or DG of wild-type
or knock-out mice. Thus, the absence of dislocated or abnormally

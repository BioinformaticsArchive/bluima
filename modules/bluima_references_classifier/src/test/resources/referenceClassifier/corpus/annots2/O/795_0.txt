Animals and maintenance
Zebrafish Danio rerio Hamilton were maintained in our fish
facility as described (Westerfield, 1995) under a 14·h:10·h
light:dark cycle (room fluorescent light, 06.00–20.00·h).
Zebrafish were kept in recirculating tank water (reverse
osmosis water with Instant Ocean Salt added, 0.8·g l–1, pH·7.0)
heated to 28°C. They were fed twice per day, at 09.00·h and
at 13.00·h, with freshly hatched brine shrimp and dried
plankton, respectively. Zebrafish used in this study were aged
4–12 months.

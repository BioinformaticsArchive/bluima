antibody (C3) directed against the PV capsid (3) and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Sanofi Diagnostic Pasteur). Immunostaining for viral
antigens and TUNEL assays on sections of spinal cords from mice
inoculated with PBS alone were uniformly negative (Fig. 3D). In
sections from paralyzed TgPVR mice, antigen-positive cells were
scattered throughout the spinal cord gray matter, as previously
reported (15, 26), and their location, size, and morphology were
consistent with those of neuronal cells. In the anterior horn, some
of the infected cells could be identified as large motoneurons (Fig.
3A and B). The antigen staining was specifically located in the cell
cytoplasm, the site of PV replication. The TUNEL assay indicated that 76% (706 of 928) of the infected neurons had nuclei

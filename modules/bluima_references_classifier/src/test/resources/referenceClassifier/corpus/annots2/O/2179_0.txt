Fig. 2. Inhibitory effects of ergot alkaloids on striatal DOPA accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition.
Mice were treated with KSU-141 5 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or bromocriptine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 30 min prior to
NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and sacrificed 30 min later. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or (-)-sulpiride
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) was given to animals 1 hr before the ergot alkaloids. The results expressed as values of
the mean+S.E.M. of 4-5 experiments. *P<0.01 vs. NSD-1015 control, TP<0.01 vs. KSU-1415 or
bromocriptine alone (Duncan's multiple test).

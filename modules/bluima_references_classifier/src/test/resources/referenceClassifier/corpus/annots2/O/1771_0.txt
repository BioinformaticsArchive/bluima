Neuropathological Evidence. Cell Loss. Ono et al.81
reported cell loss in specific areas of the brain at
postmortem of patients with DM1, such as in the
dorsal raphe nucleus, superior central nucleus, dorsal and ventral medullary nuclei, and subtrigeminal
medullary nucleus. Cell loss was more prominent in
patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness
and hypoventilation so that primary degeneration of
specific brainstem nuclei was considered a possible
neuropathological correlate of the clinical findings.
Other authors77 have also reported neuronal loss in
the superficial layer of the frontal, parietal, and oc-cipital cortex as well as in the substantia nigra and
locus ceruleus. The patient described by Mizukami
et al.77 had extrapyramidal traits as well as behavioral
abnormalities such as hallucinations, indifference,
mental slowness, and visual cognitive impairment, so
that in this case also the neuropathological changes
correlate with the clinical findings. These and other
observations81,99 suggest that, in the brains of pa-tients with DM1, cell loss of specific areas may occur
and contribute to the cognitive and behavioral ab-normalities observed.
Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusions. Neuronal eosinophilic inclusion bodies have been described in early
studies80 in a relatively large proportion of the thalamic nuclei (up to 30%) of patients with DM1,
similar to findings in primary progressive neurodegenerative disorders. These observations were confirmed by other authors,86 although their clinical
significance is still unclear. Not only the thalamus
but also the substantia nigra80 and caudate nucleus86
may be involved. More recently, immunostaining of
the inclusions has demonstrated that they are composed of ubiquitin and microtubule-associated proteins, thus creating the neuropathological substrate
for including myotonic dystrophies amongst the
neurodegenerative disorders.
Strong support for the hypothesis of neurodegeneration has come from the work of Thornton
and colleagues,48 who demonstrated in postmortem
brain slices from patients with DM1 that mutant
RNA accumulates as nuclear foci in specific brain
areas where muscleblind proteins are also sequestered, leading to deregulated alternative splicing in
neurons of specific gene proteins including tau (ex-ons 2 and 10), amyloid precursor protein, APP

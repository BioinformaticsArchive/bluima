Genetic labeling of neuronal cell nuclei
To obtain nuclear localization of EYFP in
vivo, transgenic mice were generated by
DNA microinjection of fertilized mouse
oocytes (C57BL/6). The transgene encoding nuclear EYFP was driven by the
neuron-specific Thy-1.2 minigene (Ca-roni, 1997; Feng et al., 2000) (Fig. 2C),
which was chosen for this proof-of-principle study because of its proven efficiency to drive transgenic gene expression
in subsets of principal neurons in forebrain structures. From four transgenic
lines, we selected one for additional analysis that exhibited strong nuclear EYFP ex-pression, primarily restricted to layer V of
the neocortex, the CA fields, and the dentate gyrus (Fig. 2 D, E). This line (termed
TYNC) was chosen for all subsequent ex-periments. The overall distribution of
transgene expression in the forebrain was
in agreement with previous reports of
Thy-1 gene-driven transgenes (Feng et al.,
2000) (i.e., mosaic in genetically defined

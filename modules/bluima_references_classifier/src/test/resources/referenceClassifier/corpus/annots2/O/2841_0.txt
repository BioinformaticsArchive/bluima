Figure 1. Photomicrographs of representative sections through the
entorhinal cortex (A) and dentate gyrus (B, C ) of a rat examined 5 d
postlesion. A, Horizontal Nissl-stained section showing the extent of
the lesion of the angular bundle (ab), which transects the perforant
path arising from both the medial (mEC ) and lateral (lEC ) entorhinal
cortex. B, C, Coronal CO-stained sections through the ipsilateral (B)
and contralateral (C ) sides. Note the decreased intensity of staining in
the OML (asterisks) on the side ipsilateral to the lesion (B) in comparison with that of the OML of the contralateral side (C ). OML,
Outer molecular layer; IML, inner molecular layer; GCL, granule cell
layer. Scale bars: A, 500 μm; B, C, 250 μm.

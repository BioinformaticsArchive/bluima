which are then relayed to the cerebellum, are consistent with
the notion that the cerebellum is an integral node in the
distributed corticalâ€“subcortical neural circuitry subserving cognitive operations. It remains to be determined, however, precisely how these prefrontopontine terminations are translated
into the pontocerebellar projection. The precise topographic
mapping of the associative corticopontine projections derived
from the present study and from our earlier observations
facilitate such future investigations.

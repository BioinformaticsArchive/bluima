ABSTRACT
Previous work supports the existence of two types of d opioid
receptor (d and d ) and a role of both subtypes in the spinal
12
cord and the ventromedial medulla (VMM) in the production of
antinociception. Although it is well established that spinal and
supraspinal Î¼ opioid receptors interact in a synergistic manner
to produce antinociception, little is known about the interaction
of d opioid receptors. This study used isobolographic analysis
to determine how d and d opioid receptors in the VMM
12
interact with their respective receptors in the spinal cord to
produce antinociception. Concurrent administration of the d
1

opioid receptor agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin at spinal
and supraspinal sites in a fixed-dose ratio produced antinociception in an additive manner in the tail-flick test. In contrast,
concurrent administration of very low doses of the d opioid

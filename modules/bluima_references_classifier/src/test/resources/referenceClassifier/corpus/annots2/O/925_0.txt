Each of four startle chambers (SR-LAB; San Diego Instruments,
San Diego, CA, USA) was housed in a sound-attenuated room
with a 60 dB(A) ambient noise level, and consisted of a Plexiglas
cylinder 8.2 cm in diameter resting on a 12.5 25.5 cm Plexiglas
frame within a ventilated enclosure. Noise bursts were presented
via a speaker mounted 24 cm above the cylinder. A piezoelectric
accelerometer mounted below the Plexiglas frame detected and
transduced motion within the cylinder. The delivery of stimuli was
controlled by the SR-LAB microcomputer and interface assembly
which also digitized (0 â€“ 4095), rectified and recorded stabilimeter
readings, with 100 1-ms readings collected beginning at stimulus
onset. Startle amplitude was defined as the average of the 100
readings. Background noise and all acoustic stimuli were delivered through one Radio Shack Supertweeter (frequency response
predominantly between 5 and 16 kHz) in each chamber.

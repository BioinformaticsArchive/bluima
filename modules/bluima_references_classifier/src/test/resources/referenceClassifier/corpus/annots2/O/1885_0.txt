Just as previous work has shown that LC neurons are not
activated by simple motor responses (Aston-Jones and Cohen
2005; Bouret and Sara 2005; Yamamoto and Ozawa 1989), the
activation of LC neurons before bar release in our task cannot
be solely related to the action per se; it does not happen with
bar releases occurring between trials, nor with erroneous bar
releases. The LC neuronal responses in this task seem closely
related to the occurrence of conditioned lipping. The activation
of LC neurons is not a correlate of simple lip movement,
however, because it did not occur at reward delivery. The
latency of bar release– evoked lipping is significantly shorter
than that of cue-evoked lipping. This is compatible with the
idea that the bar release–related lipping is triggered by an event
occurring before the movement itself, perhaps the green go

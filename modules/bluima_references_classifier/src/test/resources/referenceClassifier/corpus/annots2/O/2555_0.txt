trical stimulation (139). The excitable area of the ARAS in-cluded the central core of the brainstem extending from the
bulbar reticular formation, forward through the pontine and
mesencephalic tegmentum and into the caudal diencephaion
(Fig. 3 of ref. 139). Later, on the basis of transection experiments, it was shown that a midpontine pretrigeminal cat is
fully aroused, whereas a cut made only 4-5 mm more rostrally
induces uninterrupted sleep. Moruzzi (138) concluded that the
neurons lying between the two sections are the likely candidates for EEG activation and behavioral wakefulness or
arousal. It is precisely at that part of the brain where the
PBL is located. The PBL also coincides with the Bremer's (20)
forebrain EEG desynchronlzing area of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum.
With the development of single cell recording techniques,
the cellular elements of the ARAS were shown to be neurons
of the rostrai midbrain reticular formation which used an un-identified neurotransmitter (90,112,197). Subsequent single

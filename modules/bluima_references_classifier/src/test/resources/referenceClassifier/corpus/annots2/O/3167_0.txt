non-motor aspects of motivation (motivational
learning).8,9
The observation that the responsiveness of mesolimbic DA to morphine was actually reduced in the
NAc shell, together with the notion that drugs of
abuse preferentially or selectively activate DA release
in the NAc shell, raises the issue of the significance of
behavioral sensitization in the mechanism of drug
addiction. It has been hypothesized that repeated
exposure to drugs of abuse results in enduring sensitization of the responsiveness of the DA system to
secondary drug-related stimuli, which become incentives of drug-motivated behaviors.28 If stimulation of
DA transmission in the NAc shell is important in the
dependence liability of drugs of abuse, the observation that repeated exposure to morphine reduces
the responsiveness of DA in the NAc shell to the
opiate would suggest that sensitization of DA transmission in the NAc is a correlate of the expression of
stereotyped patterns of motor activity rather than of
drug addiction. Behavioral sensitization may even
result in a dissociation between motor and motivational functions of DA, as suggested by the opposite

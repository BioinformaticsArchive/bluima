no apparent correlations between the extent of the lesions and
their behavioral effects, other than an inconclusive relationship
with the size of the lesions. Thus of the four cats in which
thermosensory discrimination with the contralateral paws was
reduced to chance level for even the easiest task, three (192,
992, and 594) had relatively larger lesions, but one (293) had
a restricted lesion. Of the two remaining cats (894 and 994),
one (894) had a restricted lesion and the other (994) a larger
lesion, but both showed similarly massive defects in thermosensory behavior, with a slight, yet detectable discriminatory capacity remaining in their contralateral paws.

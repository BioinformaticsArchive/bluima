tended. Thus, increased basal or stressor-induced secretion
of ACTH and corticosterone after antagonist treatment re-flects an inhibitory action of endogenous oxytocin on both
basal and stress-induced HPA axis activity. This together
with our recent results (18, 42) indicates that the inhibitory
effects of brain oxytocin on the activity of the HPA axis in
virgin female rats is independent of the kind of stressor to
which the females are exposed. Stressors that have been
tested in this context include exposure to a novel environment (18, 19), swimming (18), maternal defeat (42), and re-peated airpuff (this study).
In contrast, during parturition blockade of brain oxytocin
receptors by icv administration of OTA before airpuff exposure did not elevate ACTH or corticosterone secretion de-spite enhanced intracerebral release of oxytocin at this time,
compared with late pregnancy (32). Similarly, under stressfree conditions, basal HPA axis activity was not increased
after antagonist treatment in parturient rats. From these re-sults we have to conclude that brain oxytocin is not significantly involved in the hyporesponsiveness of the HPA axis
in the parturient rat. However, we cannot exclude that the
sum of inhibitory adaptations of the HPA axis in the peripartum period mentioned above prevent, a priori, the possibility of a drug-induced disinhibition, because many other
factors including prolactin and/or endogenous opioids may
still act in an inhibitory, concerted manner (8, 46). Also,
variations in plasma estrogen/progesterone seen peripartum may add to these neuroendocrine alterations.

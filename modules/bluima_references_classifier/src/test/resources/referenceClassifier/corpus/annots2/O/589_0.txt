Fig. 2 Sagittal MRI of the head and neck. Cerebrum (C) partially covers the monoventricle (MV), which is continuous with a large
dorsal cyst (DC). Corpus callosum is absent. Root of proboscis (P) terminates at the ethmoid notch (black arrow), which with orbital
plate (O) of frontal bone (F) and turbinates (Tb) contributes to the superior aspect of the orbit containing the primitive eye buds
(E). Maxilla (Mx) does not contribute to the inferior orbit. (AF, anterior fontanelle; P*, pons; T, thalamus; Tg, tongue; white arrows,
optic nerve.)

ode) and the dorsal root entry zone containing afferents from
the sural nerve was ;105 mm. This yields an apparent
conduction velocity of 0.68 m/sec, which is in accordance with
an activation by afferent C fibers.
Control injections with saline have previously been shown
not to change nociceptive activity evoked in single neurons of
the thalamus when made by the intravenous (Carlsson et al.,
1988) or the intrathecal (Jurna et al., 1992) route. Because of
the clear dose dependence of the effects of dihydrocodeine
and dihydromorphine administered by intravenous and in-trathecal injection (see figs. 4, 7 and 8) and in view of the
strict regulations limiting the number of animals used in
experiments, no additional control experiments were conducted.
Dihydrocodeine without and after pretreatment
with metyrapone or cimetidine. Dihydrocodeine administered by intravenous injection reduced the activity evoked
in thalamic neurons by afferent C fiber stimulation (fig. 3).
This effect was dose dependent, and its maximum was
reached between 5 and 10 min (fig. 4). The threshold dose is
0.25 mg/kg, and the dose producing the maximum effect (i.e.,
complete depression of evoked activity) is 2 mg/kg. The ED
50
of intravenous dihydrocodeine is 0.47 mg/kg. The effect of
dihydrocodeine (2 mg/kg) was reversed by an intravenous
injection of naloxone (0.2 mg/kg; fig. 5). In a previous study,
it was found that an intravenous injection of naloxone in-creased C fiber-evoked activity in thalamic neurons at high
doses (1 and 5 mg/kg), whereas at low doses (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5
mg/kg), it was reduced (Jurna, 1988). Therefore, it must be
assumed that naloxone (0.2 mg/kg) reversed the depressant
effect of dihydrocodeine by displacement of the latter from
opioid receptor sites.
The dose of metyrapone that is usually used in metabolic
studies is 50 mg/kg (Fantuzzi et al., 1993; Maser and Legrum, 1985; Usansky et al., 1984). This dose reduced the
O-demethylation process for $2 hr by ;70% when administered 15 min before the test agent, methacetin (Maser and
Legrum, 1985). The doses of cimetidine administered for
similar purposes range between 10 to 150 mg/kg (Chang et

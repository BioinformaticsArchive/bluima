quired for presynaptic but not postsynaptic modulation of LTP
in the hippocampal CA3–CA1 synapses (Xu et al., 2000; Za-kharenko et al., 2003). However, it remains possible that ShcC is
involved in TrkB-mediated hippocampal synaptic plasticity at
the postsynapses, because BDNF was taken up by postsynaptic
neurons in an activity-dependent manner (Kohara et al., 2001).
Thus, the enhanced hippocampal LTP in ShcC mutant mice may
be caused in part by alterations of postsynaptic TrkB receptor
signaling, for example, through activation of the PLC -mediated
TrkB–IP3/CaMKIV pathway that is proposed to be relevant to
hippocampal LTP (Minichiello et al., 2002). More studies are
needed to clarify the signaling capabilities of the BDNFstimulated TrkB receptors in the absence of ShcC and the signaling ability of ShcC as a go-between adapter protein for the TrkB
and NMDA receptors, because NMDA receptor activation is frequently associated with TrkB-mediated hippocampal LTP (Suen
et al., 1997; Levine et al., 1998). In addition, it is essential to
investigate directly the NMDA receptor synaptic responses in
ShcC mutant mice, because our findings showed only differences
in the contribution of NMDA receptor to hippocampal LTP in
the mutant mice.
Similarly to ShcC mutant mice, mice lacking H-Ras showed
enhanced hippocampal LTP and tyrosine phosphorylation of the
NMDA receptors (Manabe et al., 2000). These enhancements
explained why the deficiency of H-Ras increased Src kinase activity and subsequently potentiated the receptor function associated
with hippocampal LTP (Thornton et al., 2003). These findings
might suggest that ShcC modulates NMDA receptor function for
hippocampal LTP via inhibition of Src kinase activity through the
Ras family, including H-Ras, because ShcC transmits BDNFstimulated TrkB receptor signaling to the Ras/MAPK pathway
(Nakamura et al., 1998; Liu and Meakin, 2002). In this study,
however, Src and Fyn kinase activity were unaffected in the hippocampus of ShcC mutant mice, which was distinct from the case
of H-Ras mutant mice.
Hippocampal synaptic modulation by ShcC may also involve
other molecules. A novel 250 kDa Rho-GTPase activating protein
(GAP) Grit (Nakamura et al., 2002), also termed RICS (Rho GAP
involved in the -catenin–N-cadherin and NMDA receptor signaling) (Okabe et al., 2003) or p250GAP (Nakazawa et al., 2003),
is suggested to be involved in modulation of NMDA receptor
signaling. Grit was identified originally as a binding partner of
ShcC and is involved in neurotrophin-dependent neurite outgrowth via the specific modulation of cytoskeletal actin dynamics
(Nakamura et al., 2002). Actin dynamics in dendritic spines have
been implicated in hippocampal LTP (Engert and Bonhoeffer,
1999; Matus, 2000). Grit interacted with the NR2B subunit of the
NMDA receptors, and this interaction was modulated by the re-ceptor activation (Nakazawa et al., 2003). These findings suggest
that Grit regulates the NMDA receptor-dependent actin reorganization in dendritic spines. Thus, the absence of ShcC may also
influence the localization of Grit and further affect the postsynaptic remodeling of the cytoskeleton underneath the NMDA re-ceptors, which is associated with hippocampal LTP underlying
learning and memory (Milner et al., 1998). It could be that multiple molecules are needed to regulate synaptic function for hippocampal LTP (Sanes and Lichtman, 1999; Inoue and Okabe,
2003); however, ShcC would be a modulatory component of
these molecules at the hippocampal synapses.
In summary, our observations revealed that the enhancement
of hippocampal LTP in ShcC mutant mice is primarily attributable to an alteration of NMDA receptor function rather than an
effect on the TrkB–Shc site. The current study established that the

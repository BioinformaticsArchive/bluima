Fig.·2. (A–D) Confocal image of the three-dimensional topography
of the eyestalk and brain CRY immunoreactivity of P. clarkii at
two times of day. All the images are optical sections of wholemount preparations. (A) MT-HB complex cells expressing CRY at
03:00·h. The hemiellipsoid body shows a cluster of cells expressing
a strong CRY immunoreaction; an immureactive cell apparently
located in MT seems to branch towards the HB (small arrows).
Note the protocebral tract (PT) expressing a dim immunoreaction.
(B) MT-HB complex at 19:00·h, showing low immunoreaction.
(C) Protocerebrum at 03:00·h; note the lack of immunoreactive
signal at this hour. (D) Neurons of the protocebral anterior medial
cluster (AMC) expressing strong CRY immunoreactivity at
19:00·h. Scale bars, 100·μm. (E) Fluorescence micrograph of a
histological section showing the cytoplasm of some cells of the
protocerebral anterior medial cluster (AMC) expressing CRY
immunoreactivity at 11:00·h. Scale bar, 20·μm. See text for
explanation.

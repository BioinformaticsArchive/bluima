Figure 1. Immunodot-blot analysis of the specificity of the anti-sst4
antiserum. Serial dilutions (0 –2000 ng) of the peptides corresponding to
the C -terminal regions of sst1 , sst2A , sst2B , sst3 , sst4 , and sst5 were blotted
onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with affinity-purified antisst4 antibody (6002) at a concentration of 1 μg /ml. The blot was subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and
developed using enhanced chemiluminescence.

Excitatory connections between
hindbrain interneurons
If hdINs drive swimming activity but show
no evidence of membrane bistability or
postinhibitory rebound from rest, do they
make the mutual excitatory synaptic connections expected from reverberation hy-potheses? Of crucial significance for a feedback mechanism to sustain swimming
activity was the finding that many hdINs had
both descending and ascending axons (Figs.
2 A, B, 5 A, C). Although descending axons
permit the feedforward excitation of more
caudal neurons, as we described above, the Figure 5. Hindbrain neurons make reciprocal excitatory connections with each other. A, Two hdINs, both with descending (d)

connections.
Our first evidence confirmed that individual hdINs do make synaptic contacts from both their ascending and descending axons. By making sequential paired recordings, we showed that the same, individual hdINs (six hdINs in six
tadpoles) excited postsynaptic neurons both rostral and caudal to
themselves. However, the most compelling and direct evidence
came from simultaneous recordings from pairs of hdINs. We
found 47 pairs (in 23 tadpoles) with the long-duration action
potentials characteristic of hdINs, where a current induced action
potential in one neuron led to direct, short-latency excitation of
the other. In 28% of these pairs (13 pairs in 13 tadpoles), in which
the more caudal neuron also had an ascending axon, we found Figure 6. Corelease of glutamate and acetylcholine at synapses between hindbrain neurons.

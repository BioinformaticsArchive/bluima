Figure 3. Bar graph showing counts of Fos-positive nuclei comparing
intact and VNX stimulated mating and nonmating animals. Intact stimulated(Is)animalsshowsignificantlygreater(*,p<0.01)Fosexpression
within the AOB, Me, MPOA/AH, and BNST (anterior and posterior)
compared with VNX stimulated nonmating (L's) and unstimulated an-imals (ZUS,Vus). VNX stimulated animals that mated (L'sm) showed
significantly more (p < 0.05) Fos expression than VNX animals that
did not mate in all areas except in the AOB. k's~smanimals also had
practically no Fos expression in the AOB and significantly less (p <
0.05) Fos expression within Me compared to intact mated animals.

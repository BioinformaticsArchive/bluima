Subthalamic nucleus
The STN is one of the nuclei of the basal ganglia, and is
distinguished by being the only one of this group of
nuclei to use glutamate as the neurotransmitter in its
efferent projections (Smith and Parent, 1988). STN cells
retrogradely labeled from injections in MD were ob-served in all of the cases, consistent with several studies
(Russchen et al., 1987; Velayos and Reinoso-Suarez,
1985; Nauta and Cole, 1978; Ricardo, 1981). The STN
accounted for a small proportion (1â€“3%) of labeled cells
in each of the cases. However, the distribution of labeled
cells within the STN varied with injection location (Fig.
8). In the cases injected in caudal MD (226R, 226L,
234), the rostrocaudal distribution of labeled cells in the
STN was limited. For example, in case 234, most of the
labeled cells were concentrated near the rostral pole of
the nucleus. Case 226L also contained a focal cluster of
labeled cells with limited rostrocaudal spread, but it
occupied a position near the center of the STN. In
contrast to the cases injected in caudoventral MD, la-beled cells were found throughout the rostrocaudal ex-tent of the STN after injections in ventrolateral MD (250R

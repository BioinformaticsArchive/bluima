Fig. 3. Radial arm maze learning measured in A) female rats, and B) female mice 2 weeks after a single injection of 2,6-diClPh-MeSO2 (16
or 65 mg/kg), or vehicle. The number of errors and latency to last pellet were measured over three consecutive days. Statistical analysis was
performed using ANOVA with a split-plot design. Pair wise testing between each of the treatment groups was performed with the Tukey
HSD test. Bars represent mean”S.D. (n‰8). Letter in upper case Pfi0.01 and lower case Pfi0.05, where Arepresents comparison versus the
control treatment group and Brepresents comparison between the two doses of 2,6-diClPh-MeSO2.

anhydrase from the particulate to the soluble fraction during
the in vitro incubation of the pituitary gland. The addition of
dopamine to the incubation medium was accompanied by a
prompt inhibition of prolactin secretion, and the shift in
subcellular enzyme activity. It remains to elucidate the physiological significance of the shift of the activity of carbonic
anhydrase in subcellular fractions.

FIG. 9. Photomicrographs illustrating a typical WGA-apoHRP-Au injection
site in the mPVN (A), and the resultant retrograde labelling of MeA cells as
indicated by cytoplasmic punctata (B). A Fos-positive cell (â€ ), a retrogradely
labelled cell (*) and a retrogradely labelled Fos-positive cell (arrow) within the
MeA of an animal subjected to restraint stress are shown (B). This injection
site corresponds to the level of mPVN where peak expression of c-fos occurs
after restraint. Scale bars, 100 mm (A) and 10 mm (B).

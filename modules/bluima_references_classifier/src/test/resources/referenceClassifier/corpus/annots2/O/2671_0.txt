chial mucosa is an important component of airway
narrowing in asthmatic individuals (21). However, ventilation with water aerosol has been reported to have no
effect on bronchial blood flow (14). The reported absence
of bronchial vasodilation is surprising, because, like capsaicin, water in the lower airways stimulates the endings
of pulmonary and bronchial C-fibers (29). However, in-jection of water into the lower airways also strongly stimulates rapidly adapting receptors (29), the reflex effects
of which on the airway vasculature are unknown, and
might also cause release of vasoactive mediators. These
pathways could conceivably oppose the C-fiber-mediated
vasodilation.
Therefore, in the present experiments in dogs, we
sought to determine whether water in the lower airways
can evoke bronchial vasodilation by mechanisms similar
to those engagedby capsaicin (10,28). We measured flow
in the right bronchial artery and injected small volumes
of water into a lobar bronchus. To determine whether
any vasodilator effects we observed were specific to the
airways or were part of a general systemic vasodilation,
we also measured flow in an adjacent intercostal artery.
Some investigators have suggested that in pigs efferent vagal pathways contribute little to vasodilation in the
lower airways and that bronchial vasodilation is due to
release of vasodilator peptides from the peripheral terminals of vagal sensory C-fibers (23,24), a mechanism similar to that described in rodents (27). However, the bronchial vasodilation evoked by capsaicin in sheep (10) and
dogs (28) seemsto be due in large part to centrally me-diated vagal reflex pathways and only to a small extent to
local release of vasodilator mediators. To examine the
peripheral neural pathways involved in the bronchovascular response to water, we reversibly blocked the vagus
nerves by cooling and interrupted efferent parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways by appropriate receptor blockade. Because changes in total bronchial blood
flow do not necessarily reflect changes in mucosal blood
flow (13), we also measured regional blood flow in the
lower airways using color-coded microspheres.

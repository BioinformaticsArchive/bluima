events versus baseline (Josephs and Henson, 1999; Henson, 2004); however, the purpose of the current study was not to assess hemodynamic
responses to words per se but only to compare hemodynamic responses
to words based on their later memory fate (remembered, primed, forgotten), and the absence of a fixation baseline does not limit conclusions
about response differences across these word types (Josephs and Henson,
1999; Henson, 2004). Assuming the BOLD impulse responses to successive events summate in a linear manner (as is assumed by nearly every
analysis method used conventionally), there is no need for null events,
because the fMRI time series is deconvolved with an assumed response
shape; moreover, inclusion of null events would have reduced statistical
power for comparisons between the different event types (Josephs and
Henson, 1999; Henson, 2004). There is good evidence that the degree of
nonlinearity is minimal for interstimulus intervals of approximately
3000 ms, as used here (Henson, 2004).
To examine a possible regional overlap of priming-related activity at
study and test, the relevant SPM at test (i.e., correct rejections of nonstudied words minus primed words) (Fig. 1) (Schott et al., 2005) was
used as an inclusive mask. This mask image was applied to the primedminus-forgotten and forgotten-minus-primed contrasts of the study
phase, to identify activations and deactivations at study in brain regions
that showed response decreases at test. The significance threshold for the
mask was 0.001 (uncorrected, one tailed, extent threshold k 5 adjacent
voxels) (Schott et al., 2005), but the threshold for the masking analysis
was 0.005 (uncorrected, two tailed, extent threshold k 5 adjacent voxels), as in the other encoding contrasts. The theoretical purpose of this
analysis was to test our hypothesis that priming-related response de-creases in the ventral visual stream at test would be mirrored by primingrelated response increases in the same regions at study.

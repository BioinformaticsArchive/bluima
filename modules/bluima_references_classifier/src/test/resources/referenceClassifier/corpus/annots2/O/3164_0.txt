EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal and Tissue Preparation
Fertilized eggs (White Leghorn, SPAFAS, Preston,
CT) were placed in an incubator (Humidaire) at 99.5°F
and 85% relative humidity. At appropriate times, a
window was cut in each egg to determine the developmental stage (Hamilton and Hamburger , 1951). Whole
embryos, stages 17 (n = 10), 18 (n = 10), 19 (n = 12), 20
(n = 8), and 21 (n = 6) were fixed by immersion in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 12–24 hours at 4°C, embedded in
8% gelatin and 100 mm sections cut in the sagittal
plane on a vibratome (DSK Microslicer, Ted Pella).
Immunocytochemistry was performed on free floating sections after which they were mounted onto slides,
dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared with
HemoD (Fisher) and coverslipped with permount.
For analysis of the epithelial/nerve and nerve/CNS
boundaries, stage 19 (n = 3) and stage 21 (n = 3)
embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded
in 8% gelatin and 100 μm sections cut in the sagittal
plane (as above). The olfactory region and adjacent
telencephalon were microdissected, osmicated in 2%
OsO4 for 1 hr, dehydrated through graded alcohols,
cleared in propylene oxide and embedded in EPON.
Serial 1μm sections were cut, mounted and dried onto
glass slides and stained with basic toluidine blue
(borate buffer, pH 11).
Stage 21 embryos (n = 5) used for DiI labeling were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for
2 hr and DiI (Fast DiI, Molecular Probes, diluted 1:100
in 100% ethanol) was applied to their olfactory pits
using glass micropipettes pulled to 3μm o.d. (Kimax
capillary tubing). DiI is a lipophilic carbocyanine dye
which incorporates into the lipid bilayer predominantly
of axons. By placing DiI at the epithelium of fixed
tissue, it is anterogradely transported along the olfactory nerve. In this way, DiI labels the olfactory nerve
when present. Embryos were placed into 2% paraformaldehyde and kept in the dark at 37° C for 23 days after
which time they were embedded in 8% gelatin and
100μm sections were cut on a vibratome. Sections were
mounted onto slides and coverslipped with gelmount.

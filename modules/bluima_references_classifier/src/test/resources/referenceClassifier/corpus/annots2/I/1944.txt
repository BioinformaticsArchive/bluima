The hBMEC cell line maintains the morphological and functional characteristics of primary brain endothelium and has
proven valuable in the analysis of a wide variety of human CNS
pathogens, including group B Streptococcus (30), Escherichia
coli K1 (21), Neisseria Streptococcus (43), Streptococcus pneumoniae (33), and recently, B. anthracis (44). We now identify
for the first time a B. anthracis surface-associated adhesin that
promotes hBMEC interaction and BBB penetration in vivo,
contributing to the pathogenesis of anthrax meningitis. The
results of our and previous studies suggest that BslA acts as a
global adherence factor important for anthrax disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, characterization of Bacillus cereus isolates associated with fatal pneumonias showed that they harbor
the bslA (pXO1-90) gene (17). In summary, BslA may represent an attractive new target for pharmacological intervention
or vaccine purposes to prevent disease progression during systemic anthrax infection.

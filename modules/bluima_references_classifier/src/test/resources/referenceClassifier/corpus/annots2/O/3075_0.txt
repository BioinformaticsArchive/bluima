Fig. 1. Recording sites (filled dots) in the ventral portion of the MVN and medial and lateral stimulating
zones (shaded areas) are plotted on the diagrams of 0.5 mm spaced brainstem slices. On the right the
typical vestibular field potential recorded in the ventral portion of MVN in normal and Ca2+-free solution
is shown. At the bottom single pulse response is superimposed onto a 3-ms paired pulse stimulation to
show how N1 peak negative voltage was calculated compared to the baseline (vertical lines). D,
descending vestibular nucleus; Md, medial vestibular nucleus: dorsal portion; Mv, medial vestibular
nucleus: ventral portion; L, lateral vestibular nucleus; S, superior vestibular nucleus.

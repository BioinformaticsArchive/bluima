Fig. 5. PCR analysis of HisDC mRNA expression in human tissues. (A) Strategy for PCR showing the location of primers used. Psl and Ps2
are sense primers in regions A and B, respectively. Pa3 and Pa4 are anti-sense primers in regions C and Ins, respectively. (B) PCR products
amplified with Ps2 and Pa3, representing the 2.4-kb HisDC mRNA. Lane 1, negative control; lane 2, pTN-4 plasmid; lane 3, KU-812-F cell
cDNA; lane 4, brain cDNA; lane 5, lung cDNA. (C) PCR products, representing the 3.4-kb HisDC mRNA. A primer set used the Psl and
Pa4 (lanes 1-5). As a positive control for PCR, primers for /I-actin were also included (lanes 6- 10). Lanes 1 and 6, negative control; lanes
2 and 7, pTN-4 plasmid; lanes 3 and 8, KU-812-F cell cDNA; lanes 4 and 9, brain cDNA; lanes 5 agd 10, lung cDNA. The size markers were
8X-174 replicative-form D N A digested with HaeIII

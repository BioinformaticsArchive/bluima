Figure 8. Photographs of whole-mount ze-brafish embryos (A, B) and histological sections of the brain and retinas ( C–F). A, B,
Photographs of 2.5-d-old wild-type ( A) and
nbb - / - ( B) embryos stained with acridine
orange. Note the stained cells in the forebrain and eyes of nbb - / - embryos (bright
staining in B, arrow). C–F, Histological sections of the brain and retinas of wild-type
(C, E) and nbb - / - (D, F ) fish. At 3 d of age
(C, D), apoptotic cells were detected in the
brain and retinas in nbb - / - embryos (D,
arrow). By 7 d (E, F ), the sizes of the brain
and retinas in nbb - / - embryos were f urther
reduced. Many cells had died (F, arrow).
Scale bars: A, B, 250 μm; C–F, 100 μm.

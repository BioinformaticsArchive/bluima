Figure 3. Pharyngeal arch patterning is the result of
integrating crest-dependent and crest-independent cues.
The final patterning of the arches is a result of an integration
between crest-dependent and crest-independent cues. The
patterning of the first arch is likely to involve interactions
between crest from the posterior midbrain and anterior
hindbrain, in pink, the endoderm of the first pouch, in light
blue, and most likely also the oral ectoderm, in light pink.
Morphogenesis of the second arch will involve a contribution
from rhombomere 4 crest, in red, as well as from pharyngeal
pouches 1 and 2, in light blue and dark blue, respectively. The
development of the third arch is most likely directed by the
postotic crest, in yellow, acting in concert with signals from
pouches 2 and 3, in dark blue and green, respectively.

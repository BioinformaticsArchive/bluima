topoiesis, control of peripheral blood cell number, and modulation of colony-forming cells (Tabarowski et al., 1996; Zaidi
et al., 1987, 1988). Because CGRP-positive fibers could be
nociceptors, their presence near red blood cells, leucocytes,
megakaryocytes, osteoblasts, and capillary endothelial cells
calls attention to the possibility that some of these cells,
particularly the immune ones, play a role in the pathophysiology of some headaches. Under certain conditions and in
response to certain stimuli, bone marrow nociceptors could
be activated by leucocyte degranulation and the release of
algogenic molecules such as supraoxide, hydrogen oxide,
hydroxy radicals, toxic nitrogen oxide, growth factors (e.g.,
transforming growth factor), cytokines (e.g., interleukins-1, -2,
-4, and -6 and tumor necrosis factor- ), and lipid mediators
such as prostaglandins and eicosanoids.
The apparent contribution of dural nerve fibers to branches
that branch out into the sutures of the adult calvaria is consistent with a line of evidence showing that the subsutural
dura gives rise to neural crest cells that differentiate into the
osteoblasts that form the bones of the calvaria (Gakunga et

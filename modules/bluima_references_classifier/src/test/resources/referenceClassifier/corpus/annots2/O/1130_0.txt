Fig. 8. Quantitative analysis of profilin I colocalization with the synaptic
markers PSD-95 and synaptophysin, respectively, upon control and depolarizing protocols. Note that depolarization induced by KCl causes a significant
recruitment of profilin I to both PSD-95-positive and synaptophysin-positive
sites. *P < 0.05.

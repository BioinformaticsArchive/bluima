targets of DA modulation. The kinetic properties of the two
DA-sensitive currents closely resemble those of I
KCa transient
and I , and effects of DA on type 1 cells are
KCa sustained
mimicked by the I blocker, CTX. That no detectable DA
KCa
modulation was observed in cells in which I had been
KCa
blocked with CTX before DA application provides strong
support for the conclusion that DA modulates Ca2 -dependent
K currents in these neurons.
Ca2 -dependent K currents have been described in many
insect species (Grolleau and Lapied 1995; Mercer and Hildebrand 2002b; Scha ̈fer et al. 1994; Thomas 1984; Torkkeli and
French 1995; Wegener et al. 1992; Zufall et al. 1991). Transient and sustained components of I have been reported, for
KCa
example, in cockroach dorsal unpaired median neurons and, as
in type 1 cells, both currents are blocked by CTX (Grolleau and
Lapied 1995). The gene encoding the sustained I channel in
KCa
cockroach neurons has been identified (Derst et al. 2003) and
in cells heterologously expressing this channel, sustained I
KCa
has an activation rate similar to that of the DA-sensitive
sustained current observed in honey bee AL neurons.
Reports describing the outcome of I modulation in other
KCa
invertebrate systems provide clues as to likely effects of DA
modulation of Ca2 -activated K currents on the excitability
of Apis AL neurons. In molluscan central pattern generator
neurons, serotonin-induced attenuation of spike afterhyperpolarization, attributed to a reduction in I amplitude, promotes
KCa
repetitive spiking in these neurons (Katz and Frost 1997).
Applying DA to isolated pyloric dilator neurons in the lobster
stomatogastric ganglion, on the other hand, increases the am-plitude of total I contributing to an increase in interspike
KCa
interval and a reduction in action potential frequency in these
neurons (Kloppenburg et al. 1999c). These results, together
with reports in other systems (e.g., Baxter and Byrne 1989;
Baxter et al. 1999; Buchholtz et al. 1992), suggest that DA-induced attenuation of I will increase the excitability of
KCa
honey bee AL neurons.
In developing nervous systems, levels of electrical activity
have a significant impact on neuronal growth and differentiation (e.g., Baines et al. 2001; Duch and Levine 2000, 2002; Gu
and Spitzer 1980; Kater and Mills 1991; Kater et al. 1988;
Schilling et al. 1991; Spitzer et al. 1995, 2002) and on activitydependent tuning of neuronal connections (e.g., Katz and Shatz
1996; Ruthazer and Stryker 1996; Shatz 1994; Sherrard and
Bower 1998). DA-induced changes in cell excitability therefore could have developmental relevance in ALs of the bee.
The early appearance of DA-immunoreactive processes in
honey bee ALs (Kirchhof et al. 1999), evidence that DA-receptor genes in the bee brain are strongly developmentally
regulated (Kurshan et al. 2003), and the identification in this
study of DA-sensitive currents in developing AL neurons all
suggest a developmental role for DA, in addition to its functions in the adult brain. In ALs of the sphinx moth, Manduca
sexta, modulatory actions of serotonin on developing AL
neurons (Mercer and Hildebrand 2002a; Mercer et al. 1995,
1996a,b; Oland et al. 1995) strongly foreshadow the actions of
this amine in the brain of the adult moth (Kloppenburg and
Heinbockel 2000; Kloppenburg and Hildebrand 1995; Kloppenburg et al. 1999a).
In adult honey bees, olfactory information is encoded by
spiking patterns in AL projection neurons (Abel et al. 2001;
Mu ̈ ller et al. 2002; Stopfer et al. 1997) and patterns of activity

Moderate as Optimum
In the past 20 years or so, it has become widely accepted
that a small daily intake of alcohol confers some benefit to
health in men aged 50 and over, in the sense of a reduced
risk of coronary heart disease in comparison with both
nondrinkers and heavier drinkers. Numerous studies have
confirmed the finding of a J-shaped curve relating morbidity and mortality to mean daily intake of The
intake corresponding to the nadir of the J is frequently
regarded as the defining value for moderate drinking. For
example, Klatsky7' defines moderate drinking as “the area
[under the curve] below the level at which overall net
harmful effects are seen in population surveys, about three
drinks a day. Thus, I call less than three drinks per day
`moderate' or `lighter' drinking, and define heavy drinking
as three or more drinks per day.” He also points out the
equivalence of this dividing line to Anstie's limit.
Numerous authors have pointed out that the J-shaped
curve of alcohol intake versus total mortality rate is the
result of the blending of the alcohol effects on the separate
mortality rates for all separate diseases. For example, in-creasing alcohol intakes appear to produce a progressive
lowering of the death rate from coronary heart disease, but
at intakes above 3 drinkdday, this beneficial effect is offset
by rapidly rising mortality rates from hypertensive heart

Discussion

The present study demonstrates that the P450 isoforms
CYP3A11 (mouse) and CYP3A2 (rat) are crucial for alterations in AR-dependent endocrine signaling in hepatic and
neuronal cells after treatment with P450-inducing antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital. These
endocrine alterations are not due to effects of the drug itself
or its putative metabolites acting as potential AR-ligands. AR
expression and signaling were clearly reduced when
CYP3A2/11 expression has been inhibited either by the use of
specific siRNA molecules or by the common chemical CYP3A
inhibitor ketoconazole. We established two model systems to
validate our concept. In the induction model using
Hepa1c1c7 or PC-12 cells, the P450 isoforms CYP3A11 or
CYP3A2 were induced by AED application. In the overexpression model, recombinant CYP3A11 was applied to PC-12
cells. Our results indicate that regulation of AR-dependent
pathways is a major function of P450, especially in brain.
This finding is important because there is ongoing discussion
on the function of brain P450 in drug response.
The use of cell line models facilitates investigation of the
coherence between drug application, P450 function, and AR
regulation at the molecular level. We initially started with
drug-dependent induction of CYP3A11 in Hepa1c1c7 cells.
This cell line is known to be very easily induced by AEDs
(Karenlampi et al., 1989) and expresses CYP3A11 as well as
AR constitutively. We decided to use this cell line to investigate the common principles of P450 regulation and its effects
on steroid hormone receptor regulation. Using this so called
“induction model,” we demonstrated that CYP3A11, after
induction by AEDs, modulates AR expression and signaling
in a congruent manner. If CYP3A11 expression is silenced or

Parkinson's disease is characterized by a depletion of do-pamine (DA) neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Stereotaxic injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (B-OHDA), a selective neurotoxin, into either the medial forebrain bundle or
the substantia nigra result in a massive DA denervation of
the nigrostriatal pathway. Following unilateral nigrostriatal
DA depletion, hemiparkinsonian animals develop a stereotypical rotational behavior when challenged with DA agonists such as apomorphine. The drug-induced rotational
behavior has been widely used as the behavioral index of
hemiparkinsonian animals, but it has some limitations. Al-though asymmetries in the rotational behavior may indicate an imbalance of DA contents and release capacity in
the bilateral nigrostriatal pathway, the behavior is a pharmacological reaction. Accordingly, the drug-induced rotation test is subject to sensitization effects. The present
study proposes the elevated body swing test (EBST) as a
measure of asymmetrical motor behavior of hemiparkinsonian animals in a drug-free state. The EBST simply in-volves elevating the animal by handling its tail and recording the frequency and direction of the swing behavior. Unilateral nigral6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited significant bi-ased swing activity with the direction contralateral to the
lesioned side, corresponding to the direction of apomorphine-induced rotations. A 30 set EBST was noted as the
peak time for biased swing activity. At 7 d postlesion (the
start of testing), and every week thereafter for a period of
2 months, a fairly stable biased swing activity level was
observed. At 1 and 2 months postlesion, the same animals
were also challenged with apomorphine. High positive correlations between swing and apomorphine-induced rotational behavior were noted. Furthermore, tail pinch or ap-omorphine injection increased the level of biased swing
activity in the lesioned animals. Similar mechanisms im-plicated in the dopamine-mediated rotational behavior may
be involved in the swing behavior. The EBST may circumvent the problem of sensitization and pose as an alternative tool in characterizing spontaneous behavior in animals
with lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway.

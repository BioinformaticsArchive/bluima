otic concentrations in brain dialysates by the estimated concentrations in the
striatum and the lateral ventricle.
Pharmacokinetic methods and statistics. The elimination half-lives (t1/2) of
the antibiotics from plasma, the striatum, and the lateral ventricle were estimated
by fitting a monoexponential equation to the postinfusion plasma and brain
concentration-time data (5).
The extracellular concentrations of each antibiotic that were obtained at the
steady state in the striatum and the lateral ventricle were compared by means of
Student's t test for paired data. A repeated-measures analysis of variance test,
followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple-comparison test, was used to compare
the t1/2 values for plasma and the two brain regions. A probability level of 0.05
was chosen for hypothesis testing.

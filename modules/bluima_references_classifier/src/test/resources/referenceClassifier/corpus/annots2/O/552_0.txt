cells are also susceptible to trauma-induced pathological
changes. Mild TBI results in axonal degeneration in both
animals (Lewen et al., 1996 ; Saatman et al., 1998) and
man (Povlishock, 1993). Apoptosis of oligodendrocytes
has been demonstrated after moderate TBI (Conti et al.,
1998) and contusive spinal cord injury (Crowe et al.,
1997 ; Liu et al., 1997). It has been suggested that apoptosis of oligodendrocytes after traumatic CNS injury
may be a result of either the direct trauma or a secondary event due to loss of trophic support from the degenerating axons (Beattie et al., 1998). Our observations of
early (12^24 h) apoptotic changes in the injured white
matter together with the delayed and prolonged occurrence of axonal injury (24 h^1 week) (Saatman et al.,
1998) suggest that oligodendrocyte apoptosis may contribute to secondary axonal injury following mild TBI.
Further studies to validate this hypothesis are warranted.
To date, the pathobiology of mild TBI is poorly
understood. With this report, we provide critical information that apoptosis may contribute to the pathology
of mild TBI. Apoptotic cell death does occur in the acute
period following mild TBI, and apoptotic cells are predominantly localized to the area of maximal injury (cortex and underlying white matter). Our data add an
important piece to the growing picture that contains
regional patterns of neuronal loss, regional alterations
in the neuronal cytoskeleton, and increased gliosis and
recruitment of in£ammatory cells following mild TBI
(Lowenstein et al., 1992 ; Tanno et al., 1992 ; Aihara et
al., 1995 ; Hicks et al., 1996 ; Lewen et al., 1996 ; Saatman
et al., 1998). The di¡erences in the regional and temporal
distribution of apoptotic cell death between mild and
moderate TBI underscore the need for the use of experimental models of varying injury severity and for the
conceptualization of injury severity-dependent therapeutic intervention.

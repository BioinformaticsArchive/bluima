Histological verification of microdialysis probes implantation
After the microdialysis study, mice were killed by cervical
dislocation, brains were removed and stored at ) 40 C. To determine
the exact probe implantation in the frontal cortex or dorsal raphe
nucleus, brains were placed in a Kryomat apparatus and kept at
) 25 C. Brain regions were identified according to Hof et al. (2000)
`Mouse brains' atlas and coronal frozen section of brain sliced
serially at 40-lm intervals. Slices were realized from AP 1 to 2 mm
and AP ) 4 to ) 5 mm for the frontal cortex and the dorsal raphe
nucleus, respectively. Each slice was photographed using a digital
camera (PowerShot G1, Canon) and the implantation of the probe
estimated in comparison to the corresponding slices obtained by the
`Mouse brains' atlas software (Hof et al. 2000). Only mice with
probes confined to either the frontal cortex or the dorsal raphe
nucleus were used for subsequent data analysis (examples of a probe
implantation in the frontal cortex and the dorsal raphe nucleus are
given in Fig. 6a,b, respectively).

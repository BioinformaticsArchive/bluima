DSP-4 caused a significant depletion of TH- and DBH-ir fibers
in song control nuclei and sites of catecholaminergic synthesis

DSP-4 treatment significantly reduced TH-ir in HVC, LMAN
(Fig. 7B) and area X (Fig. 7A). DBH-ir was also reduced in HVC,
RA, LMAN (Figs 7D and 8) and area X (Figs 7C and 8).
The amount of TH-ir (Fig. 9A) and DBH-ir (Figs 9B and 10) in NE
synthesizing LC and SC was also significantly depleted by DSP-4
treatment. In the dopamine (DA) synthesizing nuclei VTA and SN,
TH- (Fig. 9A) and DBH- (Figs 9B and 10) ir fibers show a DSP-4-induced decrease, but this was only a trend and not a significant effect
of the noradrenergic-specific neurotoxin.

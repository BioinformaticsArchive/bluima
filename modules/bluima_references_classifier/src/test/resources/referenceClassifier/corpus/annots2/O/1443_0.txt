Morphine conditioned place preference. The protocol used was modified
from Romieu et al. (2002). All experiments took place in a dimly lit room.
On day 1, the rats received a single pre-exposure test in a Plexiglas shuttle
box (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) composed of two compartments of
equal size (20.3 15.9 21.3 cm) separated by a sliding door. One side
consisted of white walls, a grid floor, and a 60 W light, which was on
throughout the experiments. The other side had black walls, a smooth
plastic-covered floor, and was unlit throughout the experiments. The
procedure consisted of three different phases: preconditioning (day 1),
conditioning (days 2â€“5), and postconditioning days, as indicated in Re-sults. For the preconditioning phase, each rat was placed in the white
compartment with the door open. The animal was allowed to freely
explore the apparatus for 10 min. The time spent in each chamber was
recorded (unconditioned preference), and then the animals were re-turned to their home cages. Most animals spent approximately one-half
of the time in each chamber (see Results). Animals showing a strong
unconditioned preference ( 540 s), which were 2% of the total number, were discarded. On the subsequent 4 d, place preference conditioning was conducted using a counterbalanced procedure, such that onehalf of the animals in each experimental group were conditioned to the
spontaneously preferred side and the other half to the spontaneously
nonpreferred side. During conditioning, the animals received a subcutaneous injection of either morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle solution) and were confined for 30 min in the assigned compartment. The
postconditioning testing consisted of placing the animal into the white
compartment and allowing it to freely access both chambers for 10 min.
The amount of time that the animals spend in the conditioned chamber
was recorded (CPP score). Because the aim of this study was to determine
whether the reactivation of the memory trace causes the CPP to become
labile again, we chose not to administer vehicle solution and confine the
animals to the alternative compartment. In fact, exposure to a second
compartment not paired with the drug but with vehicle also results in
learning the contextual representation of that compartment (Pavlov,
1927; Bouton, 1993). Thus, to avoid any interference of this second learning trace on the mCPP and its reactivation, we performed only pairings
with morphine. The potential drawback of omitting the vehicle pairing
procedure is that CPP memory impairments could be confused with
novelty seeking. However, we addressed the issue of novelty with control
experiments described in Results, showing that no motivational effects of
novelty were seen in our experiments. Our results are in agreement with
previous data and conclusions on CPP, indicating that rats do not form a
place preference for a novel side over one experienced previously (Mucha
et al., 1982; Mucha and Iversen, 1984; van der Kooy, 1987; Bardo and
Bevins, 2000).
The re-experience of a conditioning trial (reinforced trial) and a re-minder conditioning consisted of a single morphine conditioning
session.
Protein synthesis inhibitors. For systemic treatments, anisomycin or
cycloheximide were injected subcutaneously at 210 mg/kg (Milekic and
Alberini, 2002) and 2.8 mg/kg (Squire et al. 1980), respectively. For double injection of cycloheximide, 2.2 mg/kg was used. These doses have
been shown previously to disrupt memory consolidation (Davis et al.,
1980; Squire et al., 1980; Milekic and Alberini, 2002). For local injections,
animals were injected bilaterally into the basolateral amygdala (BLA),
ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) with 0.5 l
of anisomycin at 125 g/ l (Quevedo et al., 1999; Schafe and LeDoux,
2000; Taubenfeld et al., 2001) delivered over 1.25 min. Bilateral injections into the hippocampus (HC) consisted of 1 l delivered over 2.5
min. Anisomycin was dissolved as described previously (Milekic and
Alberini, 2002). Cycloheximide was dissolved in DMSO and finally di-luted to 1%DMSO in saline. Vehicle solutions were prepared
accordingly.
Inhibition of protein synthesis. Groups of rats were injected intraperitoneally with 125 Ci L-[ 35S]methionine. Immediately after, they re-ceived an injection of either protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide
or anisomycin) or vehicle solution. One-half of these rats also received a

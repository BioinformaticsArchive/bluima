ABSTRACT
Vigabatrin (7-vinyl GABA), an enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, was ad-ministered orally to albino Sprague Dawley and pigmented Lister-Hooded rats. A dose-dependent retinal
lesion characterized histologically by disruption of the outer nuclear layer was observed in the Sprague
Dawley rat but not in Lister-Hooded rats, indicating that this alteration is related to the absence of pigment.
The lesion is similar to that induced in albino rats by light and certain drugs. In addition, myelin vacuolation
of the brain was observed in both rat strains, consistent with the findings of other toxicity studies with
vigabatrin. In all cases, the vacuolation was limited to myelinated tracts and resulted from separation of the
myelin sheath at the intraperiod line. There was no evidence of demyelination, axonal degeneration or
damagetocontiguouSstructuresintheaffectedareas.Thevacuolationishistologicallysimilartothatinduced
in rats by certain other compounds such as isoniazid, hexachlorophene, and triethyltin, but differs in that it
is focal in distribution, it is limited to the brain, and is reversible upon cessation of treatment.

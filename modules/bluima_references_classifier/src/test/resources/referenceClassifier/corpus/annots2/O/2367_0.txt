FIG. 2. Topographical organization of the VL arm area. Top row: cortical injection site (large black dot in
circle) and maximum spread of dark brown HRP reaction product (fine stipple) are indicated for three monkeys
(M2, M3, and M4). Middle and bottom row: relative density and distribution of thalamic neurons labeled by
retrograde HRP transport (small dots) following the cortical injections above each column. Middle row: A8.0;
bottom row: A1O.O. Note that labeled thalamic neurons occur more ventrally in the VL arm area as the injection
site is placed nearer the central sulcus. Bar adjacent to the cortical diagrams, 10 mm. Bar under the thalamic
outlines, 2 mm. Abbreviations in this figure are the same as in Fig. 1.

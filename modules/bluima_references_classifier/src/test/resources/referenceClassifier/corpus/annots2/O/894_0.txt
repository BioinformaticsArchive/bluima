Clinical examination

Five dogs with a history of progressive neurologic disease
were examined either at the University of Californiaâ€“Davis
Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (dog nos. 1, 2, 4, and
5) or at the Emergency Animal Hospital and Referral Center
in San Diego, CA (dog no. 3).
Each dog had a complete blood count, serum chemistry
profile, urinalysis, thoracic radiographs, and abdominal ul-trasound done. MRI of the head was done once on each dog
using a 0.4-T scanner (Resonex 5000, Resonex Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) except for dog no. 5, which was imaged six
times over a 3-month period as part of a clinical study. The
imaging sequences were obtained from transverse 5-mm

the lateral portions of the DR (Nanopoulos et al. 1982; Belin
et al. 1983; Mugnaini and Oertel 1985; Millhorn et al. 1987,
1988; Kachidian et al. 1991; Wang and Nakai 1993;
Esclapez et al. 1994; Ford et al. 1995; Stamp and Semba
1995; Gervasoni et al. 2000).
When comparing the expression of 5-HTT, GABAB
receptor and GAD mRNA in the raphe nuclei, the most
abundant mRNA species in terms of number of labelled cells
was the GABAB receptor mRNA. Conversely, GAD mRNA
was present only in a reduced number of raphe cells and it
was mainly found beyond the boundaries of the raphe nuclei.
By using double in situ hybridization we have visualized
the presence of GABAB receptor mRNA in different
populations of cells within the raphe nuclei, including
serotonergic (5-HTT mRNA-positive), GABAergic (GAD
mRNA-positive) and also a minority of non-serotonergic
non-GABAergic cells. One of our goals has been to evaluate
the proportions of single- versus double-labelled cells within
the raphe nuclei.
The degree of coexistence of GABAB receptor and 5-HTT
mRNAs in the raphe significantly varied from one nucleus to
the other. Thus, whereas in the DR and MnR all serotonergic
neurones exhibited GABAB receptor mRNA signal, in the
RMg these mRNA species were rarely found together.
Double-labelled cells represented a large proportion (84%) of
GABAB receptor mRNA-positive cells of the DR. This ratio
remained constant among the different cell groups (ventral
and dorsal portions and lateral wings) and along the
rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. In contrast, in the MnR,
we could discriminate between two groups of GABAB
receptor mRNA-positive cells: a ventral cluster (vMnR)
where only the 50% of cells co-expressed 5-HTT mRNA,
and a dorsal group (dMnR) with characteristics closer to the
DR. Cytoarchitectural differences between cells located in
the dorsal and ventral portions of the MnR have been
described before (Vertes and Crane 1997).
In addition to serotonergic cells, GABAB receptor mRNA
was also detected in all GAD mRNA-positive cell profiles
visualized within the boundaries of the raphe nuclei studied
here. This finding suggests that all GABAergic neurones in
the raphe express GABAB autoreceptors. This is in agreement with data from Liang et al. (2000) who reported that all
GABA neurones in the rat brain contain GABAB receptor
mRNA, with the unique exception of the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus. However, it should be mentioned that in
the tissue sections examined here we could observe GAD
mRNA in cells apparently devoid of GABAB receptor
mRNA in structures such as the periaqueductal gray, dorsal
nucleus of the lateral lemniscus or the inferior colliculus.
These midbrain nuclei were not the focus of the present study
and were not exhaustively examined. It should be noted also
that limitations in the sensitivity of our in situ hybridization
method might hinder the visualization of mRNAs present in
low densities.

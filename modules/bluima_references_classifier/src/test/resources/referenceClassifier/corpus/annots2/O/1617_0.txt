Introduction
In direct sensory pathways of the mammalian brain, axons projecting from thalamus to the primary sensory cortex have a stereotypic morphology. In the thalamus, they send collaterals to the
reticular nucleus and subsequently ascend through the internal
capsule to terminate in cortical layers VI and IV (Jones, 1985,
1986). Subcortically, the topological organization of thalamocortical axons (TCAs) undergoes distinct transformations (Adams et
al., 1997). In cortex, the spatial segregation of TCAs underlies the
functional parcellation (Blasdel and Lund, 1983; Humphrey et
al., 1985; Jensen and Killackey, 1987a; Antonini et al., 1998,
1999). During development, sensory activity is an important factor in determining the spatial distribution of TCAs as was demonstrated after visual deprivation in cats (Antonini and Stryker,
1993) and whisker follicle denervation in rats (Jensen and Killackey, 1987b). Detailed studies of thalamic projections in the
whisker-to-barrel pathway revealed that modifying neuronal
transmission in cortex influences the spatial configuration of
TCA during development. Blocking the activity through the
NMDA receptor in the conditional NR1 knock-out affects TCA
morphology but does not modify the cytoarchitectural differen-

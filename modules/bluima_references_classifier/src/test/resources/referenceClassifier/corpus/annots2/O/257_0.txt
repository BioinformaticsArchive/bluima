Fig. 3. Expression of galectin-3 and
GSA I-B4 binding sites in the facial nu-cleus of adult rat 14 (A, B) and 56 days
after facial nerve resection (C, D). Mi-crographs of coronal sections of the facial
nucleus were double-stained with polyclonal galectin-3 antibodies (A, C) and
GSA I-B4 (B, D). Note the varying in-tensities of galectin-3 immunoreactivity
in motoneuron cell bodies (A), i.e.,
more intense (arrowhead), weak (ar-row), or absent (double arrow), and the
lack of galectin-3 immunoreactivity in
GSA I-B4-labeled microglial cells surrounding an injured motoneuron (ar-rowhead in B). In C, D, note the lack of
galectin-3 immunoreactivity in GSA
I-B4-labeled phagocytotic microglia surrounding an injured galectin-3-labeled
motoneuron (arrowhead). Double arrow
in D indicates galectin-3-negative mi-croglia adjacent to a blood vessel. Scale
bar = 50 Î¼m.

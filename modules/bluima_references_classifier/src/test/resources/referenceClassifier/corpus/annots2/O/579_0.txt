48.4%, and SCPs in 11, 35.5%. Out of nine
patients of the BS– subgroup, ABRs were altered
in four cases, 44.4%, MLRs in two, 22.2%, and
SCPs in one, 11.1%. The differences between BS+
and BS– subgroups in the ABR, MLR, and SCP
abnormality incidences appeared thus impressive,
26.6, 26.2, and 24.4%, respectively. However, they
failed to reach the statistically significant level,
probably because of the limited number of observations, in particular of BS– cases. Furthermore, in
BS+ vs BS– patients severer AEP abnormalities,
e.g. ABR and MLR component missing, were
likely more frequent. A similar trend could also be
traced in cases of bilateral vs unilateral alterations.
As indicated, the alterations of ABRs occurred in
26 out of 40 patients tested, 65.0%. In 11 cases from
those, 27.5%, the abnormality concerned ABRs
only. In seven of remaining 15 patients the abnormality of ABRs was associated with that of MLRs,
17.5%, in four with that of SCPs, 10.0%, and also

pressure and heart rate increased progressively up to 4
min of hypoxic exposure.
CNS hypoxia. Figure 7 shows minute-by-minute
means of mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate
during exposure to our most severe level of hypoxia
(PaO = 37.9 6 1.2 Torr). The control values were

elevated relative to whole body controls. There were no
significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure or
heart rate in the first 3 min of hypoxic exposure,
although there was a slight trend toward increased
heart rate.

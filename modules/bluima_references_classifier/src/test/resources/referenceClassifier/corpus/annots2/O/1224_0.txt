and knock-out mice challenged with SEA or saline are presented
in Figure 3 (see Fig. 5 for the PVN).
To confirm that TNF / mice were not deficient in c-Fos
induction, an experiment was conducted in which knock-out and
wild-type mice were exposed to a psychogenic stressor (i.e., an
open field) and killed 1 h later. Increased c-Fos IR was widespread
throughout the brain. Quantitative data for the PVN is presented
in Figure 5, where it can be seen that both TNF / and TNF /
mice displayed significantly increased numbers of c-Fosimmunoreactive cells after exposure to the open field (F(1,14)
12.89; p 0.05).

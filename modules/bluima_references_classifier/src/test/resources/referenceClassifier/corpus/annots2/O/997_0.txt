cells were transferred onto poly-L-ornithine-coated glass
slides and cultured in the absence of EGF and bFGF to
facilitate the differentiation. DAPI nuclear staining suggested that ephrin-A1-Fc did not increase the cell number
and that cell death was apparently not induced by ephrinA1-Fc (data not shown). Staining with the anti-nestin antibody revealed that the number of nestin-positive cells was
gradually decreased between the 1-day and 5-day assay pe-riods, demonstrating the differentiation of neural precursor
cells under the condition we adopted (Fig. 3A). Cessation of
cell proliferation was clear, from the total number of the cells

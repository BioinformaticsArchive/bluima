component observed in the DIG EMG and
jaw-movement records (Fig. 3B). The effects
of this same stimulus to the Gi on the shortlatency jaw-opening response induced by
SPT stimulation (500 Hz, 3 pulses) of the
cortex is shown in Fig. 30 (control record is
3C). The intensity of the cortical stimulus
was adjusted to produce a DIG EMG re-sponse of amplitude comparable to that

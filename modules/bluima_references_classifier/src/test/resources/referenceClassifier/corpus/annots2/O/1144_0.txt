NeuroimagingStudies
SPECT was successfully performed in all 1 1 PSP pa
tients despite significant nuchal rigidity and dystonia. The
rotating gamma camera and three-dimensional data ac
quisition permitted important flexibility in patient posi
tioning. Visual comparison of SPECT images of 11 PSP
patients and 10 normal control subjects revealed wide
spread reductions in cortical IMP uptake in PSP that were
most prominent in superior frontal regions (Fig. 2). Cal
culated relative IMP uptake was significantly lower in PSP
patients compared to control subjects in 16/24 cortical
regions and in basal ganglia regions (Fig. 3). The greatest
reductions in uptake were in superior frontal regions (de
creased by 25%; p < 0.01), and in basal ganglia regions
(decreased by 21%; p < 0.01). Significant decreases were
also detected in anterior parietal (19%; p < 0.05) and
inferior frontal (18%; p < 0.05) regions. No significant
percent asymmetry or right-leftbias differencewas found
between patients and control subjects in any of the 13
pairs of brain regions. Significant differences in regional
relative IMP uptake were not found between patients with
CT or MR evidence of hemisphere atrophy (n = 4) and
those without evidence of atrophy (n = 4).
One PSP patient's brain at autopsy was compared to his
SPECT study in corresponding coronal planes (Fig. 4).
Gross pathologic examination showed a normal cortical
ribbon, mild ventricular enlargement, and atrophy of deep
gray structures. In contrast, this patient's SPECT study
demonstrated cortical IMP uptake that was markedly db
normal, especially in the frontal lobes. Histopathologic
examination of this brain revealed the characteristic find
ings of PSP (2). Neurofibrillary tangles were found in
periaquaductal gray, loci coerulei, and raphe nuclei, but
not in multiple samples of cerebral cortex.

Materials and Methods
Animals
One hundred and fifty-five female Wistar rats of 24
months were surveyed. After necropsy, the presence of
spontaneous pituitary adenomas was confirmed in 90.
The animals were maintained from birth under standard
housing conditions. They were sacrificed between 10.00
and 11.00 h under anesthesia with sodium pentothal.
Immediately afterwards, the skulls were opened and
the pituitaries, with or without tumors, were carefully
removed and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline (PBS: 0.1 M, pH 7.4,
plus 0.8% NaCl) for 24 h at 4â—¦C and then washed in PBS

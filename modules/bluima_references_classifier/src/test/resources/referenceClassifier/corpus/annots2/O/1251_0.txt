and in animals subjected to sham injury (64%). These
findings indicate that blockade of the L-type calcium channel
reduces the number of new neurons after cerebral ischemia
by preventing cell proliferation, rather than by interfering
with maturation.
Our previous study in rats in which animals were treated
intraperitoneally with nimodipine three consecutive times
every 24 h before MCAO showed that nimodipine significantly reduced the size of the infarct (Zhu et al. 1999).
Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the inhibition of cell
proliferation caused by nimodipine could be indirect and
related to its neuroprotective action. However, arguing
against this hypothesis, as can be seen (Fig. 3a), in this

Lysolecithin lesions (Blakemore et al., 1977; Hall,
1972) are caused by a detergent, which exerts its effects
most conspicuously on myelin but also has direct effects
on other cell membranes including those of astrocytes and axons (Blakemore et al., 1977). Theiler√ïs virus
(Rodriguez et al., 1991) and EAE (Raine, 1985) cause
scattered, multifocal lesions that may become confluent and whose location cannot be predicted precisely.
Cuprizone (Blakemore, 1974) causes diffuse lesions,
which, however, occur consistently in the superior cerebellar peduncles (Ludwin, 1978; Hiremath et al., 1998).
The lesion we have described, which is mediated by
IgM antiglycolipid antibodies, is discretely localized to
a predetermined site. Thus, we have created an experimental lesion, caused by a known antibody in a specific
location, consisting of demyelination and spontaneous
remyelination with relative, but by no means complete,
sparing of axons.

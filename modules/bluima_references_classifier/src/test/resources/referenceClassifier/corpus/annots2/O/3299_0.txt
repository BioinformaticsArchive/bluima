Fig. 1. The age-related impairment in ability to sustain LTP is restored in rats fed on a diet supplemented with docosahexanoic acid. The mean slope of the
population EPSP evoked by test stimuli delivered at 30-s intervals before and after tetanic stimulation (arrow) is shown for four- (A) and 22-month-old (B) rats
fed on a control diet (open symbols) or an experimental diet (filled symbols). Population EPSP slope is expressed as a percentage of the slope recorded in the
5 min immediately prior to tetanic stimulation and results are presented as means ( S.E.M.). Standard errors are included for every 10th response and are so
small as to be obscured in some cases.

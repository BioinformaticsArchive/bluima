*Shows the fraction of brain water (BW), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
solid brain (SB), and the water content of brain [Î²MR = SBW /
( SBW + SSB)] in ten subjects from spectroscopy- and imaging-based
compartmentation analysis. Statistical significance of the difference
in results from the two methods was estimated by paired t test;
statistically different (P < 0.05) results shown in bold. SD, standard
deviation.

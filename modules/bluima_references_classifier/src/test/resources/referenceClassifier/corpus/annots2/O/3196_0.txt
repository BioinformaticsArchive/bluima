demonstrated the typical post-trauma undulated orientation (Fig.
6 E, F ). At the strain of 75%, there was modest uptake of dye, only
in axons that had been severed (primary axotomy) (Fig. 6G, H ).
Axons not severed at these higher strains were not permeable to
the dye. In severed axons, the extent of dye uptake appeared to be
less than that for chemically permeabilized axons on the basis of
the general intensity of the fluorescence signal. Therefore, after
stretch injury, dye was not taken up by the axons unless axotomy
had occurred.

HT R cells were pretreated with the
6

Fyn inhibitor PP2. Pretreatment
with PP2 for 25 min led to a significant decrease in activation of
ERK1/2 by 5-HT without any effect
from PP2 alone (54.9 5.4% of control, n 4, p 0.001; Fig. 5B).
Because PP2 has also been known to
inhibit Src-like tyrosine kinase, we
cannot rule out any possibility for
involvement of Src tyrosine kinase.
Therefore, we tried to interfere in
the interaction between 5-HT R
6

and Fyn by overexpression of the
Fyn-SH3 domain, as we did in Fig.
4D. As shown in Fig. 5C, overexpression of the Fyn-SH3 domain
significantly reduced activation of
ERK1/2 by 5-HT (69.7 2.8% of
control, n 3, p 0.001). Second,
we attempted to test the role of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase
(PKA) in the signaling pathway
because 5-HT R increases cAMP
6

through release of GTP-bound G
s

protein, which then activates PKA
(5–7). When CHO/5-HT R cells
6

were pretreated with the PKA
inhibitor H89 (20 M) for 25 min,
activation of ERK1/2 by 5-HT was
partially but significantly reduced,
as shown in Fig. 5D (89.3 2.4% of
control, n 3, p 0.05). These
results suggest that activation of
ERK1/2 by 5-HT through 5-HT R is
6

mainly through Fyn-dependent as
well as partial PKA-dependent
pathways.

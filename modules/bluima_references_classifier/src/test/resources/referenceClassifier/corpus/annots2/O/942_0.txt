(positions 1694 –1719). The amplification conditions were as follows:
94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 74°C for 60 s, for 30 cycles. The PCR
products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The
RT-PCR product amplified from kidney was subcloned into the
EcoRV site of pBluescript SKII( ) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a
BKL kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Both strands of the subcloned cDNA
inserts were subjected to DNA sequencing (model 4200; Li-COR,
Lincoln, NE), and cDNA clones with base sequences 100% identical
to the coding region of Roct were isolated. Then, the Roct cDNA was
cut out from pBluescript SKII( )/Roct using BamHI and EcoRI and
subcloned into pGEM-HEN for in vitro transcription.
Functional Expression of Roct in X. laevis Oocytes. Capped
cRNA of Roct was transcribed from NotI-linearized pGEM-HEN
containing Roct cDNA with T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (Deguchi et al., 2002). pGEM-HEN contains 3 and 5 -untranslated regions of Xenopus -globin, which stabilize RNA and enhance
the protein synthesis efficiency in the oocyte expression system (Li-man et al., 1992). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 50 nl of
water or capped Roct cRNA (10 ng) and incubated in Barth's solution
[88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM
MgSO4, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM HEPES] containing 50 g/ml
gentamicin and 2.5 mM pyruvate, pH 7.4, at 20°C. After incubation
for 3 days, uptake experiments were performed.
Uptake by Oocytes. The uptake experiment was initiated by
replacing the ND96 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM
CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) with one containing
radiolabeled substrate and terminated by addition of ice-cold ND96
solution after a 1-h incubation at 20°C. In previous studies using
OAT3-expressing oocytes, the uptake kinetics of [3H]E1S, [14C]- or
[3H]PAH, [3H]methotrexate, and [3H]cimetidine were determined at
1 h as well (Kusuhara et al., 1999; Cha et al., 2001), as was also the
case in studies of [3H]estradiol 17 -D-glucuronide, [3H]indoxyl sulfate, [3H]homovanillic acid, [14C]glutarate, and [14C]salicylic acid
uptake (Cha et al., 2001; Ohtsuki et al., 2002; Mori et al., 2003). The
concentrations of radiolabeled substrates were different due to the
differences in the specific radioactivity of substrates. Therefore, the
transport activity was normalized by substrate concentration and
indicated in the unit of microliters/(hour oocyte). Na -free ND96
solution was prepared by equimolar replacement of NaCl with choline chloride. In the case of Cl -free ND96 solution, NaCl, KCl,
CaCl2, and MgCl2 were replaced with equimolar sodium gluconate,
potassium gluconate, calcium gluconate, and magnesium gluconate,
respectively. Oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold ND96
solution and solubilized in 5% SDS, and the accumulated radioactiv-

root at supramaximal intensity (40 V) and 20 Hz with
2-ms pulses for 10 s. The amount of submaxillary
salivation produced by intravenous administration of
methacholine at dosesof 10e7,lo-$ 10w5,and low4g/kg
was0 (n = 5), 28.9 t 4.5 (n = ll), 197.7 t 26.9 (n = ll),
and 426.0 t 106.6 mg (n = 6), respectively. Methacholine (10F6 g/kg)-induced salivation was not affected by
prior treatment with either clonidine (86.3 t 6.1% of
response before clonidine, n = 6, NS) or yohimbine
(113.1 t 10.7% of response before yohimbine, n = 6,
NS). The salivation elicited by facial nerve root stimulation was markedly reduced by clonidine (65.1 t 5.8% of
response before clonidine, n = 6, P < 0.05) but potentiated by yohimbine (141.1 t 2.7% of response before
yohimbine, n = 6, P < 0.05). Prior treatment with
scopolamine (10e4 g/kg iv) completely abolished the
salivary secretion induced by either methacholine (0% of
response before scopolamine, n = 6, P < 0.001) or facial
nerve root stimulation (0% of response before scopolamine, n = 6, P < 0.001).
Effects of clonidine and yohimbine on sympathetically
induced salivation. Figure 6 shows the effects of phentolamine (1 mg/kg), propranolol (1 mg/ kg), scopolamine
(0.1 mg/kg), hexamethonium (1 and 10 mg/kg), clonidine (10 pg/kg), and yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg) on the
submandibular salivary secretion evoked by electrical
stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve at supramaximal intensity (8 V) and 20 Hz with 2-ms pulses for
10 s. The amount of submaxillary salivation elicited by
sympathetic nerve stimulation under the conditions
described above was 64.9 t 14.3 mg (n = 11). The
sympathetic nerve-induced salivation was markedly re-duced by phentolamine (4.9 t 3.6% of response before
phentolamine, n = 5, P < 0.001) and by hexamethonium at either dose used (65.3 t 6.9% and 3.4 t 2.1% of
response before hexamethonium at doses of 1 and 10
w/kg, n = 5, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively).
Propranolol, scopolamine, clonidine, and yohimbine had
no significant effect on the SMG salivation elicited by
sympathetic stimulation.

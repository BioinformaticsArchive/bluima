evidence in support of the presence of D 2 receptors
on non-DA neurons, especially as it pertains to DA
modulation of GABA neurons in the SNr. 16"58
Futhermore, we observed reaction product in a small
number of axon terminals in the D2-LI material
(Figs 5-7), whereas axon terminals in the SNc rarely
exhibit TH immunoreactivity.~
In an earlier study, Smith et al. 53 reported a loss of
57% of the TH-positive cells in the SNc of eightweek-old mutant weavers. The present study, using
animals of the same age, revealed a 37% loss of D2-LI
cells in the SNc. This also suggests that not all D 2
receptors are located on DA neurons. This conclusion is further supported by the immunocytochemical
study of Ariano et al., 5 who demonstrated D 2 receptor localization on striatonigral neurons. Additionally, in another ongoing study (unpublished
observations), D2 and GABA immunoreactivity were
co-localized in a small group of profiles in the SNc,
although the majority of structures displayed either
D2-LI or GABA-LI. Finally, intrastriatal injections
of volkensin, a retrograde "suicide transporter",
caused a 60 79% decrease of TH-positive cells in the
SNc, but only 35-56% decrease of D2 receptor binding sites\]Â°This presence of D2 receptors on non-DA
profiles in the SNc suggests a local regulation of
nigral DA neurons.

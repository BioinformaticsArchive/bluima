ing in the LSi was decreased by permanent lesions, the
feeding response to LH stimulation was increased (32).
Together, these data suggest LSi inhibition of LH feeding signals and also implicate UCN and orexin A as
neuropeptides that permit communication between the
LSi and the LH in the control of feeding.
There are some inconsistencies related to the timing
of feeding inhibition in these studies. In experiment 3,
reversal of UCN-induced inhibition of deprivation-in-duced feeding by -hCRH occurred in the first hour
(Fig. 8), whereas in experiment 5, the effect of -hCRH
on UCN inhibition of LH orexin A-induced feeding only
occurred after 1 h (Fig. 10). The second discrepancy
relates to the feeding-inhibitory effect of LSi-injected
UCN. In most experiments, UCN was effective in de-creasing feeding within the first hour (Figs. 3, 6, and 8).
However, in one experiment, the effect was significant only after hour 1 (Fig. 9). Although there is no
clear explanation for these differences, variations in
strength of feeding stimulus (deprivation vs. orexin A
stimulation), random day effects, and unknown be-tween-lot differences in efficacy of peptides are potential explanations that may account for some of the
variability observed.
In conclusion, UCN in the LSi inhibits deprivationinduced feeding without producing a CTA, and the
inhibitory effect lasts up to 24 h. Furthermore, UCN in
the LSi inhibits feeding induced by orexin A in the LH,
suggesting alteration of signaling mechanisms be-tween the LSi and the LH. Finally, the inhibitory effect
of UCN in the LSi on deprivation- and orexin A-in-duced feeding is blocked by antagonism of CRH receptor. Together, these data define the LSi region as an
important site for UCN-induced anorexia mediated by
CRHR2 and suggest that LSi UCN may influence
orexin A feeding signals in the LH.

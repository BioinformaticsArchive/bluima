Abstract
Attempts have been made to attribute the particular features of general anaesthesia such as hypnosis, analgesia, amnesia and
autonomic stability to certain brain regions. In the present study, we examined the effects of the commonplace volatile anaesthetic
isoflurane on synaptic transmission in an in vitro slice preparation of the murine amygdala. Despite the established role of this limbic
structure in the formation of aversive memories, conditioned fear and anxiety, as well as pain processing and regulation of
sympathetic tone, the influence of volatile anaesthetics on synaptic signalling has not yet been investigated in this region of the brain.
Evoked postsynaptic currents were monitored from principal neurons in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala by means of patchclamp recording. The mixed postsynaptic currents were mediated by non-NMDA, NMDA, GABAA and GABAB receptors. Isoflurane
added to the perfusion medium reduced the strength of synaptic signalling following the activation of non-NMDA, NMDA, and GABAB
receptors, whereas the GABAA receptor-mediated responses were enhanced. The overall reduction of neuronal excitability was also
reflected in a reduction of field potential amplitudes. Isoflurane neither changed the membrane resting potential nor the input
resistance of principal neurons in the amygdala. The present results may contribute to the understanding of how stress reactions and
long-lasting neuroplastic processes are suppressed under general anaesthesia.

measured volume smaller than half the volume of the average
of the normal bulbs was defined as hypoplastic. If no bulb was
visible, we recorded aplasia of the bulb. Volumes of the olfactory tracts were not measured. The maximum length and depth
of the olfactory sulcus on both sides were measured in all study
subjects.
Because voxel size on the T1-weighted SE images was 0.5031
mm3 compared with 1 mm3 on the MP-RAGE images, and
because the structures of interest ran perpendicular to the 2D
images, we used the T1-weighted images to measure the volume of the olfactory bulbs and maximum depth of the olfactory
sulci. Length of the olfactory sulci was measured along the axial
reformation of the 3D data sets to reduce influences of partialvolume effects at the end of the olfactory sulci on the 2D
images. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed
by three readers (N.D.A., V.H., T.H.), and consensus was
reached on the basis of manual segmentation.
To render the data less biased in terms of head size, relative
lengths and depths of the olfactory sulci were computed as
percentages of head size. For this, the maximum inner coronal
diameter of the anterior base of the skull was measured. In
addition, measurements of the depth of the olfactory sulci were
performed in all subjects in a selected section of the acquired
coronal T1-weighted SE images. To confirm identical section
positions for this measurement, the most posterior coronal
section through the eyeballs was used; on at least one side, a
partial volume cut of the eyeballs had to be visible. This section
was named the “plane of the posterior tangent through the
eyeballs” (PPTE) (Fig 1).
By using the 3D data sets, qualitative analyses of asymmetries and volume loss were performed by three readers in
consensus (N.D.A., V.H., T.H.) with regard to frontal and
temporal lobes, prepiriform cortex, periamygdaloid area, and
piriform lobe.

Figure 4. Neuropilin-2 mediates the attractive effect of mPFC on mdDA rostral mVTA axons. A–C , In situ hybridization shows expression of npn-1 (B) and npn-2 (C) within the TH-positive (A)
mdDA system (A –C ). The boxes in A–C are enlarged in A –C . Note the expression of npn-2 (C ) in specific neuronal subsets. D, E, Immunostaining of coronal sections for TH (green) and Npn-2
(red) counterstained with fluorescent Nissl (blue) shows Npn-2-positive cells (D, arrowheads) within the TH-positive rostral mVTA. D , Enlargement of the area indicated by top arrowhead in
D shows colocalization of a subset of TH-positive cells with Npn-2 (arrowheads). E, Npn-2 (red) is present in the TH-positive MFB. F, Npn-1 (red) is present in cells of the IZ and CP. G, Axons within
the SP of the mPFC are Npn-2-positive (boxed area enlarged on the right, arrowheads) and colocalize with TH (H, arrowheads). I, Representative examples of cocultures of rostral mVTA and mPFC
explants in the presence of IgG-Fc, Npn-1-Fc, or Npn-2-Fc immunostained for TH (green). The arrowheads indicate the growth cones (leading edge) of some of the longest TH-positive neurites.
J, Quantification of the length of TH-positive neurites in the proximal and distal quadrants of rostral mVTA/mPFC cocultures in the presence of IgG-Fc (n 13), Npn-1-Fc (n 12), or Npn-2-Fc (n
9). Graph shows average P/D ratio SEM. Three independent blocking experiments were performed. *p 0.05; **p 0.01, one-way ANOVA (compared with control IgG-Fc). Note the ability of
Npn-2-Fc to block the positive effect of mPFC on rostral mVTA axons. aca, Anterior commissure; CP, cortical plate; CPu, caudate–putamen; D, dorsal; fr, fasciculus retroflexus; IZ, intermediate zone;

Figure 5. Regulation of sEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons after hypoxia-induced seizures at
P10. A, Representative traces show that the sEPSC frequency (but not amplitude) was significantly increased after hypoxia-induced seizures. B, Summary of the regulation of sEPSCs after
hypoxic seizures from the pooled data shows that the sEPSC frequency was significantly in-creased from 1.13 0.17 Hz (n 4) to 1.94 0.19 Hz (n 7; *p 0.05), whereas the
amplitude was not significantly changed, with values of 24.3 9.2 pA (n 4) for controls and
18.8 4.4 pA (n 7) for the hypoxia-treated group.

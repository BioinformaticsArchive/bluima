ropsychiatric diseases. Schizophrenia is considered to be associated with an attenuated flow of hippocampal output (Gray
1998; Gray et al. 1991; Joyce 1993; Mogenson et al. 1993).
Functional neuroimaging studies of schizophrenics suggest an
abnormal information flow between the hippocampal formation and the prefrontal cortex (Weinberger et al. 1992). As
schizophrenia is associated with a hyperfunction of the dopaminergic system (Gray et al. 1995b; Joyce 1993; Joyce and
Meador-Woodruff 1997), an enhanced DA-induced depression
of the excitatory drive onto subicular cells may cause abnormalities in the hippocampal output. Considering that antagonists at DA receptors have a high antipsychotic potency, the
subiculum may represent a potential site of action. A reduction
of the DA-induced inhibition of glutamate release by D1 an-tagonists may partially restore the diminished hippocampal
information transfer.

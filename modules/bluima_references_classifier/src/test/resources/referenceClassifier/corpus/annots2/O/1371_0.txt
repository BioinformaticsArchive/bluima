Experiment 1
Behavior during exposure phase
During encounters across the wire mesh, all males spent time
investigating each other, often moving back and forth together,
suggesting that they were aware of the presence of another animal. They also spent time sniffing at the wire mesh (presumably
getting information about the other male) and grooming. Two
hours after these encounters, each male in groups 1 and 2 fought
with a second stimulus male. Encounters started with mutual
sniffing, circling, and agonistic postures [including upright and
sideways postures (Johnston, 1985)], and then the animals
fought until a winner and loser became apparent. All subjects in
both groups lost fights to the aggressively experienced stimulus
males. Losers generally fled rapidly and jumped out of the arena.
In encounters 2 and 3, losers fled immediately after noticing their
opponents in the arena (supplemental video, available at www.j-neurosci.org as supplemental material). Subjects escaped more
quickly in successive encounters (F(2,21) 82.96; p 0.001). For
males in group 1, the escape latency in encounter 1 (47.58
3.70 s) was significantly longer than in encounter 2 (8.03 1.40 s;
t(7) 12.42; p 0.001) and encounter 3 (5.97 0.62 s; t(7)

and circuitry present may explain the differences in tissue reactivity to A de- posits between cortical areas and the
striatum. A full understanding of these
factors may provide important clues for
the development of therapies that could
help protect cortical neurons from the
toxic effects of A .
It will be important to address the
cause of the very early amyloid deposition
in the striatum of the PS1 mutation carriers. Although the reason is not yet known,
we also have seen disproportionate retention of PiB in the striatum of an APP mu- tation carrier and a nondemented Down
syndrome subject (our unpublished ob- servations), although both of these cases
had more cortical involvement than any of
the PS1 mutation carriers included in this
report. These early-onset forms of AD all
share overproduction of A (particularly
the 42 amino acid form) as a proposed

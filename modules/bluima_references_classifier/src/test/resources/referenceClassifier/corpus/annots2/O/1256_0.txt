We used the Cavalieri principle of stereological volume measurements (Gundersen, 1988 ; West and
Gundersen, 1990). The Cavalieri principle refers to a
method of obtaining an unbiased estimate of the
volume of a structure by superimposing a randomly
offset 3D grid on the data and counting the number of
equally sized cubes within a structure. This principle
was incorporated in software developed in our laboratory (Barta et al., 1997). The cubes were defined by
the distance between the same points across slices.
Each cube had sides of equal length. All points (intersection of grid lines) which fall within the object of
interest are selected, and the total number of selected
points provides an estimate of the volume of the object.
In order to enhance grey/white matter contrast
proton and T2 images were added together. T2 images
were subtracted from proton images to enhance CSF to
brain contrast (Schlaepfer et al., 1994, 1995). A 3D
Cavalieri grid (12r12r12 voxels) was randomly
placed on the image. Each dot, which was placed by
the program on a grey-matter pixel, was selected to
measure total grey matter, including all brain, cerebellum, and brainstem down to and including the
level of the base of the cerebellum. Each white-matter
dot in the same area was (in a separate measurement)
selected on the same grid to measure total white matter. A smaller (6r6r1 voxel) grid and the same technique were used to measure grey and white matter in
the frontal lobe (Figure 1). A 2r2r1 voxel Cavalieri
grid placed on the difference image was used to
measure the lateral ventricles. All grids, which fell on
CSF in either lateral ventricle, were selected for this
measurement. Choroid plexus was not included in the
CSF measurement.

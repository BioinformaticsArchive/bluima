FIG. 2. H-Ras interacts via the Src kinase domain. a, 35S-labeled
deletion proteins were incubated with H-Ras-GST-agarose (5 g; lanes
4 – 6). Complexes were washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed
by fluorography. Control in vitro translated products (0.1 volume of
binding assay; lanes 1–3) are also shown. n 3. b, H-Ras-GST-agarose
was preincubated with equivalent amounts of either control in vitro
translation (empty plasmid; lane 1) or unlabeled Src kinase domain
(KD; lane 2) for 1 h. An equivalent amount of radiolabeled KD was
added to both reactions, and the incubation was continued for a further
2 h. Protein complexes were washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and
analyzed by fluorography as above. n 3.

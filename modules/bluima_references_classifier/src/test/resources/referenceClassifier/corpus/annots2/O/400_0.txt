Davis, 1997), whereas expression of freezing was blocked by AP-5
injections into the L A (Maren et al., 1996b; Lee and K im, 1998).
Lee and Kim (1998) suggested two possible reasons for this
discrepancy: First, there may be different outputs within the
amygdala mediating different aspects of fear. The output mediating conditioned freezing might be NMDA receptor dependent,
whereas the output mediating fear-potentiated startle might be
NMDA receptor independent. Second, these different fear measures also act in different time windows. Short fear responses such
as the potentiation of the startle response might be NMDA
receptor independent, whereas long-lasting fear responses such as
freezing might be NMDA receptor dependent. Furthermore, they
speculated about possible differences within the conditioning
procedures.
The debate regarding whether NMDA receptors within the
amygdala are essential for the expression of conditioned fear or
not is not just a methodological discussion; it is of theoretical
importance because conclusions about the neural mechanisms of
acquisition and expression of conditioned fear hinge on the an-swer (cf. LeDoux, 2000). For example, do different labeled
sensory-motor lines or a single output of the amygdala control
different fear responses? Do amygdaloid NMDA receptors control different things in different kinds of fear-conditioning tasks?
The aim of the present study was to clarify the discrepancy
between the different studies investigating the role of amygdaloid
NMDA receptors in the expression of conditioned fear. Therefore, different doses of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 were
injected into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the expression of fear-potentiated startle as well as conditioned freezing was
tested. An experimental design was used in which both fearpotentiated startle and conditioned freezing can be simultaneously measured within the same experimental session so that
potential differences in experimental condition can be excluded.

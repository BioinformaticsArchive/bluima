Contrary to the above hypothesis, however, bath application of
IbTX (100 nM) caused no significant enhancement of any of the
fEPSPs during the train (Fig. 7 B, C) (n 5). Likewise, similar
high-frequency EPSP or EPSC trains evoked in CA1 pyramidal
cells during whole-cell recording (n 3) or intracellular recording with sharp electrodes (n 2) were not measurably enhanced
by IbTX (60 â€“120 nM) (Fig. 9A2,A3,B).
In a minority of the field potential (1 of 5) and intracellular
recordings (1 of 5), however, IbTX application was followed by a

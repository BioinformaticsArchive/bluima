FLU, fluoxetine; NOR, norfluoxetine; nd, not detectable. Data represent mean 6
S.E.M. of seven to eight rats per group.
a Detection limit in plasma was 10 nM for fluoxetine, 6 nM for norfluoxetine.
b Detection limit in brain tissue was 0.15 pmol/mg wet weight tissue for fluoxetine, 0.20 pmol/mg for norfluoxetine.
c Mean represents two of seven rats with levels near the detection limit (mean =
13.0 6 3.0 nM) and the remaining five rats with undetectable levels.
d Mean represents four of seven rats with levels near the detection limit (mean =
0.23 6 0.06 pmol/mg) and the remaining three rats with undetectable levels.
e Mean represents three of eight rats with levels near the detection limit (mean =
0.24 6 0.03 pmol/mg) and the remaining five rats with undetectable levels.

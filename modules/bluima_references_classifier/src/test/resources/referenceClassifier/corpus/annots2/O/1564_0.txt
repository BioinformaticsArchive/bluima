Calpains in the brains of patients with AD

Calpains are known to regulate the activities of various
enzymes, including several protein kinases and phosphatases that modify the cytoskeleton in addition to
direct cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins (Lebart &
Benyamin, [28a]). Alterations in calcium homeostasis
in AD pathogenesis [29] associated with calpain overactivation [30] have been proposed to play an important role in the development of cytoskeletal pathology
and neurodegeneration. Calpain activation has been
found in clinical brain specimens of AD. For example,
calpain 2 was demonstrated to be present in % 75% of

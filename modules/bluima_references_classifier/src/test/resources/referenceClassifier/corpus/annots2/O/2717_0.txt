(GRe), and catalase (CAT). Other essential components are the biosynthetic pathways for glutathione and
NADPH that supply the reducing equivalents for
GSHPx and GRe, and various low molecular weight
antioxidants such as vitamin E and vitamin C.
Within the brain there is difference in the response
to oxidative stress between different cellular types,
such as neurons and glial cells4; furthermore it is
known that antioxidant capacity of neurons in culture
is lower than that of glia in culture.5
It is also known that neurons are more vulnerable
than glia to insults such as ischemia, hypoxia, brain
trauma,6 all conditions in which oxidative stress is
thought to play primary or secondary roles.'
Most of the previous data have been obtained on
primary cell culture or on purified subcellular fractions,
and little is known about the response to oxidative
stress and about antioxidant capacity of neurons and
glia purified from CNS. For this reason we wanted to

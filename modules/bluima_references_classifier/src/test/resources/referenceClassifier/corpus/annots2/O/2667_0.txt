when testing delayed reponse in monkeys with hippocampal lesions. Furthermore, monkeys
are standardly tested with only very short retention delays (often only up to 5 set) while in the
present delayed nonmatching-to-position task rats were tested over much greater delays. On
those occasions that hippocampectomized monkeys have been given longer delays more
distinct deficits have been observed ([87,89] but see Ref. [13]). A final anomaly concerns the
report that fornicotomy need not affect delayed response in monkeys [SS], even with delays
of 30 sec. Inspection of this study does, however, reveal that the two monkeys receiving
complete fornix transection via a direct neurosurgical approach were markedly impaired,
suggesting that fornicotomy can produce performance deficits.
In summary, it has been found that one particular spatial test for working memory,
delayed nonmatching-to-position, provides clear evidence that the anterior thalamic nuclei
can have an important role in memory. While this role can be closely linked with the fornical
inputs to this nucleus, it does not appear to rely on afferents from the mamillary bodies.
When this finding is combined with a re-analysis of anatomical and clinical evidence
concerning diencephalic amnesia, it can be seen that there is considerable support for the
notion that anterior thalzmic nucleus dysfunction plays an important role in diencephalic
amnesia. It now remains to test this possibility more directly using a wider variety of learning
tasks and extending the studies from rats to nonhuman primates.
The present findings also support the notion that medial temporal amnesia and
diencephalic amnesia should be regarded as closely related phenomena. This does not,
however, mean that they need appear identical: Clearly diencephalic processing must be
contributing something new to the incoming limbic information and hence the consequences
of selective damage in these two regions may differ. This naturally leads to the final question
of what it is that anterior thalamic activity adds to the information relayed from the
hippocampus. Very little is presently known about such activity, although studies of
avoidance learning by rabbits reinforce the view that it is necessary to consider the anterior
thalamic nuclei in the context of both their hippocampal and cingulate connections 124,251.
These avoidance studies have also led to the proposal that the connections between the
anterior thalamic nuclei and the posterior cingulate cortex form part of a mnemonic system
that maintains representations of persistent and repeating task events [24, 251. In contrast,
the present delayed nonmatching-to-position studies indicate that the anterior thalamic
nuclei are involved in the processing of relatively brief, inconsistent events. Clearly there is a
need to resolve these apparent differences and so uncover the contributions of the anterior
thalamic-cingulate connections to new learning.

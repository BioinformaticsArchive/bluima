not uniform, there is ample evidence for pre- and
postsynaptic dopaminergic deficits in the aged
human46 and aged rodent43 brain, and for their
role in age-associated locomotor impairments.51
Signs of motor dysfunction are frequent in the
elderly44,56 and the prevalence of movement disorders increases with ageing.3 Although not always
severe, age-associated motor impairments, such as
slow movement, stooped posture and shuffling
gait, greatly impede the quality of life of the
elderly.
Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in the
potential therapeutic value of gangliosides, in particular of GM1, for combating neuronal injury and
degeneration. GM1 has been shown not only to
improve neurotransmitter deficits, neuronal
morphology and behavioral deficits in models of
neurodegenerative diseases,28 but to have therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials as well.53 The ageing
brain appears to respond to the neurorestorative
effects of GM1. Indeed, GM1 administered systematically to aged rats enhances the reduced choline
uptake activity, choline acetyltransferase activity
and acetylcholine content,21,22,26 restores the size
and the number of choline acetyltransferase- and
p75-immunopositive neurons in the forebrain and

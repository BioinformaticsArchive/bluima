other hand, the binaural cues are relatively little affected by changes in sound frequency. If
a sound source is centered directly on the
midline, the magnitude of the binaural time
and intensity cues will not change significantly
with changes in sound frequency. Furthermore, sounds located on one or the other side
of midline will generally be associated with an
earlier or more intense stimulation of the ear
nearer the sound source regardless of the frequency content of the stimulus. Therefore, for
the midline tests employed in the present
study, the binaural cues do not depend on
sound frequency.
The distinction between midline and lateral
field localization provides some support for
the idea that auditory cortex plays a role in
resolving the ambiguity of binaural cues, but
whether this can be related to the neuroanatomical or neurophysiological organization of
the primary auditory cortex remains to be
seen. Further studies of the properties of the
ferret's auditory cortex are necessary before a
correspondence of structure and function can
be demonstrated.

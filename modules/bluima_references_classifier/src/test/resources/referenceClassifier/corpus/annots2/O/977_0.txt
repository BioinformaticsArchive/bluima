control subject, S1. As expected from previous studies, the
coherence was restricted to the 15- to 30-Hz range and showed
clear task-dependent modulation. Coherence was abolished
during the movement but was present during both hold periods
and was greatest during the second hold period after the
movement. This is in complete contrast to the corresponding
time-frequency coherence map for GL (Fig. 2B), where any
significant coherence was weak and showed no clear modulation with the task. This is more clearly shown for the corresponding power and coherence spectra averaged over a 2-s
period from 4 to 6 s during the second hold period (Fig. 2,
Eâ€“G). Figure 2E shows coherence spectra between EMGs from
1DI and AbPB for S1 (solid) and for GL (dotted lines). Figures
2F and G show the power spectra for the two muscles. The
coherence and power spectra were averaged over the 2-s time
window during the second hold period shown in Fig. 2, A and
B. Compared with S1, GL showed no clear significant coherence peaks in the 15- to 30-Hz range (compare dark solid with
dotted and light solid lines in Fig. 2E). S1 also had clear peaks
in the 15- to 30-Hz range in the power spectra of both 1D1 and
AbPB (Fig. 2, F and G, dark solid lines). The power spectra of
the corresponding EMGs from GL showed no obvious peaks in
the 15- to 30-Hz range (Fig. 2, F and G, dotted and light solid
lines).

DISCUSSION
The hypocretins have been implicated in a variety of physiological
functions, including feeding (Sakurai et al., 1998), neuroendocrine
regulation, and arousal (Chemelli et al., 1999; Hagan et al., 1999;
Lin et al., 1999), as well as in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.
Here we have shown that administration of hcrt1 but not hcrt2 to
the LC has dramatic effects on sleep architecture. We have detected
mRNA expression and immunoreactivity to hcrtr1, whereas neither
mRNA nor protein expression for hcrtr2 was observed in the LC
area. Finally, administration of hcrt1 increased the firing rate of LC
neurons and induced c-fos in the LC area. These data strongly
suggest that the alterations in sleep architecture induced by hcrt1
are the consequence of a neuroexcitatory effect on LC neurons
through the hcrtr1.
hcrt1 application suppresses REM sleep and leads to a 70%
increase in wakefulness and a 48% decrease in SWS2 after either
unilateral or bilateral injections into the LC area. Bilateral injections in nearby structures had no effects on the sleep –wakef ulness
cycle, especially microinjections into the LDT, a cholinergic nu-cleus considered a “REM-on” structure that receives a relatively
dense hcrtergic innervation. Injections into the pontine reticular
formation, a nucleus that does not contain hcrt-immunopositive
fibers (Peyron et al., 1998) and that is in close proximity to the
“REM sleep induction zone” (Ahnaou et al., 1999; Kohlmeier and
Reiner, 1999), did not show any effect. In contrast to published
results (Hagan et al., 1999; Piper et al., 2000), local injections of the
hcrts into the fourth ventricle (without any associated injection site
located into the LC area) did not cause any significant effect on
sleep–wakefulness cycle, presumably because the dose of the lo-cally applied peptide was 100 times lower than the dose used for
intracerebroventricular infusion. In addition, the observed effects
were dose-dependent, indicating that the conditions used in the
present study were not saturating. This, together with blockade of
the effects on sleep and wakefulness by previous incubation with an
anti-hcrt-specific antiserum, supports the specificity of hcrt-induced
effects. It is noteworthy that injection of the lower dose of hcrt1
caused a selective reduction of REM sleep without significantly
affecting other states of vigilance, which suggests that the physiological role of hcrt1 is mainly related to REM sleep, and that the
alterations of the sleep–wake cycle seen at the higher dose are the
result of overstimulation of LC noradrenergic cells.
LC neuronal activity is highly related to the status of wakefulness and REM sleep. It has been known for >20 years that
monoaminergic neurons in the LC area are active during W,
decrease their firing rate during SWS, and are virtually quiescent
during REM sleep (Hobson et al., 1975; Aston-Jones and Bloom,
1981). Unilateral lesion of the LC in cats enhances REM sleep
(C aballero and De Andres, 1986), and stimulation of cholinergic
afferents promotes increased cortical desynchronization (Berridge
and Foote, 1991), whereas 6-hydroxydopamine lesions do not cause

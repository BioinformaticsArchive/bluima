in human MSA patients also demonstrated a reduction in GDNF
levels, indicating that GDNF may also play an important role in
MSA in humans.
Collectively, these results point toward the possibility that oligodendrocytic accumulation of syn in MSA may interfere with
the expression of NTFs and disrupt the neurotrophic support
provided by the oligodendrocytes to the neurons, resulting in
altered neuronal function and survival.
Several NTFs, such as NGF, BDNF, and GDNF itself, have
been widely reported to be altered in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (Siegel and Chauhan, 2000; Capsoni and Cattaneo,
2006; Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2009), and many studies have
looked at NTF replacement strategies in an effort to stave of
neuronal dysfunction and death in these disorders with a number
reporting beneficial effects (Lad et al., 2003; Peterson and Nutt,
2008; Ramaswamy et al., 2009; Sadan et al., 2009; Saragovi et al.,
2009). Although we report alterations in a number of NTFs in the
MBP-h syn Tg mice, we chose to focus on GDNF as its role in
MSA remains elusive, unlike BDNF (Kawamoto et al., 1999;
Nishimura et al., 2005) and bFGF2 (Sarchielli et al., 2008), which
have been reported to be altered in MSA. We were also interested
in GDNF in relation to its role in olfactory function, an early
deficit in MSA and other -synucleinopathies (Abele et al., 2003)
and its reported ability to restore motor function (Gill et al., 2003;
Slevin et al., 2005). Although we chose to focus on GDNF, we
appreciate that augmentation of levels of the other NTFs may also
have had an equally beneficial effect.
In addition to its expression by oligodendrocytes (Du and
Dreyfus, 2002; Wilkins et al., 2003), GDNF has also been reported
in cortical neurons (Schaar et al., 1993; Choi-Lundberg and

bodies of fed rats (Fig. 3C). Many neurons with SOCS-3
mRNA did not contain either NPY or POMC mRNA,
however. Detection of co-expression of SOCS-3 mRNA
and NPY or POMC mRNAs was facilitated by using fed
animals since SOCS-3 expression was elevated during
feeding. In fasted rats, neurons that were double-labeled
for SOCS-3 and NPY mRNAs were scarce, despite the
presence of the expected larger numbers of neurons with
NPY mRNA. Likewise, the DMN of fed rats also showed
increased SOCS-3 FISH intensity over neuron cell bodies,
but the phenotype of neurons containing SOCS-3 mRNA
in the DMN was not determined.
Immunocytochemistry with SOCS-3 antibodies revealed
numerous positive fluorescent cell bodies in the ARC (Fig.
3D) and DMN. The increased expression of SOCS-3
mRNA in the ARC of fed rats in comparison to fasted
animals was paralleled by increased immunofluorescence
staining of ARC neuron cell bodies in the fed rats (Fig.
3E). In contrast to the results with SOCS-3 mRNA FISH,
SOCS-3 immunostaining labeled many cells throughout
the hypothalamus and diencephalon besides the ARC and
DMN, although in the fed rats the staining of ARC and
DMN neurons was generally brighter than elsewhere.
Controls of omitting primary antiserum or substituting
normal rabbit serum for the primary antiserum at the same
dilution showed no staining.

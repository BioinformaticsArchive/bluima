Newborn forebrain neurons migrate from their site of origin to
their definitive positions in the cortical plate. Defects in neuronal
migration are often associated with epileptic disorders (Palmini et
al., 1991). Temporal lobe epilepsy (TL E), one of the most common neurological disorders in humans (Margerison and Corsellis,
1966), is accompanied by Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) and
granule cell dispersion (GCD), a defect in granule cell migration
(Houser, 1990; Armstrong, 1993). A similar altered granule cell
migration is observed in a mouse mutant, the reeler mouse (Rakic
and Caviness, 1995).
Recently, the gene deleted in this mouse mutant was cloned
and the protein it encodes was named reelin (D'Arcangelo et al.,
1995; Hirotsune et al., 1995). Reelin is synthesized and secreted
by Cajal–Retzius (CR) cells in the marginal zones of the neocortex and hippocampus (D'Arcangelo et al., 1995, 1997; Hirotsune et al., 1995). Mice lacking reelin and its lipoprotein receptors
apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low density
lipoprotein receptor (V LDLR) as well as mice deficient in the
adaptor protein disabled 1 (dab1) show severe migration defects
in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Rakic and Caviness, 1995; Howell et al., 1997; Sheldon et al., 1997; D'Arcangelo
et al., 1999; Trommsdorff et al., 1999). Reelin deficiency in
humans is associated with autosomal recessive lissencephaly that
is characterized by malformations of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and brainstem (Hong et al., 2000). Recently, increased numbers of CR cells were found both in reeler mice (Coulin et al.,
2001) and in tissue samples from TLE patients (Blu ̈mcke et al.,
1999), raising the possibility that alterations in CR cells and in the

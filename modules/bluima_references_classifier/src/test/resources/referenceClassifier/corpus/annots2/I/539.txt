nal activity or extracellular fluid peptide concentration. It is
possible that balanced changes in CRF synthesis and secretion occurred, and consequently escaped detection in the
radioimmunoassays. Despite technical challenges resulting
from the size and hydrophobicity of CRF, two groups have
reported successful CRF microdialysis in brain regions containing high concentrations of the peptide (Pich et al., 1995;
Merali et al., 1998); it remains to be established whether
lower synaptic concentrations of CRF can be measured using
this method. Ideally, subsequent studies will more precisely
elucidate the effects of antidepressant treatment on CRF
secretion under resting and perturbed conditions in the same
animal. The new MicroPET method that allows for visualization of gene expression in vivo is one such technique.
Another means by which antidepressant drugs could po-tentially alter CRF neurotransmission is via an effect on CRF
receptor function. We and others have found no effect of
antidepressant treatment on brain CRF receptor density, by
using homogenate binding methods (Grigoriadis et al., 1989;
Stout et al., 1996). The current findings extend these results
by demonstrating no effect of antidepressant treatment on
subtype-specific binding by using receptor autoradiography.
Moreover, antidepressant administration was without effect
on CRF1 or CRF2A receptor gene expression in peak forebrain
regions. We did not observe a reduction in amgydaloid CRF1
receptor mRNA expression, as was previously reported after
amitriptyline administration (Aubry et al., 1999).
In summary, chronic antidepressant drug treatment in
these studies did not affect basal CRF gene expression in the
PVN but rather reduced the sensitivity of these neurons to
various forms of stress. Further experiments are required to
determine the time course of antidepressant treatment re-quired for these effects and to characterize, if any, the functional consequences of these interactions. It is plausible, but
not as yet demonstrated, that reduced sensitivity of PVN
CRF gene expression to stress may contribute to normalization of HPA axis activity in patients undergoing psychopharmacological treatment. Evidence collected to date has failed
to demonstrate that antidepressant administration modulates CRF synthesis, secretion, or receptor sensitivity in ex-trahypothalamic brain regions, although such an interaction
has been hypothesized to underlie reduction of CSF CRF
concentrations in treated patients.

although some reactivity was seen inside the cell, in a
nonnuclear region. The image shown is a z-series
section through approximately the middle of the cell.
Notably, the reactivity was much reduced and not
detected in the plasma membrane in the absence of the
primary antibody (image was similar to that shown in
Fig. 8E). When anti-Trp1 was first incubated with the
peptide, the reactivity in the plasma membrane was
attenuated significantly (Fig. 7B), although the reactivity inside the cells was not completely competed out.
Similar results were obtained with control HEK-293
cells (i.e., transfected with the vasopressin receptor
cDNA; data not shown). Thus HEK-293 cells appear to
contain the Trp1 protein at levels high enough to be
detected by immunofluorescence. The localization of
the immunofluorescence (e.g., at the cell boundary) was
further confirmed by superimposing the FITC image on
a light-field image (not shown). To our knowledge, this
is the first evidence for the presence and localization of
an endogenous Trp protein in any cell type.
Immunolocalization of hTrp1 and hTrp3 proteins in
HEK-293 cells. To confirm the localization of Trp1
protein, we used HEK-293 cells transfected with the
HA-tagged hTrp1 cDNA. Immunolocalization of Trp1 in
these cells was examined by confocal microscopy using
either anti-Trp1 or anti-HA and the respective FITClabeled secondary antibody. A strong reactivity was
observed in the plasma membrane region of these cells
with either antibody. Figure 8, A and B, shows the
images obtained with anti-Trp1 and anti-HA, respectively, in hTrp1-expressing HEK-293 cells. In ,20% of
the cells, a prominent cytosolic localization was also
seen (Fig. 8, A and B). Figure 9 shows a Ã—4 zoom image
of such a cell using the anti-HA (a similar pattern was
seen in cells treated with anti-Trp1). Immunofluorescence was associated with the plasma membrane and a
reticular structure inside the cell, which appeared to
exclude the nuclear region. We have not yet identified
this intracellular organelle. When anti-HA was first
incubated with the HA peptide (Fig. 8D) or in the
absence of the primary antibody (Fig. 8E shows the
reactivity detected with anti-mouse IgG, which was
similar to that seen with anti-rabbit IgG), the signal
was considerably dampened and the plasma membrane
or ER localizations were not seen. Thus the expressed
hTrp1 protein, like the endogenous Trp1 protein, was
localized primarily in the plasma membrane of the cell
(compare Fig. 8, A and B). The reason for the heterogeneity in the Trp1 localization and the significance of its
intracellular localization in some cells is not presently
clear. One possible explanation is that, due to the high
levels of expression, some of the protein might not be
routed correctly. This needs to be examined in greater
detail. Notably, such heterogeneity was not very prominent in localization of the hTrp3 protein in HEK-293
cells transfected with the HA-tagged hTrp3 cDNA. In
these cells, the protein was clearly localized in the
plasma membrane (see Fig. 8C; note that the same
primary and secondary antibodies were used in Fig. 8,
B and C). Intracellular reactivity was also observed in
these cells. However, this was localized (like a ``hot

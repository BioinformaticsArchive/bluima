The origins of regional diversity in RA signaling during de-velopment are determined by several factors. Primarily they are
established by the distribution of RA receptors [6, 37, 38] and
the synthetic and catabolic enzymes [36, 39]. Acting upon these
factors are the retinoid-binding proteins which may influence
receptor action by the sequestration of free RA and the potentiation of enzyme activity via the presentation of retinoid to the
appropriate synthetic or catabolic enzyme. We found that rCRBP
facilitated RA synthesis from retinaldehyde in cytoplasmic fractions of adult liver, early postnatal retina, embryonic meninges
and postnatal choroid plexus. rCRBP also enhanced RA synthesis by RALDH-2 in the choroid plexus when the enzyme was
assayed in isolation from other cytoplasmic proteins by zymography assay. The increase in RA synthesis mediated by CRBP
may result either from an increase in retinaldehyde solubility or
by CRBP-retinaldehyde acting as a preferred substrate for the
enzyme [33]. The ratio rCRBP/retinaldehyde was crucial, since
excess apo-rCRBP was inhibitory, perhaps suggesting that apoCRBP interacts with the enzyme and blocks its access to holoCRBP.
CRBP and CRABP II are coexpressed at some sites of RA
synthesis, and both are expressed in the choroid plexus ; CRABP
I, in contrast, is present in regions that take up and degrade
RA. The cerebellum and RA-induced P19 cells expressed both
CRABP I and CRABP II, however the immunoblots with general CRABP antiserum and the holo-CRABP assays (Fig. 3) suggest that CRABP I is the major species in cerebellum and
CRABP II the predominant species in RA-induced P19 cells.
The choroid plexus, which synthesizes and possibly secretes RA,
expressed only CRABP II, the RA-binding protein suggested to
be associated with this function [40]. High levels of CRABP I
are evident in embryonic tissues with a high susceptibility to the
teratogenic action of RA [3, 5, 18], which include the eye [41]
and cerebellum [42]. RA-binding proteins sequester free RA and
maintain its availability for enzymatic inactivation [43].
CRABP-I-rich tissues respond to RA [25, 36] but are likely also
to require protection from inappropriate levels of free RA. We
employed a holo-CRABP assay to detect the cerebellar RA-

Consistent with this idea, overexpression
of postsynaptic density-95 increases the
number of excitatory synapses on hippocampal neurons in vitro (El-Husseini et
al., 2000).
It is also possible that gonadal hormones increase MeApd synapses

MeApd neurons in the current sample,
an effect on intrinsic afferents would
likely be accompanied by additional differences; for example, in males, each
presynaptic glutamatergic MeApd neuron might form more intrinsic synapses
and/or the proportion of glutamatergic
MeApd neurons might be greater. Interestingly, the proportion of vasopressinergic neurons in the MeApd is sexually
dimorphic (De Vries and Simerly,
2002), providing a precedent for sex differences in the balance of neurochemical

NMDA subtype. For this reason, we directly assayed conantokin-T for NMDA antagonist activity.
The effect of the peptide on NMDA receptors was evaluated
by a fluorescence method. In this assay system, the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions in cerebellar granule
cells in culture determines the level of fluorescence of the
calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2. The addition of NMDA and
glycine to the cell culture opens ion channels associated with
NMDA receptors, allowing the influx of extracellular calcium,
resulting in a characteristic increase of fuia-2 fluorescence.
Conantokin-T produces a dose-dependent partial antagonism of NMDA-induced increases in [Ca'+],. Fig. 4 shows a
representative experiment. The peptide produced a maximal
inhibition of about 70% with half-maximal inhibition occurring at low micromolar concentration in this experiment. This
I& value represents a lower apparent affinity than was found
for conantokin-G using a cGMP assay in cerebellar slices.3 A
detailed comparison between the two peptides using a variety
of physiological assays is in progress and will be presented
elsewhere.4

Lesions were made in rats anaesthetized with chloral
hydrate (300 mg/kg, i.p.). This dose allowed recovery from
anaesthesia within 1 h. The Pf, SThN and GP were unilaterally lesioned with an excitotoxic drug (quinolinic or
ibotenic acid) microinjected using a stainless steel cannula
(o.d.: 0.2 mm), fixed to the end of a glass micropipette,
graduated in μl and connected by polyethylene tubing to a
10 μl microsyringe (Hamilton, airtight) driven by an infusion pump (Razel, model 88901, Stamford, CT, U.S.A.).
The cannula was placed in the injection site, 2 min before
injection and kept there until 4 min after it. The excitotoxic
drugs were slowly delivered over 2 min. The Pf (A="3.8,
L=1.2, H="6.2 under dura) was lesioned with 45 nmoles
quinolinic acid in 300 nl (n=5 rats). The SThN (coordinates:
A="3.6, L=2.5, H="7.2 under dura) was lesioned with
15 nmoles ibotenic acid in 300 nl (n=12 rats). The GP
was lesioned (n=16) with ibotenic acid (50 nmoles/μl) microinjected into three sites: 0.2 μl into the anterior site
(A="0.3, L=2.5; H="6.2); 0.2 μl into the median site
(A="0.9, L=3.0, H="6.5); 0.15 μl into the posterior
site (A="1.8, L=3.8, H="6.2). The interval between
lesioning and experiments was eight days for all the
structures. The extent of the lesion was determined histologically on Nissl-stained sections by assessing neuron loss
and microglial proliferation.15,26

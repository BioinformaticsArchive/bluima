TC-3' (including EcoRI site), was used instead. After PCR amplification
was carried out with these primer sets, the products (hFGF-5 and
hFGF-5S) were cloned into a pBluescript SK+ vector and sequenced.
The SalI/EcoRI-cleaved inserts were then transferred to a mammalian
expression vector, pMexNeo (34).
Production of Recombinant FGF-5 and FGF-5S Proteins in E. coliâ€”
Full-length, recombinant FGF-5 protein was obtained using a bacterial
expression vector system, pET-3c (35). The FGF-5 cDNA fragment was
amplified with the primer set, 5'-CGGAATTCCATATGGGTGAAAAG-

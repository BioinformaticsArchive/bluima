Fig. 3. (A, B) Dark-field photomicrographs of anterograde labelling in the SN following an injection of
WGA-HRP into the core of the NAcc (injection site illustrated in Fig. I). (C-E) Anterograde labelling
in the MD (D) and the VM (E) after injection of WGA-HRP into the dorsomedial SNR (injection site
shown in Fig. 2). Rectangles in C delineate the regions of the MD and VM shown in the photomicrographs. Arrows in D and E point to the anterograde labelling. (F, G) Retrogradely labelled cells in the
SNR following injection of WGA-HRP into the rostromedial part of the MD (F) or VM (G). Injection
sites are depicted in Fig. 2. ZI, zona incerta. For other abbreviations see Figs 1 and 2. Scale bar = 350/~m
(A); 150~m (B-D): 50~m (F, G).

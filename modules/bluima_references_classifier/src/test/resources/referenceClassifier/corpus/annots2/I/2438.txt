confirm the results of previous field-potential
and single-unit studies in the cat (18, 36, 38,
45) and are very similar to the results of a
CSD analysis of the toad optic tectum (7).
Furthermore, the above pattern for the fast
and slow direct inputs to the cat colliculus
is analogous to that predicted, on the basis
of CSD analysis, for the retinal input to laminae A and Al of the cat dorsal lateral ge-niculate nucleus (39). Finally, in the colliculus, the matching between direct and indirect afferents has been confirmed in recent
experiments (4) in which stimulation of area
18 of the ipsilateral visual cortex generated
collicular current sinks with shorter latencies
deeper in the SGS than those generated by
stimulation of area 17.

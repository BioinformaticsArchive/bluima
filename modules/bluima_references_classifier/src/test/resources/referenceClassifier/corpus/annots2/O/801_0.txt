Figure 1. Dark-field photographs il-lustrating fiber projections traced to the
striatum in case M8 from the SEF (A)
and the FEF (B) in serially adjacent sagittal sections approximately 3.5 mm
lateral to the midline. v indicates corresponding blood vessels in the two sections. Locations ofthe two injection sites
are shown on the drawingof the hemisphere (SEFsite indicatedby horizontal
hatchina: FEF denosit. bv vertical
hatchit& A shows ihe extensive anteroposterior distribution of the corticostriatal projection traced from a single
TS-methionine injection site centered
slightly medial to the center of the SEF
as determined by microstimulation. B
illustrates the sharply bordered clusters
of fibers labeled from the WGA-HRP
injection site in the FEF. AC, anterior
commissure; CN, caudate nucleus; IC,
internal capsule; Th,thalamus. Scale bar
on photo, 2 mm; on drawing, 5 mm.

brain tumor extirpation [Hertz-Pannier
et al., 1997; Stapleton et al., 1997;
Worthington et al., 1997]. Studies de-signed to identify neural networks im-portant in audition have been performed
in children [Ulualp, 1998]. Differences in
fronto-striatal activation have been identified between children with Attention
Deficit Disorder (ADD) and normal controls using fMRI and the go/no-go task
as an activation paradigm [Vaidya et al,
1998]. Interestingly, methylphenidate
not only was found to improve performance of the study task in children with
ADD but to increase striatal activation in
these children, as well.
In addition to its use for investigation of cognitive function, fMRI has
been applied to study motor control in
children. Maps of motor activation have
been found to compare favorably to
those obtained from intraoperative corticography in children who undergo tu-mor extirpation [Mueller et al., 1996].
The control of complex motor movements in children has been studied
[Rivkin et al., unpublished data]. Children 9 to 10 years of age recruited as
normal volunteers have been studied us-ing a rhythmic finger-tapping paradigm.
Subjects are trained to listen to a metronome cadence and match its rhythm with
alternating bimanual index finger tapping. Once so trained, each child is scanner-fitted with audio headphones and
placed in the 1.5T MR. While echo planar MR imaging is conducted, the child
listens to the broadcast metronome
rhythm and endeavors to reproduce the
rhythm with bimanual alternating index
finger tapping. Periods of tapping are al-ternated with periods of rest. The group
analysis of four children is found in Figure 8. The images provide a picture of a
distributed neural network necessary for
tapping to match a rhythm provided by
auditory means. Regional activation of
auditory, primary motor, and supplementary motor cortices are observed.
Studies to discern the interaction of this
distributed motor network with learning
are likely to follow.

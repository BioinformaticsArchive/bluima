DISCUSSION
Because neurotrophins have been used to treat motoneuron diseases [BDNF Study Group (Phase III), 1999], studies of their in
vivo expression patterns and regulation in the adult spinal cord
are critical to understanding possible mechanisms, and efficacy, of
potential treatment strategies. We show that NT-4/5 is robustly
expressed by neurons throughout the gray matter of the normal
adult rat cord, and by a subpopulation of white and gray matter

Fig. 5. (A) Time course of formation of the [3H]BTX-B/receptor complex in the absence or presence of genistein. Synaptosomes were incubated
at 26°C with 1 nM [3H]BTX-B and 10 μM RU39568 in the presence (closed circles) and absence (open circles) of 500 μM genistein. At the indicated
times, [3H]BTX-B bound was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” (Insert) linearized plot, B represents the [3H]BTX-B bound
at each time and Beq is the bound ligand at equilibrium. (B) Dissociation of the [3H]BTX-B/receptor complex in the absence or presence of
genistein. Synaptosomes were incubated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Dissociation was initiated by adding 600 μM veratridine,
in the presence (closed circles) or absence (open circles) of 500 μM genistein and at the indicated times, bound [3H]BTX-B was determined. The
results presented show data of a single experiment performed in triplicate. (Insert) linearized plot, B represents the [3H]BTX-B bound at each time
and Bo is the bound ligand at t = 0. (C) Dose-response curve of genistein effect on the binding of [3H]BTX-B to synaptosomes. [3H]BTX-B was
incubated for 16 h at 26°C in the presence of increasing concentrations of genistein as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results
represent data of a single experiment performed in quadruplicate.

blockage of 22Na+ influx through neurotoxin-activated so- dium channels in cultured brain neurons and a decrease of
Na+ current in cultured cerebellar granule cells. At this
point, the question was whether the inhibitory effect was
mediated by the inhibition of a tyrosine kinase activity. Several data argue against this hypothesis: 1) only genistein but
not the other tested tyrosine kinase inhibitors was active on
22Na+ influx or Na+ current; 2) the effect of genistein was
mimicked by daidzein which is described as a genistein an- alog inactive on tyrosine kinase activity; 3) the time course of
genistein activity on intact neuronal cells was very rapid
because the maximum effect was obtained in less than 20 s,
which seems incompatible with an effect caused by a dephosphorylation revealed by the inhibition of a tyrosine kinase; 4)
a direct interaction between genistein and sodium channels
was visualized in rat brain synaptosomal fractions by the
inhibition of [3H]BTX-B specific binding induced by genistein
and not by other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The two latter
arguments also allow the elimination of a possible effect

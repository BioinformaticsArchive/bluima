Light/dark paradigm

The light/dark apparatus consisted of a rectangular Plexiglas box
(20 47 20 cm) with the black section comprising one third and
the white section comprising the remaining two thirds of the chamber. The two sections of the apparatus were separated by a
Plexiglas partition with an opening (12.5 5 cm) allowing passage
from the open “white” section to the enclosed “black” portion of the
chamber. A 40-W light bulb, positioned 10 cm above the center of
the white compartment, provided illumination, while red, translucent Plexiglas served as a roof of the black chamber.
Mice were habituated to the open field (rectangular Plexiglas
cage, 25 45 20 cm) lined with clean shavings for 10 min on 3
consecutive days (familiar environment). On each trial mice were
transported to the test site which housed the light/dark box apparatus. Mice were not exposed to the light/dark box during the
habituation procedure. The test day experimental protocol was
simulated on each of the 3 habituation days by gently removing
each mouse from the HC and handling subjects briefly (2 min)
before returning each animal to its cage and transporting mice
back to the main animal housing unit.

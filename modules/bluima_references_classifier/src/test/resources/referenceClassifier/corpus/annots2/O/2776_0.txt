five mice immunized with 102 PFU developed neutralizing
antibodies, as did one of five animals receiving either 1
or 10 PFU. Upon challenge with EMCV at 40 days PI, all
animals that exhibited any level of neutralizing titer were
protected against pathology (symptoms) and death. The
animals that failed to seroconvert (titers Â› 20) died of
EMCV-like disease within 2 weeks after challenge.

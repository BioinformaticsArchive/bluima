ence of flow within the vasculature itself limits recovery
after ischemia in turtle brain. Energy failure is a possible
limitation since creatine phosphate levels are reportedly
decreased more during ischemia than during anoxia (12).
Although ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations were
unchanged during several hours of anoxia (6, 12), turtle
brain ATP was conserved only for 1 h of ischemia.
Subsequently there was a rapid fall of ATP (14). If one
assumes that energy demand is similar during anoxia
and ischemia, these data demonstrate the importance of
continued substrate provision through the circulation.
Effects on brain vasculature may also factor in the
development of irreversibility from ischemic insult. We
speculate that the change in ionic environment during
ischemia may interact with blood stasis to increase vascular resistance and/or blood viscosity to the extent that
reperfusion becomes impossible. The present study certainly establishes the importance of blood flow in maintaining ion homeostasis and continued viability of turtle
brain in a model of reversible ischemia. It also demonstrates the advantage of studying brain survival in an
animal model with markedly decreased vulnerability to
metabolic insufficiency. Identification of factors that
favor turtle brain survival may ultimately lead to greater
understanding of mammalian brain metabolism and its
vulnerability to limitations in blood flow and oxygen

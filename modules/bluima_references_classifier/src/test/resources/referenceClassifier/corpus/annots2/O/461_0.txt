described previously for single VM grafts (Doucet et al., 1989;
Chkirate et al., 1993). Again, the picture was very similar for
VM graft and co-grafts with cortical, mesencephalic, or striatal
astroc y tes.

Serotonin neurons grew similarly well on VM and
cortical astrocyte cultures
Postnatal 5-HT neurons taken from P10 dorsal raphe and plated
onto confluent V M or cortical astrocyte cultures survived similarly
and displayed comparably extensive neurite branching (Fig. 13).
This expected result exemplifies the necessity for in vivo experi-

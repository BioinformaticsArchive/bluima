of GH increases IGF-1 expression in hypophysectomized rats (Hynes et al., 1987). GH similarly
increases expression from the IGF-1 promoter in the
brains of immature (but not old) rats, and the actions
of GH on cerebral growth and myelination are probably mediated by IGF-1 (Scheepens et al., 2000). GH
actions independent of IGF-1 are, however, thought
to be responsible for some of its effects on motor
neuron morphology (Chen et al., 1997) and glial cell
function (Wyse and Sernia, 1997; Cacicedo et al.,
1999). The actions of GH in the brain may thus be
direct or mediated by the activation of many mediators. In the chicken, some neural actions of GH may
be induced by the induction of a specific GH-response gene.
GH-response gene-1 (GHRG-1), a cysteine protease inhibitor that is inducible by GH in normal
chickens but not in GH-resistant dwarf chickens
(Agarwal et al., 1995), is a marker of GH action in
birds (Radecki et al., 1997). This gene is widely
expressed in the brain of adult chickens, particularly
in the cerebellum (Harvey et al., 2001c). In embryonic chicks, it is also expressed in the neural tube of
the spinal cord, in regions of GH- and GHRimmunoreactivity (Harvey et al., 2001c). A functional GH-GHR-GHRG-1 cascade therefore appears
to be present in neural tissues of the chick embryo
prior to pituitary somatotroph differentiation, possibly reflecting autocrine/paracrine actions of
neurally produced GH.

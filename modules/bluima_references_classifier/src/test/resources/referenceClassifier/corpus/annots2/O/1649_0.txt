Efect of CXCL12/CX3CL1 cotreatment on neuron adhesion

Because we observed mutual inhibitory effects on neuronal movement between CXCL12 and CX3CL1, we wondered whether analogous effects were obtained for cell adhesion. For this reason, we
decided to investigate whether CXCL12/CX3CL1 cotreatment
could modulate CX3CL1-mediated cell adhesion. The results
shown in Fig. 9 indicate that CXCL12 did not increase neuron
adhesion to laminin for the time points analyzed (from 2 to 20
min), a slight increase being observed for CGN only at 20 min.
Interestingly, however, neuron cotreatment with CXCL12/
CX3CL1 blocked CX3CL1-mediated cell adhesion at all time
points analyzed. Comparable results were obtained on hippocampal and cerebellar neurons (Fig. 9).

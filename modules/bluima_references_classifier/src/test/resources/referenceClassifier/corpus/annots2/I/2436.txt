impulses (12, 45, 46). Units in ICX influenced by both sensory modalities may be
components in this descending pathway.
The high proportion of units with binaural
input further suggests that a relationship
may exist between information about the
location of a sound in space and the position of a contralateral limb. Such information would be necessary to coordinate body
movements toward or away from a soundproducing object of significance to the be-having animal. Further experiments are
needed to examine this question and also
to accurately describe the destinations of
the axons projected by cells in this region.
It would also be of interest to examine the
representation of the trigeminal and facial
sensory systems in this nucleus.

ABSTRACT SNAPITAG-1is a 135kDa glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is
transiently expressed upon the surfaces of developing axons. In the embryonic rodent spinal cord,
this molecule is expressed by motor neurons, dorsal root ganglion cells, and commissural neurons
(Yamamoto et al.: J. Neurosci. 63576-3594, 1986;
Dodd et al.: Neuron 1:105-116, 1988). The commissural cells are a subset of early-forming dorsal
horn interneurons whose axons follow a circumferential course in the embryonic spinal cord. The
axons of commissural neurons cross the developing ventral commissure to terminate on contralatera1 synaptic targets, whereas those of the other
subset of circumferential cells, the association in-terneurons, remain on the same side of the spinal
cord to form ipsilateral, terminal synaptic fields.
The difference between the axonal trajectories of
these two subsets of nerve cells raised the question of whether or not association interneurons
would also express the SNAPPTAG-1epitope and,
if so, how would this expression be related to that
of the commissural cells. Immunocytochemistry
for SNAPRAG-1 and choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) was used to answer these questions. The
results indicated that association interneurons ex-pressed SNAP/TAG-1 epitopes and that this ex-pression began later and lasted longer than that of
the commissural neurons. Other new findings of
this study included the identification of a lateral
subgroup of commissural fibers that expressed
SNAPRAG-1 later than their more medially lo-cated counterparts, and these lateral fibers were
more pronounced in the thoracic spinal cord than
at cervical levels. Furthermore, interesting developmental relationships were observed between
SNAPRAG-l-positive fibers and ChAT-positive
motor neurons in both cervical and thoracic spinal cord. Lastly, SNAPRAG-1 immunoreactivity
was detected on the terminal collaterals of dorsal
root ganglion fibers during the late prenatal pe-riod. While the function(s) of SNAPPTAG-1 re-mains enigmatic, its expression in developmental
time and space, along with the recent suggestion
that a released form of this molecule might serve a
substrate adhesion function (Furley et al.: Cell 61:
157-170,1990; Karagogeos et al.: Development 112:

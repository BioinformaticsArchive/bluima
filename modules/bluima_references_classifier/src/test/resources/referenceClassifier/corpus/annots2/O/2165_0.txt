Tissue distribution: The sCT-suppressive
binding sites of 1251-hCGRP was found to
distribute broadly among the tissues
examined, except for the kidney (Fig. 1). In
addition to the tissues which are known to
respond to CGRP (25, 26) or to contain its
specific binding sites (12-15), three visceral
organs exhibited high levels of specific
binding: spleen, liver and lung.
Tissues or cells which lack notable binding
and not listed in Fig. 1 include a cancer cell
line (A 431) from human epithelium, fibro
blasts from Swiss 3T3 mice and rat blood
cells. The alveolar macrophage is also
considered to be free of binding sites, because
repeated lavage of the lung with saline (27)
failed to remove any binding sites from the
lung.
Peptide specificity: As shown in Fig. 2

recent interest. The frontal cortex provides a main and
topographically organized, monosynaptic, glutamatergic
input to the STN (Monakow et al, 1978; Carpenter et al,
1981a, b; Nambu et al, 1996; Nambu et al, 1997). The
cortico-STN projection, which has been a focus of study for
motor and premotor cortico-basal ganglia system, is termed
the `hyperdirect' basal ganglia pathway in that impulses
reach the basal ganglia output nuclei faster via this route
than through the cortico-striatal pathway (Kolomiets et al,
2003). Given that the STN impacts directly on DA cells
(Rosales et al, 1994; Meissner et al, 2003), this route (PFC to
the STN to the midbrain cells) may represent an alternative
in the primate to the direct PFC–VTA/SN pathway observed
in other species. In fact, PFC stimulation results in both
excitatory and inhibitory responses in the primate SN pars
reticulata, which are mediated via the STN and striatum,
respectively (Kitano et al, 1998). The PFC–STN connection
in primates (Frankle et al, 2003), along with the direct STN
connection to the SN, is likely to have an impact not only on
the SN pars reticulata cells, but also on the DA neurons
(Rosales et al, 1994).

post-spike excitability might be enhanced by opioid receptor
antagonism, morphine withdrawal does so more potently than opioid
receptor antagonism alone.
Because the DAP and AHP overlap temporally (Greffrath et al.,
1998; Teruyama & Armstrong, 2002), increased post-spike excitability
during withdrawal excitation in vivo might equally result from
decreased AHP amplitude. Although we cannot eliminate potential
effects on DAPs, the naloxone-induced decrease of AHP amplitude in
cells from morphine-dependent rats, but not cells from morphine-na ̈ıve
rats, suggests that this might further increase oxytocin cell post-spike
excitability < 0.1 s after each spike during morphine withdrawal.
Post-spike potentials are not the only membrane properties that
influence post-spike excitability; the TOR modulates spike duration,
interspike interval and firing frequency (Bourque, 1988). Because
the TOR in magnocellular neurosecretory cells is Ca2+-dependent
(Bourque, 1988), depolarization and Ca2+ influx associated with
spikes will activate the current underlying the TOR, to induce a
transient membrane hyperpolarization. Hence TOR modulation will
have a similar net effect to AHP modulation, albeit with a shorter timecourse. Morphine withdrawal reduced both the TOR and AHP, and so
the reduced influence of these Ca2+-dependent K+ properties probably
contributes to enhanced magnocellular neurosecretory cell post-spike
excitability < 0.1 s after each spike during morphine withdrawal.
Numerous studies have addressed the cellular adaptations that might
mediate morphine dependence, identifying counteradaptations in
several second messenger systems. However, previous work has
failed to identify changes in K+ or Ca2+ conductances associated with
morphine dependence (Williams et al., 2001). By contrast, we have
shown that intrinsic properties that are mediated by K+ conductances
are altered in magnocellular neurosecretory cells during morphine
dependence. Several mechanisms could underlie inhibition of TOR
and AHP during morphine withdrawal in magnocellular neurosecretory cells. First, morphine withdrawal could directly inhibit the K+
channels underlying the TOR and AHP. Second, the reduced TOR and
AHP could result from reduced Ca2+ entry resulting from inhibition of
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, a common target of l-opioid receptors
(Grudt & Williams, 1995). However, the fact that TOR and AHP were
reduced concomitantly with increased spike broadening, which results
from activity-dependent Ca2+ entry during repetitive firing (Bourque
& Renaud, 1985), suggests that Ca2+ availability is increased rather
than decreased. Instead, reduced TOR and AHP might reflect a
morphine withdrawal-induced reduction of the Ca2+-sensitivity of the
Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. Small conductance Ca2+-dependent K+
(SK) channels mediate the AHP in magnocellular neurosecretory cells
(Greffrath et al., 2004) and changes in Ca2+ sensitivity could result
from altered association between calmodulin and the alpha subunits of
SK channels (Xia et al., 1998). Indeed, changes in Ca2+-calmodulin
signalling mechanisms have been previously observed during chronic
morphine treatment (Liang et al., 2004).
Finally, the decreased input resistance and membrane s observed
during morphine withdrawal might indirectly affect the TOR and AHP,
and thus post-spike excitability. For example, changes in membrane s
could influence the delay to the first spike during membrane depolarization. In addition, changes in input resistance could indirectly affect
the AHP and TOR, by affecting Ca2+entry and / or the activation range of
Ca2+-dependent K+ channels during membrane depolarization. However, there was no significant correlation between TOR or AHP area and
input resistance or s, either under basal conditions, or following
morphine withdrawal, suggesting the presence of such indirect interactions is unlikely. Nevertheless, a mechanistic link between changes in
membrane s and / or input resistance, and changes in post-spike
excitability, can not be ruled out by these studies.

Fig. 4. Immunogold electron microscopy of AQP4 in brain cortex of control, mdx and mdx3cv mice. (A) Control brain. Numerous AQP4 gold particles
(arrows) decorate the glial membranes, separated by a basal lamina (asterisk) from the blood vessel. (B) mdx brain from 1.5-year-old mdx mouse.
A small number of gold particles are attached to the swollen glial endfoot (asterisk) facing the blood vessels. Note the unlabeled glial membrane facing
the neuropile (arrowheads). (C, D) mdx3cv brain. Swollen glial endfeet (asterisk) enveloping two vessels are labeled by rare gold particles at the
membrane facing the neuropile (C) or are devoid of gold particles (D) at the membranes facing the vessel and the neuropile. e, endothelial cell. Original
magnification: A, B, D, 20,000; C, 12,000.

Fig. 4. Plasma epinephrine (E) concentrations (mean Â±
SEM) at rest (time -10 and 0), during graded exercise at
60% (time 12), 70% (time 15) and 80% (time 18) of the
VO2maxand during recovery (R), after placebo (PL) or
domperidone (DMP) administration to normal volunteers.
Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in E re-sponse to exercise between PL and DMP treatment either
analyzing the overall response (p = 0.02), or the areas
under the curves (p = 0. 009), or the pick values (p = 0.01).

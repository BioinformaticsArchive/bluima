recorded. Pairs of stimuli (0.2 ms, 2 threshold for generating a
single action potential in the neuron studied) were separated with
an inter-stimulus interval of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ms. The
number of spikes in response to the second stimulus was averaged from 16 consecutive stimuli and compared with the average
number of spikes evoked by 16 single stimuli.

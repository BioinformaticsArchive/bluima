Elevated P450 Reductase Expression
in Developing Olfactory Neuroepithelia
Developing respiratory and olfactory neuroepithelia
also exhibited high levels of P450 reductase transcripts
between E13.5–E16.5. This includes epithelia lining
the external nares, developing nasal airways, primitive
nasal cavities (future olfactory epithelium), and future
olfactory lobes of the brain (Fig. 3G–L). Except for the
olfactory lobes of the brain, these sites in adult animals
are noted for unusually high levels of P450 reductase
activities and P450-dependent drug metabolism activities (Ding and Coon, 1992; Voigt, Guengerich, and
Baron, 1985). P450 reductase transcripts were less
concentrated but greater than background levels in
neural tissues surrounding the lateral ventricles and
the third ventricle at the level of the hypothalamus
(data not shown). The spinal cord consistently showed
specific hybridization that was slightly above background but less than that detected in the central
nervous system.
Relatively high levels of P450 reductase message
were also observed (E13.5–E16.5) in the epithelium
covering the stomach wall (future mucosal surface) and
the lobular bronchi of the developing lungs (not shown).
This was not surprising because immunoreactive P450
reductase has been described at these sites in adults of
several species (Chichester et al., 1991; Hall et al.,
1989; Lee and Dinsdale, 1995; Strum et al., 1990). P450
reductase expression in the liver was consistently at
background levels, even though CYP3A11 was highly
expressed and detected in situ by E13.5 (data not
shown). This raises the question whether low expression levels of P450 reductase might be sufficient to
support P450 catalysis in all tissues. We suspect that
P450 reductase is present in all cells and tissues, and
that in situ hybridization has revealed sites having the
highest local concentrations in developing embryos.

Expression of MASH-I and B2 syrnpathoadrenalmarkersin
C-cells
The MASH-l protein is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor characteristicof neuralcrest sympathoadrenapl rogenitors
(Johnsonet al., 1990).Within this cellular population, MASH-l
is expressedbefore, but not after, neuronaldifferentiation (Johnson et al., 1990; Lo et al., 1991; Guillemot and Joyner, 1993).
In addition, the presenceof MASH-l RNA hasbeenreportedin
a C-cell line (Johnsonet al. 1990). SinceMASH-l is presentin
sympathoadrenapl rogenitorsand C-cell lines, we have hypothesizedthatitmayalsobepresentinnormalC-cellsbefore,but
not after, neuronaldifferentiation.
To determineif MASH-l protein was presentin C-cells, we
immunostainedthyroid sectionswith an antiserumto MASH-l.
As determinedby confocal microscopy, C-cells expressedapparently nuclearMASH-l immunoreactivity (Fig. 4A). For comparison, we also staineda comparablethyroid sectionwith an-tiserum to calcitonin (Fig. 4B). MASH-l immunoreactivity was
alsonuclearinCA77cells(Fig.4C).Incontrast,wewereunable
to detectMASH-l immunoreactivity in C-cell cultures(datanot
shown).WealsoexaminedMASH-l expressioninthyroidand
cultured C-cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 40). MASH-l was clearly
detectable in RNA isolated from juvenile rat thyroids. It was
alsodetectedimmediatelyafterdissectionanddispersionofthe
thyroid. In contrast,MASH-l RNA was undetectablein C-cells

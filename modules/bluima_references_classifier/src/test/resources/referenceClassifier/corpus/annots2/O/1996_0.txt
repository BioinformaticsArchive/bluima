NR2A is degradation in lysosomes. It should be pointed out that
the different extent of NMDAR endocytosis and recycling
observed during development is not solely due to differences in
NR2A/NR2B expression, as other factors such as expression
of NMDAR-binding proteins or NR1-dependent regulation of
NMDARs affect NMDAR trafficking and surface expression.
Nevertheless, our novel use of the heterodimeric MHC II proteins as a reporter has clearly shown that the NR2B cytosolic
domain can act as a dominant recycling signal and likely contributes to the developmental differences observed in NMDAR
trafficking. Furthermore, we anticipate this approach will be a
valuable tool to dissect out domains and motifs that are important in the trafficking of multimeric protein complexes.

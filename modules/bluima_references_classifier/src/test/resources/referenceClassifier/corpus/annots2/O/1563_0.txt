ELISAs

Tissue samples were homogenized as described in detail elsewhere
(Hughes et al., 2002). IL-1b, Interleukin-6 (IL-6, R & D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) and MCP-1 ELISAs (Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA, USA) were carried out according to the manufacturers'
instructions. Tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) ELISA was provided
by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control
(NIBSC). The plate was coated with a sheep TNF-a antibody
(2 lg / mL) diluted in coating buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl,
1.5 mm KH2PO4 and 2.7 mm Na2HPO4.2H20) for 12 h at 4 C. The
plate was blocked with 1% albumin (chicken egg grade; Sigma) in
coating buffer at room temperature. The secondary antibody, biotinylated sheep anti-mouse TNF-a was diluted 1 : 1000 in coating buffer
supplemented with 2% normal sheep serum.
Spike recovery showed that 95% of recombinant IL-1b, TNF-a,
IL-6 and MCP-1 added to na ̈ıve mouse brain homogenate was
recovered in the assays (recovery). Protein concentrations of the
samples were determined using a commercially available Bio-Rad

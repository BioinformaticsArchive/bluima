desensitization. Although little interaction was observed among
inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptors, activation of an excitatory receptor had marked effects on inhibitory responses. Muscarinic agonists, which produce an inward current in LC neurons, reduced the magnitude of agonist-induced outward
currents and increased both the rate and amount of opioid
desensitization. Muscarinic activation did not alter desensitization of a,-adrenoceptor responses. Acute desensitization
shares several characteristics with the tolerance induced by
chronic morphine treatment of animals.

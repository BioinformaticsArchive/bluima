Signal analysis

Oscillatory activity in the STN and the EEG were studied by means of
Gabor transforms. A discrete Gabor expansion can be used to
represent the time–frequency distribution of the energy in the signal.
The signal is expressed as a weighted sum of time–frequency-shifted
versions of an elementary function g(t).

Female Wistar rats (brc, University of New South Wales, 6^8
weeks of age; 124^177 g at operation) were used in this study.
Under anaesthesia with intraperitoneal ketamine (60 mg/kg)
plus xylazine (10 mg/kg), either the left sciatic nerve close to
its trifurcation was ligated and cut peripherally, or the ventral
ramus of the left L5 (occasionally L4) spinal nerve was transected and 1^2 mm removed. In one animal, Fast Blue (FB) was
applied to the cut axons at the time of the sciatic lesion. Three
days (n = 4), 1 (n = 4), 4 (n = 3) and 10^12 (n = 4, one with FB)
weeks after sciatic nerve lesions and 1 (n = 4), 4 (n = 4) and 11
(n = 3) weeks after spinal nerve lesions, rats were reanaesthetised

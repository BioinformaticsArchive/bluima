In the present investigation the brain of a clinically di-agnosed 70-year-old male German SCA4 patient along
with the brains from four age-matched individuals
without medical histories of neuropsychiatric diseases
(1 female, 3 males; mean age at death 64.3  6.1 years)
were studied. The Ethical board of the Faculty of
Medicine at the J.W. Goethe-University of Frankfurt/
Main approved the examination of these brains.
The presented male SCA4 patient is a member of a
five-generation ADCA family from the northern part of
Germany with 14 known affected individuals (Fig. 1).
In affected family members, age at disease onset ranges
from 20â€“61 years and, similar to the first described
SCA4 family of Scandinavian origin, did not show
clear anticipation (i.e. earlier onset and more severe
course of disease symptoms in successive generations)
within five generations (Flanigan et al., 1996). Gait
and stance ataxia and balance disorder commonly are
the first clinical signs in diseased family members,
followed over years by dysarthria, limb ataxia and dysmetria, hypo- or areflexia, as well as profound somatosensory impairments.
After receipt of informed consent for genetic analysis, genomic DNA of the patient and of all known
family members were isolated from peripheral leucocytes according to a standard protocol. In each instance,
repeat expansions of all currently known SCA genes

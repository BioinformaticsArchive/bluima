under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 6A). Whether the ho-mogenization was performed in the presence of EGTA or of
Ca2+, the cytosols contained 25 6 5% of the total protein, the
Lubrol-soluble proteins 58 6 5%, and the Lubrol-insoluble pellets 17 6 3%. The relative amount of striatin in each fraction
was assessed by scanning of Western blots (Fig. 6B). When the
homogenate was prepared in the presence of 1 mM EGTA,
striatin was present in highest amount in the Lubrol-soluble
fraction (Fig. 6C, lane 2), but was also found in the cytosol
fraction (lane 3) and in the Lubrol-insoluble fraction (lane 1).
When the homogenate was made in the presence of 100 μM
Ca2+ (lanes 4 – 6), the Lubrol-insoluble fraction did not contain
any striatin (lane 6). Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms showed that in the latter case, the striatin content of the
cytosol was almost twice that measured in the absence of Ca2+
(Fig. 6C). The same experiments were repeated four times with
the same results.

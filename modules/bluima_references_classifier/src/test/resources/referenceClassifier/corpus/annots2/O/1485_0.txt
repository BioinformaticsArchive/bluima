Hyperthermia-induced seizures

Prolonged FS were elicited in 10-day-old rats (weighing 20.8 ± 0.6 g;
n = 8) by heated-air-induced hyperthermia using a previously
described paradigm (Baram et al., 1997; Chen et al., 1999; Dube
et al., 2000). Briefly, one–two pups were placed in a round Perspex
cylinder (inner diameter: 13 cm; height: 46 cm) and exposed to a
regulated stream of heated air (41–53 C) generated by an adjustable
hair dryer directed $ 46 cm above the animals. Core temperatures

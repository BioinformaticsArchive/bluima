METHODS

Animal preparation
Experiments were performed on 130 Sprague-Dawley male rats
weighing 250-300 g. After an intraperitoneal injection of 100 pg
atropine sulfate, the animals were deeply anesthetized with 2%
halothane in a nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture (â€œ/3 - `/,). A tracheal
cannula was inserted, the jugular vein was cannulated, and then the
animals were paralyzed by an intravenous injection of gallamine
triethiodide (Flaxedil) and artificially ventilated with the use of a
Palmer pump. The expiratory CO2 was continuously monitored,
with a Capnomac (Datex Instrumentarium), during the whole ex-periment, and the end-tidal CO, was maintained around 4%. The
level of halothane, 02, and N20 was also systematically checked
during the experimental period. The heart rate was continuously
monitored and core temperature maintained at 37 t OSOC (mean t
SE) by means of a homeothermic blanket system.
The animals were mounted in a stereotaxic frame. The head was
fixed in a dorsiflexed position (incisor bar elevated 10 mm above
the standard position) (Paxinos and Watson 1986). Two craniotomies were performed on the right side, one at the frontoparietalis
suture level (for passage of hypothalamic stimulating electrodes)
and the second at the occipitoparietalis level (for passage of parabrachial recording electrodes). The dura was then removed. After
surgery the halothane level was reduced to OS%, and the mixture
of nitrous oxide/oxygen was maintained at `/, - l/3 to achieve the
level of anesthesia that was adequate for ethical purposes but did
not excessively depress neuronal responses to noxious stimuli (Be-noist et al. 1984; Le Bars et al. 1980).

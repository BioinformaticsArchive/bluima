fragment-treated (IN-1 Fab) cerebella. Note the similar distribution of reactive neurons for either marker in the corresponding sections. The average
number of labeled neurons per section is reported in the plots on the right side of the plate. Each point represents the value obtained from a single animal.
A large number of c-Jun-labeled neurons (top plot) are present 2 d after injection. Their number gradually decreases thereafter and returns almost to
basal levels at 7 d. NADPH diaphorase-reactive Purkinje cells (bottom plot) are evident at 5 d; two animals have ;100 cell per sections, whereas the others
show a smaller number of labeled cells. Also, in this case the number of reactive neurons is close to control values at 7 d. Note, however, that both the
control Fab ( filled squares) or saline injections ( filled triangles) yielded only a small number of labeled cells per section, which was consistently lower than
that counted in time-matched I N-1 Fab fragment-treated cerebella.

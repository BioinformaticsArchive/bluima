low (Figs 1–3). PrPC was not significantly detected from liver
tissue (Figs 3 and 4). This indicates that liver tissue contains the
lowest amount of PrPC, if any, within the detection limits of the
immuno-concentration method described in the present work.
Secondly, we investigated the distribution of PrPC along
the digestive tract. Sections of tissue from the gastrointestinal
tract were removed from the second series of sheep (ewes
IV–VII). Only results from ewe VII are shown. We have
observed that the signals obtained for PrPC from these tissues
were often diffuse at the level of biglycosylated forms (Figs 3
and 4). The distribution of PrPC along the digestive tract was
shown to be different from one sheep to another (Fig. 2). In
ewe VII, PrPC was found all along the digestive tract, with
more PrPC in the reticulum and ileum (Figs 3 and 4), whereas
in ewe IV, PrPC was mainly detected in the reticulum, rumen
and duodenum (Fig. 2). In ewe V, PrPC was concentrated in the
reticulum and rumen (Fig. 2).
In order to check that the PrPC isoforms detected in some
tissues corresponded to glycoforms, we carried out a
deglycosylation experiment on PrPC immunoprecipitated from

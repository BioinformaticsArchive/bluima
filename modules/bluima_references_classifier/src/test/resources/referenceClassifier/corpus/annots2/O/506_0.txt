Northern Blot Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the hippocampus of each
group. Twenty micrograms of RNA samples from each group
were electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels and
transferred onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech Ltd., Buckinghamshire, U.K.). The Rediprime DNA
labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to
label mouse hsp40 cDNA fragment with [ -32P] dCTP. The
membranes were hybridized with each probe and all hybridization procedures were performed according to the manufacture's
recommendations as described previously (Ohtsuki et al., 1996).
As controls, cDNA fragments for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were used.

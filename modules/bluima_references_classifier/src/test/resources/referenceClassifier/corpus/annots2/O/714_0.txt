2.8.3. Testing phase
This phase was conducted exactly as the preconditioning
phase, i.e., free access to both compartments. The time
spent in each compartment was measured for 18 min. A
score value was calculated for each mouse as the difference between time spent in the drug-paired compartment
during the postconditioning and preconditioning phases.
Data were analysed by using two-way ANOVA with
genotype and treatment as factors of variation (between
subjects). Subsequent one-way ANOVAs were calculated
when appropriate.

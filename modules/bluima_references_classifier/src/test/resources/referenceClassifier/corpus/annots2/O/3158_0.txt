Modifications of spontaneous neuronal activity after
the performance of motor tests

The quantitative analysis of characteristics of SA
patterns of VL neurons indicated that functional
changes after the performance of repetitive motor
tests are accompanied by the transient modifications
of spontaneous activities of A- and B-units.

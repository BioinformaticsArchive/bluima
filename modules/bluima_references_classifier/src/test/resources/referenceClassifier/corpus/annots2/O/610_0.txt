distributed between the two experimental groups; 5 of the
11 animals with higher cumulative immune responses
were in the fresh cell transplant group and six were in the
cryopreserved cell group.
Mean immune response scores for all animals in each
experimental group are shown in Table II. There was no
statistical significance in the differences observed between
fresh and cryopreserved cell transplant groups when comparing either scores for each individual stain (H&E, OX1,
or OX42) or the cumulative immune response scores.
Thus, immune responses did not appear to vary between
the two experimental groups, indicating that cryopreserved cells do not elicit a stronger immune response in the
animal model.
Representative examples of immunohistological
staining of brain tissue from the two treatment groups are
shown in Figures 3, 4, and 8. Included in these figures are
examples from each treatment group and representative
immunohistochemical stains. In addition, animals exemplifying various levels of immune rejection are included.
In the fresh group, one animal that exhibited rotational
recovery between 12 and 15 weeks exemplified a healthy,
stable graft with surviving TH-IR neurons, patchy CD44
pig glial staining, and a network of NF70-positive pig
neurons (Fig. 3). The immune response for this animal was
minimal (cumulative immune response score of 2), with
only light OX1 staining of macrophages and activated
microglia. In addition, there was evidence of increased
OX42-IR microglia around the graft border and a slight
migration of microglia into the graft. In the cryopreserved
group, one animal that showed amphetamine-induced
rotational recovery at 15 weeks is shown in Figure 4. This
animal also had a very healthy-appearing, stable graft and
a cumulative immune response score of 2.
An example of histological staining from animals
with a greater inflammatory response to the porcine graft
is shown in Figure 8. Although the porcine cells appear
healthy with respect to TH-, NF70-, and CD44-IR cells,
the cumulative immune response score was 10. There
were infiltrating cells and red blood cells evident by H&E
stain. The infiltrating cells also included OX1-IR cells
with both lymphocytic and microglial morphology and
OX42-IR activated microglia. Infiltrating cells were lo-calized in perivascular regions within the graft. However,
despite these infiltrating cells, the transplanted cells ap-peared healthy, and the graft was functional based on
rotational correction at the end of the study. Given this
level of inflammatory response, the graft might have been
rejected had the study not been terminated 15 weeks after
the cells were transplanted.
DISCUSSION
Transplantation of fetal brain tissue for the treatment
of Parkinson's disease has been studied experimentally for
more than 2 decades (Bjo Ìˆ rklund and Stenevi, 1979). During this time, the field of cell therapy has focused on
methods to obtain tissue reproducibly to supply dopaminergic neurons that reinnervate the striatum. Clinically,
both human and porcine fetal tissues have been used as the

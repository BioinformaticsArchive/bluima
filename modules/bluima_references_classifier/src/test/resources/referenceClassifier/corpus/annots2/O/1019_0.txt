expressed following neuronal activity (Morgan and Curran,
1991); therefore, the distribution of Fos-positive neurons
reflects the activated brain areas in response to stress.
Warm environmental exposure resulted in strong c-fos
expression of the activated neurons. We detected and
evaluated with a semi-quantitative analysis the distribution
and activation of specific brain areas in warm- and coldstressed animals (Table 1).

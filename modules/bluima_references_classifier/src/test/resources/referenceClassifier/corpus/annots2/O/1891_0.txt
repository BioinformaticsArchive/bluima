Figure 8. Model of rapid glucocorticoid signaling in SON magnocellular neurons. According
to this model, glucocorticoids (CORT) bind to a membrane-associated, G-protein-coupled re-ceptor (mbGR) and activate divergent intracellular G-protein signaling pathways. Activation of
G s leads to cAMP/PKA-dependent endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis; the activated G dimer
leads downstream to nNOS activation and NO synthesis. Endocannabinoids then act in a retrograde manner to suppress glutamate release from excitatory synaptic terminals via CB1 activation, and NO feeds back onto inhibitory synaptic terminals to facilitate GABA release onto SON
magnocellular neurons. The combined suppression of synaptic excitation and facilitation of
synaptic inhibition by glucocorticoids should cause a reduced excitability of the magnocellular
neurons and a decrease in oxytocin (OXY) and vasopressin (AVP) release into the blood.

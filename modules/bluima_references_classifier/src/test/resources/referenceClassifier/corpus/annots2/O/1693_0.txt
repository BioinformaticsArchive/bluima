brated affinity columns (0.8 4 cm) under gravity flow. After
extensive washing, the columns were eluted with 0.2 M glycine
and 0.15 M NaCl (pH 2.7) and collected into tubes containing
200 mM Tris-HCl, 50 M iodoacetate, 50 M 4-(2-aminoethyl)
benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 M EDTA, and 50 g/ml leupeptin. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10 –20% Tris/
glycine gradient gels. All runs were carried out at 4 °C. Three
separate affinity chromatography runs were carried out for
each column ligand.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein bands separated by
SDS-PAGE were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and
digested overnight with sequencing-grade trypsin in situ at
37 °C. Samples were run on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operating in the
reflector mode. Samples were dissolved in a 50% solution of
acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) and dried on the sample
plate. A nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm was employed to
ionize the sample. The accelerating voltage was set to 20 kV
employing a 275-ns delay before introduction of ions into the
flight tube of the mass spectrometer. The mass scale (m/z 500 –
5000) was calibrated with a mixture of peptides (400 fmol/ l),
and 100 laser shots were used to produce each spectrum. Peak
lists were submitted to the Mascot search engine with no taxonomy limitation and a peptide tolerance set to 100 ppm.
Immunoblot Analysis—Briefly, samples were heated at 90 °C
for 5 min in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, loaded onto
gels, and electrophoresed. Gels were transferred to Hybond
ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 50
V overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% milk or bovine serum albumin (BSA; used with biotinylated primary antibodies) at room temperature for 1 h and
washed 3 10 min with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h and washed as
described above. Next, the membranes were incubated with
either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse
IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (both
from Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and washed. Detection
was accomplished using ECL Western blotting substrate
(Pierce), and images were captured either on film or using a
VersaDoc 3000 imaging system (Bio-Rad) and quantitated with
the manufacturer's Quantity One software.
Co-immunoprecipitation—A peptides were resuspended in
Me SO to 2.5 mM and used at 10.8 M. MBP was used at 1.56
2

M. Proteins were combined in 250 l of incubation buffer
(PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% BSA). Anti-MBP mAb 382 was
added to each sample mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with
rocking. After incubation, 20 l of washed GammaBind protein
G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each
mixture, followed by incubation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C
with rocking. Beads were separated by centrifugation at 8000
g for 2 min. Supernatants were removed, and beads were
washed with 1 ml of incubation buffer. Separation and washing
were repeated three times. A final wash was performed in PBS
and 0.05% Tween 20 to remove excess BSA. Centrifuged beads
were combined with 25 l of reducing SDS-PAGE loading
buffer and heated as described above. 10 l of each sample/
loading buffer mixture was loaded onto 10 –20% Tricine gels

tion of T cells and NK cells, IL-2R expression as well as alternative pathway of T cell activation via CD2-T11TS interaction
were well documented [5,6,22]. Further investigation revealed
that T11TS exerts a strong mitogenic stimulus through T11
(CD2)-associated Src-like protein tyrosine kinase from the surface of T lymphocytes [15]. However any disease relevance of
the glycopeptide was surprisingly lacking [23] until our previous studies demonstrated its immunotherapeutic and antitumor

IL-12 [natural killer (NK) cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic
lymphocyte maturation factor] enhances the lytic activity of
NK/lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, facilitates specific
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, is a growth factor for
activated T and NK cells, induces interferon-g (IFN-g) from T and
NK cells, and inhibits angiogenesis (Gately et al., 1991). IL-12
may function as an immunomodulator in the treatment of malignancies and significantly retards the growth of some murine tumors
(Nastala et al., 1994). However, vaccination with B7-1 transduced
tumor cells and systemic recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) cured mice
bearing wild-type parental tumors more effectively than rIL-12
alone (Rao et al., 1996; Putzer et al., 1997).
In the present study, we examined the antitumor effects of rIL-12
and genetically engineered glioma cells expressing B7-1 or both
B7-1 and ICAM-1 in a brain tumor model.

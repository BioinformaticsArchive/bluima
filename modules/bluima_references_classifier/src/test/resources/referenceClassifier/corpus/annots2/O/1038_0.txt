Fig. 2. Effects of ET-1 on NBDL-CSA transport in isolated capillaries. A,
concentration-dependent decrease in steady-state luminal NBDL-CSA
accumulation caused by ET-1. B, effect of ET-1 on steady-state luminal
NBDL-CSA accumulation. Capillaries were loaded to steady state (60
min) in medium with 2 M NBDL-CSA. Then (time 0 on graph), 100 nM
ET-1 was added to the medium; 90 min later, ET-1 was removed. Each
point represents the mean value for 7 to 15 capillaries from a single
preparation (pooled tissue from 3–10 rats); variability is given by S.E.
bars. Units are arbitrary fluorescence units (scale, 0 –255). Statistical
comparisons: , significantly smaller than control, P 0.001.

riously compromised our conclusions, it is
possible that small errors from a number of
sources have had a cumulative effect that is
not negligible. For this reason numerical re-sults such as the exact speed for divergence
between Vl dominance and MT dominance
should be considered as our best estimate of
an actual value that may be somewhat higher
or lower.
The greatest virtue of these experiments
may be that they lead to an eminently testable
hypothesis concerning the neural substrate for
apparent motion. We would expect that an
MT lesion would compromise a monkey's
ability to detect apparent motion at high
speeds and large interflash intervals while
having relatively little effect on its performance
at low speeds and small interflash intervals.
With recently developed techniques for making selective MT lesions (18), this experiment
appears practical and should provide a decisive
behavioral test of the conclusions suggested
by this study.

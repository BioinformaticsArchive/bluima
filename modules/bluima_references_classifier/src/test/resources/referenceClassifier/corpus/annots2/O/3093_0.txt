Figure 3 shows the mean magnitudes of the analyzed
components of respiratory activity of each nerve after
pontine carbachol, expressed relative to the magnitude
of the corresponding component in the control condition
(100%). After carbachol, the magnitude of the activity
of all nerves was significantly less than control. Mean
Phr activity decreased to 87 6 3.0% of control (n = 18
injections, P < 0.001), RLI-Aug activity decreased to 79 6
3.1% (n = 13, P < 0.001 ), RLE-Dec activity decreased to
72 6 4.7% (n = 10, P < 0.01), XIII-Aug activity decreased
to 15 6 3.2% (n = 15, P < 0.001), and PharE-Aug activity
decreased to 8.3 6 2.9% (n = 16, P < 0.001). The mean
arterial blood pressure decreased by 12 6 1.8 mmHg
(n = 18), corresponding to a relative mean decrease to
89 6 1.3% of control (n = 18, P < 0.001). The mean TI
was 3.1 6 0.5 s (median = 5.3 s) during the control
period and 3.2 6 0.6 s (median = 6.6 s) after carbachol,
and the mean TE was 5.1 6 0.4 s (median = 5.8 s)
during control and 5.9 6 0.6 s (median = 8.3 s) after
carbachol. The TI and TE values and their differences
before and after carbachol were not distributed nor-

CB1 null-mutant mice were generated by homologous recombination as described (Ledent et al. 1999). Briefly, a phosphoglycerokinase-Neo cassette was inserted between AvrII and SfiI sites located
1073 base pairs apart, replacing the first 233 codons of the gene.
Homologous recombination in R1 cells and aggregation with CD1
eight-cell stage embryos were performed. A recombinant line was
used to generate chimeras allowing germ line transmission of the
mutant gene. Heterozygous mice were bred for 15 generations on a
CD1 background before generating the wild-type and CB1 null
littermates used in this study. The F14 generation of homozygous
mice was genotyped and therefore used to produce the F15
generation that has been used for the experiments. Adult male

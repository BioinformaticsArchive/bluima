Cloning and Expression of the NEDL1 E3 Geneâ€”To detect
novel molecules that are important in regulating neuronal
programmed cell death, we constructed oligo-capping cDNA
libraries from a mixture of three fresh human neuroblastoma
tissues (stages 1 and 2) that were undergoing gradual spontaneous regression, probably by neuronal apoptosis (14).
Screening of 1152 novel genes by RT-PCR revealed that 194
genes were expressed differentially in regressing neuroblastomas with favorable prognosis and in aggressive tumors
with poor prognosis. Among these genes, we found a partial
cDNA sequence with an HECT-like domain (Nbla0078) that
partially matched the KIAA0322 gene. Because KIAA0322
lacks a 5 -coding region, we used a genome-based PCR procedure to clone the corresponding full-length cDNA. This is
predicted to encode a protein product of 1585 amino acids
with homology to NEDD4 E3 (15, 16), which includes a C2
domain at the N-terminal region supposed to mediate its
membrane localization in a calcium-dependent manner, two
WW motifs important for protein-protein interaction through
binding to specific proline-rich clusters, and a conserved catalytic HECT domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). We named
this novel ligase, which mapped to chromosome 7p13, NEDL1
(NEDD4-like ubiquitin-protein ligase-1). We also cloned the
mouse counterpart of NEDL1 cDNA, whose amino acid se-quence is 78% identical to the human sequence. Tissue-specific expression of NEDL1 mRNA of 10 and 7 kb in size was
observed, with predominant expression in adult and fetal
brains as examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Its

The methods describing this EE paradigm have been previously described in detail (Wallace et al., 1995 ; Pinaud et al.,
2001). The subjects in these experiments were all age-matched
adult male Sprague^Dawley rats that weighed 210 7 g (n = 27,
Charles River, Canada). Rats were exposed to a 12/12-h light^
dark cycle. Animals belonged to one of three experimental conditions. (1) Animals belonging to the `enriched environment'
group (EE, n = 9) spent 1 h/day together in a 3 mU1.5
mU1 m basin that had been lined with standard bedding material and Â¢lled with toys, tubes and food rewards. For the
remainder of their day, rats remained in their home cages.
(2) Animals in the `handled-only' group (HO, n = 9) were lifted
and held repeatedly throughout 5 min then allowed to remain in
their home cages. This condition was designed to reveal any
changes in gene expression that may have been induced in EE
animals as a result of handling or as part of an expectation
response to the handler. (3) Undisturbed controls (UD, n = 9)
remained in their home cages throughout the experiment. The
duration of this experiment was 3 weeks. Variability in gene
expression related to circadian cycle was minimized by employing a consistent schedule with EE and HO protocols conducted
between 15.00 h and 16.00 h daily. During this time, behavior
was monitored for each experimental group in order to assess
levels of wakefulness and activity. Several rats in the HO and
UD groups were not included in the histological analyses
because of low activity levels. Rats included in the analyses
had approximately similar activity levels. Our experimental procedures conformed to institutional regulations and the Guide to
the Care and Use of Experimental Animals from the Canadian
Council on Animal Care.

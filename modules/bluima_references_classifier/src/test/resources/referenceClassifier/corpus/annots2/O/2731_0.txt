Fig. 1. Serial ABRs elicited by 8000-Hz tone pips at various stimulus intensities (dB peSPL) at 12 months of age. (A) Normal ABRs (thin tracings) from a
typical control animal (0% EDC group), compared with those from an animal in the
17.5%EDCgroup(thicktracings)thathadabnormalABRs.(B)Normal&Rs (thin
tracings) from a typical control animal (0% EDC group), compared with ahnormal
ABRs gathered from an animal in the 35% EDC group. The 17.5 and 35% EDC
animals had ABRs with reduced amplitudes, prolonged latencies, and elevated
thresholds. Latencieson the x-axis include a 0.3-msec acoustic transit time from
the activation of the headphone to the stimulus's arrival at the animal's ears.

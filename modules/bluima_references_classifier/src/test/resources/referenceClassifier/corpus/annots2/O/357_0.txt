terminal domain (CTCK) in the C-terminal region. Also, vWF C and D
domains alternate with the TSR domains. This sequence was deduced
from the sequencing of overlapping cDNA clones obtained by successive screening of a bovine SCO cDNA expression library (for details,
see Meiniel et al., 1995; Gobron et al., 1996). The EMBL accession
numbers corresponding to this entire sequence are X93922; Y08560;
Y08561; AJ132106; AJ132107; AJ133488.

Fig. 1. n-Butyrate induces differentiation in MN9D cells. A: MN9D
cells were treated with 1 mM n-butyrate. Morphological changes can
be observed 6 days after treatment. Untreated MN9D cells were
round and only occasionally extended short neurites, whereas n-bu-tyrate-treated cells had flattened cell bodies and extension of longer
neurites. B: n-Butyrate-treated cells expressed the neuronal marker,
GAP43. Immunostaining showed that n-butyrate treated MN9D cells
expressed GAP43, which was not expressed in the control cells.

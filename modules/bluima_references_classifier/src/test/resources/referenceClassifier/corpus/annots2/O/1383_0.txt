The competitive muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine methyl bromide (Sigma) was dissolved in saline. Drug solutions
were mixed at the beginning of each experiment and stored in 60-lL
aliquots at 4 C until use. The drug doses of 5 or 10 lg / 0.5 lL were
chosen to maintain consistency with our previous research (Pratt &
Kelley, 2004) and are concordant with other effective striatal
treatments in the literature.

FIG. 7. Proposed mechanism for rhythmic and specific expression of zfaanat2 in the pineal gland. Pineal expression of zfaanat2 8.
is enhanced by a synergistic interaction of OTX5-PCE and CLOCK/
BMAL-E-box complexes. A functional E-box (E) and three PCEs (P) are 9.
located within a downstream regulatory region (PRDM). These ele-10.
ments recruit the rhythmic (sinus wave) and ubiquitously expressed
11.
(dark fish) transcriptional factors heterodimer BMAL/CLOCK (B and
C) and the arrhythmic and pineal-specific expressed (white fish, arrow 12.
indicates pineal expression location) OTX5 (O), respectively. The interface contact between the protein shapes represent the possibility of 13.
physical interaction between BMAL/CLOCK and OTX5.

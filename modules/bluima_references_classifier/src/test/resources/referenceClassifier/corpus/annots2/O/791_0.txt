Fast recovery from inactivation is unaltered in DGCs
following S.E.
Fast recovery from inactivation in DGCs was studied with
double-pulse experiments (see inset Fig. 3A) at a recovery
potential of 80 mV. The recovery from inactivation could
be best described by a biexponential equation (equation 3)
shown superimposed on the data points (Fig. 3B), with
fast,1 and fast,2 corresponding to the two time constants of
recovery. Clearly, fast recovery from inactivation was un-altered by S.E. (Fig. 3B, control: fast,1 6.8 0.6 ms,

(25, 27, 52, 53). Re-inoculation to mice of the cell culture-propagated agent revealed no permanent change of its molecular
profile and strain properties (26, 27, 52â€“55). The phenomenon
has been proposed to simply reflect post-translational differences of PrPC molecules when expressed either in culture or
tissue (52, 53). Thus, unglycosylated PrPC in mouse cell lines
migrate faster than mouse brain PrPC, putatively reflecting different compositions of the GPI moieties (52). New findings of
the present study offer clarification of the cause of these observations. Our results established that, whereas in mouse prioninfected cells the N termini of endogenously and PK-cleaved
PrPSc are similar (i.e. both Pc248-negative and 12B2-positive), a
more complex situation prevails in sheep prion-infected cells;
indeed, two factors appeared to account for the molecular mass
difference observed between brain and cell PrPres fragments: (i)
a differential mobility of PrPC due to the variable composition
of the GPI moiety, which was abolished after removal of the
latter by hydrofluoric acid treatment, information lacking in
the former studies; (ii) the production of distinguishable N termini produced by in vivo (endogenous) and in vitro (PK) cleavages. Likewise, not only PrPC tissue-specific differences, such as
those reported in the human and sheep species (7, 31, 35), but
also different trimming capabilities, as observed here in two
mouse models (tg338 and tga20), might account for PrPres
molecular mass discrepancies in neural and lymphoid tissues in
naturally infected hosts.

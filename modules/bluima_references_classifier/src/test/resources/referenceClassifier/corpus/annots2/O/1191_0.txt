and restored after the further addition of CGP55845. (B,C) Bar charts of group data (n 8) showing significant reduction in the mean amplitude and
mean frequency, respectively, of individual sIPSCs in the presence of 0.5 M baclofen, and reversal of the effect after addition of 1 M CGP55845
(* P 0.05, ANOVA and Tukey's test). (D) Example power spectra computed for 30 s recordings of compound sIPSC activity depicted in the recordings
shown in Fig. 5A. In the control situation there is a prominent peak in the power spectrum in the frequency range (4 â€“15 Hz), caused by the presence
of rhythmic compound IPSC activity. This peak in the power spectrum was eliminated after the application of 0.5 M baclofen, and was restored by
the addition of 1 M CGP55845. (F) The corresponding autocorrelograms show the rhythmic nature of the compound sIPSC activity in the control
situation, and elimination of the rhythmic activity after addition of 0.5 M baclofen. (F,G) Bar charts of group data (n 6) showing significant reduction
in the mean frequency and normalized area power of the rhythmic compound sIPSC activity, respectively, in the presence of 0.5 M baclofen and
reversal of the effects after addition of 1 M CGP55845 (* P 0.05, ANOVA and Tukey's test).

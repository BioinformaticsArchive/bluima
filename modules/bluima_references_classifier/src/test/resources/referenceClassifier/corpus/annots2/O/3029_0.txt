and did not correlate with histopathology. [3H]AMPA and
[3H]GLU returned to control levels 4 weeks postischemia in
dentate gyrus, consistent with ischemia inhibiting receptor
protein synthesis throughout the brain, resulting in a transient
decline in glutamate receptors across cortical and hippocampal regions independent of histopathology (57). These studies
suggest that changes in glutamate receptor density are triggered in most neurons following ischemia, whereas delayed
neuronal death occurs in only certain susceptible neurons.
Chronic ethanol by increasing sensitivity to glutamate likely
increases sensitivity to both the decreases in receptors as well
as the loss of neurons.
Transient global ischemia, which occurs clinically in pa-tients surviving cardiac arrest, causes irreversible injury to a
few specific populations of neurons, particularly hippocampal
CA1. Delayed neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 following
global ischemia has been reported in the rat (45) the gerbil
(27), and in humans (43). NMDA receptor blockage by competitive antagonists (52,55) or noncompetitive antagonists
such has MK-801 have been reported to protect against CA1
damage in both the rat (15,23,46,56) and gerbil (3,22,33,46) in
most but not all studies (4). Ethanol blocks NMDA receptor
responses including excitotoxicity, suggesting that it might
protect against transient ischemia. Ethanol (3 g/kg) lowered
body temperature during ischemia and did show protection
against global ischemia-induced delayed CA1 neuronal death.
Ethanol is well known to lower body temperature dependent
upon the ambient temperature. A 2â€“48C decline in brain temperature during or following transient ischemia in rats has
been reported to significantly attenuate ischemic brain damage (5,6). This prompted a series of experiments where body
temperature was carefully controlled. When body temperature was maintained, no significant protection was found.
Thus, ethanol (3 g/kg) induced hypothermia will protect
against cerebral ischemia.
There are several possible explanations for the lack of ethanol protection when body temperature is maintained at
378C. Although it is possible that the dose of 3 g/kg was not
sufficient to block NMDA receptors, previous studies have in-dicated that as little as 0.75 g/kg ethanol can block NMDA re-

Neither the dualistic flesh–spirit, soul–body or mind–
brain philosophies, nor Kant's escapism into transcendental metaphysics, which is by definition beyond our
capacity, explain the psycho-physiological phenomenon.
Encouraged by modern technology, contemporary
scientists developed a neuropsychological dualism. The
mysterious entity, by account of which neuroscientists
try in vain to explain psychophysiological events, is the
brain. Current conjectures in neurosciences, psychology,
biology, medicine and other related sciences are based
on the correlation between instances of brain damage,
stimuli, and electrical or chemical neurophysiological
processes on the one hand, and `psychological' or behavioral events on the other. Most contemporary works on
these issues are grounded on the notion that we receive
information about objects and events by sense organs.

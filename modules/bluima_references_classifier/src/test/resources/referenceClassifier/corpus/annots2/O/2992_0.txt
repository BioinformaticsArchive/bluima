The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is localized to the human chromosome region 5q21â€“224,10,20
and mutated not only in familial adenomatous
polyposis but also in sporadic colorectal tu-mours.4,8,13,17,30,34 Almost all germline and somatic
mutations found to date are nonsense or frame-shift
mutations that result in a carboxy-terminal truncation of the APC gene product. Germline APC mutations are known to induce extracolonic disorders. In
Gardner's syndrome, benign soft tissue and bone
tumours, dental abnormalities, desmoid tumour and
polyps in the upper gastrointestinal tract co-exist.6
Turcot's syndrome includes familial adenomatous
polyposis and brain tumours.44 The APC gene is also
considered to be essential for normal development;
development of the primitive ectoderm prior to
gastrulation failed in mouse embryos carrying
homozygous APC mutant alleles.26
The APC gene product is a 300,000 mol. wt cytoplasmic protein composed of 2843 amino acids.8,17,40

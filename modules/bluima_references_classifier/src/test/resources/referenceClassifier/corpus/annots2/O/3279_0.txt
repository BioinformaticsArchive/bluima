MATERIALS AND METHODS
Intrahippocampal injections. Adult male wild-type mice, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-deficient (tPA-/-) mice (Carmeliet et al., 1994),
plasminogen-deficient (plg -/-) mice (Bugge et al., 1995), or
plasminogen-heterozygous (plg +/-) mice (Bugge et al., 1995) were in-jected intraperitoneally with atropine (0.6 mg/kg of body weight) and
then were anesthetized deeply with 2.5% avertin (0.02 ml/gm of body
weight). They were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus and injected unilaterally with 1.5 or 0.5 nmol of kainate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO or Alexis,
San Diego, CA) in 0.3 μl of PBS into the hippocampus (Andersson et al.,
1991; Tsirka et al., 1995). After variable lengths of time, the animals were
anesthetized and perfused through the heart with ice-cold PBS, followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. The brains were removed,
post-fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4°C, and then left in 30%
sucrose in PBS for 48 hr at 4°C. Coronal brain sections (30 μm) were cut
on a microtome, collected in 10 mM PBS, and then processed for cresyl
violet staining and immunohistochemistry. For cresyl violet staining, the
sections were mounted onto slides, dehydrated, and then stained with
cresyl violet, which stains rough endoplasmic reticulum in neuronal cell
bodies.
Intrahippocampal inf usions. To obtain autologous plasma for inf usion,
;200 μl of blood was collected from the femoral vein under anesthesia

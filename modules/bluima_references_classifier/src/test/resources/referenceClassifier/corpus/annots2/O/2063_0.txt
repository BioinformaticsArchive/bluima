BRAIN H202 PRODUCTION IN HYPEROXIA 1763
able in all regions of the rat brain as shown in Table 2.
Aminotriazole levels tended to be higher after hyperoxic
convulsions in all brain regions. The posterior subcortex
consistently had the lowest aminotriazole concentrations, so it was used as the reference region for aminotriazole uptake for all studies. Brains containing ~60 pg
aminotriazole/g wet wt in posterior subcortex were not
used so that aminotriazole concentration would not be
rate limiting for catalase inactivation (27). The possibility of postmortem production of H202 was also excluded
in separate animals injected with aminotriazole 30 min
before death. No systematic changes in measured catalase activity were found for brain samples allowed to
remain at room air temperature for 5, 10, 15, or 20 min

to hold an object without crushing it.‚Äù Likewise, GL uses a

We have previously argued that oscillatory synchrony may
characterize a low-level control system that engages and then
maintains the particular level of activity in the large number of
synergistic muscles that are needed to exert efficient grip
between the digits (Kilner et al. 2002). Such a control system
would be highly sensitive to changes in finger position signaled
by cutaneous, joint, and muscle afferents as well as other inputs
from the hand. The present results suggest that this oscillatory
control system cannot exist in the complete absence of somatosensory afferent inputs. These afferent inputs may normally
serve to modulate or even be involved in the generation of 15-to 30-Hz oscillations in the motor system. Such a hypothesis is
consistent with the reduced level of EMG-EMG coherence
after digital nerve block (Fisher et al. 2002) and is further
supported by the well-documented observation that there is a
large burst of such oscillatory activity in the hand area of M1
after median nerve stimulation (Hari and Salenius 1999; Salenius et al. 1997).

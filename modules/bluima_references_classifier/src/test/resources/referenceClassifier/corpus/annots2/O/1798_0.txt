Estradiol increases cytosolic STAT3 phosphorylation in
cortex after MCAO
We first measured STAT3 phosphorylation in the cytosolic fraction prepared from the cerebral cortex at 3 h after MCAO. STAT3
phosphorylation was barely detectable in the cytosolic fractions
from the contralateral side and sham-operated animals (data not
shown). However, STAT3 phosphorylation was induced after
MCAO in the cerebral cortex cytosolic fraction. Figure 1 also
shows that estrogen replacement further enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in postischemic cytosolic fractions compared with
unreplaced OVX animals (n 5 per group; p 0.05). Estradiol
did not change T-STAT3 protein at this early time point, suggesting that estradiol enhances the activation of STAT3 but does not
alter the amount of STAT3 protein in the cerebral cortex after
MCAO. Interestingly, STAT3 phosphorylation was not different
between estradiol-treated and untreated groups at 22 h of reperfusion (n 5 per group; data not shown), suggesting that STAT3
activation in the cytosol is transient.

to an intrinsic defect (Wetts and Herrup, 1982). Thus, in
+/Lc t-) +/+ chimeras, only +/+ PCs remain in the
adult.
We have determined the total number of PCs remaining in four lurcher chimeras and three wild type mice.
For this quantitative analysis, Lc is a more accurate cell
marker than P-glucuronidase activity. Our data reveal
the existence of numerical units of PCs. These findings
suggest that a small number of progenitors gives rise to
the entire population of cerebellar PCs. Furthermore,
these progenitors are committed to becoming PCs very
early in neural development.

Figure 3. CST fibers crossing the midline of the spinal cord. A–C, Photomicrographs illustrate significant numbers of BDA-immunoreactive CST axons sprouting across the midline in
ngr1 / mice after PyX compared with ngr1 / sham and ngr1 / PyX-lesioned mice. Scale
bar, 100 m. D, The average number of CST fibers crossing the midline of the cervical spinal per
transverse section is significantly greater in ngr1 / mice compared with ngr1 / PyX,
ngr1 / sham, and ngr1 / sham-lesioned mice (*p 0.001, ANOVA). Data are the
mean SEM for n 7–10 mice.

acoustic stimuli with an initial highfrequency burst followed by lowfrequency activity. The strongest re-sponses were evoked by stimuli presented
from the most eccentric targets available in
the setup ( 60째, 0째) and ( 70째, 0째). The
cat oriented to the acoustic targets that
were within its oculomotor range, and,
consistent with previous observations in
the head restrained cat (Populin and Yin,
1998), the subject undershot such targets
(Fig. 5 F, G).
The injection of 5 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital changed the magnitude of the
responses to stimuli presented from all
speakers (Fig. 5B). The results are ex-pressed as a percentage of change from the

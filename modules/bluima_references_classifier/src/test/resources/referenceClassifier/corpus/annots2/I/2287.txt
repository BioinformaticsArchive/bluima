ICC varies with developmental age. If more
cells do project to the ipsilateral ICC in the
neonate than in the adult, the possibility
arises that, as in the retinotectal system, the
increased available terminal space in the ICC
might reduce the rate at which these cells
normally die in the course of postnatal de-velopment. That is, the formation of terminals in the ICC would increase the probability
that these cells would be maintained.
Whether the increased input to the ipsilatera1 ICC results from the growth of the
normal complement of terminals or from
reduced cell death, it is likely that the mechanisms are not equally effective for each of
the nuclei that project to the ICC. In contrast
to CN, for example, the lack of any change
in the number of labeled cells in the MS0
following an HRP injection into the ICC
(15) suggests that the maintenance of terminals from this nucleus is unaffected by the
presence of available synaptic space in animals subjected to a cochlear ablation at birth.

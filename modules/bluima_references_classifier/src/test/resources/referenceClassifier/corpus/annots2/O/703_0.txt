binding sites and ultrastructural details is satisfactory, and
allows a sufficient penetration of antibody and marker.
A central part of our methodological study was the use
of the classical substrate DAB instead of colloidal gold.
Though the treatment with OsO enhances the electron

density of the DAB-reaction product, the marking with
DAB alone requires ultrathin sections with low contrast.
Considering this, continuous contrast enhancement with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate does not come into account
when working without metal intensification.
The alternation of noncontrast- and contrast-enhanced
ultrathin sections is an adequate solution to this problem
and provides an attractive alternative to silver-intensification techniques. The loss of information, based on the
distance (60â€“70 nm) between the neighbouring sections, is
tolerable in most cases.
The ANG I / II- and AT -receptor-immunolabelling is

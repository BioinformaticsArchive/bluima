lation (2, 11, 16, 19, 27) of intercostal and phrenic afferents can inhibit the inspiratory motor output. In a previous study (30), we found that the peak integrated diaphragm electromyographic (JEMGdi) response was
reduced during TO in the decerebellated cat with both
vagi blocked. This finding suggested that there were nonvagal afferents evoked by TO capable of significantly re-ducing the drive to the diaphragm. Because subsequent
midcollicular decerebration did eliminate the inhibition
in this preparation, spinal afferents emanating from respiratory muscles became our prime candidates for providing inhibition of the loading response. Therefore we
hypothesize that in the reduced preparation (i.e., decerebellated vagally blocked) the attenuation of inspiratory
(or phrenic) motor drive elicited by TO is provided by
inspiratory muscle afferents traveling in the dorsal column of the spinal cord. To test this assumption, we em-ployed a technique to cold block nerve fibers traveling in
the dorsal column of the spinal cord. In addition, cervical
dorsal rhizotomy (C,-,) was used to differentiate between
phrenic and chest wall/abdominal nerve contributions.
Our results indicate that the observed attenuation of the
peak JEMGdi response to loading is provided by cervical
dorsal roots as well as chest wall/abdominal afferents.

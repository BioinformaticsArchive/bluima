Introduction
Central nervous system (CNS) injuries have dramatic consequences
ascribable to the very limited capability for structural and functional
repair (Bro ̈ samle & Schwab, 1996). Axotomy of the optic nerve is a
classical model to study the effects of traumatic injury in the CNS.
The lack of regeneration in the CNS is due to the contribution of
different intrinsic factors, most of them still poorly understood. The
key elements are the massive degeneration of the injured neurons and
the presence of inhibitory factors, such as molecules involved in scar
formation and myelin associated proteins (Schwab & Bartholdi,
1996). It has been shown that experimental lesions trigger an active
cell death process, in which a number of genes play a regulatory role.
One of these genes, the proto-oncogene bcl-2, protects cells from
active cell death in several in vitro and in vivo models (Allsopp et al.,
1993; Zhong et al., 1993; Dubois–Dauphin et al., 1994; Martinou
et al., 1994; Zanjani et al., 1998). In particular, the overexpression of
the bcl-2 gene promotes RGC survival after optic nerve lesion
(Bonfanti et al., 1996; Cenni et al., 1996).
Recently, it has been suggested that, in addition to protecting
neurons from degeneration, bcl-2 can also influence axonal growth.
Indeed, bcl-2 overexpression can induce axonal elongation in several
cell lines (Oh et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1996). Endogenously
expressed bcl-2 is able to enhance the rate of axonal growth in

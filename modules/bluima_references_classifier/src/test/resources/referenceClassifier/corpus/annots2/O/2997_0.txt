DISCUSSION
Variation of Bcl-2 immunostaining patterns with aging
The expression of Bcl-2 is known to change markedly during late
postnatal maturation and aging of the brain (C astr ÃÅen et al., 1994;
Merry et al., 1994; Kroemer, 1997; Merry and Korsmeyer, 1997;
Reed, 1997). In the squirrel monkey, two types of changes have
been noted: a progressive loss of immunostaining and a switch
from type A to type B immunostaining. Losses of Bcl-2 immunostaining occur in the cerebral cortex, whereas the amygdala and
piriform cortex are two structures in which small intensely stained
Bcl-2+ cells (type A neurons) are progressively replaced by
larger and more weakly stained cells (type B neurons) during the
course of aging. A very intense Bcl-2 immunostaining of small
neurons has been observed during prenatal development of the
rat brain, particularly in the cortical plate in which postmitotic
neurons begin to send out processes and form synaptic connec-

extent by spatial location. The firing rate plots indicate significant local changesin firing rate only when the rat was on cue
4 in the East, South, or West positions, but not on the North
position(Fig.4).Nevertheless,astheupperpanelofFigure4
shows,activity wasapparently elevated to someextent in the
samerelative position of the North arm as that of the other
arms. Given that the ANOVA is the more direct and conservative analysisof the relative effectsof the factors testedhere,
our conclusionis that the activity of this cell and all cellsin this
categorystrongly reflectthe relevant specificcuesand arepoorly,
if at all, influenced by spatial location.

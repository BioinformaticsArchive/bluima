rons in the GPi have consistently been shown to increase
activity during arm and wrist movements (Aldridge et
al., 1980 ; Georgopoulos et al., 1983 ; Anderson and
Horak, 1985 ; Brotchie et al., 1991 ; Mushiake and Strick,
1995 ; Turner and Anderson, 1997). Disparate experimental paradigms also may play a role in the di¡erences
between rat and primate SNr responses. Because animals
are typically restrained in primate studies, only taskrelated movements are free from restriction. Under
these conditions, responsive neurons are limited to
those related to the movement being tested, while other
neurons have nothing to contribute. In the freely moving
condition, which characterizes our study, many more
motor programs are likely to be active, and thus many
more neurons have speci¢c functions to perform. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, we encountered a relatively wide range of neuronal responses.
Although there were a relatively high percentage of
task-related responses in the SNr, we did not ¢nd evidence for changes speci¢c to the on- or o¡set of visual
and auditory stimuli signaling the appropriate location
for a reinforced nosepoke response or the availability of
Fig. 8. Examples of units with responses time-locked to particular
sucrose. This was somewhat unexpected given data from
aspects of the sucrose reinforcement interval. (A) A unit with
changes in ¢ring limited to the period just after sucrose onset but primates and cats in signaled bar-press or go/no-go tasks
before its o¡set (`discrete' response). Units with this pattern of where up to 60% of SNr units are reported to be cueresponse made up V27% of spout-responsive units. (B) In this related (Joseph and Boussaoud, 1985 ; Nishino et al.,
example, which had response characteristics similar to V26% of
1985 ; Hikosaka et al., 1993). Furthermore, a relatively
spout-responsive units, the increase in ¢ring was limited to the
high percentage of globus pallidus and striatal neurons
period (V500 ms) prior to sucrose onset (`pre-onset' response).

to turn their heads either left or right in response to a
tone (Gardiner and Kitai, 1992). The inconsistency with
our data may in part be due to the fact that our rats had

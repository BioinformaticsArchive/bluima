Tissue distribution of BMCP1 expression
To date, BMCP1 protein expression has not been evaluated
due to lack of antibodies to this recently described UCP. To
allow protein expression and distribution to be assessed, rabbit
polyclonal antibodies were raised against two sequences of
mouse BMCP1: (1) a 19 amino acid sequence between TM1
and TM2, and (2) a 14 amino acid sequence between TM2
and TM3, regions that lack homology to other proteins,
including other UCPs, by BLAST search analysis. Specificity of the BMCP1 antisera were assessed by western blot
analysis, and antibodies from rabbits #3647 (TM1-TM2
sequence), and #3644 (TM2-TM3 sequence; affinity-purified) demonstrated high-affinity labeling of a 36-kDa band,
the expected size of BMCP1 (Fig. 1). Staining density of
the BMCP1 band was decreased by co-incubation with the
antigenic BMCP1 peptide (Fig. 1a). Because of the low
aqueous solubility of the peptide, the highest concentration
that could be tested was 100 mg/mL. By 12% SDSâ€“PAGE,
the 32 kDa UCP2 protein band was easily differentiated
from the 36-kDa BMCP1 band (Fig. 1b). To further confirm
the specificity of the antibody, we compared immunostaining of our `standard' BMCP1 antibody (#3647) with a second
antibody raised against an alternative epitope of BMCP1

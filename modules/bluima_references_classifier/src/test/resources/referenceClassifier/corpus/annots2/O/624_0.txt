the degree of sequence homology is much higher within
subgroups (A: 65–86%, B: 75–95%) than between subgroups (% 50%). Although the two subgroups are clearly
individualized, they share structural peculiarities such as the
QPE or KPE/H signature of turn 8–12 and the tentative
nonproline cis peptide bond between P9 and E/K10.
In summary, we have shown that Lqh6 and Lqh7 can be
classified into the a-like group of scorpion a-toxins on the
basis of both pharmacological and structural arguments,
and used a comparative approach to discuss the features
that differentiate this type of toxins from classical- and antiinsect a-toxins. Long ignored as a group, a-like toxins are
abundant in scorpion venoms and the present study
emphasizes the importance of thorough comparative pharmacological characterization of new scorpion toxins.
Recently, the interest in a-like toxins has been boosted by
the discovery of their ability to specifically target a somatic
Na channel subtype in the mammalian brain, thus revealing
subtle variations in the structure of receptor site 3 of
neuronal Na channels. As mutant Nav1.4 channels with
Nav1.6 receptor site 3 motif are highly sensitive to Lqh3, it
has been suggested that Nav1.6 might be the target of a-like
toxins in the brain ([46], but see [7]). The present challenge is
to identify this target unequivocally, with the perspective to
get some information about its physiological roles by using
a-like toxins as molecular tools.

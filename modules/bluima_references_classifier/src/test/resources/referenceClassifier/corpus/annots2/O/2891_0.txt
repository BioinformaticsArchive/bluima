DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study are that (1) functional GABAergic
synaptic contacts are established on dentate granule cells immediately after birth; (2) the frequency of the mIPSCs increases with
age; (3) the mIPSCs from immature granule cells as well as in the
adult can be satisfactorily fitted with the sum of a single exponential rise and single exponential decay; (4) mIPSCs are slower in
developing animals but are similar in amplitude compared with
the adult, resulting in a developmental decrease in the synaptic
charge transfer; (5) the kinetic properties of the mIPSCs depend
on the postnatal age of the animal (i.e., whether the animal is
younger or older than 3 weeks postnatal) and not on the maturational stage of the neuron; and (6) synaptic GABA receptors

in developing neurons are differentially sensitive to zolpidem and
zinc, indicating subunit-dependent alterations in the functional
properties of the GABA channels during development.

Early functional GABAergic synapses on immature
granule cells
The rate of granule cell generation reaches its peak between P5
and P7, at approximately 50,000 neurons per day (Schlessinger et
al., 1975). Previous studies have shown that GABAergic neurons
are born prenatally (Schlessinger et al., 1978; Amaral and Kurz,
1985; Lubbers et al., 1985), and by the end of the first postnatal
week, they make synaptic contacts on granule cell dendrites as
well as somata (Lubbers and Frotscher, 1988; Seress and Ribak,
1988, 1990). Although GABAergic responses have been shown to
occur in developing hippocampal and cortical pyramidal cells
(Mueller et al., 1984; Kriegstein et al., 1987; Janigro and
Schwartzkroin, 1988; Ben-Ari et al., 1989; Gaiarsa et al., 1990;
Blanton and Kriegstein, 1991; Luhmann and Prince, 1991; Zhang
et al., 1991; Hosokawa et al., 1994; Fleidervish and Gutnick,
1995), the functional properties of the early GABA receptor- A

mediated synaptic transmission in the late-developing dentate
granule cells are not well understood. The data presented here
demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of dentate granule
cells of the early postnatal rat possess functionally active
GABAergic synaptic inputs [interestingly, no glutamatergic synaptic events can be observed at this time in granule cells (our
unpublished observations)], similar to CA1 and CA3 pyramidal
cells (Ben-Ari et al., 1989; Hosokawa et al., 1994; Gaiarsa et al.,
1995). Importantly, these first GABAergic synaptic inputs are
likely to play significant roles in neuronal development (see
below).

Properties of the first GABAergic synaptic currents in
dentate granule cells
GABA is known to exert various effects on developing neurons
(Hansen et al., 1984, 1988; LoTurco et al., 1995; Behar et al., 1996;
Marty et al., 1996). Some of these effects can be observed when
GABA is simply included in the incubation medium in cultures
(e.g., Behar et al., 1996), i.e., presumably via the activation of
mostly extrasynaptic receptors. Recent results, however, indicate
that the synaptic release of GABA also plays an important role in
neuronal maturation. Indeed, GABA receptor-mediated synap- A

tic potentials summate and cause enough depolarization to open
voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels and remove the Mg 2+ block of
NMDA channels, leading to increases in [Ca 2+] (Ben-Ari et al.,
i

1989; Cherubini et al., 1991; Yuste and Katz, 1991; Gaiarsa et al.,
1995; Owens et al., 1996); GABA is depolarizing in both the adult

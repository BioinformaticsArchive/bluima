FIG. 10. Normal (A), slow (B), and very slow (C)
saccades generated by changing the “biases” and inputs
of the model of Fig. 3. The associated discharge of the
EBN is also illustrated. The superior colliculus discharge
(not shown) is assumed to be the same in A and B, but is
assumed to have twice the duration and half the peak
firing rate in C. See text for abbreviations.

locus coeruleus to the subthalamic nucleus, the striatum, the
basal forebrain cholinergic column, the pallidal complex,
the thalamus, the cerebellum, the hippocampus and the
frontal, prefrontal, entorhinal and occipital cerebral cortex.
trkB mRNA expression was compared between control
subjects and parkinsonian patients on tissue-sections of the
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) at a level including the exiting fibres
of the third cranial nerve nucleus.20 The limits of the SN and
the VTA were determined as previously described using
adjacent sections stained for acetylcholinesterase histochemistry with the Geneser-Jensen and Blackstad method as
previously described.20

50%. The 2Na +–Ca 2+ exchange blocker CGP37157 also
blocked the increase, and this efect was not additive with the
efects of blocking Na + influx. When added together, CNQX
and lidocaine inhibited the fluorescence increase more than
CGP37157 did. Thus, during ischemia, Ca 2+ entry via NMDA
receptors accounts for the earliest rise in cytosolic Ca 2+. Ap-proximately 50% of the sustained rise is attributable to Na +
entry and subsequent Ca 2+ release from the mitochondria via
the 2Na +–Ca 2+ exchanger. Sodium entry is also hypothesized
to compromise clearance of cytosolic Ca 2+ by routes other
than mitochondrial uptake, probably by enhancing ATP depletion, accounting for the large inhibition of the Ca 2+ increase by
the combination of CNQX and lidocaine.

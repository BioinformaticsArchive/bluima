Figure 2. Biological effects of intrastriatal AdRSV.CNTF injections. A, Cresyl
violet-stained section at 7 d postinjection
showing no major cytopathogenicity in
the vicinity of the injection site (arrow).
B, GFAP immunohistochemistry two
weeks after injection showing an immunostained area (arrowheads) widely ex-tending beyond the injection site in the
striatum (arrow). The boxed area is en-larged in the inset, which shows GFAPimmunoreactive striatal astrocytes characterized by enlarged cell body and
processes. C, GFAP immunohistochemistry 96 hr postinjection showing immunostained astrocytes in the injected striatum ( S) and in the adjacent globus
pallidus (GP). GFAP immunostaining is
much lower on the noninjected side ( D).
E, GFAP immunohistochemistry at 96 hr
postinjection showing immunostained
astrocytes in the substantia nigra, pars
reticulata (SNR), and pars compacta
(SNC) on the side of the injection. GFAP
immunostaining is much lower on the
noninjected side ( F ). Scale bar (at bottom right): 250 μm in A, C–F; 400 μm in
B; 160 μm in the inset.

Figure 3. E xpression of α3 , α6 , α7 , β2 , β3 , and β4 neuronal nAChR
subunits in Wt and Mt mouse brain using in situ hybridization. No difference was apparent between Wt ( A) and Mt ( B) probed with α3-specific
probes with both genotypes showing intense hybridization in the M Hb.
Hybridization is seen in the SN in Wt ( C) and Mt ( D) probed with
α6-specific probes, and no difference was seen between Wt ( E) and Mt ( F)
probed with α7-specific probes with Wt and Mt showing hybridization in the
Hp and DG. Strong hybridization is seen in the M Hb and Th, and
moderate hybridization is seen in the C x, Hp, and DG in Wt ( G) and Mt
( H ) probed with β2-specific probes. Hybridization is seen in the M Hb and
the SN in Wt (I, K ) and Mt (J, L) probed with β3-specific probes. Hybridization is seen in the M Hb in Wt ( M ) and Mt ( N) probed with β4-specific
probes.

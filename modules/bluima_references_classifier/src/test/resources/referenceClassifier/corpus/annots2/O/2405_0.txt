containing 1.0% Sarkosyl (FG R. japonicum strains) or 0.1%
Sarkosyl (all other strains), mixed, and then centrifuged as
before. Cells were washed with 2 ml of TE buffer, mixed,
and centrifuged again. Cells were resuspended in 400 pul of a
lysis mixture containing 26,550 U of lysozyme (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) per ml, 0.3 Kunitz U of RNase I
(Sigma) per ml, and 20% Ficoll 400 (Pharmacia, Uppsala,
Sweden) in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, 8.9 mM
boric acid [pH 8.2]). A portion of the cell lysis mixture
containing either 40 p.l of R. japonicum strains or 20 p.l of all
other strains was immediately transferred to a 9-mm well
formed in a 0.6% vertical agarose gel (DNA grade; 160 by
140 by 3 mm; BioRad, Richmond, Calif.) in TBE buffer.
After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, an equivalent volume of the first overlay solution (1.0% sodium
dodecyl sulfate, 10% Ficoll in TBE buffer) was placed over
the cell lysis mixture, and then 100 p.l of the second overlay
solution (1.0% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2.5% Ficoll in TBE
buffer) was placed over the first. The wells were immediately
sealed with molten 0.6% agarose in TBE buffer. DNA was
separated by electrophoresis in TBE buffer at 10Â°C for 40 to
60 min at a constant current of 6 mA and then for an
additional 6 to 24 h at 8 mA. Plasmid bands were visualized
with transmitted UV light after being stained with aqueous
ethidium bromide (5 p.g/liter).
Plasmids used as molecular weight markers are listed in a
footnote (see Table 4). Estimations of FG R. japonicum
plasmid molecular weights relative to the molecular weight
markers were obtained by linear regression analysis of
migration distance versus the log of the molecular weight of
the plasmid. The plasmid isolation procedure outlined above
worked well with all of the strains except E. stewartii SW2.
The plasmid DNA from this strain was isolated by the
procedure of Kado and Liu (14), dialyzed into TBE buffer,
and separated electrophoretically in the gels described above.

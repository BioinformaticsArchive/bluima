viously reported mouse synaptosomal 144-kDa nNOS (17). The
two variants share a similarly reduced catalytic activity re-spect to the classic 157-kDa nNOS, although specific activity,
Ca2 dependence, and requirements are similar to all other
mitochondrial isoforms.
Taking into consideration the immunological characterization shown in Fig. 2, brain mtNOS appears to be an entity
different from rat or mouse liver mtNOS (1, 5). This discrepancy suggests the occurrence of tissue- and species-specific
different mitochondrial variants. In this regard, mitochondrial
variants of iNOS-like (3) and nNOS-like (7) isoforms in pig and
rat heart organelles were described. Moreover, several years
ago, an eNOS-like mtNOS in the rat brain was reported (27).
Immunological and functional observations are indicative of
a developmental modulation of the brain mtNOS variant. This
notion is supported by data showing that brain mtNOS is
highly expressed and active in the late stages of fetal development and during the first postnatal days followed by a de-creased expression in the adult brain. In agreement with previous reports, cytosolic nNOS was poorly detected in embryos
or immediately after birth, and its expression increased
sharply after postnatal day P6 (17).
The occurrence of mtNOS is consistent with a fine modulation of critical mitochondrial functions by NO. In the brain,
NO inhibits respiration (11), promotes de-energization of synaptic mitochondria (28), and induces Ca2 release from the
mitochondrial matrix (29). Furthermore, NO and reactive ox-ygen species participate in significant neuronal events, such as
dendritic growth and arborization (30) and apoptosis (31).
.
Most of mitochondrial O2 and H2O2 production is a consequence of reactions of NO with components of the respiratory
chain (10, 12). Accordingly, L-arginine is known to stimulate
H2O2 release through the activation of mtNOS (13), an observation extended to brain mitochondria (Fig. 7) and dependent
on the mtNOS expression level. This study established a link
between NO metabolism and the generation of reactive oxygen
species by mitochondria during development: mitochondria
with different mtNOS content, such as those from newborn
P2â€“ 4 and adults, yielded similar H2O2 production rates in the
presence of NO (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, only neonatal organelles
containing significant amounts of mtNOS responded to L-arginine stimulation (Fig. 7), thus leading to a temporal increase in
H2O2 production. Thus, the similar temporal pattern of brain
mtNOS (Fig. 5) and Mn-superoxide dismutase (Fig. 8A) gains
.
further significance: an increased dismutation rate of O2 to
H2O2 by mitochondrial matrix Mn-superoxide dismutase (Re-action 3) is expected to outcompete the formation of ONOO
(Reaction 4), prolong NO half-life, and consequently, increase
cytosolic H2O2 steady-state levels (32, 33). A similar correlation
between Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase and cytosolic nNOS is
consistent with previous reports on protection against NO
toxicity in neurons by superoxide dismutase (34). Considering
that at maximal mtNOS expression, the formation of ONOO
was not detected, this study supports the following notions: (a)
mitochondrial production of NO is an important factor in the
developmental setup of brain H2O2 steady-state concentration
in parallel with Mn-superoxide dismutase activity and (b) as a
corollary, the accurate temporal up-regulation of mtNOS may
represent a redox signaling mechanism rather than a stressful
event. This view is supported by recent observations that propose that NO and H2O2 participate in the development and
maturation of the nervous system, particularly through potentiation of Ca2 signaling by redox changes (31). Moreover, NO
and H2O2 may promote cell cycle arrest and quiescence in
different tissues by mechanisms such as activation of p38
MAPK (35), inhibition of activity or expression of cyclin D1,

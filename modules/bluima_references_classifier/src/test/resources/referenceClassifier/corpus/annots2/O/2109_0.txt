In a separate experiment using two control rats,
one acutely hyperglycemic rat, and one chronically
hyperglycemic rat, we determined if radioiodinated
albumin was restricted to the vascular space or if it
spilled across the blood-brain barrier into the brain.
This was accomplished by injecting radioiodinated
albumin intravenously, and after 30 minutes the rats
were perfused with heparinized saline via the left
ventricle under deep barbiturate anesthesia to flush
the intravascular contents. When the return from
the right atrium was free of blood, perfusion was
stopped, the brains were removed, and weighed
samples from various regions were counted for their
iodine-125 content.
We measured the density of total and perfused
brain capillaries essentially by the methods described
by Buchweitz, Weiss, and their collaborators,13"15
with total capillary density quantified by alkaline
phosphatase, which stains endothelial cells of brain
microvessels, and with the fraction of perfused
microvessels identified by their content of the fluorescent dye, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)dextran. Six control, five acutely hyperglycemic,
and four chronically hyperglycemic rats were anesthetized with 400 mg/kg i.p. chloral hydrate, and
cannulas were inserted into a tail artery and the
right atrium of the heart via the external jugular
vein. The skin was infiltrated with local anesthetic
solution and sutured. The rats were restrained in

hippocampus can be taken as an indication for the
existence of either a set of NCAM-containing complexes
or a variety of smaller complexes derived from one
complex with a molecular weight of at least 600 kDa.
These complexes could consist of self-assembled NCAM
molecules (Hall and Rutishauser, 1987; Becker et al.,
1989) or of a set of different molecules closely associated
with each other. Brain spectrin was not found in such
complexes, most probably because this cytoskeletal element may not have been solubilized in Triton X-100,
remaining instead associated with cytoskeletal elements
in the membrane fraction. The neural cell adhesion
molecule L1 was also not found in the complexes
isolated, although a close association of L1 with NCAM
via extracellular carbohydrate residues has been proposed. Most probably, these interactions are labile toward
Triton X-100.
The data presented here confirm the existence of
NCAM complexes in the membrane and imply that
complex formation is developmentally regulated and
brain region-specific. Complex formation of NCAM 180,
as indicated by the masking of the D3-specific epitope,
occurs in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and
hippocampus during development, whereas the olfactory
bulb shows no epitope masking. In the cerebral cortex,
cerebellum, and hippocampus, the time course of epitope
masking correlates with neural differentiation. The epitope becomes masked at a time when synaptic connections are formed. In the hippocampal formation, the
maturation of the CA regions precede the development of
the dentate gyrus (Angevine, 1975). This developmental
pattern is reflected by the earlier and more complete
masking of the D3 epitope in the pyramidal cell layer as
well as the stratum oriens and radiatum, compared with
the granular cell layer, the stratum moleculare, and the
hilus of the dentate gyrus. In the continuously regenerating olfactory nerve, the D3-specific epitope does not
appear to engage in complex formation. This is also
confirmed by a description of NCAM 180 expression in
the developing and regenerating axons of fish optic nerve
(Bastmeyer et al., 1990), where the D3 antibody was used
to detect the molecule. In a study examining the expression of NCAM 180 in the cat visual cortex, the D3-specific epitope of NCAM 180 also became masked
during development, correlating with the maturation of
synaptic connections during the critical period (Delius et
al., 1993).
At present, there is some evidence from previous
studies that the association of several membrane proteins,
via weak molecular interactions, may play an important
role in triggering certain cell functions (Bourguignon et
al., 1990; Volarevic et al., 1990; Stefanova and Horejsi,
1991; Jacobson et al., 1995; for reviews, see Parton and
Simons, 1995). The complexes observed appeared to

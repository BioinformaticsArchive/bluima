SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, and synaptophysin were observed in
the GT1-1 cells by Western blotting (Fig. 2, C–H). The Sc batch
A of ScGT1-1 cells showed an increase in the monomeric forms
of SNAP-25 (27%), synaptophysin (16%), and syntaxin 1A
(18%), 60 – 85 days p.i., compared with control cells (Fig. 2,
C–H), while the increase in monomeric SNAP-25 in Sc batch B,
which contained lower levels of PrPSc, was more modest, 60 –70
days p.i. (Fig. 2, C and D). There was no difference in the
expression of GAPDH that was used as a loading control. When
the presence of PrPSc in Sc batch A and Sc batch B cultures
were determined by immunohistochemistry using the antibody
D13 in combination with guanidinium thiocyanate treatment,
85% of the Sc batch A cells showed a visible staining for PrPSc
in comparison to 35% of the Sc batch B cells (Fig. 3).
ScGT1-1 Cells Showed a Decreased Expression of SNAP-25,
Syntaxin 1A, and Synaptophysin Compared with Uninfected
GT1-1 Cells, When Complex Formation Was Eliminated—
When ScGT1-1 cell lysates, incubated at 100 °C for 20 min to
avoid complex formation, were compared with uninfected
GT1-1 cell lysates incubated at 100 °C, a reduced level of
SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A and synaptophysin could be observed
(Fig. 1). When a new batch of GT1-1 cells was infected, the
levels of monomeric SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, and synaptophysin
were determined in ScGT1-1 and GT1-1 cell lysates incubated
at 100 °C for 20 min, at different time points after infection
(Fig. 4). A reduced expression of SNAP-25 could be observed 32
days p.i., and the difference became more pronounced 45 days
p.i. A similar trend could be demonstrated when the expression
of synaptophysin was investigated. However, no marked difference in the expression of syntaxin 1A could be seen after 45
days p.i., and there was no difference in the GAPDH loading
controls (Fig. 4).
ScGT1-1 Cells Exhibited an Increased Level of Both the
SNAP-25a and -b Isoform mRNA Compared with Uninfected
GT1-1 Cells—To investigate whether the decreased SNAP-25
expression detected in ScGT1-1 cells was reflected at the
mRNA level, real time PCR was used. This method also made
it possible to distinguish between the two different SNAP-25
isoforms (SNAP-25a and -b). mRNA corresponding to SNAP-25a and -b confirmed previous results where GT1-1 cells have
been found to express mRNA for SNAP-25 (9). The expression
of the genes encoding SNAP-25a and -b in ScGT1-1 cells, 100
days p.i., were elevated by 77 and 78% respectively, compared
with uninfected GT1-1 cells (Fig. 5).
db-cAMP/IBMX-treated ScGT1-1 and GT1-1 Cells Showed a
Comparable Increase in SNAP-25 and Synaptophysin Expression and Were Morphologically Similar—Using immunohistochemistry, the SNAP-25 labeling was mainly localized to the
plasma membrane of the soma in a diffuse and non-clustered
way, both in ScGT1-1 cells and GT1-1 cells (Fig. 6, A and B).
Also, a few neurites could be seen diffusely immunolabeled for
SNAP-25 in both GT1-1 and ScGT1-1 cells. Synaptophysin
labeling occurred as small puncta localized throughout the
soma of the ScGT1-1 and GT1-1 cells. The neurites observed
were also immunolabeled (Fig. 6, C and D).
An increased expression of SNAP-25 and neuritic outgrowth
have been observed upon exposure of PC-12 cells to db-cAMP
(23). To investigate whether ScGT1-1 cells were different from
GT1-1 cells in this respect, we compared the effects of combined
treatment with db-cAMP and IBMX in these cell populations.
When ScGT1-1 cells and GT1-1 cells were treated with db-cAMP/IBMX for 3 days, outgrowth of neurites (Fig. 6, E and F)
as well as an increased expression of SNAP-25 and synaptophysin (Fig. 6G), were seen to a similar extent in both cell
populations. The cellular localization of SNAP-25 and synaptophysin in the treated ScGT1-1 or GT1-1 cells showed no

Figure 2. Stimuli and experimental design. Top row, Part of the movie sequence viewed by participants. Every sequence began with a new movie, which was followed by eight stimulus movies,
each defined in relation to the previous movie. Condition names are given above each movie. At the end of a sequence, participants answered a yes–no question about the movie they just saw (on
50% of sequences) or rested for 6 s. Bottom row, Eight frames taken from one movie. All movies began with two objects at the top of the screen, here a cookie and a disk, and an actress's hand at
the bottom. The actress reached for one of the objects and moved it to the bottom of the screen. Different tool–food pairs of objects were used in each of six functional runs.

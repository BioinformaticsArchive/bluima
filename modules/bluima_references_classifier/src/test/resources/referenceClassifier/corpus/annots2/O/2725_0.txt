of the OCB. Figure L4 shows the effect of stimulating the OCB on the
CAP audiogram in a single preparation. It can be seen that the effect of
OCB stimulation is not uniform across frequencies and is greatest in this
preparation for frequencies between 13 and 20 kHz. The frequency of
maximum suppression of the CAP varied between preparations from -9
to 13 kHz. Figure 1B shows an example of the augmentation of the CM
recorded at the round window in response to 1 kHz tones after OCB
stimulation, which was recorded at the beginning of each experiment. The
augmentation of the CM is an indication that the CAP suppression is
attributable to the postsynaptic action of the OCB on the OHC rather
than to attenuation of the acoustic signal reaching the cochlea through
contraction of the middle ear muscles (Desmedt et al., 1971).

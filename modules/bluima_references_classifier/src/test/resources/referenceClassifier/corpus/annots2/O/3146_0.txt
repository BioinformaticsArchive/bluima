RESULTS
The RMS persists after OB removal
The OB of adult mice was removed unilaterally, and animals were
allowed to survive for 3 d, 3 weeks, or 3 months. Sagittal sections
of the brain revealed that in the operated hemispheres (3 d, n =
3; 3 weeks, n = 6; 3 month, n = 4) a prominent RMS was present
(Fig. 1). As in animals with an intact bulb, the RMS was composed of highly packed small cells that were clearly distinguishable from the surrounding brain parenchyma. The RMS has an S
shape that begins at the dorsal and lateral wall of the anterior
horn of the lateral ventricle, curves ventrally between the corpus
callosum and striatum, and then turns rostrally to reach the OB.
On the bulbectomized side, the path followed by the RMS was
identical to controls, but the RMS was enlarged.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Cell Culture and Reagents—The U251-MG (U251) human glioma cell
line was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Y. Gillespie (University of
Alabama at Birmingham). U87-MG and U118-MG human glioma cells
were purchased from ATTC. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium F-12 (50/50), supplemented with 2 mM
glutamine (MediaTech, University of Alabama at Birmingham Media
Preparation Facility) and 7% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT).
Recombinant NRG-1 was produced by the laboratory of Dr. S. Carroll
(University of Alabama at Birmingham). Inhibitors Tyrphostin AG 825
(AG 825), PP2, and PP3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at 20 °C. All chemicals and other re-agents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. In all
experiments, control samples received the same concentration of di-methyl sulfoxide or other vehicle as experimental samples.
Immunocytochemistry—For our initial erbB receptor immunostaining, U251 cells on uncoated glass coverslips were rinsed with
sterile PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Fixed cells were rinsed three times with PBS, then placed in a blocking
buffer, which consisted of PBS, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.1% Triton
X-100. After 30 min, cells were incubated with the appropriate primary
antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Polyclonal antibodies for the erbB receptors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) were used at 1 g/ml (1:200). The following day, the cells were
rinsed three times for 10 min with blocking buffer and then incubated
with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were
washed three times for 10 min with PBS, mounted using mounting
medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA), visualized (Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope,
Heerbrugg, Switzerland), and digitally imaged (Spot RT, Diagnostic
Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).
To study erbB2 localization in actively migrating glioma cells, U251
cells were fixed after a migration assay (see below). The cells and
cellular processes on the undersurface of the Transwell filter were
immunostained for erbB2 as above. The filter was then removed from
the insert using a scalpel blade, mounted on a glass microscope slide,
visualized, and imaged as above.
For colocalization of erbB receptors with focal complex components,
cells were processed as for a migration assay (see below). After 4 h, cells
were fixed as above and double labeled with antibodies for erbB2 and
one of the following mouse monoclonal antibodies: erbB3 (Santa Cruz),
-integrin (Santa Cruz), FAK (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid,
1

NY), or phalloidin-586 (Molecular Probes). Antibodies and phalloidin
were used at the manufacturer's recommended dilution. Cells were
visualized and imaged as above.
Motility and Migration Assays—The scratch motility assay was used
to measure two-dimensional movement. U251 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. A scratch was then made on the monolayer
using a sterile 200- l pipette tip. The monolayer was rinsed three times
with migration assay buffer (MAB) consisting of serum-free medium
plus 0.1% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin and placed in MAB
without or with 1 ng/ml NRG-1 . At the initiation of the experiment (t
0) a digital image of the scar was taken at a magnification of 10 (Axon
Imaging, Foster City, CA). 24 h later (t 24) the same region of the scar
was imaged again. The images were imported into the Scion imaging
program (available online at scioncorp.com). This software allowed us to
quantify the two-dimensional movement of the cells by measuring the
surface area of the scar at t 0 and comparing it with the surface area
at t 24. Experiments were done at least three times. Measurements
were made in triplicate.
To measure three-dimensional movement, the Transwell migration
assay was used as described previously (27). Transwell filters (B-D
Falcon, Bedford, MA) with 8- m pores were coated on the undersurface
with 10 g/ml laminin. The following day, they were washed three
times with PBS and blocked for 1 h with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum
albumin. In addition to providing a necessary substrate for migration,
the laminin undercoating filled the 8- m pores of the Transwell, creating a liquid diffusion barrier effectively dividing the well into two

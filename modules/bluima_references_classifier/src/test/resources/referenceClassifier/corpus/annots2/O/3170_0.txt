observed in five seronegative controls and marked
changes in one. We did not find any correlation between
the presence and severity of axonal damage and a history
of cognitive disorder. There was no quantitative correlation between the severity of axonal damage and the
presence or absence of HIVE. However, there was an
obvious topographical correlation with macrophages,
microglial activation and giant cells. Indeed axonal
damage was present in five of six cases with HIVE and
bAPP positive spheroids were usually present within foci
of microglia/macrophages and multinucleated giant cells
expressing HIV proteins and HLA-DR (Figure 1g,h).

In a previous immunohistochemical analysis done by our
group on four brain specimens of patients with NCC, there was
a predominant Th1-like response with NK cells, macrophages,
variable numbers of T cells, and abundant IL-12 (29). In those
cases there was no evidence of granuloma or fibrosis and very
few or undetectable B cells, plasma cells, mast cells, eosinophils, or IL-4-producing cells. In the present study these findings were extended by analyzing specimens that contained
granulomas around the cysts. Altogether, the combined results
from both analyses suggest that in NCC there is initially a
predominant Th1 response that eventually evolves into a
chronic Th1 and Th2 phenotype associated with a mature
granuloma formation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. The data
from the 12 patients suggest that the evolving immune re-sponse could be influenced by the parasite's involutionary process from viable to a final calcified stage. Most of the specimens we have analyzed by immunohistochemistry are in the
colloidal or granular-nodular stage. The immune response elicited by the release of dying parasite antigens appears to be the
most frequent cause of severe clinical symptoms. In contrast,
determining the immune events that precede parasite death
will be possible mainly from extrapolations with animal studies.
In a mouse model for NCC, the initial stages of the infection
are also predominated by a Th1 response that appears to be
orchestrated by the CNS influx of gd T cells (5). The influence
of this cell type in the initial stages of human NCC is yet to be
determined.
In the present study both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were
present, including IFN-g, IL-18, and IL-4. IL-13 and IL-10
were found to a lesser extent (data not shown). The probable
influence of these cytokines on the formation of immune granulomas may be inferred from other infection models of animals. An initial Th1 response that evolves into a mixed Th1Th2 phenotype associated with mature granuloma formation
has been observed in other helminthic infections. An example
includes the peritoneal infection of mice with Taenia crassiceps
(30). It should be noted, however, that when spleen cells,
ascites, and regional lymph nodes were studied after infection
with T. crassiceps, an interesting result was found in terms of
parasite burden (33, 35, 40). Thus an initial, transient Th1
response limited parasite replication, and the subsequent Th2
response was associated with increased parasite burden. However, it is not surprising that the immunological response in-volved in controlling parasite burden differs from that of granuloma formation. Consistent with this, another helminth,
Schistosoma mansoni, also induces an initial Th1 phenotype
followed by a mixed Th1-Th2 response with accompanying
granuloma formation (45). In this model, the combined role of
IL-4 and IL-13 was shown to be essential for the induction of
mature granulomas (6). Another regulatory cytokine in terms
of granuloma formation is IL-10 as it appears to diminish the
size of granulomas in schistosomiasis in both humans and mice
(12, 44). Finally, in other nonhelminthic infections like tuberculosis, TNF-α seems to be essential for granuloma formation
(8, 13, 24). In the present study the epitopes for TNF-α could
not be unmasked following formalin fixation and paraffin em-bedding.
Cytokines are also known for their influence on the irreversible replacement of functional tissue with collagen. In the
present study the upregulation of the fibrinogenic cytokine

Intracellular recordings and electrical stimulation
Intracellular recordings were obtained with micropipettes filled with 2-4 M potassium acetate
(90-360 MQ). Voltage recordings in current-clamp mode were performed with a high-impedance
amplifier having a 'bridge' circuit (Axoclamp-2A, Axon Instruments, USA). A bipolar metal
electrode (90 % platinum-10 % iridium) was placed in the cut end of the optic nerve for stimulation
( 0-8 mA, 0 5 ms monophasic pulse).

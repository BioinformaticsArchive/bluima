Nervous system development requires that extending axons precisely navigate their particular, predetermined paths from cell
soma through changing environments to their synaptic targets. A
rapidly growing literature indicates that the axons are guided
through this journey by responding to a variety of substances
produced by intermediate and synaptic target tissues (Letourneau
et al., 1994; Tessier-Lavigne, 1994; Garrity and Zipursky, 1995;
Keynes and Cook, 1995; Goodman, 1996).
Many of the neurons in the dorsolateral embryonic spinal cord
extend pioneering axons that can be tracked during their intrasegmental, circumferential growth to the floor plate at the ventral
midline, where they decussate and turn to run intersegmentally
alongside the floor plate (Holley, 1982; Holley and Silver, 1987;
Bovolenta and Dodd, 1990; Yaginuma et al., 1991). This system
has served as a fruitf ul model of vertebrate axon guidance mechanisms primarily because of the relative ease with which these
extending axons can be studied in vitro and in vivo (TessierLavigne et al., 1988; Colamarino and Tessier-Lavigne, 1995a).
Several lines of evidence suggest that a recently cloned protein,
netrin-1 (Serafini et al., 1994), helps guide these commissural
axons in vivo. First, netrin-1 is homologous to the Caenorhabditis
elegans unc-6 gene product (Ishii et al., 1992) and the Drosophila
Netrin-A and Netrin-B gene products (Harris et al., 1996; Mitchell
et al., 1996) that have been genetically implicated in the guidance
of circumferential and commissural axon growth (Hedgecock et

S18327 at hα2-ARs. Alone, S18327 (10 μM) did not affect
[35S]GTPgS binding.
Antagonist Actions of S18327 at ha2A-ARs: Inhibition
of Activation of [35S]GTPgS Binding by NE at a2-ARs in
Rat Amygdala In Situ. In analogy to these studies of cloned
hα2A-ARs, NE was shown to markedly activate [35S]GTPgS
binding in rat amygdala (Fig. 5B). S18327 (10 μM), which did
not itself modify [35S]GTPgS binding (Fig. 5C), abolished the
action of NE (Fig. 5D).
Antagonist and “Inverse Agonist” Actions of S18327
at h5-HT1A, h5-HT1B, and h5-HT1D Receptors: Blockade
of 5-HT-Stimulated [35S]GTPgS Binding. 5-HT markedly
stimulated [35S]GTPgS binding at h5-HT1A, h5-HT1B, and
h5-HT1D receptors with EC50 values of 17.5 6 2.0, 8.9 6 1.4,
and 1.3 6 0.2 nM, respectively. At h5-HT1A sites, S18327
elicited a very mild stimulation, attaining 14.2 6 0.8% of the
maximal influence of 5-HT (100%) and with an EC50 value of
97.1 6 30.1 nM. Furthermore, it exerted antagonist properties at these sites in concentration-dependently inhibiting
the stimulation elicited by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (6)-8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (100 nM), with a Kb value
of 129.0 6 13.0 nM. At 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors,
S18327, applied alone, inhibited basal binding by 27.0 6
6.1% and 51.2 6 4.5%, respectively, suggesting “inverse ag-onist” properties. The inhibition was concentration dependent at both h5-HT1B and h5-HT1D receptors with IC50 values of 4074 6 566 and 70 6 18 nM, respectively. In view of
the low affinity of S18327 at h5-HT1B and h5-HT1D sites and

[F(1,35) = 1.35 for H3K9/14Ac and F(1,34) = 2.26 for H3k9Me3],
nor was an interaction detected for the H3K9Me3 data [F(1,34)
= 0.56]. However, an interaction between sex of the neonate and
hormone treatment was found for the H3K9/14Ac modification
[F(1,35) = 4.02; p < 0.05]. The interaction was caused by the control
female group which had significantly lower levels of H3K9/14Ac as
compared to any of the other groups (p < 0.05).

Discussion
We report, for the first time, that H3K9/14Ac and H3K9Me3;
two epigenetic marks that are nearly mutually exclusive and respectively are typically associated with increased and decreased gene
transcription, are sexually dimorphic in the developing CTX/HIP.
It is worth noting that the sex differences we found are on the order
of 30% which, given the heterogeneity of brain tissue, is remarkable and could represent up to 30% of the epigenome. Our CTX/
HIP dissections included many subregions, but the major areas, the
hippocampus, cortex and the dentate gyrus, have well documented
functions in cognition, many of which are sexually dimorphic and
modified by steroid hormones.20,28,29 Moreover, sex differences
documented in CTX/HIP include differences in cell numbers,
thickness of cortical layers, numbers of spines and electrophysiological properties.24,30 Interestingly, the neonatal CTX/HIP contains
steroid receptors and steroid synthesizing enzymes,13,23,31,32 and
neural structures in CTX/HIP can be modified by not only steroid
hormones,20,28,29 but also the environment.9,33,34
Our studies also revealed a developmental timeline in the CTX/
HIP such that the sex difference in H3K9/14Ac was detected on
embryonic day 18 and again on the day of birth; however six days
later, the same trend was present but failed to reach significance. On
the other hand, H3K9Me3 was only sexually dimorphic after birth.
If we take the most parsimonious view of the functions of histone
acetylation and methylation perhaps transcription in the male CXT/
HIP is elevated due to increase acetylation (relative to the female
brain) prior to birth, followed by a period of decreased transcription,
caused by enhanced methylation, again relative to females. In the
male mouse neonatal T exhibits two peaks in plasma, one during the
final three days of gestation (E17-19) and the second surge is directly
after birth.35-37 Interestingly, our T treatment (on gestational days
16â€“19) only masculinized H3K9/14Ac levels in neonatal females,
suggesting that H3 acetylation might be primarily mediated by the
prenatal rise in T. In contrast, H3K9Me3 is dimorphic after birth
but male-like levels of H3K9Me3 cannot be mimicked in females

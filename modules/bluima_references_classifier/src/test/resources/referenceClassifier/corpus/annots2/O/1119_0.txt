mechanisms, and oxidative nucleotide damage has been
investigated mainly in isolated skin and blood cells or their
cell lines [17 â€“ 20]. Fibroblasts from CS patients but not
XPA cell lines are sensitive to oxidative DNA damage
caused by ionizing radiation [17], and the defects of
transcription-coupled repair can lead to the failure of
removal of oxidized nucleotides in the CS fibroblast lines
[18]. In animals, embryonic fibroblasts from CS genedeficient mice (CSB2/2 mice) are hypersensitive to
oxidative lesions by gamma-ray-irradiation, while embryonic stem cells from XPA gene-deficient mice (XPA2/2
mice) had a subtle gamma-ray-sensitivity [19]. It is
intriguing that XP cell lines are not hypersensitive to
X-ray killing, although the nucleotide excision repair in the
oxidative DNA lesions is XP protein-dependent [20]. In this
study, the cases of XPA but not CS demonstrated
depositions of 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine and 8-hydroxyguanosine in the pallidal neurons, and this seemed to be
contradictory to the aforementioned CS predominance in
the oxidative DNA damage of skin cells caused by radiation.
On the other hand, the CS cases demonstrated the pallidal

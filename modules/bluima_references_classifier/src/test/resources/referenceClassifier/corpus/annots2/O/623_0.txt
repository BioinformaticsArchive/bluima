Figure 5 Pretraining prevents the memory deficit induced by PD098059 infusion into the EC. Arrow indicates time of infusion (0.2 μg/side
of PD098059 [n = 10] or vehicle [n = 13]). (A) Latency to platform location during pretraining, the first probe trial, training, and the second
probe trial. (B) Representative traces of the probe trials for animals from the vehicle (n = 13) and drug (n = 10) groups. (C) Dwell time in the
outer 50% of the tank before the first successful attempt during the probe trial. (D) Heading error as the angle away from the target (deg)
leaving the entry quadrant during the probe trial. (E) Latency to the platform location during retraining. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.

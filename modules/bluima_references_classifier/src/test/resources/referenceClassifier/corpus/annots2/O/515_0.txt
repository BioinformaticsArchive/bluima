One hallmark of AD is the accumulation of A , although the
cause of AD may be multifactorial. Here, we showed that ER
stress-inducible Herp enhances A 40 generation. Since a significant increase in the level of A 42 was not observed, the high
expression level of Herp appears to mainly enhance 40- -secretase cleavage. A recent report showed that some nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs preferentially decreased the generation of A 42 (32). Taken together with our result, it appears
that the regulation of the generation of A 42 is distinct from

to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, and blotted with biotinylated MA lectin as described above. A
duplicate gel was also transblotted and stained with India ink to assess the purity
of the proteins. The proteins were then subjected to an Applied Biosystems
solid-phase protein sequencer.

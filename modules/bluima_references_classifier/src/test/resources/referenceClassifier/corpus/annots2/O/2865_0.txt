Fig 7. Illustration of activation
distribution within the TTG in re-sponse to 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz
pure tones. Note that a 1000-Hz
tone activates a larger area of cortex with lateral TTG predominance, whereas activation in re-sponse to a 4000-Hz tone is
relatively confined to the medial
aspect of the gyrus.

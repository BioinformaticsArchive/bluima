The decay phase of the evoked EPSCs at baseline
could be fitted with two exponentials, t1 and t2, which
represent the time constants of the fast and slow components, respectively. Addition of DHK to the bath significantly slowed the EPSC decay phase, as indicated by
increasing t1 from 6.88 1.07 ms to 8.53 1.57 ms
(P 0.05) and t2 from 15.18 4.26 ms to 28.10 6.77 ms
(P 0.01). The ratio of t2 to t1 (t2:t1) increased significantly
from 2.25 0.41 to 3.62 0.69 (P 0.05) (Fig. 5D) after the
addition of DHK, indicating that blockade of GLT-1 has a
dominant effect on the EPSC slow component. In the
presence of DHK, the addition of DGG to the bath caused
stronger inhibition on the slow component than the fast

Fig. 5. Effect of 1.5 g/kg ethanol and saline infusion (i.v.) on dopamine concentrations in the core (left) and shell (right). * P 0.05 for ethanol when
compared with basal. The average basal levels were 1.4 0.2 nM for the core ethanol group, 1.1 0.3 nM for the core saline group, 2.2 0.4 nM for
the shell ethanol group, and 1.5 0.3 nM for the shell saline group. Arrow indicates bolus injection (n 4 â€“ 6).

FIGURE 4
SPECT study obtained in a 20-yr-old male patient (cranial = left; caudal = right) in the postictal phase after a tonicclonic seizure. Asymmetric rCBF is seen in the frontal (arrows in the top row) and temporal lobes (arrows in the bottom
row), with the highest rCBF in the right medial and inferior frontal gyrus (arrows). At this time EEC revealed general
paroxysmal discharges without focal signs. Three days later an EEG control showed a focus in the right temporoposterior
region without paroxysms. The CAT scan was normal. (LEAP collimators).

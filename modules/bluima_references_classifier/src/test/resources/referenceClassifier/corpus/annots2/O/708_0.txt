Image analysis
Images of the histological sections were acquired with a bright-field
Nikon Optiphot 2 microscope via a Sony DXC-950P 3CCD
colour video camera and analysed using Biocom (Les Ulis,
France) VisioScan version T4.18 image analysis software.
For semiquantitative evaluation of the distribution and quality of
lesions on Bodian silver-impregnated slides, one investigator (GH)
acquired images (objective Ã— 50) from a pre-defined location in the
following regions in all animals: frontal cortex (fCx), hippocampal
pyramidal layer (Py) and the granule layer of the dentate gyrus
(GrDG), caudate-putamen (striatum), external segment of the globus
pallidus (GPe), entopeduncular nucleus (EP), subthalamic nucleus
(STN), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), cerebellar (Cb)
granule layer and Purkinje cells. Two other investigators (AP, KP)
studied open-label Bodian silver-stained sections from the rotenone
and vehicle groups in all of the brain regions and agreed on criteria
for differentiating lesioned animals from controls. The images were
then shown twice in random order to both investigators blind to the
treatment of the rats, resulting in four analyses of each image. The
investigators noted the presence or absence of the lesion criteria,
scored from 0 (not lesioned) to +++ (severely lesioned), then
classified the animal as lesioned or not. For statistical analysis, an
image was classified as lesioned if the presence of a lesion was
detected in at least two of the four analyses. All images were shown
again in an open-label manner and the severity of the lesion in each

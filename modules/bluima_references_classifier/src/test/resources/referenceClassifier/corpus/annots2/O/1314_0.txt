the hippocampal granular and pyramidal neurons and was
strongest in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 subfields
(Figs 4 and 5). Furthermore, filipin staining in the perikarya
was associated with perinuclear cholesterol `hot spots', whose
levels in the apoE-deficient mice increased dramatically
following environmental stimulation. The levels of the perinuclear cholesterol `hot spots' of control mice were not
affected by environmental stimulation and were slightly higher
than those of apoE-deficient mice which were kept in the
regular environment.
The extent to which elevation of the hippocampal
cholesterol content of environmentally stimulated apoEdeficient mice was also associated with the accumulation of
cholesterol in astrocytes was examined by double labelling
the sections with filipin and the astrocytic marker GFAP. As
can be seen in Fig. 6, the hippocampus of the environmentally stimulated apoE-deficient mice contained a large
number of GFAP-positive cells, a fraction of which
($15%) also contained filipin-positive cholesterol `hot
spots'. The levels of GFAP-positive astrocytes was markedly
lower in apoE-deficient and control mice, which were kept in
a regular environmental, and in environmentally stimulated
control mice, and the few GFAP-positive cells which were
seen in these mice did not contain the filipin-positive `hot
spots'. Additional immunohistochemical experiments
revealed that environmental stimulation was associated with
a marked increase in the number of GFAP-positive hippocampal astrocytes of apoE-deficient mice, whereas the
corresponding control astrocytes were not so affected
(Fig. 7). Furthermore, immunoblot assays revealed that

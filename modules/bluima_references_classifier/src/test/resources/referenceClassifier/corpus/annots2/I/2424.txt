based on the observation that, during reversible blockades of gasping activities, phrenic discharge was the last
eliminated and the first to reappear. Also, the onset of
discharge of the phrenic nerve precedes that of the re-current laryngeal nerve in gasping (22).
An organization that might explain many of the above
characteristics of the critical medullary area for gasping
is that of the pattern generator for respiratory pumping
in Aplysia caEiforrzica that Byrne (7) has recently de-scribed. This pattern generator is comprised of an aggregation of spontaneously active neurons that mutually
excite each other and also drive interneurons and motoneurons. We submit that our results are consistent with
similar endogenously oscillating cells underlying the neurogenesis of gasping.
In summary, as demonstrated in the present and a
number of previous studies (20-23), there are many
fundamental differences between eupnea and gasping.
Indeed, it is our hypothesis that there are different
central pattern generators for these two respiratory patterns. Thus we cannot be certain of the relationship, if
any, of recent models for the neurogenesis of eupnea
(e.g., Refs. 16 and 17) with the neurogenesis of the gasp.

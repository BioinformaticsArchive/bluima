On the other hand, although SVN infection caused a short-lived high viremia
in the SCID mice (in contrast to the persistent high viremia caused by SVA), it
could not penetrate efficiently into the CNS. We hypothesized that the persistent
low viremia shown by SVN in SCID mice did not produce a sufficient viral load
to allow neuroinvasion.

Identification of genes expressed differently in salamander tail
regeneration and rat spinal cord injury
A bioinformatics approach was used to identify gene orthologs that
are expressed similarly or differently after salamander tail amputation versus rat spinal cord injury. We used current (as of May 2006)
human Entrez Gene IDs that were assigned to each annotated probe
set on the Ambystoma GeneChip to identify all presumptive
salamander orthologs on RatU34A, B, and C GeneChips. To
accomplish this cross-referencing task, we used Resourcerer (Tsai
et al. 2001), a database that allows orthologous genes to be
identified among species-specific microarray resources. This yielded
a list of 1036 probe sets between the Ambystoma and RatU34
GeneChips that presumably correspond to 662 unique, orthologous
genes. We compared the expression pattern of each of these genes
using results from this study and published studies that profiled gene
expression after SCI in rat, using RatU34 GeneChips (Carmel et al.
2001; Song et al. 2001; Aimone et al. 2004; De Biase et al. 2005).
De Biase et al. (2005) provide a table that compares specific details
of these rat SCI microarray studies. The rat studies used thoracic T8-10 contusion models (MASCIS, OSU, and weight drop methods)
and tissues were sampled at and flanking the impact site during the
first 48 h post-injury; Aimone et al. (2004) also sampled 7 and
35 days after injury. For each gene, we qualified gene expression as
either significantly up, significantly down, or non-significant. We
used statistical and fold-level criteria (FWER <0.01; >2-fold
change) to score salamander genes for these criteria. If a gene was
reported as significantly regulated in the rat studies, we recorded it
as such; otherwise, we recorded it as non-significant.

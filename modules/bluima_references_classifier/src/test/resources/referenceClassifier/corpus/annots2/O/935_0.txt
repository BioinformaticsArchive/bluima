The golli products of the MBP gene are not structural proteins of the myelin sheath, and studies on their
intracellular localization suggest a possible role in the nu-cleus as well as in the cytoplasm of the cell. The golli
proteins consist of two domains. The first 133 amino acids
constitute the unique golli domain, followed by an MBP
domain of variable size in the two major isoforms of the
protein family. To begin to understand these roles, we
conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential
molecular partners of golli proteins. For this study, we
used the 133-amino acid golli domain as a bait to isolate
GIP cDNA from rat PC12 cells. This cDNA was used to
isolate the homologous mouse GIP cDNA from an oligodendrocyte library by conventional screening procedures.

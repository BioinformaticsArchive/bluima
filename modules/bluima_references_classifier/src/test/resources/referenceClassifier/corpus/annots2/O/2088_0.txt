estimated the rate of biosynthesis of NA and
DA from the content and the turnover rate of
NA and DA. Under hypoxic conditions, the
content of NA was decreased, whereas the
turnover rate of NA was unchanged. On the
other hand, the content of DA was unchanged
under hypoxia, whereas the turnover rate of
DA was markedly decreased. These results
taken together suggest that DOPA accumu
lation was decreased under hypoxia both
in NA neurons and in DA neurons. However,
considering that the conversion of exoge
nously administered DOPA to NA was
decreased under hypoxia (9), the decrease in
NA biosynthesis may be partly due to the
inhibition of dopamine Q-hydroxylase by
hypoxia.
After exposure to hypoxia, the depletion of
DA after treatment with a-MT was markedly
retarded, whereas the depletion of NA was
almost unchanged. These results are in good
agreement with the previous results (8, 9).
Furthermore, as previously reported by us (8),
the present results showed that the depletion
of 5-HT after synthesis inhibition was
retarded by hypoxia. Since the turnover rate
of a neurotransmitter is considered to be a
good biochemical index of the functional
activities of the neurons containing the
neurotransmitter (20, 21), these data indicate
that the functional activities of NA neurons
are relatively resistant to hypoxia, whereas
the activities of DA and 5-HT neurons are
sensitive to hypoxia. The decrease in 5-HIAA
content, which is also regarded as a good
biochemical index of the turnover rate of

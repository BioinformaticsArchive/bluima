Properties of postsynaptic responses

Hippocampal interneurons are known to express a
range of GABA receptor subunits26,73,93 and exhibit

both fast (putative GABA ) and slow (putative

GABA ) IPSPs,13,15,48,49,68,78,80 indicating that

GABAergic neurons are themselves under GABAergic control. This study indicates that synaptic re-sponses mediated by basket cells are similar in
both pyramidal cells and other interneurons and
their properties are consistent with unitary IPSPs
described previously.12,13,17,44,49,51,63,65,66,78
In the absence of pharmacological verification, the
finding that all unitary synaptic responses were
hyperpolarizing in the range of membrane potentials
tested ("55 to "65 mV) and had fast kinetics (rise
times 1â€“15.2 ms) is highly suggestive of a GABA

receptor-mediated eVect,12,13,63 as compared to a
GABA receptor-mediated response which has a

slow onset and a time to peak of 2200 ms.67,70 It
therefore seems likely that responses elicited by individual interneurons in both pyramidal cells and other
interneurons are mediated by similar receptor mechanisms. However, GABA receptor subunits may not

be uniformly expressed across diVerent subtypes of
interneuron.22,26,73 In the future, detailed pharmacology of interneuron-to-interneuron connections
may therefore reveal functional diVerences corresponding to diVerent GABA receptors with varying

subunit composition.
The hyperpolarizing nature of the unitary synaptic
responses seen in this study is at variance with earlier
studies addressing interneuron-to-interneuron network interactions in which the authors described a
GABA receptor-mediated excitatory eVect over
A

other interneurons.59,60 However, the hyperpolarizing nature of the responses seen here is consistent
with other studies which examined unitary interactions between unidentified pairs of putative interneurons.51,78 The previously reported depolarizing
responses evoked by population activity59,60 could be
due to changes in the intracellular concentration
of chloride and bicarbonate ions in the cells after
synchronous activation of very large numbers of
synapses.85
The synaptic response mediated by the LM-R
interneuron needs special consideration. Previous
studies have shown that single action potentials elicited in presynaptic LM-R interneurons may fail to
evoke any postsynaptic response, whereas a short
train of action potentials produces summated hyper-

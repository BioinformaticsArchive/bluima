ever, although GDNFR-α is seen to be expressed at high levels in
neurons of the lateral septum (Figs. 1C, 2 E), labeling was ob-served only on the periphery of the medial septum (Fig. 1C).
Conversely, RET mRNA was detected in scattered neurons in the
medial septum (Figs. 1 D, 2 F) and not at all in the lateral septum
(Fig. 1 D). Thus, there appears to be some segregation of RET
and GDNFR-α expression within the basal forebrain.
In addition to these previously characterized GDNF-responsive
populations, we find novel neuronal populations, which, based on
the expression of both GDNF receptor components, are likely to
benefit from the neurotrophic activities of GDNF. Of considerable interest is the finding that serotonergic neurons of the dorsal
Raphe nucleus express both GDNF receptors (Fig. 4 A–D). As
this population has been shown to degenerate in some cases of
Parkinson's disease, this suggests that GDNF may be an even
more efficient therapeutic agent for this disorder. In support of
this notion, preliminary results indicate that GDNF can promote
the survival of a portion of lesioned serotonergic neurons of the
dorsal Raphe (P. Åkerud and E. Arenas, personal communication). Additional populations that express both RET and
GDNFR-α mRNAs include dorsal cochlear (Fig. 4 E,G), lateral

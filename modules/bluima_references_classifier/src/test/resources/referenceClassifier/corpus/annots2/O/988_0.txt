leading to high and sustained levels of gene expression.
The ability of AAV to transduce stably a broad range of
both dividing and postmitotic cells with high efficiency
while avoiding the stimulation of inflammatory and
immunogenic host responses makes AAV arguably the
human CNS gene therapy vector of choice [28]. In the
current study, we examined transgene protein expression
5 weeks after injection of AAV-BDNF, AAV-GDNF, or
AAV-GFP into the striatum using antibodies specifically
directed against recombinant human BDNF, rat GDNF, or
green fluorescent protein (GFP) to confirm that transgene
expression remained stable and at physiologically relevant levels for the entire course of the experiment. We
saw intense BDNF, GDNF, or GFP immunoreactivity
unilaterally in the striatum of all rats that received
injections of AAV-BDNF, AAV-GDNF, or AAV-GFP, re-spectively (Fig. 1). Rats injected with either AAV-BDNF
or AAV-GDNF exhibited an immunoreactive ``penumbra'' extending from the site of vector injection, indicating the presence of BDNF or GDNF protein expression at
the end of the experiment (Figs. 1A and 1B). The GDNFimmunoreactive penumbra had a mean volume of 4.8 F
0.5 mm3 (mean F SEM) surrounding the vector injection
site, while the BDNF-immunoreactive penumbra had a
mean volume of 2.7 F 0.5 mm3. As both BDNF and GDNF
are secreted proteins, this penumbra likely represents the
area over which BDNF or GDNF is secreted at high,
immunocytochemically detectable levels from transduced cells. Immunoreactivity for all transgenes was
restricted to the striatum and was not observed in the
septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, corpus callosum, or
overlying cortex.

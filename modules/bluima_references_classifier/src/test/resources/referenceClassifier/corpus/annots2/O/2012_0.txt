residue. Within an HA subtype there is usually a predominant
P2 residue, with the exception of the H7 and H9 viruses, where
there are several dominant P2 residues. However, in all cases,
the P2 cleavage site contains a residue with an uncharged,
aliphatic or charged R group and not an aromatic R group, as
in the case of the neurotropic H1 strains.
The reverse-genetics-engineered influenza WSN HA mutant
Y328S virus fails to undergo multicycle replication in MDBK
cells in the absence of trypsin. To determine whether the
tyrosine residue at the P2 position (Y328) of the wild-type
WSN HA cleavage site has any effect on HA precursor protein
cleavage and virus activation, we generated recombinant wildtype viruses, along with mutant viruses containing a serine or
phenylalanine mutation at HA residue 328, using reverse ge-netics. The serine mutant virus (HA Y328S) was generated to
mimic the conserved sequence at the HA cleavage site P2
position, and the phenylalanine mutant virus (HA Y328F) was
generated to mimic the sequence present in the A/NWS/33
virus. Recombinant wild-type, Y328S, and Y328F viruses could
be rescued from transfected 293 T cells and subsequently am-plified in MDBK cells with the addition of trypsin. According
to previous reports, WSN can undergo multicycle replication in
MDBK cells without exogenous trypsin. We therefore examined whether the mutant Y328S and Y328F viruses retain the
ability of trypsin-independent replication in MDBK cells. In
plaque assays in MDBK cells, we found that the titers of the
WSN wild type (Y328) or the Y328F mutant virus were comparable with or without exogenous trypsin. In contrast, only the
lower dilutions of the Y328S mutant were able to form plaques
in the absence of trypsin, resulting in a significant reduction in
virus titer (Fig. 2A). The growth defect of the Y328S mutant
virus in MDBK cells in the absence of trypsin was then confirmed in viral multicycle growth experiments, in which MDBK
cells were infected with either wild-type (Y328) or mutant
Y328S and Y328F viruses at an MOI of 0.01 for 72 h, with the
supernatants being harvested every 12 h for viral titer determination. In the presence of trypsin, both Y328S and Y328F
mutant viruses replicated as efficiently as the WSN wild type
and could reach a titer of 108 PFU per ml by 72 h postinfection
(Fig. 2B). When trypsin was not included in the culture me-

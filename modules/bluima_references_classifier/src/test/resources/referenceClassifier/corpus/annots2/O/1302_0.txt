Lesion-induced response determined by Western
blot
SCG10 and GAP-43 protein changes after the unilateral
CX have been described previously (McNeill et al., 1999),
and, as with mRNA, we found a time dependent increase
in the level of SCG10 but not GAP-43 protein in the contralateral cortex. Specifically, the level of SCG10 protein
was increased at 3 days post-lesion and remained elevated above sham-operated values at 27 days post-lesion.
However, after the combined CX/SN lesion, the pattern
was reversed: GAP-43 protein levels increased significantly by 10 days post-lesion, before returning to control
levels at 27 days post-lesion (Fig. 5), but SCG10 protein
levels showed no significant change after the CX/SN le-sion. In addition, as with the mRNA data, we found no
change in the level of SCG10 or GAP-43 protein in the
contralateral cortex after SN lesion alone.

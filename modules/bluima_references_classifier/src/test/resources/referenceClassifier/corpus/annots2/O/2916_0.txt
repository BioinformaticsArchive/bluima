Both free-floating coronal and sagittal frozen sections of
sucrose cryopreserved cerebellum were stained in a standard
avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex technique in which antibody localization was revealed by the nickel-enhanced 3,3-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride method.1 AYnity-purified
rabbit anti-human â1, â2, â3 and â4 antisera were used at a
concentration of 0.5–1.0 μg IgG/ml in these analyses. At
these concentrations, both the immunofluorescence and
ELISA results (Fig. 1b and Table 1) indicate that the
antibodies are specific for their respective subunits, with no
cross-reactivity with other â subunits. Inhibition of immunohistochemical staining was performed by pre-incubation
of the antibodies with 50-fold molar excess of fusion protein. Non-specific labelling was determined by replacement
of the primary antibody with a solution of 1.0 μg/ml normal
rabbit immunoglobulin.

Fig. 6. Agenesis of the subcommissural organ (SCO) in adult Rfx3-deficient
mice. (Aâ€“D) Semi-thin toluidine-blue-stained sections of brains from wild-type
(A and C) and Rfx3-deficient (B and D) mice (20 weeks old). In wild-type
mice, the SCO cells lining the posterior commissure are elongated and their
apical poles protrude [white arrowhead in C] into the third ventricular cavity
(IIIv). In Rfx3-deficient mice, the remaining SCO cells are flattened and their
apical borders no longer protrude into the ventricle. They instead have a ciliated
aspect similar to that of the ependymal cells lining the lateral walls: the black
arrowheads mark the apical borders of the cilia of the ependymal cells
bordering the lateral walls of the third ventricle in wild-type and mutant mice
(C and D). The white arrowheads mark the protrusions of the SCO cells in
wild-type mice (C) and the abnormal ciliated border of the SCO cells in
mutant mice (D). IIIv, third ventricle; PC, posterior commissure.

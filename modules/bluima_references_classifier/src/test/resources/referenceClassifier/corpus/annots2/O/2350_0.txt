small, but significant, increases in the rate of limb flicking and investigatory or play
behavior (Table I). Following the 100 #g/kg dose, raphe unit activity was significantly
decreased from saline baseline only at 5 (--22.4 Yo)and 15 min (--23.1 Yoo)postinjection
(P < 0.05, t-test), while the limb flick rate was significantly increased at 5, 10, 15, 30
and 45 rain postinjection (P < 0.05, t-test). Four of the 5 cells tested at 100/~g/kg
showed a significant decrease in activity (Fig. 3). This dose of psilocin also produced
significant increases in head shaking, staring, and investigatory or play behavior
(Table I). The highest dose of psilocin (750 #g/kg) produced significant decreases in
raphe unit activity (--31.4 to --71.6 Yo) as compared to saline baseline (P < 0.01, t-test) at each time point between 10 and 60 min postinjection (Fig. 6). All 6 of the units
tested at this dose showed a significant decrease in activity. Unit activity was still
significantly decreased (---43.7 Yoo,P < 0.02) at 2 h postinjection, but had returned to
baseline levels by 4 h after psilocin administration. Interestingly, the highest dose of
psilocin produced no significant increase in the rate of limb flicking (Table I).

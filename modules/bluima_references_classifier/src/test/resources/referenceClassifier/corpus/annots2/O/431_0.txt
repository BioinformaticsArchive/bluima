Fig. 1. Electron microscopy of dog brain capillary. (A) A
cross-section of a brain capillary containing two red blood
cells is shown. (B) Two apposing cells form a tight junction
complex that is electron-dense and prevents paracellular
diffusion. Legend: N, endothelial-cell nucleus; L, capillary
lumen; R, red blood cell; TJ, tight junction; E, endothelial
cell. Bar, 1.6 μm in (A); 0.3 μm in (B).

thickness of the neocortical mantle. Vasopressin and vasopressin receptor V1a agonists were found to facilitate this flux. V1a
antagonists blocked the facilitatory efect of vasopressin and
reduced the water flux even in the absence of any exogenous
agonist. V2 agonists or antagonists had no efect. These data
suggest that vasopressin and V1a receptors play a crucial role
in the regulation of brain water and ion homeostasis, most
probably by modulating aquaporin-mediated water flux through
astrocyte plasma membranes.

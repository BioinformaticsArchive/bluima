ing areas.66,79 Clearly, the contributions of intrinsic
innervation, compared to descending supraspinal
projections, as well as intersegmental ascending
fibres, to the cholinergic terminal fields of the spinal
cord will require quantitative assessment through
combined tracing and lesioning/transection studies.
In addition, there is a possibility that primary aVerents may be cholinergic themselves as suggested on
the basis of the presence of ChAT immunoreactivity
in dorsal root ganglion cells reported.59 However, in
the present study and by using in situ hybridization in
a previous study we neither detected VAChT nor

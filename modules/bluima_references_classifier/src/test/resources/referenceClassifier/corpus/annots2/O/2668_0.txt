SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I. The cerebellum haslong been known to participate in movement control. One of the enduring theories of cerebellar function
is that it “tunes” and coordinates sensorimotor traffic in other
parts of the CNS. In particular, it has been implicated in the control of the sensitivity of muscle spindle stretch receptors through
the fusimotor system.
2. The stretch sensitivity of spindle primary endings can be
varied approximately over a IO-fold range by fusimotor efferent
action. For many years it has been believed that cerebellar dysfunction is associated with reduced drive to the fusimotor system
and that this in turn causeshypotonia by reducing the reflex excitation of cw-motoneuronsby spindle afferents.
3. The data on which this hypothesis is based were obtained in
anesthetized or decerebrate animals. Little direct information is
available on animals or humans performing voluntary movements and exhibiting ataxia or other cerebellar symptoms.
4. We tested the hypothesis by recording from nine muscle
spindle afferents in behaving cats before and during reversible
inactivation of cerebellar interpositus and dentate nuclei. In normal cats fusimotor action varies with motor task, greatly altering
spindle stretch sensitivity. We investigated whether this same
range of task-related sensitivity manifested itself during ataxia.
5. We found that the full range of spindle sensitivity was still
present during ataxia. We therefore conclude that the cerebellar
nuclei studied are not primarily responsible for fusimotor control,
nor is the ataxia primarily caused by disordered proprioceptive
sensitivity.

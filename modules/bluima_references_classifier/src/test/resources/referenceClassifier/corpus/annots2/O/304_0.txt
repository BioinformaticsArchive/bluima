Bregma). Sections were mounted onto gelatin coated slides, air dried and then
stored at x80uC until required for in situ hybridization.
The area of the brain sectioned for hybridization was equivalent to
1.8â€“3.4 mm behind the Bregma point according to the Rat Brain Atlas (27). A
cDNA fragment of the leptin receptor corresponding to a region of the
intracellular domain specific to the long splice variant, Ob-Rb, was generated
from rat brain RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR. The primer pair used in the

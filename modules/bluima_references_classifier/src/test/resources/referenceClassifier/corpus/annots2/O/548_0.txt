A
lien hand syndrome is a fascinating but controversial
clinical entity. Brion and Jedynak, in 1972, first
described three patients with tumour of the corpus callosum who failed to recognise ownership of one hand when it
was placed into the other hand behind the back and
introduced the concept of the alien hand (la main
Ã©trangere).1 Subsequently, the term has been applied to a
motor phenomena of apparently purposeful actions of one
hand against the patient's intention.2 Perception disturbance,
which makes this syndrome unique, is always verbally
expressed, even expression of astonishment at the autonomous activities of the alien hand may occur. Neuroimaging
and pathological studies demonstrated that the frontal lobe
and corpus callosum are the most common anatomical lesions
responsiible for this distinctive phenomenon.3 4 Here, we
describe the clinical, neuroanatomical, and radiological
findings of two patients who presented with the callosal type
of alien hand syndrome. The isolated manifestation of
intermanual conflict without evidence of callosal apraxia and
forced grasping makes our patients substantially different
from those previously described. On neuroradiological studies,
both patients had infarction restricted to the corpus callosum
secondary to stenosis of the supracallosal segment of the pericallosal artery.

AMPK
A complex system of biochemical pathways en-sures that anabolic/energy-consuming processes and
growth are tightly coordinated with the energy status of
the individual cells and the overall organism. One key
component among these biochemical pathways is the
serine-threonine protein kinase AMPK. This kinase serves
as a cellular fuel sensor with activation that is crucial to
reestablish energy homeostasis, and thus, to protect cell

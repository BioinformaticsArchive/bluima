mRNA Differential Display

The RNA imageR protocol and kit from GenHunter
(Brookline, MA) were used for the mRNA differential
display. Isolation of total RNA from rat NAc was carried out
with the TRIzolR Reagent (Gibco, BRL). Total RNA (each
0.5 μg) was converted to cDNA by the use of Maloney
murine leukemia virus (MMLV), reverse transcriptase (RT),
and an oligo (dT) primer.
One-tenth of the cDNA was amplified in a 20 μl total
reaction volume containing 1  PCR buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, pH9.0), 20 pmol of the oligo (dT)
primer (T12MN), 4 pmol of an arbitrary hexamer primer,
2 μM dNTP, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Amplitaq GoldR;
Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Cycling parameters were 94°C
for 1 min, 40°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 1 min for 40 cycles,
then 72°C for 7 min. The amplified cDNAs were separated in
a 6% DNA sequence gel, after which the gel was stained with
SYBRR Green II nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR).
Bands representing differentially expressed cDNAs were
excised from the gel, reamplified by a PCR with the same
primers, and subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen,
San Diego, CA) by TA cloning. Inserts were analyzed by
supercoil dideoxynucleotide sequencing.

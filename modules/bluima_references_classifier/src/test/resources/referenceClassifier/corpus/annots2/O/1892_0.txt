All procedures were carried out in compliance with the guidelines of the
National Institutes of Health. All protocols were approved in advance by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Oregon Health &
Science University. Male CBA / J mice, which carry the Pde6brd1
mutation and exhibit blindness by weaning age (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME, USA), were used to examine the effects of early retinal
degeneration on the development of ipRGCs. For controls, we used male
CBA / N (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA) mice, which
have the same genetic background as the CBA / J mice, but lack the
Pde6brd1 mutation and are, therefore, visually intact.
The mice were housed in facilities that permit the maintenance of a
12-h lightâ€“dark (LD) cycle. Animals used in the behavioral studies
were kept in separate chambers under the environmental conditions
described below. Studies were restricted to male mice to avoid
potential effects of fluctuations in female reproductive hormones on
circadian behaviors. All mice used for entrainment studies were
between 3 and 7 months old, to avoid variability in their abilities to
entrain (Pittendrigh & Daan, 1976).

The large caudal whiskers are associated with two types of striated
musculature, one that moves the whole mystacial pad and another that
directly moves each sinus hair follicle. The most rostral vibrissae lack
the latter muscle system (Doerfl, 1985). The striated muscle fibres
mediating protraction form a sling around the rostral aspect of each
hair follicle. Contraction of these muscles via branches of the facial
nerve pulls the base of the follicle caudally, moving the distal aspects

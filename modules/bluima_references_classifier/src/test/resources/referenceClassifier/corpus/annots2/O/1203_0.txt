Figure 2. Photoperiod-induced differences in water-maze reversal learning and memory after relocation to the hidden platform. A, Latency to reach the relocated hidden platform by block of training. B, Path length to reach the hidden platform by block
of training. C, Time spent in each quadrant of the pool including the quadrant in which the platform was hidden in the original
hidden-platform trials and the quadrant in which the platform was hidden for the reversal trials. Long-day, n 7; short-day, n

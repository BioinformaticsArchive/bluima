the levels of all three subunit mRNAs rosethree- to fourfold.
In addition, others have demonstrated that the al-subunit
mRNA and its encodedpolypeptide becomeabundant in granule neuronsonly after migration to their adult positions(Meineckeand Rakic, 1990).Consistentwith thesefindingsin vivo,
all of the subunit mRNAs were presentin granulecell cultures
preparedat Pl 0. Moreover, the mRNAs wereexpressedat levels
approximately sixfold higher than those found at E19. In ad-dition, the p2- and y2-subunit mRNAs increasedsixfold be-tween 4 and 7 d in culture. Although theseincreasesoccurred
approximately 2 d later than those seenin vivo, our results
indicate that cultured P10 granulecellsmimic many aspectsof
their normal developmentalprogram. The delay in the observed
increasespresumably reflects the time required for recovery

Fig. 1. Profile of eicosanoid content in
normal versus kainate-treated brain, spinal cord, and CSF. Animals were injected
with 10 mg/kg kainate subcutaneously,
after 24-h tissues and CSF were harvested, and the different eicosanoid contents were measured by ELISA. A, total
brain; B, spinal cord; C, CSF. Data are
expressed as mean S.E.M.; n 5; ,

(Fig. 2 B) that was comparable to LTP in naive animals (147.4
6.7%; p 0.05; LTP 15% in 7 of 9 cells) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast,
rats administered cocaine showed a significantly reduced LTP
(114.1 2.7%; p 0.01; LTP 15% in 3 of 12 cells) (Fig. 3A).
On average, LTP was not inducible when tested 24 h after a single
cocaine injection or 24 h after the fifth day of five consecutive
injections (99.0 3.5% and 93.1 10.7%; LTP 15% in 1 of 7
and 1 of 6 cells, respectively) (Fig. 2 D, E). In agreement with
previous results from mice (Ungless et al., 2001) (but see Liu et
al., 2005), these results indicate that in vivo cocaine exposure
causes a decrease in the incidence of electrically induced LTP in
VTA DA neurons independent of the induction protocol and
suggest that cocaine-induced LTP and synaptically evoked LTP
share some common underlying mechanisms.

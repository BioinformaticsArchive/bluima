We developed an in situ model to investigate the hypothesis
that AMPA/kainate (AMPA/KA) receptor activation contributes
to hypoxic–ischemic white matter injury in the adult brain.
Acute coronal brain slices, including corpus callosum, were
prepared from adult mice. After exposure to transient oxygen
and glucose deprivation (OGD), white matter injury was as-sessed by electrophysiology and immunofluorescence for oligodendrocytes and axonal neurofilaments. White matter cellular components and the stimulus-evoked compound action
potential (CAP) remained stable for 12 hr after preparation.
OGD for 30 min resulted in an irreversible loss of the CAP as
well as structural disruption of axons and subsequent loss of
neurofilament immunofluorescence. OGD also caused widespread oligodendrocyte death, demonstrated by the loss of
APC labeling and the gain of pyknotic nuclear morphology and
propidium iodide labeling. Blockade of AMPA/KA receptors
with 30 μM NBQX or the AMPA-selective antagonist 30 μM
GYKI 52466 prevented OGD-induced oligodendrocyte death.

strated the specificity of each of the immune reactions.
In all sections analyzed, only neurons identified as having an MA phenotype by the presence of TH or TPH
immunofluorescence were found to contain GTPCH
immunoreactivity. Representative examples of 5 -HT,
NE, or DA cell groups identified by TPH or TH immunofluorescence are presented in Fig. 1. The green fluorescein signal for GTPCH within neurons of the DR
was intense and homogenous across all Texas Redlabeled TPH-positive cell bodies and dendritic processes (Fig. 1A and B). The NE neurons of the LC,

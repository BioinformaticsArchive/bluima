of the geniculate nuclei begins on El 5.5. At this time, the NPYIR neurons of the IGL also begin to create the GHT by sending
fibers ventrally toward the SCN. The relationship between IGL
development and retinal innervation of the IGL, VLG, or DLG
has not been explicitly studied. However, the IGL may receive
retinal fibers later than its neighboring structures (Frost et al.,
1979; Frost, 1984; So et al., 1984).
The convergent complexity of neuronal and glial events in
the lateral geniculate raises multiple questions concerning the
source and nature of putative signals initiating optic fiber ramilication. Both neurons and glia have been suggested as regulators of visual system growth patterns (Jhaveri et al., 1991).
There is also increasing awareness that anatomical astrocytic
“barriers” to axonal penetration organize brain morphology
(Steindler, 1993). The entire adult IGL and SCN (Morin et al.,
1989; present results) contain dense matrices of astrocytes. The
barrier function may be one reason that reinnervation of IGL
and SCN, but not of other visual system nuclei, fails following
transplantation of embryonic retina to enucleated adults (Radel
et al., 1990). The great length ofthe IGL suggeststhat in addition
to being a nucleus mediating adult circadian rhythmicity, it plays
an important functional role in the laminar development of the
lateral geniculate complex (Hutchins and Casagrande, 1988,
1990).

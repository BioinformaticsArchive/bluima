2001; Jones et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2003). Such inflammatory cell expression of NG2 was not observed in this
study; the discrepancy may be explained by the fact that
other studies (e.g. Bu et al., 2001; McTigue et al., 2001;
Tang et al., 2003) used polyclonal antibodies to NG2 whilst
a monoclonal antibody was used here.

matters (except the injury site) (Fig. 5). Using a cRNA
probe that recognizes the tyrosine kinase domain of
TrkB, we found full-length tyrosine kinase TrkB receptor (TrkB-TK) predominantly hybridized in cells
throughout the gray matter (Figs. 5Aâ€“5H). In the ventral horn, large soma cells in Rexed lamina IX express
TrkB and likely represent SMN (Figs. 5C and 5G, inset

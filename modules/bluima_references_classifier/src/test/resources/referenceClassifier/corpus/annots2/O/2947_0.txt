DISCUSSION
The results of the present study add to our knowledge of the
molecular mechanisms by which chronic exposure to opiates leads
to dependence at a cellular level in LC neurons. We show that
chronic morphine administration increases levels of specific subtypes of adenylyl cyclase and of specific subunits of PKA in the
LC. Using an antisense oligonucleotide strategy, we show f urther
that the upregulation of adenylyl cyclase, but not that of PKA,
requires CREB. This differential regulation of adenylyl cyclase

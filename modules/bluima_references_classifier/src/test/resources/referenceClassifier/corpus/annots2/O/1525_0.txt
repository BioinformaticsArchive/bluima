under conditions of reduced Cdk5 activity. In order to capture
this potentially transient phosphoinhibitor-1 species in vivo,
acute striatal slices were treated with the Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, in the absence or presence of PDBu and assessed for
phospho-Ser65 inhibitor-1 levels (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment with
roscovitine attenuated the PDBu-induced increase in the levels
of diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 by 68 2% ( p 0.001,
Student's unpaired t test, n 4) (Fig. 5A, second panel), confirming that this form of inhibitor-1 is jointly regulated by PKC
and Cdk5 activities in vivo. In contrast, roscovitine had no effect
on the PDBu-induced increase in the level of phosphorylation
of the control PKC substrate, Ser831 of GluR1 (Fig. 5A, bottom
panel), indicating that the roscovitine-dependent decrease in
the levels of diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 in striatal slices
treated with PDBu is most likely a result of Cdk5 inhibition and
not due to a nonspecific effect of roscovitine on PKC activity.
Surprisingly, however, no generation of phospho-Ser65 inhibitor-1 was detected in these striatal tissue samples (Fig. 5A, top
panel). These findings suggest that phospho-Ser65 inhibitor-1,
conceivably generated as a result of simultaneous PKC activation and Cdk5 inhibition in acute striatal slices, may have nonetheless escaped immunodetection due to rapid dephosphorylation by a basal protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity
in vivo.
Regulation of Diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 Inhibitor-1 Levels by
Protein Phosphatase Inhibitors in Acute Striatal Slicesâ€”The in
vitro and in vivo observations described above raise the possibility that phospho-Ser65 inhibitor-1 is a labile inhibitor-1 form
that is highly susceptible to dephosphorylation in vivo unless it
occurs in the context of phospho-Ser67. Phospho-Ser67 inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by PP-2A and PP-2B in the striatum
(29). To characterize the dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser65
inhibitor-1 in this tissue, striatal slices were treated with a panel
of selective protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors
(Fig. 5B). Treatment with inhibitors of PP-1, PP-2A, or PP-2B
activity did not result in the generation of detectable levels of
phospho-Ser65 inhibitor-1 in acute striatal slices (data not
shown). The PP-2A inhibitor, fostriecin, and the PP-2B inhibitor, cyclosporin A, also had no significant effect on diphosphoSer65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 levels. In striatal slices, okadaic acid
inhibits PP-1 and PP-2A differentially in a dose-dependent
manner (38). At a concentration of 0.2 M, it inhibits 80% of
PP-2A activity and 5% of PP-1 activity, whereas at 1 M, it inhibits 95% of PP-2A activity and 35% of PP-1 activity. Okadaic acid
(0.2 M), which predominantly inhibits PP-2A, caused a small,
but significant, increase in the levels of diphospho-Ser65/Ser67
inhibitor-1 in striatal slices. On the other hand, treatment with
1 M okadaic acid resulted in a more substantial increase that
was comparable with the maximal effect of PDBu and was
(4.6 0.3)-fold larger than the increase caused by the lower
dose of okadaic acid. This difference, together with the failure
of fostriecin to cause a change in diphospho-Ser65/Ser67 inhibitor-1 levels, suggests that PP-1 is the major protein serine/
threonine phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating
phospho-Ser65 inhibitor-1 in the striatum. Treatment with
calyculin A, which equally inhibits most PP-1 and PP-2A activity at 1 M (38), caused an increase in diphospho-Ser65/Ser67
inhibitor-1 levels that was comparable with the increase due to

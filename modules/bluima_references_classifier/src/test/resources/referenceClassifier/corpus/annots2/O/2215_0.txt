cells (CB: 25-38). Its extent measures
590-1,380,800-1,200, and 725-1,410 wrn
in the dorsoventral, anteroposterior, and
mediolateral direction respectively. In
general, due to the uniform divergence of
dendritic segments from their somata, primate X neurons resemble the isodendritic
radiant neurons of Ramon-Moliner (82).
They also resemble the multipolar integratory densely ramified neurons of Leontovich (59).
AXONAL SYSTEM OF X NEURONS (FIG. 8).
Axons of X neurons emerge from the cell
body and occasionally from a primary dendrite. Compared with axons of L and T
neurons (Figs. 5, A-C, 1lA, C and 14A, B),
they are consistently thicker with diameters
varying between 3 and 7 pm (5.0 + 1.4,
mean * SD). Irrespective of the location or
the somatodendritic appearance of the parent neuron, all labeled X axons follow a
common path. This as well as the points of
origin and trajectories of ipsilateral extrinsic

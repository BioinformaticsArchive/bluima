tant for the NMDA-mediated signaling
pathway (Thomas and Huganir, 2004) and
we hypothesized that downregulation of
this subunit would lead to alterations in
the phosphorylation of CREB. To evaluate
whether changes in NR2B affect the downstream signaling molecule CREB and
phospho-CREB, we stained the PC of control and lesioned mice with CREB and
phospho-CREB antibodies (Fig. 4). The
number of immunoreactive cells in layer
IIa and IIb of PC were quantified with op-tical dissector stereology methodology
(Figs. 4G). CREB and phospho-CREB
were widely expressed by cells in layers
IIa and IIb of PC (Fig. 4 A, D). We ob-served a reduction in phospho-CREBimmunoreactive pyramidal cells only in
layer IIb and not IIa at 2 and 7 d after zinc
sulfate lesion (Figs. 4 E, F ) ( p 0.01).
However, CREB immunostaining re-mained unchanged after lesion (Figs.
4 B, C), suggesting alterations in CREB ac-tivation and phosphorylation rather than
expression. Together, these data indicate a
pathway whereby peripheral lesion re-duces glutamatergic input and neural ac-tivity in the OB, input and neural activity
in the PC, reduction in the phosphorylation of CREB in layer IIb neurons, and ex-pression of NMDA receptor subunit
NR2B in layer IIb and putatively other
genes.

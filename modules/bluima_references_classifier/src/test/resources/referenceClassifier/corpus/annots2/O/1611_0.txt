well to increasing stimulation intensities applied to the
EC. The five groups differed in the amplitude of the
evoked responses in the EC-BLA pathway at all levels of
intensity [F(4,33) = 4.4, P < 0.01]. CORT10 and
CORT25 groups showed a significant enhancement in
the evoked potentials at all levels of intensity and in
baseline responses compared with the na ̈ıve, the vehicle,
and the CORT5 groups (P < 0.05 for CORT10 and
P < 0.005 for CORT25; Fig. 4a).
As a consequence, there was a difference between
the baseline responses of the five groups [F(4,33) =
9.13, P < 0.0001]. CORT5 group showed a significantly
higher baseline responses relative to the na ̈ıve (P < 0.05)
and to the vehicle (P < 0.05) groups but marginally
lower baseline responses than the CORT10 (P = 0.052)
and the CORT25 (P = 0.06) groups. The CORT10
and CORFT25 groups both showed a significant in-crease in baseline responses relative to the na ̈ıve (P <
0.0001) and to the vehicle (P < 0.0001) groups. (Fig. 4b)
Therefore, CORT influenced baseline activity in BLA
in dose-dependent manner.
The TBS to EC induced a robust increase of the
field potentials in BLA in all the five groups. Eighty minutes posttetanization amplitudes in BLA differed significantly from pre-TBS levels in all the groups: t(8) = 5.72,
P < 0.0001 for na ̈ıves, t(5) = 3.1, P < 0.05 for the vehicle
group, t(7) = 6.93, P < 0.0001 for the CORT5 group, t(6)
= 6.73, P < 0.001 for the CORT10 group, and t(7) = 3,
P < 0.05 for the CORT25 group. Thus, TBS induced LTP
in EC-BLA pathway in all the groups (Fig. 4c).
There was a significant difference between the
groups in posttetanic potentiation (PTP) for up to 20 min
post-TBS [F(4,33) = 3.66, P < 0.05]. All the treatment
groups (including the vehicle group) exhibited lower
levels of PTP than the na ̈ıve rats: (P < 0.05) for vehicle
group: P < 0.001 for the CORT5 group, P < 0.05 for
the CORT10 group, and P < 0.005 for the CORT25
group. Therefore, PTP was reduced in treatment groups
independently of CORT concentration. LTP was not
influenced by any of the treatments.
To test a possible relationship between the initial
change in baseline activity, produced by the treatment,
and LTP, we performed a statistical analysis of correlation between the mean of baseline responses and TBSinduced enhancement of the responses (Fig. 4c). No sig-

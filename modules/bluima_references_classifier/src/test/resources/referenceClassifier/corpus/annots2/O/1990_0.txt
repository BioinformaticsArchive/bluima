In both humans and rodents, the external environment is encoded in the form of cognitive maps. Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex
(mEC) represent spatial locations in a sequence of grid-like patterns scaled along the dorsal–ventral axis. The grid spacing correlates with
the intrinsic resonance frequencies of stellate cells in layer II of mEC. We investigated the development of frequency preferences in these
cells from weaning to adulthood using patch-clamp and sharp microelectrode recordings. We found that the dorsal–ventral gradient of
stellate cell properties and frequency preferences exists before animals are able to actively explore their environment. In the transition to
adulthood, cells respond faster and become less excitable, and the range of intrinsic resonance frequencies in the population expands in
the dorsal direction. This is likely to reflect both the growth of the brain and the expansion of the internal representation caused by new
exploratory experience.

Fig. 5. Effects of altering ion concentrations on the response to opioid in a nerve terminal. Responses to
methionine-enkephalin (20/tl of 3 mM; arrow) were examined during intracellular recording from a
calyciform nerve terminal. Complete responses are shown in the chart recorder traces (left-hand panels),
while the right-hand panels are expanded time-base oscilloscope records showing voltage responses to
50 ms constant-current hyperpolarizing pulses before (C)) and during ( 0 ) exposure to the opioid. Control
buffer: the response to methionine-enkephalin is a depolarization accompanied by a decrease in input
resistance (as measured during the response when the membrane potential was returned to the control
value by application of hyperpolarizing current). Note the relaxation or "sag" in the initial expanded
time-base record (solid arrowhead), which is due to activation of a mixed cation inward rectifier? During
exposure to opioid, there is a reduced voltage response to the hyperpolarizing current pulse, indicating
reduced input resistance (0). The sag due to the inward rectifier is also not as prominent, since rectifier
activation depends on the degree of hyperpolarization obtained during the current pulse.9 Low sodium
buffer: the depolarizing response to methionine-enkephalin is reduced to 40% of control when sodium
chloride is replaced by choline chloride (5 mM nominal Na + concentration). Insets 1 and 2 show responses
to depolarizing current in control (0.3 nA) and low sodium (0.5 nA) buffer, respectively. Potassium
(10 mM): increasing K+3.3-fold to 10 mM reduced input resistance in the terminal considerably, but had
no effect on the size of the opioid response. Cesium (3 mM): the mixed cation inward rectifier is blocked
in this buffer,9 as evidenced by the absence of a relaxation in the expanded time-base record (open
arrowhead). The response to the opioid was not reduced in this buffer, and consisted of depolarization
and spiking activity. Similar spiking activity during opioid responses was seen in many terminals in control
buffer, including during several recoveries from ion substitutions in this terminal (not shown). Scale bar
calibrations: 20 mV, 0.8 nA and 12.5 s for left-hand panels; 20 mV and 15 ms for right-hand panels; 40 mV
and 30 ms for right-hand panel insets.

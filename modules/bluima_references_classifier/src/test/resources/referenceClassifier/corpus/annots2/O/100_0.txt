transported proteins it was a major w35Sxmethionine and
w3 Hxpalmitate labeled protein in neurons w21,29x. In vitro
binding studies using whole proteins indicate that SNAP-25
shows a distinct preference for the plasma membrane
syntaxin molecules with which it heterodimerizes syntaxin 1 ) 4 s 2 ) 3. w41x. Two-hybrid analysis has also
demonstrated a similar binding preference in SNAP-25rsyntaxin interactions w1,19x. However, N- and C-terminal peptides derived from SNAP-25 failed to show significant syntaxin or v-SNARE binding selectivity w64x. Functionally, recombinant SNAP-25 enhances the affinity of
syntaxin 1 binding to its cognate v-SNARE, VAMPrsynaptobrevin-2, suggesting a role for SNAP-25 in vesicle
docking w20,41,51x. The yeast homologue of SNAP-25,
Sec 9p, has also been associated with vesicle consumption
due to the accumulation of small vesicles when the temperature sensitive mutant is incubated at restrictive temperature w35x. Sec 9p, like SNAP-25, is required for the v-SNARE, Snc 1p, to interact with the t-SNARE, Sso 1p
w7,44x.
The cDNA for human SNAP-23 was originally cloned
from a B-cell cDNA library using the two-hybrid system
with the cytosolic portion of syntaxin 4 as `bait' w42x.
Three other groups have isolated cDNA clones for SNAP-23, one from human melanoma cells w63x, a clone, originally called syndet, from mouse adipocytes w56x, and two
isoforms from human neutrophils and HL-60 cells w34x.
SNAP-23 is expressed in numerous tissues where it has
been localized to the plasma membrane and to an uncharacterized, intracellular compartment w1,56x that was re-cently shown to be endosomal in nature w8,53x. Initial
experiments suggest that it can bind equally in vitro to
each of the plasma membrane syntaxins 1, 2, 3 and 4.
w42x. Subsequent experiments using two-hybrid analysis
show that SNAP-23 has a partner preference for syntaxin
1 G 4 ) 2 ) 3 but this seems to be dependent on the
combination of `bait' and `prey' used w1x. Functional
analysis of SNAP-23 indicates its role in several membrane trafficking events such as: transferrin receptor recycling in MDCK cells w28x, glucose transporter mobilization
in adipocytes w43,52x and dense core granule release in
platelets Chen et al. submitted..
In several polarized cells, SNAP-23 has been found to
localize to either the basolateral or apical plasma membrane w14,31x. None of those cells, however, endogenously
express SNAP-25 therefor it is difficult to know if there is
a specific sorting mechanism for the SNAP-25rSNAP23
family of t-SNAREs. Neurons and neuroendocrine cells
are unique in that they express both members of this
family. In this study we show that SNAP-23 is predominantly associated with the somata of the neuron, while
SNAP-25 localizes to the axonal processes and synaptosomes. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that
SNAP-23r25 form heterodimers with syntaxin t-SNAREs
that would not be predicted from the previous in vitro
binding experiments w1,41,42,64x.

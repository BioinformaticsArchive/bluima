Functionally Distinct RNA-binding Motifs of ADAR1 Associated with Editing of 5-HT2CR RNAâ€”Previous mutagenesis
studies revealed that the three repeated copies of the dsRBM
found in ADAR1 are functionally distinct from one another
(37), and that the functional importance of each individual
dsRBM depends upon the ADAR1 splice variant when synthetic dsRNA is utilized as the substrate (38). Using the recombinant ADAR1-b splice variant, we examined the effect of the
equivalent substitution mutation introduced into each of the
three dsRBMs of ADAR1 on editing activity measured with the
natural 5-HT2CR RNA substrate as compared with a fully
complementary synthetic dsRNA substrate. For each of three
dsRBM mutants, RI, RII, and RIII, the highly conserved lysine
residue within the dsRBM core that is essential for RNAbinding activity was mutated (37, 38). In agreement with earlier observations obtained with a synthetic [32P]dsRNA substrate, the RIII copy of ADAR1 was the most important of the
three dsRBMs and the RI and RII copies were less important for
deaminase activity, either in the FL or the M296 form of the
protein (Fig. 4A). When the 288-nt 5-HT2CR RNA was tested as

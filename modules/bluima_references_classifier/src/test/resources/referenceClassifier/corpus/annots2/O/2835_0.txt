Fig. 1. A shows a typical injection site (arrowheads) in the hippocampus after 10 days of FG injection.
DiVusion of the dye is evident throughout the CA3, dentate granule cell layer (arrows), and the adjoining
CA1. C shows specific retrograde labelling of CA3 pyramidal cells in normal hippocampus following such
an injection of FG (A) into the contralateral hippocampus. DG, dentate gyrus; Scale bar=400 μm. B and
D show enlargements of FG-labelled areas in A and C. Scale bar=200 μm.

Adult (3 months old) male nonlinear white rats
with the average weight of 150 g were used for the
experiments. The experiments were performed at the
same time of day. The animals had free access to food.
The rats were placed in special plastic cages that had
free-air ventilation and that were sized (7 Ã— 14 cm) for
one rat and corresponded to the width of the center of the
gap of the strong permanent magnet. The magnetic field
could be considered homogenous, because the field varied for no more than 5% within a sphere with a diameter
of 12 cm. The magnetic field intensity was measured
with a Teslometer W1-8 (Armenian Radiophysical Institute). This instrument measures magnetic fields in the
range 10-3 to 1.6 T (65%). The magnetic induction

stellate ganglia were exposed retropleurally by removing the head of
the first rib. These nerves project to the heart and vasculature of the
forelimb, respectively. In most experiments, recordings were made
from two nerves (right inferior cardiac nerve and either the left
inferior cardiac or left vertebral nerve). Potentials were recorded
monophasically from the central ends of the cut nerves placed on
platinum bipolar electrodes. The capacity-coupled preamplifier bandpass
was set at 1–1,000 Hz so that the synchronized discharges of sympathetic
fibers appeared as slow waves or envelopes of spikes (20).
Microinjections. All chemicals used for microinjection were di-luted in PBS. Solutions were adjusted to a pH of 6 – 8 (litmus paper
test) and placed in a glass micropipette ( 40- m tip diameter) that
was glued (cyanoacrylate) to the needle of a 5- l Hamilton syringe
and mounted on a microinjection unit (David Kopf Instruments,
model 5000). A 50-nl injection was made slowly ( 10 s) at each
medullary site (see below) by turning the calibrated micrometer on the
microinjection unit. The following drugs were injected into the me-dulla: the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC; 1.0 mM) or
SR-95531 (0.125–1.0 mM) and the nonselective EAA receptor antagonist kynurenate (KYN; 150 mM). All drugs were purchased from
RBI Sigma (St. Louis, MO). These drug concentrations are within the

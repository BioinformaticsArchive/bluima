FIG. 3. Northern blot analysis of human BEC1 and BEC2. A, tissue distribution. B, distribution within human brain. Blots of poly(A)+ RNA
(2 Î¼g) from human various tissues and brain regions were hybridized individually with the 32P-labeled probe specific to human BEC1 (top panel),
BEC2 (middle panel), or erg (HERG, bottom panel). The positions of size markers in kilobases are indicated.

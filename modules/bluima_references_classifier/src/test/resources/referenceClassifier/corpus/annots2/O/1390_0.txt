distribution of BDNF-containing neurons in the PAG and ex-pression of TrkB in spinally projection neurons in the RVM
(Conner et al., 1997; Yan et al., 1997a,b; King et al., 1999), our
results suggest an involvement of BDNF in NMDAR-dependent
neuronal plasticity in enhanced descending modulation during
inflammatory pain. Hindpaw inflammation upregulates BDNF
proteins in the ventrolateral PAG, which is associated with an
increase in BDNF and TrkB in the RVM. Importantly, there is an
increased TrkB activation as shown by the increased TrkB phosphorylation. Behavioral studies demonstrate that NMDAR an-tagonists are able to block BDNF-induced nociceptive facilitation, suggesting that the effect of BDNF depends on downstream
NMDAR activation. Two alternative mechanisms may underlie
the action of BDNF after microinjection in the brain (Lessmann,
1998). First, BDNF may enhance glutamate release from presynaptic terminals in the RVM, leading to an increase in intracellular
Ca 2 concentration through the activation of NMDARs, resulting in enhanced excitatory (facilitatory) descending output. Al-ternatively, BDNF may bind to postsynaptic TrkB receptors and
enhance NMDAR activity through intermediate cellular signaling pathways (Pezet et al., 2002b). Our results demonstrate the
latter mechanism because of the following: (1) activation of PAG
neurons induced internalized and phosphorylated TrkB in RVM
neurons and direct knockdown of TrkB expression in the RVM
attenuated inflammatory hyperalgesia, and (2) BDNF is coupled
to NMDAR activation.

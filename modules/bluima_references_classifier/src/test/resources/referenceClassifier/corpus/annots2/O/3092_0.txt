Conditioned effects of cocaine

Exposure to the compound stimulus previously paired with cocaine
resulted in a conditioned increase in motor activity (mean = 182 6 35
counts/10 min) within the first 10 min bin after which motor activity
returned to baseline levels by the end of the 30 min session (Fig. 3B,
histogram). These conditioned stimulus-elicited increases in motor
activity in the paired drug group (n = 6) were significantly different
from those seen in both the unpaired drug group (n = 6) and the
vehicle control group (n = 6) (F6,45 = 3.64, P < 0.01). Tukey's post
hoc analyses revealed that the activity scores for the paired drug
group differed from both the unpaired drug and control groups in the
first 10 min bin following the administration of the vehicle and
conditional stimuli, but not during the second and third 10 min bins.
Exposure to the cocaine-paired compound stimulus was accompanied by an immediate increase in DA oxidation currents which reached
maximum current values of μ 2.5 nA within μ 10 min after the
presentation of the stimulus (Fig. 3B, lines and symbols). This increase
was significantly different from both the unpaired drug and vehicle
control group values (F6,45 = 3.16, P < 0.05). Tukey's post hoc
analyses revealed that the increase in the DA oxidation signal in the
paired drug group was significantly greater than the unpaired drug
group in each 10 min bin after presentation of the compound conditional stimulus and was different from the vehicle control group in
the last two 10 min bins. Increases in DA oxidation currents above
baseline values on the test day were not significantly different from
cocaine-induced changes in DA oxidation currents (Fig. 3A vs. 3B).

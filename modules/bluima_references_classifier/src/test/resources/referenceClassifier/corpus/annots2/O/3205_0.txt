The extracellular DA, DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA
levels, as a percentage of baseline values, in saline
and in cytokine-treated animals of the first experiment, are shown in Table 1. Figures 2–5 show the
eVects of the cytokine and air-puV stress in the
second experiment. The eVects of the cytokines in
the two experiments were the same. Thus, the results
focus primarily on the second experiment, and the
initial study is referred to only in the context of amine
changes that occurred in the absence of the air-puV
stressor. Treatment with IL-1 did not aVect extracellular DA levels over the course of 5 h (F<1).
Treatment with IL-6, in contrast, markedly influenced DA levels, as revealed by a significant cytokine

P<0.01. Newman–Keuls multiple comparisons indicated that a decline of extracellular levels was apparent within 30 min of IL-6 administration (relative to
baseline and to levels in saline-treated rats), and
remained depressed over the course of the ensuing
2.5 h. Upon presentation of the air-puV, which itself
was not suYcient to alter DA levels, a further decline
of DA was noted. This decline was particularly
marked, such that extracellular DA levels reached

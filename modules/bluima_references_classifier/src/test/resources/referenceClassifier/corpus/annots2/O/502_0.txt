Gauge (AWG) enamel-coated copper wire (;0.8 mm diameter). The loops of the solenoid met at the long-axis coil
end and were tightly twisted into three half-turns of ap-proximately 2 mm total length to displace the tuning circuit components away from the coil inductor (Fig. 1a). The
circuit diagram for the coil system is shown in Fig. 2. The
leads were soldered to a miniature 16 pF ceramic chipcapacitor (2.8 × 2.8 × 2.5 mm, Dielectric Laboratories Inc.,
Cazenovia, NY) (C3T in Fig. 2). This placed the capacitor in
series with the coil inductor (LImp in Fig. 2) in order to
tune the circuit resonance. A resonance-blocking circuit
(27) was added in parallel across the tuning capacitor. The
resonance-blocking circuit consisted of a crossed-diodes
package (model MA45471, M/A-COM, Inc., Lowell, MA)
placed in series with a six-turn, 2 mm × 2 mm inductor
(LDec in Fig. 2), made with 28 AWG enamel-coated copper
wire. This resonance-blocking scheme decoupled the im-planted coil from the external coil during transmission,
thus enabling the external coil to provide relatively uniform excitation over the spinal cord. However, during
signal reception the resonance blocking circuit was not
active, so the implanted and external coils remained coupled and the MR signal received by the implanted coil was
detected. Once construction and bench testing were completed, the implantable coil system was coated with
PMMA, which produces no interfering 1H signal, sets
quickly, and dries to a hard solid. The PMMA coating
maintains the coil's structural integrity, provides a surface
for attachment of the coil system to the spinal column,
electrically isolates the coil, and minimizes possible susceptibility distortions due to the coil components.
The external surface coil was a single-turn saddle constructed with flat copper tape ;6 mm (0.25 inches) in
width, 3 cm along each side (measured from the center of
the tape). Rather than use a single-series capacitor to turn
this inductor to resonance, two fixed capacitors (20 pF
ceramic chip-capacitor, American Technical Ceramics,
Huntington Station, NY) were placed at each end of the
inductor (in Fig. 2, one chip capacitor is CD and the other

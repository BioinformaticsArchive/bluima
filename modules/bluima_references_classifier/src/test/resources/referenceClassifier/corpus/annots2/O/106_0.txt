FIG. 2. Structural arrangement of the Oct-2 gene in the 3'-region
subjected to alternative splicing and localization of the PCR primers
used to isolate the resulting alternatively spliced forms of Oct-2
mRNA. Boxes represent exons. The numbers under each box correspond to the exon number. Thin lines represent intronic sequences.
The hatched boxes represent intronic DNA segments spliced into
Oct-2c mRNA. Arrows depict the localization of the primers. Arrowheads indicate the translation termination site for each isoform. The
primers are shown according to a nomenclature in which a-5' is the
5' primer for Oct-2a.

ABSTRACT
The nigrostriatal dopamine system of the mammalian brain is
necessary for normal voluntary motor activity. Dopamine exerts its
effects by acting on two primary receptor subtypes: D1-like (D1
and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors. Previous research
has indicated that both subtypes are involved in the negative
feedback regulation of dopamine release in the brain. However,
the role of D1-like receptors localized within the striatum remains
controversial. Using in vivo microdialysis, we report that infusions
of the D1/D5 antagonist SCH 23390 [R-( )-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine] (5â€“200
M) directly into the striatum increased dopamine release in a
concentration-dependent manner. Systemic administration of the

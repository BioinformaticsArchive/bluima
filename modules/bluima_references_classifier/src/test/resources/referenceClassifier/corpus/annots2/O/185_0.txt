Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV-5) is a neurovirulent alphaherpesvirus that causes fatal encephalitis in calves (5, 21). Nonneurovirulent BHV-1 is associated with abortions and respiratory infections (subtype 1.1) and genital infections (subtype
1.2) in cattle (57). Both BHV-1 and BHV-5 strains are neurotropic viruses and establish latency in the trigeminal ganglion
(TG) following intranasal and conjunctival inoculation (1, 50).
Genetically, they share 85% DNA homology; however, they
differ in the ability to cause neurological disease in calves (5).
In a rabbit seizure model, nonneurovirulent BHV-1.1 and neurovirulent BHV-5 infections are distinguished by their differential neuropathogenesis (14). Following intranasal inoculation, BHV-5 invades the brain via the olfactory pathway,
resulting in acute neurological signs that are comparable to
those seen in calves. Virus antigen and neuronal damage are
located in the affected rabbit's brain within the areas connected through the olfactory pathway. These are olfactory
bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform/entorhinal cortex,
frontal/cingulate cortex, hippocampus/dentate gyrus, amygdala, dorsal raphe (DR), and locus coeruleus (LC) (36). These
rabbits also have a few infected neurons (5 to 10/field) in the
TG; however, further invasion of the virus to the pontine and

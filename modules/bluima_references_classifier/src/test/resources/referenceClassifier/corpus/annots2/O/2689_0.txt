CNS of the E l 2 embryo express N-cadherin. The highest levels of N-cadherin expression are observed in the
areas with the highest cellular compaction, mainly in
the ventricular, proliferative zone of the neuroepithelium. In the marginal zone, differentiating cells also
express N-cadherin, albeit more weakly. Similar observations were made in all other CNS regions examined.
In general, regions developing later, for example, the
cerebellum (cbl.cort.;Fig. 6 0 , also show a delayed ex-pression of N-cadherin.
During the ensuing phase (about E l 6 to postnatal
day 6 [P6]) when more neural cells have differentiated
and fiber tracts are forming, N-cadherin expression is
moderate and mostly restricted to particular subsets of
nuclei and neuronal cell layers (see below). In the adult
brain, no N-cadherin expression is seen, except in a few
regions where low levels of N-cadherin expression persist, e.g., in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Purk,
Fig. 4F,G) and in the olfactory bulb (data not shown).
The expression of N-cadherin in the ventricular zone
at early stages and during the initial formation of nu-clei suggests that neuronal progenitors and differentiating neurons express N-cadherin mRNA. This conclusion is supported by immunostaining results from
chickbrain(Rediesetal.,1993)showingthatoutgrowing axons express the N-cadherin protein. Based on the
present results, we cannot draw firm conclusions on
whether glial cells and/or their precursors also express
N-cadherin. The answer to this question requires a
more detailed study in the future.
Results from the present study show that, in general,
the expression of N-cadherin in the mouse brain is similartothatobservedinthebrainofthechicken(Redies
et al., 1993) and the frog (Simonneau et al., 1992). In
all three species, an early phase of ubiquitous expression and a later phase of topographically restricted ex-pression in particular brain regions are observed at
corresponding developmental stages.
In chicken, N-cadherin plays a role in neurulation
and it is expressed in the neuroepithelium from the
beginning of its formation. In the present study, these

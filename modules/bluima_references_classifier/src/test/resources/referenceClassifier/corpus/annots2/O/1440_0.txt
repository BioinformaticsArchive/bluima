the reduction of beclin 1 expression. Overall, these results support the
role of Beclin 1-regulated long lived protein turnover in the catabolism
of expanded poly(Q).
Beclin 1 has been shown to regulate autophagy in mammalian cells
(19). To examine the effect of Beclin 1 on autophagosome formation in
H4 cells, we first used the appearance of the phosphatidylethanolamineconjugated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3
(LC3-II) as a marker of autophagy activation. The microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-I) is a mammalian ortholog of Apg8/
Aut7/Atg8, an essential protein for autophagy in yeast (28). LC3-II, a
phosphatidylethanolamine-modified form of LC3-I, is specifically localized to the autophagosomal membrane, and the generation of LC3-II is
an early and critical step in the formation of autophagosomes (28, 29).
GFP-LC3 has been used as a marker for the intracellular levels of autophagy (15). We transfected H4 cells with an expression vector of GFPLC3, and the levels of GFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes after rapamycin stimulation were determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3E).
The levels of GFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes were significantly
lower in Becn1 KD H4 cells than that of control (pSRP only, 1.10 1.24
(mean S.D.); pSRP plus rapamycin, 3.80 1.31; Becn1 KD only,
0.85 1.10; Becn1 KD plus rapamycin, 1.35 1.52; p 0.01 pSRP plus
rapamycin versus Becn1 KD plus rapamycin, n 6; *, p 0.01 between
pSRP plus rapamycin and Becn1 KD plus rapamycin, analysis of variance; Fig. 3E). We also determined the levels of LC3-II by Western blot
and densitometric analysis (1647 for pSRP only, 1287 for Becn1 KD,
2315 for pSRP plus rapamycin, and 1947 for Becn1 KD plus rapamycin
(arbitrary units); Fig. 3F). Although a significant amount of basal LC3-II
was still present in Becn1 KD H4 cells, which is consistent with the fact
that yeast atg6 is not required for Apg8-PE formation (31), the level of
endogenous LC3-II after rapamycin stimulation was lower in Becn1 KD
H4 cells than that of control H4 cells (Fig. 3F). From these findings, we
concluded that the reduction of beclin 1 expression in H4 cells led to a
defect in autophagosome formation.
Mutant Htt-N-terminal Fragments Have a Negative Effect on Beclin
1-mediated Protein Degradationâ€”Our studies demonstrate that a Beclin
1-regulated autophagy pathway plays an important role in regulating
intracellular levels of Htt with expanded poly(Q). Because the accumulation of expanded poly(Q) is a hallmark of polyglutamine expansion
diseases, we suspected that expanded poly(Q) might have a negative
effect on Beclin 1-mediated protein turnover that in turn may promote
and exacerbate the accumulation and oligomerization of expanded
poly(Q). To examine this possibility, we first determined the rate of long
lived protein turnover in H4 cells transfected with a control vector or
expression vectors for Htt 171-Q17, Htt 171-Q68, and Q79 alone, or
along with beclin 1 expression vector. A significant reduction in the rate
of long lived protein turnover was detected after the cells were trans-

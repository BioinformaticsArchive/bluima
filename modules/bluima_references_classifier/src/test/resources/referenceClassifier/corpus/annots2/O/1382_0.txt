Stimulating microwires

Our major goal was to stimulate the RST for 1 h, to examine the
stimulation-induced changes in regeneration. However, long-duration
supramaximal stimulation of the RST was technically much more
difficult to achieve than with the peripheral nerves (Brushart et al.,
2002). We initially attempted to place a conventional stimulating wire
(250 lm silver wire) over the RST on the dorsolateral surface of the
cord, and stimulated at 20 Hz at intensities adequate to activate the
RST. However, this regime induced very large vibrations in the animal
because most of the current spread to nearby roots and produced direct
muscle contractions. Thus, movement of the animal relative to the
electrode made consistent stimulation impossible and damaged the
spinal cord. Even by using a stereotaxic frame, vertebral clamps and
fine tungsten stimulating electrodes, we could not stabilize the animal
adequately to avoid damage to the spinal cord during this 20-Hz
supramaximal stimulation.
Thus, to stimulate the RST we adopted a flexible fine-wire
stimulation method that has been proven to work without producing
major spinal cord injury. That is, the red nucleus was activated via
antidromic stimulation of the cervical RST using flexible microwire
electrodes developed by Prochazka et al. (1976). These stimulating
microwire implants are made from 30-lm-diameter PtIr (80%
platinum, 20% iridium) wire (California Fine Wire, CA, USA)
insulated with 4 lm of polyimide. Under a dissecting microscope, the
stimulating end of the wire was stripped of insulation up to 300 lm
from the end and a tip was cut at a 30 angle. A 90 bend was made
1.0 mm from the stimulating tip so the epidural portion would lie flat
on the dura mater and control the depth of penetration. Approximate
impedance for these electrodes was 5â€“20 kW.
A major disadvantage of using microwires is that their tips are so
small that current densities near the tips are very high during
stimulation, which can potentially lead to electrolytic tissue damage.
In preliminary trials, we stimulated the RST with monophasic current
pulses (0.1 ms, 300 lA). However, we found that there were lesions
in the tissue observed in subsequent histology, even though stimulation was adjusted to a physiological level that would maximally recruit
the axons in the RST. Furthermore, when the microwire tip was
directly observed in saline under a microscope during prolonged
20-Hz stimulation, the tip clearly oxidized and produced gas bubbles

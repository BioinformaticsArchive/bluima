this reinforces the physiological data that neither NGF nor
CGRP fibers directly alter the sympathetic discharge in re-sponse to noxious CRD but does not rule out the likelihood that
noxious stimuli applied to the T5/6 dermatome would augment
autonomic dysreflexia to some extent.
Compared with T5/6 NGF Adts injections, similar CGRP
fiber distribution was seen throughout T13/L1 (n 9) and L6/S1
(n 8) dorsal columns and gray matter with NGF overexpression, including lamina X surrounding the central canal (Fig.
6 A, B). An ANOVA across the critical spinal levels (T13/L1, L6/
S1) and treatment groups (GFP, NGF, Sema3a Adts) revealed a
significant difference in the extent of CGRP fiber density in the
dorsal horns (F(4,38) 21.107; p 0.001). In rats injected with
GFP Adts into T13/L1 (n 5) or L6/S1 (n 9) spinal cord
segments, the CGRP areal coverage in the dorsal gray matter
chosen for quantification (Fig. 6 A, B) was 10 â€“13%, respectively (Fig. 7). Compared with GFP controls, NGF overexpression significantly increased CGRP fiber immunoreactivity up to
20% at T13/L1 and L6/S1 segments (Fig. 7).
The distribution of CGRP fibers in Sema3a Adts-injected
L6/S1 cords (n 14) generally appeared similar to GFP Adts
controls (Fig. 6 B). However, immunostaining in the dorsal horns
was less evident, particularly in the deeper laminas (Fig. 6C).
Quantitatively, the spatial extent of CGRP staining in the lumbosacral dorsal horns was significantly reduced compared with
GFP controls (Fig. 7), demonstrating that Sema3a overexpression decreased the amount of local spontaneous CGRP fiber
sprouting into the spinal cord after T4 spinal transection.
The combined physiological and histological data indicate
that after complete spinal cord injury, the site-directed overexpression of NGF in lumbosacral spinal levels significantly in-creased both CRD-evoked dysreflexic hypertension and CGRP
fiber sprouting, whereas overexpression of Sema3a significantly
reduced sprouting and hypertension. Quantitatively, there was a
significant positive correlation between the extent of CGRP
fiber distribution in the thoracolumbar or lumbosacral spinal
levels and the severity of autonomic dysreflexia among GFP,
NGF, and Sema3a Adts-injected groups (Fig. 8).
Similar quantification of substance P (SP ) fiber densities in
the dorsal horns of adjacent sections (Fig. 9) revealed a significant
difference across treatment groups between spinal levels
(F(4,38) 8.901; p 0.01). Whereas NGF overexpression at
T13/L1 and L6/S1 significantly increased SP fiber density by
50% compared with GFP Adts controls (Fig. 9), Sema3a Adts
injections did not lower SP immunoreactivity in lumbosacral
levels below that of the normal density. This is similar to our
previous observations demonstrating that Sema3a does not in-duce retraction of established (normal) fiber densities but only
prevents the sprouting of these axons (Tang et al., 2004). Moreover, extremely low baseline values of SP fiber immunoreactive
densities in GFP Adts-injected spinal cords ( 4%), more than
twofold less compared with CGRP (compare with Fig. 7), make
such comparisons difficult. In addition, the high degree of variability in thresholding of extremely punctate SP fiber immunostaining in cross sections also prevents precise interpretation of
Sema3a overexpression on SP fiber density.

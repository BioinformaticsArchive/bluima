sion of -catenin and p35 by 1.3- to 1.7-fold in both the NAc and
the CPu of wild-type mice, whereas such increases were attenuated in f/f–Fos–D1–Cre mice (Fig. 5 A, B) ( p 0.05). Cdk5 ex-pression was different by 1.3-fold in the two groups of mice after
28 d but not 7 d of cocaine injections (Fig. 5 A, B). Basal expression of the three genes was also identical in the two groups of mice
(Fig. 5 A, B) ( p 0.05).
To examine further whether Fos regulates Grin1 (NR1), Gria2
(GluR2), Ctnnb ( -catenin), Cdk5r1 ( p35), and Cdk5 expression,
we transfected three cell lines with Fos and measured the endogenous expression of these genes. Consistent with those observed
in vivo, an increasing level of c-Fos increased the expression of
Grin1, Gria2, Ctnnb, and Cdk5r1 in vitro (Fig. 5C). Together,
these results indicate that c-Fos regulates the expression of these
target genes both in vivo and in vitro.

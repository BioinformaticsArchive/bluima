as the endogenous LC3 in the transgenic
mouse brain (Mizushima et al., 2004). The
direct fluorescence of GFP–LC3 was de-tected in CNS neurons of many brain re-gions, including cerebellar Purkinje cells
(Fig. 1 A) (supplemental Fig. 1 A, available
at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental ma-terial). To monitor autophagic activity un-der neurodegenerative conditions, we
generated Lurcher mice producing GFP–
LC3 by a genetic cross between the Lurcher
and GFP–LC3 transgenic strains (termed
GFP–LC3/Lurcher hereafter). At P10, a
striking enhancement of overall green fluorescence, characterized by the presence of
a large number of green “foci,” was ob-served in the area of DCN and Purkinje cell
axon tracts of GFP–LC3/Lurcher mice
compared with GFP–LC3 transgenic mice
(Fig. 1 A1,A2). When examined at a high
magnification, these green fluorescent foci
appear to be in the shape of “bulbs” or
“torpedoes” either directly attached to or
in close proximity to the somata of the
deep cerebellum nuclei (Fig. 1 A3,A4 ). Im-munostaining using anti-calbindin antibody revealed that these foci are primarily
calbindin positive, demonstrating that
they are Purkinje cell axons (Fig. 1 B).
These swollen Purkinje cell axons were
also labeled by an antibody raised against
phosphorylated Tau (AT8) (Fig. 1C), indicating that they were indeed dystrophic
and in the process of degeneration. Our
results demonstrated that the Lurcher mu-tation triggered the accumulation of the
autophagic marker GFP–LC3 in the ax-onal dystrophic swellings of degenerating
Purkinje cells, features that were possibly
associated with altered autophagic
activity.

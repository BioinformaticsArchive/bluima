dence of a profound retardation of cell loss when compared
with rats that had been fed ad libitum and is in good
accordance with the present demonstration of maintained
pineal function.
One general correlate of aging appears to be a widespread decline in the tissue responsiveness to catecholamines. There is considerable evidence indicating that
adrenergic neural control, especially of cardiac function but
also in the brain, is decreased with age14'53.Although some
workers have failed to demonstrate any decline in the pineal
gland fl-receptor density with age8, this has been observed
byothers15'6Â°.SincetheactivityofpinealNATiscontrolled
by noradrenaline secreted rhythmically from the sympathetic fibers within the pineal gland, a reduction in catecholamine responsiveness could explain the age-related
decline in NAT and thus melatonin production.
To our knowledge, pineal functions have previously only
been studied during short-term restriction of food intake,
ranging from a few hours of fasting to 4 weeks of reduced
food availability. In general, the pineal gland responds to
such treatments with reduced activity, including reduced
sensitivity to catecholaminergic stimulation7, as well as
lowered NAT activity6J and melatonin production6'52.In
the present study we have estimated pineal activity at two
ages, i.e. 3 and 28 months. Two possibilities, therefore, exist
as to how pineal function may have responded to chronic
food restriction. After an initial depression, which lasts for
at least 4 weeks7, pineal activity may have increased to
normal and then gradually declined with age, but slower
than in chronically, ad libitum fed rats. Another possibility
is that the activity of the pineal gland was actually lower in
food-restricted than in ad libitum fed rats much of the time
between 3 and 28 months of age, but that in old age, the
level of melatonin production was maintained in foodrestricted animals while it declined in ad libitum fed rats.
The question then arises if there exists any causal connection between reduced pineal activity for an extended period
of life and maintained activity in old age, or if both
conditions are independent of food restriction.

GABAergic projecting neurons in the PBN complex, it
is unlikely that the glutamate-containing neurons in
the PBN complex are GABAergic in nature.
Depending on the stimulus intensity (3, 26, 47) and
concentration of the excitatory amino acid used (3, 31,
47), activation of the PBN promoted differential effects
on SAP and HR that range from no change to an
increase in these hemodynamic parameters. To minimize possible confounding interference with the transient hypertension that we used to activate the baroreceptors, the concentration of L-Glu (1 nmol) used in this
study was lowered to elicit no significant effect on SAP
and HR. We found in our preliminary experiments that,
at higher doses (5 or 10 nmol), microinjection of L-Glu
into the PBN resulted in an increase in MSAP (+9.6 6
4.5 or +14.5 6 6.3 mmHg, respectively) and HR
(+9.0 6 6.3 or +12.4 6 5.6 beats/min, respectively).
These results are consistent with previous reports (3,
31, 47).
We are aware that the pharmacological method we
used to evaluate BRR control of HR has limited application on the threshold and maximal capacity of the
reflex. Because they could be affected separately, the
possibility that glutamatergic inputs from PBN to
RVLM may modulate these parameters differentially
cannot be ruled out. In addition, because phenylephrine may activate low-pressure receptors in the atria
and ventricles, the significance of the glutamatergic
projections to the RVLM from the PBN on the reflex
mechanism induced by activation of low-pressure receptors may be underestimated. We also recognize that,
because the present study did not examine reflex
tachycardia in response to a decrease in SAP, the effect
of PBN on the other end of the BRR function curve, i.e.,
BRR control of sympathetic activity, is unknown. In
this regard, Hayward and Felder (16) reported recently
that PBN neurons reduce the capacity of BRR regulation of sympathetically mediated increases in SAP.
Whether the glutamatergic input from the PBN to
RVLM is involved in this process, however, awaits
further investigation.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that
glutamatergic descending projections to the RVLM
ipsilaterally from the ventrolateral regions and the KF
subnucleus of the PBN complex may participate in
central regulation of cardiovascular functions by exerting an inhibitory modulation of the cardiac baroreflex
response. Furthermore, such an inhibitory modulation
on BRR response may take place by activating both
NMDA and non-NMDA receptors at the RVLM.

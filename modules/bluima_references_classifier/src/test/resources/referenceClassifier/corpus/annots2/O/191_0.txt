Perfusion and ligand injection. As a TRP ligand, the cockroach peptide
LemTRP-4, which differs from CabTRP-Ia by only one amino acid
residue (a Met6 to Leu6 change) in a region likely to be unimportant for
receptor binding and activation (N ̈assel, 1999), was used. During ligand
injection the lamina and photoreceptors were perfused with crayfish
saline at a rate of 0.1 ml/sec. GABA at 0.1 or 1.0 mM and TRP at 1 or 10
μM were delivered to photoreceptor terminals in the lamina with pressure injection via separate capillaries with 10 –15 μm tips. Injection
volumes of 0.01–1.0 μl were controlled by pulse pressure and duration.
To minimize desensitization, GABA volumes were adjusted to elicit
nonsaturating responses, and injection frequency was set to 1 injection/30
sec. TRP was either injected in nanoliter volumes or perfused over the
lamina via continuous injection at 2–5 μl/min.
Recording procedures and data anal ysis. Recording electrodes were
filled with 3 M K +-acetate and selected for resistance (;100 MV) and
speed (time constant <0.1 msec after capacity compensation). Photoreceptors were typically impaled in the distal retina in the relatively large
soma–rhabdomere region. A few recordings were made in the axons close
to the terminals.
Receptor signals were led to an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) that was switched between bridge mode, discontinuous current clamp, and discontinuous voltage clamp. In discontinuous modes, current injection and voltage measurements alternated
during a 2.0 msec duty cycle (500 Hz sampling rate). Because the
membrane time constant varies between 50 msec (in the dark) and 20
msec (light adapted), the switching period is sufficiently fast to resolve all
photoreceptor signals. The amplifier bandwidth was direct current to 30
kHz. Input resistance measurements were performed in discontinuous
current clamp with currents of -0.1 to -0.3 nA, and the light-elicited
responses were measured in either bridge mode or discontinuous voltageclamp mode.
Responses were digitized at 500 Hz via an analog-to-digital board and
a 486 personal computer. To assess the reliability of the responses, visual
stimuli and ligand applications were typically repeated five times, and the
responses to each condition were averaged. E xcept where noted, data
used in measurements and shown in the figures represent the averages of
five or more responses that were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz after
averaging. The SD of the averaged data rarely exceeded 610% of the
mean response for visual stimuli and current pulses and was typically
approximately 620% of the mean for TRP- and GABA-elicited
responses.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Simulations

The computer simulations using the SV and MV models
showed that focal susceptibility changes affect areas in
the image that extend far beyond the area of change in
the object. This was the case for both TE and TACQ
effects, each resulting in significant contributions to the
PSF outside the central area (central voxel). The character of the image-intensity changes depended strongly on
experimental parameters and was different for SPI and
EPI experiments. An example of the TACQ effect is
shown in Figure 1a and b for the MV model and in Fig.
1c and d for the SV model with the vessel running
parallel to the static magnetic field. Note that the
intensity changes affect many voxels outside the (central) voxel where the susceptibility changes occur. An

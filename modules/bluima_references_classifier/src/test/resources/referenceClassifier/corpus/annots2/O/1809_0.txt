Fig. 5. Excitation of mNTS neurons by MCH. In each panel, top trace: MAP (mm Hg), 2nd trace: neuronal firing rate (spikes/s), and 3rd trace: neuronal
action potentials ( V). (A) Basal firing rate of this neuron was eight spikes/s. Increase in MAP induced by PE (3 g/kg, i.v.) elicited an increase in the
neuronal activity (46 spikes/s) indicating that the neuron was barosensitive. (B) When the neuronal firing returned close to basal level (eight spikes/s),
pressure micro-application (4 nl) of L-Glu (5 mM) directly to the neuron increased its firing (58 spikes/s) which lasted for about 0.8 s. (C) When the
neuronal firing returned close to the basal level (10 spikes/s), pressure micro-application (4 nl) of MCH (0.5 mM) increased the neuronal firing
(28 spikes/s) which lasted for about 0.8 s. When the neuronal firing returned to the basal level (10 spikes/s), MCH-1 receptor antagonist (2 mM) was
applied (4 nl) (large arrow between panels C and D); no change in neuronal firing was elicited (not shown). (D) Subsequent pressure micro-application
(4 nl) of MCH (0.5 mM) to the neuron failed to elicit an increase in neuronal firing.

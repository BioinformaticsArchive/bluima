Fig. 3. Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid immunoreactivity in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The results are expressed as means ± SEM of five–six
observations and represent the mean density of the bands for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid immunoreactivity measured in unstressed control rats (control)
and rats that were placed on an elevated platform for 1 h on 1–20 days. Significantly different from control: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.

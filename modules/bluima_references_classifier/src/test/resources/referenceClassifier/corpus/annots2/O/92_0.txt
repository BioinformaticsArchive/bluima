of the somatosensory pathway. A `tonic' centrifugal gating
may in fact occur in PD patients with akinetic-rigid
syndrome even during apparent relaxation [14], although
we did not recorded any muscular activity.
These findings are of particular interest if compared with
those reported by Rossini et al. [22,24,25] who studied
upper limb SEPs in parkinsonian patients. They found an
attenuation of the median-derived pre-central P22-N30
potential (but not of the N20 potential) which was reversed
by apomorphine administration and paralleled by amelioration of the clinical symptoms. This result has not been
replicated by other authors who found a reduced P22-N30
potential in only a small number of patients without any
correlation with clinical impairment [5,6,16].
Our findings validate Rossini's observations, particularly

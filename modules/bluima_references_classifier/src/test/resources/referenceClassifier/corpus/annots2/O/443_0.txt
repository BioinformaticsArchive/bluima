(Daluge et al., 1997). Figure 6 also confirms that there was
little dissociation of the 14C label from abacavir during its
passage through the cerebral circulation and that intact drug
was presented to the luminal membranes of the barriers.
Abacavir (300 mg) is administered to HIV-infected patients
twice daily (Kumar et al., 1999). Furthermore, the mean
human plasma abacavir concentration after this dose has
been administered is twice the 50% inhibitory concentration
in HIV-1 clinical isolates for over 6 h (IC50 0.26 M; Daluge
et al., 1997; Kumar et al., 1999). The transfer constant for the
cerebrum uptake of [14C]abacavir was 9.3 l/min/g and was
used to calculate a theoretical flux for abacavir entry into the
mammalian brain (4.8 pmol/min/g) and estimate that it
would take 55 min for abacavir to reach an effective brain
concentration (i.e., 0.26 M). It is important to note that this
modeling does not consider abacavir distribution into target
cells within the brain, kinetics of intracellular phosphorylation, disposition of the active metabolite (carbovir triphos-

Introduction
Guided only by reward and penalty information, animals can
adapt their behaviors so that maximal rewards are obtained in the
long run, even in unfamiliar and stochastic environments. This
reward-based behavioral learning problem has been modeled in
several ways (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Breiter et al., 2001). The
central learning algorithm in the reinforcement learning models
changes behaviors in proportion to reward prediction errors.
Some computational models have proposed that the signal transmission in the striatum is modified by synaptic plasticity for be-havioral learning, while being guided by reward prediction error
conveyed by midbrain dopamine neurons (Houk et al., 1995). In
their pioneering work, Hollerman and Schultz (1998) have accumulated compelling evidence that dopamine neurons in the
monkey midbrain encode reward prediction errors. Human im-aging studies have revealed that the activity in the ventral striatum and putamen (Berns et al., 2001; Breiter et al., 2001; McClure
et al., 2003; O'Doherty et al., 2003) is correlated with the reward
prediction errors in classical conditioning tasks.

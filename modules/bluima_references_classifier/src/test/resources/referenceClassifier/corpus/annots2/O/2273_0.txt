METHODS
Twenty-one adult mongrel dogs of both sexes (17-25
kg) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/
kg iv). Dogs were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide
(l-3 mg) and ventilated with a positive pressure respirator (Harvard respiration pump 607). Tidal volume and
respiratory rate were adjusted to give an alveolar (end
expiratory) CO2 content of 4%, as monitored by a CO2
gas analyzer (Beckman LB2). The CO2 analyzer was
calibrated regularly with mixtures of CO2 in air analyzed
to a precision of 0.1%. Dissection to expose both femoral
arteries and veins and both omocervical arteries was

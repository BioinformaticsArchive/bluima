The transcription factor Pax6 is expressed in precursor
cells during embryonic CNS development, and it plays
an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation
and neuronal fate determination. Pax6-expressing cells
are also present in the adult hippocampal dentate
gyrus and subventricular zone/rostral migratory stream,
regions in which neuronal precursors exist during adult
life. In the adult dentate gyrus, precursor cells are
located in the innermost portion of the granule cell
layer, and Pax6-expressing nuclei are most abundant in
this region. To examine the putative role of Pax6 in
adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we have studied the
proliferative activity, distribution, and phenotype of
Pax6-expressing cells by using immunohistochemistry.
Our results indicate that Pax6 is intensely expressed in
proliferating precursors of the adult dentate gyrus.
Pax6 is also expressed in nonproliferating cells, which
may correspond to resting progenitor cells and to granule neurons in their very early developmental stages,
because this transcription factor is strongly down-regulated during granule neuron differentiation. However, a
small subpopulation of hilar mature neurons and certain
astrocytes of the adult hippocampus also express
Pax6. Although the precise roles of this transcription
factor in the adult brain remain to be determined, our
findings support the idea that its function in the control
of cell proliferation and neuronal fate determination during embryogenesis is also operative in the adult hippocampus. However, the expression of Pax6 in astrocytes
and certain mature neurons may indicate the existence
of other roles for this transcription factor in this telencephalic region. V 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

from site to site. Vocalization was usually associated with
excitation of the TA, CT, EO, IO, IIC, and D. The timing
of the onset, peak, and offset of activity in the various muscles varied from site to site. Further, vocalization evoked
from the NRA was associated with a high level of tonic or
continuous discharge in the CT, IO, EO, and IIC muscles
on which the expiratory-phased activation was superimposed
(CT and IO illustrated, Fig. 4). At many sites (23 of 30) the
inspiratory D burst was superimposed on a tonic activation as
illustrated in Fig. 4. Although it is conceivable that this result
may have been associated with electrical contamination of
the D recording by adjacent chest wall muscles active during
expiration, for many of the same experiments and electrode
placements tonic activity was never seen in D during PAGevoked vocalization. In contrast, the TA muscle showed only
phasic expiratory activity (Fig. 5). The GG muscle was only
occasionally active, and the DG was almost never active
during NRA-evoked vocalization ( Fig. 5 ) . Expiratoryphased PCA activity was observed in 7 of 20 vocalization
sites, with inactivity or inhibition of PCAE during the vocalization period at the remaining sites.
The unusual quality of NRA-evoked vocalization was not
related to the dose of DLH injection. In those experiments
in which larger doses of DLH were injected into the NRA
( 15- 120 nl) , the pattern of EMG activity and the quality of
vocalization were unchanged and very different from those

An important pharmacokinetic characteristic of nicotine metabolites is that their brain residence times are significantly longer than
that of nicotine (Ghosheh et al., 1999). The latter study reported the
half-lives of cotinine and nornicotine to be 333 and 166 min, respectively, compared with 52 min for nicotine. Consequently, these me-tabolites have the potential to accumulate in rat brain to a larger extent
than nicotine following repeated nicotine administration. Thus, prolonged, intermittent administration of nicotine, as is the case with
chronic tobacco use, may result in pharmacologically relevant brain
concentrations of these slow-effluxing metabolites. Considering the
chronicity of nicotine exposure during tobacco smoking, the potential
for accumulation of pharmacologically active nicotine metabolites is
of importance for explaining the prolonged effects of tobacco smoking (e.g., tolerance and dependence). Metabolite accumulation could
contribute to the central effects that result from peripheral nicotine
exposure. Typically, a chronic smoker uses tobacco every 20 to 30
min with intermittent inhalation of mainstream smoke. Thus, delivery
of nicotine to the brain during tobacco smoking constitutes intermit-

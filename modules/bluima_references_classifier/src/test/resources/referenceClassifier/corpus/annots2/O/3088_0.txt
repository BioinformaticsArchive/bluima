suggests that receptors would be present in grafts. It cannot be
excluded, however, that a humoral signal from the host to the
graft mediates indirect effects of the injections. In addition, al-though the dose of melatonin used (25 μg) is commonly used in
reproductive studies, such an injection produces serum levels
three orders of magnitude above physiological levels (May wood
et al., 1993). Thus it is not known whether the entrainment
observed here is a physiological effect of melatonin.
In contrast to the effects of injections given immediately after
transplantation, a second set of injections given 6 weeks after
transplantation had no measurable effect on the phase of the
rhythms. Although it is possible that melatonin injections given
over >5 d could at some phases cause entrainment, any such
effect on established grafts would have to be much smaller than
the effects on perinatal grafts. That is, it is likely that the melatonin injections given immediately after transplantation fell at a
wide range of phases of the oscillations generated within the
grafts; melatonin was given at two times of day, and the phases of
oscillations within different grafts were likely to have been initially scattered, because they came from fetuses of SC N-lesioned
dams (Davis and Gorski, 1988). Despite this wide range of initial
phases, the groups became clustered after only 7 d of injections.
Thus in at least some of the grafts large phase shifts must have
been produced. In contrast, no phase shifts in response to five
melatonin injections were observed when given 6 weeks after
transplantation.
The apparent loss in sensitivity to melatonin in grafts is consistent with a loss observed in hamster pups; entrainment of
hamster pups can be achieved with injections on P1–P5 but not

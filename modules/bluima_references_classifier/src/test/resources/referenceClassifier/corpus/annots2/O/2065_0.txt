other local circuit neuronsby usingVVA in combination with
electrophysiology. Differences in the postsynaptic targets of
GalNacmand GalNac+ cell types suggeststhat the expressionof
the GalNac-containing moleculesmay be related to specific
functionaldifferences.Thechandeliercellswerethemostdistinctive GABAergic cell type which did not expressGalNac.
The synaptic projections of chandeliercells are highly specific
for the initial segmentsof pyramidal cell axons(Somogyi, 1979;
Fairen and Valverde, 1980; Somogyi et al., 1982). Thus, the
chandelier cells' highly specific projections would allow them
to control the output of groupsof nearby pyramidal cells.The
postsynaptic targets of the chandelier cells are very different
fromthebasketorneurogliaformcells,whichterminateoncell
bodies,dendritic shafts, or spinesof both pyramidal and nonpyramidal cortical neurons(Somogyi, 1986).
Severalroleshavebeenhypothesizedforthebasketandneurogliaform cells. Both have beenimplicated in sharpeningreceptivefieldproperties,althoughthebasketcellsarethoughtto
act over longerdistances(Jones,1984;Koch, 1987;Hata et al.,
1988).Inhibition betweenbasketcellsmay enhanceorientation
selectivity; in a recent cross-correlationanalysis,it wasshown
that horizontal inhibitory interactions exist between pairs of
visual cortical neuronswith somewhatdifferent orientation preferences,but not betweenneuronswith orthogonal orientation
preferences(Hata et al., 1988). The cell pairs forming these
inhibitory connectionsweresituatedlessthan 1mmawayfrom
each other, in layers 4, 5, and 6. Hata et al. were probably
recordingfrompairsofbasketcellssimilartothoseinFigure6
whichextendedcollaterals300-700pmthroughlayer4(seealso
Somogyiet al., 1983).Theseresultsindicate that GalNac+basket
cells may be involved in enhancingorientation selectivity. It
would beinterestingto determinewhether the GalNac-containing moleculeson the surfacesof basketcellsprovide a molecular
mechanismfor stabilizing synaptic connectionsbetweenpairs
of basketcellswith slightly different orientations.
The neurogliaform cells are lesswell known, but they have
also been implicated in sharpeningreceptive field properties.
Joneshasspeculatedthat the vertical axonsof basketcellsmight
control the flow of visual signalsfrom layer 4 to the supra-and
infragranular layers within a singleorientation column, while
thelocalconnectionsofneurogliaformcellswouldsharpenthe
boundaries between columns (Jones, 1984). 2-Deoxyglucose
studiesin the visual cortex have shownthat orientation columns
aremappedinasystemofparallelbands(Lowe1etal.,1987).
Variations in the thicknessof thesebandsgives them a beaded
appearance,when viewed tangentially in flat mounts of the vi-sualcortex. It is not yet clearhow thesebandsareformed during
ontogeny or what leadsto this beadedorganization. One possibilityisthatneurogliaformcellsmayhaveanonuniformdistribution acrossthe visual cortex and that clustersof this cell
type lead to variations in orientation column thicknesses.
It is also possiblethat the expressionof GalNac-containing
cell surfacemoleculesis related to a particular extrinsic afferent
fiber system.Previouswork hasshownthat separatesetsof local
circuit neurons in layer 4 are contacted by either the X- or
Y-geniculocortical fibers. GABAergic neurons in layer 4 that
received contacts from X-type geniculocortical afferents were
considerably smaller(averagediameter, 15pm) than thosethat
received Y-type inputs (averagediameter, 24 Km) (Freund et
al., 1985b).Our findings indicate that GalNac is not expressed
selectively on neuronsthat arepostsynapticto only oneof these

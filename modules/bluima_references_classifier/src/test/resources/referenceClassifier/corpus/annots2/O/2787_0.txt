fibulin-1 and -2 were quite distinct in most tissues of

of expression patterns of the fibulins during this em-bryonic period, adjacent parallel sections of 13dpc em-bryos probed with the different oligonucleotides were
analyzed. Fibulin-1 mRNA was detected in a large proportion of mesenchyme derived from mesoderm (Fig.
3A,B), such as mesenchymal cells in the developing
lung, intestine, kidney, and other connective tissues
throughout the body. Prominent expression was noted
in tongue, intestine, and some parts of the central and
peripheral nervous system.
The expression of fibulin-2 mRNA was more re-stricted than the expression of fibulin-1 mRNA (Fig.
4A,B). Fibulin-2 mRNA expression was prominent in
the developing cartilage, particularly in the region of
the nasal septum, mandible, larynx, and thyroid. During the development of vertebral and femur cartilage,
fibulin-2 mRNA was located in the perichondrium surrounding the cartilage. Strong expression was also
found in smooth muscle of the descending aorta. In
addition, fibulin-2 mRNA was expressed uniformly by
the outermost connective tissue that forms demarcations between individual tissues. Thus, it was seen in
the thin capsule-like connective tissue sheaths which
cover the heart, lung, liver, and kidney. Both fibulin-1
and -2 mRNA were expressed particularly well in tissues derived from the neural crest mesenchyme. For
example, in the facial mesenchyme, strong expression
for both fibulins was noted in developing palate and
larynx.

All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986
(86/609/EEC). The experimental protocols were carried out in
compliance with institutional ethical committee guidelines for an-imal research, and all efforts were made to minimize the number
of animals used and their suffering. C57/Bl6 mice aged postnatal
days 20 –32 were killed by decapitation under halothane anesthesia and 400 m-thick parasagittal slices were cut. They included
part of the striatum, the GP, the STN and the SN and their main
connections when cut at an angle of 10 2° (Fig. 1). This method
generated one slice per hemisphere where most of BG nuclei and
their connections were well preserved. For the slicing procedure,
the solution contained (in mM) 110 choline, 2.5 KCl, 1.25

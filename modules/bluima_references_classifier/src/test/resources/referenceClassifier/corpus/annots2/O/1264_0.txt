striking observations illustrate this concept. First, patients suffering
from essential tremor, a condition in which the nigrostriatal pathway is
intact, were treated with l-DOPA for 9â€“21 years without the emergence
of dyskinesia (Rajput et al., 1997). Second, in patients with asymmetrical parkinsonism, LID tends to occur first and to be more severe on the
more affected side (Mones et al., 1971; Horstink et al., 1990). Moreover,
when treating MPTP-treated monkeys with l-DOPA, we obtained more
dyskinetic than non-dyskinetic animals (data not shown).
Our results suggest that a massive lesion is a necessary but not a
sufficient condition for LID appearance, raising the possibility that
other factors also play a role. Among these, one should first consider
the paradox of l-DOPA treatment being effective in PD. Under normal
circumstances, l-DOPA is decarboxylated to DA in striatal terminals
of DA neurons. The site of l-DOPA decarboxylation in the
parkinsonian brain remains, however, obscure, as most of striatal
DA terminals degenerate. It has been suggested that l-DOPA might be
taken up, decarboxylated and released as DA by serotonergic
terminals, striatal capillaries, noradrenergic neurons, and non-aminergic striatal interneurons and efferent neurons (Ng et al., 1970). The
shift from a positive response to l-DOPA to a response impaired by
dyskinesia, or other motor fluctuations, may represent the transfer of
the decarboxylation and release function to neurons or cells other than
surviving DA neurons. In a series of elegant experiments, Melamed
et al. refuted the involvement of serotonergic neurons and showed
that non-aminergic, striatal neurons convert most of the exogenous

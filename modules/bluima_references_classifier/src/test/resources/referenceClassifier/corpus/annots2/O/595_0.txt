by a one-way ANOVA to test for differences in ChAT or
PR mRNA levels between untreated animals (ovx) and
animals treated with estrogen (E), tamoxifen (Tmx) or
estrogen plus tamoxifen (E+Tmx). Post-hoc comparisons
were made using a Dunnett's Multiple Comparison test. As
there was no statistical difference between the ovx and
ovx+V animals (data not shown), these two groups were
combined and defined as the ovx group.

Emotional experiences are often better recalled than nonemotional ones (Christianson, 1992). For example, people show su-perior declarative memory for emotionally vivid segments of a
story, relative to emotionally neutral segments (Cahill et al., 1995;
Adolphs et al., 1997). The amygdala appears to play a critical role
in such an enhancement of emotional memory, because patients
with bilateral amygdala damage do not remember emotional
better than neutral story segments (Cahill et al., 1995; Adolphs et
al., 1997).
Imaging studies have shown that amygdala activation correlates
with emotional memory in the intact brain. Two positron emission tomography (PET) studies (C ahill et al., 1996; Hamann et
al., 1999) and one f unctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
study (C anli et al., 1999) reported significant correlations be-tween amygdala activation related to emotional stimuli and subsequent memory. In all three studies, individuals who showed
strong amygdala activation in response to a set of emotional
stimuli (relative to other study participants) also showed superior
memory for those stimuli (relative to other study participants).
Importantly, such correlations between amygdala activation and
subsequent memory were not observed for emotionally neutral
stimuli.
These first imaging studies have identified a correlation be-tween amygdala activation and declarative memory for emotional
stimuli across different individuals. This between-subjects study
design allows for at least three alternative interpretations of the
data. The first is that some individuals are more responsive to
emotional experiences than others. The observed amygdala activation therefore would reflect a tonic personality characteristic.
The second is that some individuals, during a particular scanning
session, may have been in some sort of state that enhanced
responsiveness to emotional experience. The third interpretation
is that the amygdala is responsive in a dynamic or phasic way to

A photograph of a slice used for recording is shown in Fig.
1A. The area used for recording is outlined by a circle. Figure
1B shows an infrared microscope image of a representative
layer V pyramidal neuron. The results of the present study
were obtained from 176 pyramidal neurons. These neurons
had a mean resting membrane potential, spike height, and
input resistance of 68.7 0.8 mV, 93.7 2.3 mV, and
286 29 M (n 62), respectively, which are comparable
with the values reported previously (Wang and O'Donnell,
2001). In all experiments, layer V pyramidal neurons were
held at a holding potential of 70 mV, and EPSCs were
evoked by the stimulation of layer II–III fibers with bipolarstimulating electrodes every 20 s in the presence of GABAA
receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (10 M). Because
EPSCs were completely blocked by CNQX (20 M) plus D-APV (50 M) (Fig. 1C), they were predominantly mediated by
ionotropic glutamate receptors.
Potentiation of EPSCs by cAMP. We initially examined
the effect of the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, on the
evoked EPSCs. Typical responses are shown in Fig. 2A. Bath
application of forskolin (25 M) produced a rapid and sustained enhancement of evoked EPSCs on layer V pyramidal
neurons. The mean EPSC slope measured 20 min after forskolin application was increased by 53.6 5.8% of the control
baseline (n 8; p 0.05, paired Student's t test). No significant recovery was visible after drug washout of at least
20-min intervals. The magnitude of EPSC potentiation by
forskolin was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B), with an
estimated EC50 value of 21 M. Because forskolin has been
reported to possess many cAMP-independent actions, including the blockade of several types of K conductance, it is
possible that the effect of forskolin on EPSCs is caused by its
nonspecificity (Laurenza et al., 1989). To exclude this possibility, an analog of forskolin, Dd-forskolin, which has no
effect on adenylyl cyclase but does mimic many of the cAMPindependent actions of forskolin, was used. As shown in Fig.
2A, Dd-forskolin (25 M) had no significant effect on EPSCs
(4.2 2.3%; n 4; p 0.05, paired Student's t test). As on
layer V pyramidal neurons, forskolin (25 M) also increased
the slope of EPSCs of layer II–III pyramidal neurons. The
mean EPSC slope 20 min after forskolin application was
increased by 48.7 6.9% of the control baseline (n 5; p
0.05, paired Student's t test) (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the facilitatory effect of forskolin on the layer V pyramidal neurons
was robust at P8-P10 but became weaker as animal maturated (Fig. 2D), with the magnitude of potentiation by forskolin (25 M) being 82.5 7.8% at P8–P10 (n 5), 53.6
5.8% at P14–P16 (n 10), and 32.8 4.2% at P21–P23 (n
5), indicating that the enhancement of synaptic transmission
by forskolin is age-dependent. In the present study, forskolin
was not observed to significantly change the holding current
under voltage-clamp conditions (16.2 2.2 pA for before and
19.3 3.1 pA for 20 min after forskolin application; n 35;
p 0.05, paired Student's t test).
Additional evidence that elevation of cAMP levels can in-duce a synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic transmission
on the layer V pyramidal neurons of mPFC came from exper-

Spinal unit activity was amplified, continuously displayed on an
oscilloscope (analogue delay), and discriminated from background with the aid of a window discriminator. Discriminated
signals were converted into pulses, displayed on-line with the use
of a chart recorder, and counted and saved by a computer. The
sampling time for each trial was 120 s, which included 10 s of
spontaneous activity, 30 s of ED, and 80 s post-ED. Before each
trial a 120-s sample of the spontaneous activity was taken (“control”). Responses to ED are presented as the increase in unit activity during ED minus the spontaneous activity of the corresponding 30-s period determined during the immediately preceding control period or as a decrease in spontaneous activity (in %) when
the effect of ED was inhibitory. These data were used to generate
peristimulus time histograms ( l-s binwidth) with conventional
computer programs off-line.
Stimulus-response functions (SRF) to graded ED were plotted
for each neuron, and a regression analysis of the linear part of the

Thalamic reticular neurons
The second neuronal population involved in thalamic
rhythm generation is RT/PGN neurons, which are contained in a shell-like nucleus that surrounds mainly
anterior and lateral aspects of the dorsal thalamus [11].
RT/PGN is composed entirely of inhibitory neurons [12]
that express T channels CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 [10]. The
properties of the RT/PGN T channels are subtly different
[13,14] from those expressed in TC cells and allow burst
firing under resting conditions. The T channels in RT/PGN
neurons seem to be primarily localized in dendrites (sites of
incoming excitatory synaptic activity) [15], and thus can
boost efferent signals to these cells, including those arriving from TC or cortical neurons. Knockout mice for CaV3.2
and CaV3.3 have not yet been reported, so the primary
mediator of burst firing in RT/PGN cells remains unknown.

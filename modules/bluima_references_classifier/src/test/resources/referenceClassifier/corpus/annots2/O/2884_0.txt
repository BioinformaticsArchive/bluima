ketanserin, as compared to baseline. The main effect of
DPAT on the intensity dependence of P25 was observed in
the 30-minute postdrug recording (mean effect across
subjects: 8.1 _ 8.0 vs 10.2 _ 8.9 ixV/10dB, p < 0.01),
that for ketanserin was found in the 2-minute postdrug
recording (mean effect across subjects: 8.8 _+ 8.6 vs 6.0 _
8.4 ixV/10dB, p < 0.001). The intensity dependence of the
N50-component was affected only by DOI in the 10- and
30-minute postdrug recording. The intensity dependence
of the P100-component was not influenced by any of the
applied serotonergic drugs.
Apomorphine reduced the intensity dependence of the
P25- and P100-components especially in the 30 minute
postdrug recording. Atropine caused a reversal from am-plitude increase to an amplitude decrease with increasing
intensity in the P100-component recorded 2 minutes after
drug injection. This effect disappeared in the 10 and 30
minute postdrug recordings. No consistent results were
found concerning the intensity dependence of the new
early positive component around 23ms emerging under the
effect of atropine. The intensity dependence of the N50component was unchanged by atropine and apomorphine.

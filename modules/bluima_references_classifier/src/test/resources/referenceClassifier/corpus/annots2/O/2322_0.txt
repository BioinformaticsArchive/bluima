74 T. HORI AND T. NAKA YAMA

Terminology. The terms 'thermo-sensitive neurones' or 'temperature-sensitive
neurones' have been generally used to describe the neurones which respond to small
changes in local brain temperature (Nakayama et al. 1963; Hardy, Hellon & Sutherland, 1964; Cunningham, Stolwijk, Murakami & Hardy, 1967; Wit & Wang, 1968;
Eisenman, 1969). These terms do not necessarily mean that the neurones are directly
sensitive to temperature. These neurones could be interneurones which receive
temperature signals synaptically from thermo-sensors. Eisenman & Jackson (1967)
suggested one way of making the distinction between these two types of cells. The
criteria they used were the slope and the shape of thermal response curve of the unit,
reaction to barbiturates and localization of the neurone. These criteria are reasonable
enough to identify the interneurones, provided the temperature of a neurone under
study is accurately estimated. However, the criteria may provide no direct evidences
for the inherent thermo-sensitivity of the neurones. In the present study, not all the
units were examined by applying the above criteria. Therefore, it would be appropriate to use the term 'thermo-responsive neurones' rather than 'thermo-sensitive
neurones'.

Dopamine receptor autoradiography
DA uptake sites were measured using a protocol adapted
from Joyce and Alexander.1,26 Sections were removed from
overnight "70)C storage for 1 min prior to preincubation
in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.9) at 4)C for 5 min. Sections were
incubated with 3 nM [3H]mazindol (specific activity 24 Ci/
mmol) in 50 mM Tris–HCl buVer (pH 7.9) containing
300 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl and 100 nM desipramine (to
block other monoamine uptake sites). Non-specific binding
was defined in the presence of 100 μM nomifensine and was
approximately 60% of total binding. Sections were given
three 1-min washes at 4)C in buVer as used for the pre-wash.
For DA D receptor autoradiography, a modification of
1

the method of Graham et al.18 was employed. Preincubation
was for 20 min at 4)C in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4).
Incubation buVer was 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) containing
120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl and 1 mM
2

MgCl containing 1 nM [3H]SCH 23390 (specific activity
2

71.1 Ci/mmol) with 100 nM ketanserin (to block serotonin-2
binding sites) and was for 150 min at room temperature.
Non-specific binding was 30–40% of total binding and was
estimated by incubation in the presence of 2 μM cis-

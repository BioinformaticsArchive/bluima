Transganglionic tracing of muscle afferents

Between P28 and P31, the animals were re-anaesthetized by halothane
inhalation and the forelimb extensor digitorum communis (EDC)
muscle was exposed and injected with 4 lL of 0.5% cholera toxin B
subunit (CTB, Quadratech, Epsom, UK) solution using a Hamilton
syringe. The skin was repaired and 0.03 mg / kg buprenorphine was
administered by i.p. injection to relieve any discomfort. The animals
recovered and were retained for 4 days to allow transport of the tracer.
Then they were given an anaesthetic overdose and transcardially
perfused with saline followed by buffered fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, 1 mL / g body weight). Cervical spinal cord
and forebrain were postfixed, cryoprotected and sectioned on a
freezing microtome. Parallel sets of 50-lm sections were collected for
immunocytochemistry or Nissl staining.

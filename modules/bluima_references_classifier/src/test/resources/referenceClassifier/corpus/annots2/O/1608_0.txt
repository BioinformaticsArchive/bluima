least three times. At the point where the electrical current evoked
bladder responses, the threshold for evoking a response was
examined at each position where electrical stimulation evoked a
response. We also performed extracellular single-unit recordings
with the same monopolar tungsten microelectrode. The recording
data from neurons together with bladder pressure were stored
using Cambridge Electronic Design (CED; Cambridge, UK) 1401plus data interfaces and Spike 2 software. Storage-related neurons were defined if the mean firing frequencies of the neurons in
the storage phase were significantly higher than those in the
micturition phase in a period of three urinary cycles or more, and
vice versa for micturition-related neurons. At the end of the ex-periment, electrolytic lesions (30 A, 1 min) were made to mark
the location of the stimulating/recording sites.

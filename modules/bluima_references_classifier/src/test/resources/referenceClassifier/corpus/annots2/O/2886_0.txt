time-course was not measured in our experiments.
One possible function of such a delayed gating
mechanism is to emphasize the associative interactions between the two pathways but prevent ex-traneous, possibly irrelevant, inputs from entering
the hippocampus.
It has been established previously that GABAergic
inhibition via GABA receptors plays an important
A

role in synaptic interactions within the hippocampus.
For example, in the presence of the GABA blocker
A

bicuculline, the magnitude of LTP in the dentate
gyrus is enhanced41 and the heterosynaptic interactions are revealed.38 A new aspect of such interactions during co-activation of the two perforant
pathways shown by our study is a selective enhancement of the medial pathway. This eVect does not
appear to be directly related to the preferential
GABA inhibition of the lateral pathway, but may be
B

a result of the topographic arrangement of the two
pathways. The distal dendrites of the granule neurons
are thinner and may have a higher input resistance
than the middle dendrites. Computational analysis in
a geometrically realistic model of the granule neuron
have shown that for equal synaptic currents at two
locations there would be an expected larger depolarization in the distal dendrite. Consequently, a net
axial current would be expected to flow proximally,
thus contributing to the depolarization of the medial
dendritic region.20,21
Interactions between the lateral and medial
pathways have been examined previously in situ.
McNaughton et al.26 were the first to propose co-operative interactions between perforant aVerents.
In their experiments, performed on anaesthetized
animals, LTP induced by concurrent activation of the
medial and lateral pathways was larger than during
activation of either pathway alone. This result is
apparently diVerent from ours, where selective en-hancement of the medial pathway was observed.
However, it should be noted that in their experiments
the magnitude of LTP was much lower, presumably
due to the eVect of anaesthesia on GABA inhibi- A

tion. Thus, experimental conditions could account
for the diVerent results. Tomasulo et al.38 found that
the blockade of GABA inhibition in the lateral
A

pathway enhances LTP to the extent that the subsequent co-activation of both pathways has no ad-ditional eVect. This finding is in agreement with our
data.
Abraham et al.1 observed mutual long-lasting,
heterosynaptic depression between the two pathways.
This was recently confirmed by Christie et al.,10 who
studied heterosynaptic long-term depression of the
lateral pathway by repeated tetanizations of the
medial pathway. White et al.40 demonstrated co-operative LTP and long-term depression between the
overlapping ipsilateral and contralateral projections
of the perforant pathway. All of the studies were
performed on anaesthetized animals, where synaptic
inhibition is greatly enhanced, possibly diminishing

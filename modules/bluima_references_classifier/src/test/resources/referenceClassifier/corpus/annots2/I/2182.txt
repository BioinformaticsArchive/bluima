tatory receptors on the anterior tongue ap-pear to be involved in the initiation of a rejection response, whereas those on the posterior
tongue are necessary for a sustained rejection
sequence (84). Of course, the Xth nerve was
still intact in these animals and these fibers,
in the hamster at least, are also relatively sensitive to QHCl(9, 37). Nevertheless, the idea
that input from posterior taste buds (innervated by the IXth and Xth nerves) is particularly important for decisions about rejection,
whereas those from anterior taste buds (in-nervated by the VIIth nerve) are important
for acceptance (53), is supported by the present data.

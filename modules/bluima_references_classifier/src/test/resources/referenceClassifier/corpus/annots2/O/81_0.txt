Figure 3. A, The merged rCBFâ€“MRI images indicate the location of the
negative correlation of the regression between normalized rCBF and
propofol concentration. The range of negative t values for the PET data
is coded by the color scale. B, Positive covariation between the thalamic
rCBF and other brain structures. The range of positive values for the PET
data is coded by the color scale.

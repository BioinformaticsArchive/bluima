Activation of microglia is believed to contribute to
neurodegeneration processes through the release of
proinflammatory and cytotoxic factors, including IL-1 ,
TNF- , NO, reactive oxygen intermediates, arachidonic
acid metabolites, and quinolinic acid (Chao et al., 1992;
Dickson et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1993; Brosnan et al.,
1994; Matsuo et al., 1995; Espey et al., 1997; Minghetti
and Levi, 1998). Although the precise component of the
inflammatory response that induces neurodegeneration
after intranigral LPS-injection is unknown, several studies have suggested that iNOS/NO from activated microglia play a central role in neuronal death (Gao et al.,
2002; Iravani et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2000; Arimoto and
Bing, 2003). Cytokines are very potent inductors of
iNOS (Nathan, 1992), thus, it is conceivable that after
LPS injection, proinflammatory cytokines trigger iNOS
induction. Accordingly, present results demonstrate two
stages in the inflammatory response with some differences in the temporal profile of the proinflammatory
cytokines (IL-1 , TNF- and IL-6) and iNOS. The peak

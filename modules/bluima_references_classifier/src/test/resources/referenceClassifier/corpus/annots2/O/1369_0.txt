Fig. 7. GluR1 phosphorylation and the effect of different PKA effectors. The level of phosphorylated GluR1 was increased by a D1 agonist SKF 38936
and decreased by a D1 antagonist SKF 83566. A PKA inhibitor, H89 abolished the effect of D1 agonist on GluR1 phosphorylation, while forskolin
blocked the inhibitive effect of D1 antagonist. Data are presented as mean S.E.M. of three independent studies. Numbers indicate positions of
molecular weight markers in kDa.

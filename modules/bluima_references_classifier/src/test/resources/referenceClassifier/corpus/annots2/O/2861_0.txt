Fig. 1. Effects of neonatal handling and long-term mild stress exposure (one daily stressor from post natal days 22 â€“ 152) on spatial
learning in the rat. The rats experienced four trials a day (together
comprising a training session) for a period of 4 days. Mean 9 S.E.M. Fig. 3. Effects of postnatal handling and long-term mild stress
values are shown as the time required to find an invisible platform exposure on the time course of locomotor activity in the open field

FIG. 1. Leptin stimulates the human trh promoter via STAT3 in transfected 293T cells. A,
Human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were
transfected with ObRb and human trh-luc re-porter constructs. Empty vector (pcDNA3) or WT
STAT3 plasmids were also cotransfected into the
cells. B, Cells were transfected with vectors en-coding WT STAT3 or DN STAT3 proteins, to-gether with the human trh-luc reporter construct
and ObRb plasmids. C, Cells were transfected
with ObRb or ObRb lacking tyrosine 1138
(Y1138S) vectors, together with the human trhluc reporter construct. In all experiments, cells
were left untreated (black bars) or treated with 40
nM leptin for 6 h (open bars). A CMV-lacZ control
vector was also cotransfected into the cells to normalize luciferase activities. Transfections and
treatments were done three times, each time in
triplicates. Shown is one representative experiment. Data are means SEM.

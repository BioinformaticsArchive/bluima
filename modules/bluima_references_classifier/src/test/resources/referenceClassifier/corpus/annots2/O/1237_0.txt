auditory fear conditioning at 3 and 24 h after the reactivation trial
(3 and 10 tone presentations, respectively). To keep consistent
with previous terminology (Nader et al., 2000), we refer here to
the 3 h test as post-reactivation STM (PR-STM) and the 24 h test
as post-reactivation LTM (PR-LTM).
The findings revealed that intrathalamic infusion of U0126
impaired neither retrieval nor reconsolidation of auditory fear
conditioning. Rats in each group conditioned normally, as evidenced by postshock freezing (Fig. 4c). The ANOVA for postshock freezing scores showed only a significant effect for trials
(F(1,16) 255.0; p 0.01). The effect for group was not significant (F(1,26) 0.005). Furthermore, on the following day, both
vehicle and U0126-infused groups showed equivalent retrieval of
the fear memory during the reactivation trial (t(16) 0.11; p
0.05) (Fig. 4d). Fear memory was also intact on subsequent re-trieval tests (Fig. 4e,f ). There was no significant difference be-tween vehicle and U0126-treated rats in either the 3 h test (t(16)
0.28; p 0.05) or the 24 h test (t(16) 0.61; p 0.05). Importantly, these findings provide an additional series of controls for
the consolidation experiments, indicating that ERK inhibition in
the thalamus does not interfere with auditory processing in the
thalamus or its targets. Furthermore, the fact that memory re-mained intact 24 h later suggests that intrathalamic infusion of
U0126 did not produce memory deficits in the consolidation
experiments by somehow nonspecifically competing with freezing 24 h after infusion.
To further examine the null effect of intrathalamic infusion of
U0126 on reconsolidation, we infused twice the amount of
U0126 (2 g/side) into a separate group of rats before reactivation (n 7; data not shown). As before, there was no significant
effect on reactivation (vehicle, 68.8 9.1; drug, 67.1 6.0; t(14)
0.14; p 0.05), PR-STM (vehicle, 65.5 10.2; drug, 70 6.46;
t(14) 0.33; p 0.05), or PR-LTM (vehicle, 40.1 8.3; drug,
43 8.7; t(14) 0.23; p 0.05). Thus, although ERK/MAP
inhibition in the auditory thalamus impairs memory consolida-

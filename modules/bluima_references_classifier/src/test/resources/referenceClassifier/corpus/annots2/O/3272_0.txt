Potent anticonvulsant and neuroprotective actions associated with high-affinity blockers of glutamate receptors, especially those coupled to the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/phencyclidine (PCP) recognition site of the
channel complex, have been firmly established (Rogawski,
1992; Muir and Lees, 1995). However, increasing awareness
of the potential neurotoxicity associated with these ligands,
including neuropathology, motor dysfunction, seizures, and
possible hallucinogenic and/or psychotomimetic actions, may
limit their development as clinical drugs. Because hyperactivity of glutamate synapses remains one of the most significant pathological consequences of cerebral ischemia, mechanisms targeting attenuation of glutamatergic excitotoxicity

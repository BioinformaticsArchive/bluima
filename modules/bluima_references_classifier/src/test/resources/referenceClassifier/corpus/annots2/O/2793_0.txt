and laminin-like molecules are components of the
deposits.12 HSPG and laminin have also been identified as components of senile plaques in brains of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and deposition
of HSPG has been suggested to be a precondition of
cerebral amyloidogenesis.20,21 A polyclonal antibody
to a 110,000 mol. wt laminin-binding protein (LBP)
also labels the murine deposits and has emerged as
the most reliable marker to visualize and quantify the
deposits.12 However, staining with most polyclonal
antibodies has been found to be non-specific, and
thus, the specificity of LBP staining is also likely to be
non-specific in nature.
PAS-positive granular deposits have also been
reported in the senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM)
P8 strain.2 Based on light-microscopic appearance and distribution, these PAS-positive structures
appear similar to those in B6 mice. The SAM strains
of mice have been described to undergo several

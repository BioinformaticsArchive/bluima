FIG. 12. Overlapping distributions of mRNA encoding the
MCH-1 receptor and PPL in rat brain. RNA expression of MCH-1
receptor and PPL was analyzed by RNA in situ hybridization of radiolabeled MCH-1 receptor (a and b) and PPL (c and d) riboprobes to
adjacent horizontal sections of a p14 rat brain (a and c) and sagittal
sections of an adult rat brain (b and d). The autoradiographic signals
obtained with Beta-Max x-ray film are shown. At p14 of postnatal brain
development MCH-1 receptor expression is low and restricted to the
hippocampus formation and cerebellum (a). In contrast, high levels of
PPL expression are visible in the cortex and hippocampus and a lower
level of expression in the cerebellum (c). In the adult rat brain, coexpression of MCH-1 receptor (b) and PPL (d) is visible within the whole
brain, especially the hippocampus and cerebellum. ce, cerebellum; co,

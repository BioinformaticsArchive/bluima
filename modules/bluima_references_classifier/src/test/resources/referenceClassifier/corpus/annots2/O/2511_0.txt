Sixteen cats were anesthetized with sodium pentoharbital
(50 mgjkg, iv.) and a jugular vein was catheterized for the
administration of supplemental doses of anesthetic. Colchitine (400 ,ug in 20 ~1 distilled water) was injected into the
fourth ventricle over a 60-min period, to raise peptide levels.
The wound was closed, the cat removed from the stereotaxic
apparatus and kept in an anesthetized state on a heating
blanket, monitored and observed for 22.-26 h. The cats were
subsequently perfused through the heart with isotonic saline
followed by 3 I of fixative [3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5%
acrolein w/v in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)].
The brain was removed and postfixed overnight at 4'C then
transferred to a sucrose solution (20% in 0. I M phosphate
buffer) at 4'C until the brain sank. The brainstem *as
frozen in Iiquid nitrogen and stored at - 70-C.
Thirteen animals were processed for double- and singlelabeling, Sections were incubated in phosphate-bu~ered
saline containing 10% goat serum (Colorado Serum Co.)
and 0.4% Tnton X-100 for l-2 h. The sections were then
incubated for 48 h in one of the Foliowiny solutions of
antibodies: (i) rat anti-S-HT (I : 500, Eugene Tech.) and
rabbit anti-TRH (1 :500): (Ii) monoclonal rat anti-SP
(I : 500, Accurate Chem.) and rabbit anti-TRH (I : 500): (iii)
monoclonal rat anti-SP and goat anti-S-HT (I : 1000, Im-munonuclear); (iv) rabbit anti-TRH; (v) rat anti-5-HT; or
(vi) monoclonal rat anti-SP. Rabbit serum, instead of goat
serum, was used for incubations that used the goat primary
antibody. Sections were then incubated for I 2 h m fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITWabeled goat anti-rat IgG
(Cappei) and rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC) goat antirabbit (for i and ii); FITC-labeled rabbit anti-goat (Miles)
and RITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat (Cappel, for iii); FITClabeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) and 7-amino-J-m~thyl-~oul~arin-3-a~etic acid (AMBER)-labeled goat
anti-rat (Jackson, for i); or FITC-labeled goat antirat/rabbit for 5-HT, TRH and SP (corresponding to iv, v
and vi). All secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of
I :50. Following incubation the sections were washed.
mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, allowed to dry, and
coverslipped with Krystalon (EM Diagnostic Syst.).
In three animals, sections were processed for triple-labeling. Sections of the medulla were cut (40 Fm), and incubated
in phosphate buffered saline containing 10% donkey serum
(Jackson) and 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) fur 2 h. Sections
were incubated in goat anti-5-HT (1: 500), rabbit anti-TRH
(I : 500) and rat anti-SP (1 :500). Two days later sections
were washed, incubated in FlTC donkey anti-goat, RITC
donkey anti-rabbit and AMCA donkey anti-rat (I :SOJackson) and mounted for microscopic examination.
Both homologous and heterologous absorption controls
(IO #M solutions) were performed in order to examine the
specificity of each antibohy. Each antibody was tested for its
abilitv to recoenize 5-HT. TRH or SP. The SP antibodv was
further testedwith preabsorption of neurokinin K, elohosin
or physalaemin. Immunostaining was absent when the 5-HT
antisera was incubated with excess 5-HT but was present
when incubated with TRH or SP. The immunoreactivity
observed with SP antisera was abolished by preabsorption
with SP, neurokinin K, elodosin or physala&in but nbt by
DreabsorDtion with 5-HT or TRH. Similarly, the immunoreactivity with the TRH antibody was absent when preabsorbed with TRH, but was present after absorption with
S-H?` or SP. in addition, controls consisted of omission of
either the primary or secondary antibodies and incubation
with both FITC, RITC, or AMCA-ladled secondary antibodies.

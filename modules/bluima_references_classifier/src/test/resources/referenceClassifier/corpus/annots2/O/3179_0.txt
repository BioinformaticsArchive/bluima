genin in situ hybridization is shown for E18.5, P2, P4, and P20, whereas
radioactive in situ hybridization (bottom) is shown for P2 and P20.
Digoxygenin in situ hybridization pictures are taken at 50× for E18.5, 25×
for P2 and P4, and 12.5× for P20. C, Encephalopsin expression is
prominent in developing spinal cord. Sagittal sections of embryonic time
points are taken of the cervical cord at 100× for E15.5 and 50× for E17
and E18.5. The coronal section at P2 is taken of cervical spinal cord at
50×. Arrows indicate selected encephalopsin-positive interneurons of the
ventral horn. The color reaction in the P2 section is allowed to proceed
twice as long as that in the embryonic time points, so the observed
abundance levels of encephalopsin are not directly comparable. Cb,
C erebellum; FrCtx, frontal cortex; OcCtx, occipital cortex.

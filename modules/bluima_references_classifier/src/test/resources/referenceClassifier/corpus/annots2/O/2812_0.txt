generation. However, because env expression levels were so
low and the incubation period was so extended, the cellular
site(s) of env expression and whether the Env protein requires
interactions with other retroviral proteins could not be ascertained. Thus, questions remain as to whether expression of
CasBrE env alone is sufficient to induce acute neurodegeneration or whether its toxicity is cell type dependant.
To address the issues of cell type specificity and direct toxicity of the envelope, we have developed an alternative ap-proach for expressing the CasBrE env gene in the CNS. This
involves the introduction of the envelope gene or restricted
replication-competent virus into clonal multipotent neural progenitor cells in culture followed by their transplantation into
the brains of susceptible mice. These progeneitors have been
shown to engraft into the brains of developing mice, where
they appear to become functionally and histologically integrated and capable of constitutively expressing exogenous
genes (reviewed in reference 49). While to date these cells
have been employed to distribute therapeutic gene products
(25, 52; reviewed in reference 53), we reasoned that such cells
could also be used to resolve certain questions about the biologic significance or toxicity of particular genes. Taking advantage of this unique delivery system, we report that neither the
CasBrE envelope protein nor virus expression disseminated
from these neural progenitor cells throughout the brains of
susceptible mice is sufficient for the acute induction of spongiform neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that neuropathologic changes in the brain are precipitated by CasBrE
virus life cycle events beyond virus binding and entry, in en-dogenous microglial cells.

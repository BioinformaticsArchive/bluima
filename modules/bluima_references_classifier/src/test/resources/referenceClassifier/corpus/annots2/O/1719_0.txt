The timing of neuronal activity in the striatum is critical for
motor and cognitive control: striatal output neurons affect the
levels of phasic release and inhibition in cortico-basal ganglia
pathways. Our findings demonstrate that oscillatory activity is
a prominent feature of locally generated field potential activity
in the rat's striatum and show that, across a range of frequency
bands, the power of these LFP oscillations varies with spontaneous behavior and during instructed navigation in T-maze
tasks. Temporal codes based on oscillatory modulation of
neuronal activity have been invoked in functions ranging from
sensory representation and neuronal network coordination to
expectancy coding, timing, and sequence learning and memory

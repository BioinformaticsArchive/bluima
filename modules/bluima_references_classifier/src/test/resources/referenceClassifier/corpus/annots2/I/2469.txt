vagotomized may have resulted from the combination of
rats with and without vagotomies adequate for blocking
VMH obesity. This possibility appears all the more likely
in light of the vagotomy procedure used by King et al.
(19); they transected the vagal trunks very close to the
stomach (cf. the description in Ref. 4), which is very
similar to a selective gastric vagotomy. It would be ex-pected that many of the animals would show complete
vagotomies on the gastric test even though much of the
innervation of other abdominal viscera, especially that of
the pancreas and the liver, was intact. Because they are
relatively insensitive on the issue of the particular vagal
fibers critically involved, comprehensive assessments of
the extent of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy should minimize the incidence of misassignments.

FIG. 2. His -VP26 binds GST-RP3 and GST-Tctex1 in vitro. Pu- 6

rified His VP26 and His -KIF5B (amino acids 771â€“963, His tag nega-66 6
tive control) were incubated with GST-tagged dynein subunits, bound
to glutathione-Sepharose beads, in a pull-down assay. His -VP26 bound
6

to dynein light chains GST-RP3 and GST-Tctex1 but not to GST-DIC,
GST-LC8, or GST control. His -VP26 was initially detected with Coo- 6

massie Blue stain (A), before confirmation on Western blots using
anti-His (B) and anti-VP26 (C) antibodies. Expression, binding, and
6

elution of all GST-dynein fusion constructs were confirmed with Coomassie Blue stain (A). GST-DIC was present at lower concentrations
than other fusion constructs.

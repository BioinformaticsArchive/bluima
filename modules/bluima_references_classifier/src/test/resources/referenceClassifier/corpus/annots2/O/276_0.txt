teins, Oct-1 (8), Oct-2 (8), SCIP (Oct-6) (9), or Brn-42 expressed
in GnRH neuronal cells. Because the mutagenesis also disrupted the Hox and bicoid motifs, our studies cannot eliminate
these types of homeoproteins as potential candidates involved
in Ark repression. Indeed, studies by us and others have demonstrated that the cis-acting element spanning -154 to -147
of the rat GnRH promoter is required for basal promoter activity in GT1-7 cells (63, 74). Furthermore, this site appears to
integrate signals for both activation and inhibition of GnRH
promoter activity, as Otx-2, a bicoid-like homeoprotein, stimulates the GnRH promoter via this region in GT1-7 cells (74).
Thus, the identity of the homeoprotein(s) interacting with
MEF-2B and 2C in Gn10 and GT1-7 cells may provide important insights related to both positive and negative regulation of
the GnRH promoter.
Although MEF-2 isoform expression has been demonstrated
both spatially and temporally in the embryonic brain (43â€“ 49),
unraveling MEF-2 functions in neuronal lineages has just be-gun. The finding that MEF-2 regulated transcription is associated with neuronal survival implicates anti-apoptotic genes as
potential MEF-2 targets (50, 51). Prior to GnRH, however, the
only neural promoter having been identified as a MEF-2 target
was the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid NR1 receptor promoter (52).
In fetal cerebrocortical cultures, Sp1 and MEF-2C interacted to
synergistically activate the NR1 gene. Given that MEF-2C and
Sp1 were also expressed endogenously in these fetal cerebrocortical cultures suggests that these two factors regulate NR1
expression in vivo. Coupled with our studies of the GnRH
promoter, these data provide further evidence that MEF-2 proteins may play pivotal roles in neuronal development.
The complexities of MEF-2-mediated gene regulation have
been extended with recent work from Lu et al. (75). In cardiomyocytes, MEF-2 was shown to be maintained in an inactive
state when associated with the class II histone deacetylases 4
and 5 (HDAC4 and -5) that deacetylate histones resulting in
transcriptional repression. Under hypertrophic conditions,
HDAC dissociation from MEF-2 was mediated via CaMK signaling, while subsequent MEF-2 activation occurred by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation within the
MEF-2 transactivation domain. Thus, the activity of MEF-2
proteins was shown to be dependent upon phosphorylation as
well as interactions with other coregulatory proteins. In T cells,
MEF-2 is sequestered in an inactive state by another repressor,
Cabin (76). Similar to cardiomyocytes, calcium signaling leads
to MEF-2 dissociation from the inhibitory factor (Cabin). In
this system, however, Cabin associates with a histone deacetylase complex consisting of mSin3A/HDAC1 and -2. Finally, the
co-repressor MITR (MEF-2 interacting transcription repressor)
also down-regulates MEF-2 activity via recruitment of HDAC1
(37).
Although the signaling pathways involved in HDAC dissociation from MEF-2 have been delineated in muscle and T-cells,
the pathways involved in the active recruitment of HDACs to
target promoters are currently unknown. To our knowledge,
the GnRH promoter is the only natural promoter negatively
regulated by MEF-2 transcription factors. Thus, it will be in-teresting to investigate whether Ark signaling results in MEF-2-dependent recruitment of HDACs or other co-repressor proteins to the GnRH promoter to inhibit transcription. Our
preliminary studies to dissect the signaling components re-quired for Ark inhibition of the GnRH promoter suggest that
calcium pathways are not involved.2 Therefore, if Ark stimulates HDAC association with MEF-2 proteins bound to the
GnRH promoter, signal-dependent recruitment of HDACs is

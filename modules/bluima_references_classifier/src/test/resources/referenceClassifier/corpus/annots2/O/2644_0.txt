Histology
Among the hippocampal placements, all probes were within 1
mm of the dorsal hippocampal surface illustrated in Figure 2A
in rostrocaudal and mediolateral planes, and all probes rested
on the alveus in the CAlKA2 border region. In both hippocampal and neocortical placements, positions were unchanged
from one experiment to the next in the same cat, since the probes
were cemented in place, and no evidence of displacement was
found on histological examination.

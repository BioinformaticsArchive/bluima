stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. LPA, a lipid
mediator found in serum, has been reported to exert mitogenic and
morphological effects on numerous cell types (Moolenaar, 1995).
However, little is known on its possible actions in the nervous system,
besides its ability to induce neurite retraction in vitro (Jalink et al.,
1994). The effects of LPA are thought to result from its action on a
G-protein-coupled receptor (Moolenaar, 1995). Two unrelated putative
LPA receptors have been cloned recently, and belong to the seven
transmembrane receptors superfamily (Guo et al., 1996; Hecht et al.,
1996). One of these receptors is highly expressed in brain during
development (Hecht et al., 1996). Our findings suggest that LPA may
act also as an intercellular messenger in mature brain, although the
source of endogenous LPA in brain remains to be identified.
The precise mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptors
increase the phosphorylation of FAK are not known. Our results in
hippocampal slices suggest a role for the activation of PKC and the
inhibition of cAMP. These pathways, may be important in parallel
or in combination with other pathways involving subunits of
heterotrimeric G proteins (Luttrell et al., 1996) and small GTPbinding proteins (see Machesky & Hall, 1996 for review). In
hippocampal slices, the effects of LPA and carbachol on FAK+
tyrosine phosphorylation were prevented by GF109203X and
calphostin C, which inhibit PKC by completely different mechanisms.

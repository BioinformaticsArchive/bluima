Motor paralyses of the limbs in REM sleep and cataplexy may result from inhibition of the peripheral muscles at the spinal cord level by the gigantocellular nuclei
and raphe nuclei at the reticular formation (1,13,14).
Spinal inhibition may also be responsible for the cessation of chorea, athetosis, hemiballismus, and parkinsonian tremor during sleep (15â€“17). It is possible that
increased cortical activity during REM sleep occasionally
breaks through spinal inhibition to induce irregular muscle movements. Spinal inhibition may be absent in the
patients without atonia during REM sleep (18).

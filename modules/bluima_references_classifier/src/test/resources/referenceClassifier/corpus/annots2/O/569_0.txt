Fig. 9. The efflux transporter, system A, at the blood-brain barrier.
System A is present in the abluminal side and carries L-Pro, Gly, and
MeAIB. The other amino acid transporter may be present on the luminal
side and carry L-Pro and Gly, but not MeAIB. MeAIB also inhibits system
Aâ€“mediated L-Pro on the abluminal side. L-Pro and Gly undergo efflux
transport across the BBB, but MeAIB does not.

Fig. 5. Quantification of GFAP levels by scanning densitometry. Three independent experiments of GFAP immunoblots
were scanned and analyzed using the NIH Image Program
with the Gel Analysis Macro routine. The data for these experiments were normalized to the level of GFAP in control, unlesioned brains. The difference in GFAP levels between suramin
and saline-treated tissue at 3 days post-injury was found to be
statistically significant by the Tukey test (*, a<0.01).

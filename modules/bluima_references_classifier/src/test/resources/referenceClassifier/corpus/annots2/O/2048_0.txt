Altered dynamics of soluble A in
plaque-rich versus plaque-free mice
Sampling the ISF at slower perfusion rates
(which allows for more efficient dialysis of
ISF solutes) revealed age-dependent changes
in ISF A (Fig. 5). In particular, this method
revealed significantly decreased diffusion of
endogenous A 40 and A 42 into the microdialysis probe in 24-month-old compared
with 3-month-old mice. To better understand the basis for this marked decrease in

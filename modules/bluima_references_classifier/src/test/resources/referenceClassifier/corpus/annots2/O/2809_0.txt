Data analysis
Autoradiograms from in situ hybridization and binding
experiments were quantified densitometrically with a computerized image analysis system (MCID, Imaging Research,
St Catherines, Ontario, Canada). Optical density was
measured in several subfields of the hippocampal formation,
the limbic system and in different regions of the cerebral
cortex, and non-specificvalues were subtracted to obtain the
specific optical density in the respective area investigated.
The values listed in Table 1 represent the mean fmol/mg
protein :k S.E.M. of five animals per group. To calculate
the amount of protein in fmol/mg we used 10-gm-thick ~251
micro-scales (Amersham) and followed the manufacturer's
instructions.

Fig. 3. The altered whisker pattern is somatotopically represented in the barreloid thalamus. (A) The whisker pattern in a control mouse visualized
using LUXOL staining. Five rows of whiskers termed A to E are shown. (B) The control barreloid pattern visualized using cytochrome oxidase staining
at P4. Sectioning at a given angle allows one to see five rows of barreloids, A to E (see Experimental Procedures). (C) The altered whisker pattern
induced by Ad-Shh. The mouse was infected with Ad-Shh at E10 then analyzed at P5. (C=) In the figure two extra whiskers between row A and row
B (bold circles) are highlighted. (D) The contralateral side of the barreloid pattern. (D=) The extra barreloids corresponding to the extra whiskers are
highlighted (bold lines) along with other barreloids (plain lines). Scale bars 0.1 mm.

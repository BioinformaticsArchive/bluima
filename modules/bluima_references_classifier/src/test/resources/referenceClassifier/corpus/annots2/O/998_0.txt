An earlier study provided circumstantial evidence for a
critical role for endothelial cells in the development of
brain necrosis. Endothelial cell numbers in the rat brain
were monitored after irradiation using a fluorescent
histochemical technique [3]. This showed that within 1
day of irradiation there was a fall in endothelial cell
number to about 85% of that of age-matched controls. In
view of the slow turnover of these cells [4], this is most
likely to be explained by the apoptosis of a sensitive subpopulation of endothelial cells [3, 5]. (The existence of this
separate sub-population sensitive to apoptosis, around
15% of all endothelial cells, suggests that these endothelial
cells may have a significantly different role from other
endothelial cells [3]. This possibility requires further
investigation.) The rapid loss of cells within a day was
followed by a further slow loss of endothelial cells over
several months. When cell numbers became depleted to
about 65% of normal, an attempt at re-population was
observed. However, this was transient, and a second
decline in endothelial cell density then occurred, shortly
before the onset of brain necrosis.
Recently, a related study was carried out on mice using
the radioprotector, Hoechst 33342. This was administered
shortly prior to irradiation [5]. This radioprotector rapidly
localizes in endothelial cells but is not present elsewhere in
brain at the time of radiation exposure. It was found that
pre-treatment with Hoechst 33342 substantially protected
endothelial cells against the initial loss (24 h) after low
doses and that this was associated with a dose modification factor of ,3.0. In so far as endothelial cells are the
likely critical target for radiation damage leading to late
necrosis, it seemed possible that late brain necrosis might

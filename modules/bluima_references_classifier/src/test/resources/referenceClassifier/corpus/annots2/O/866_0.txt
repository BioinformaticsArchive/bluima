Di@rences in tuning properties across motoneuron
categories
Our results show few significant differences in the frequency selectivity of TCs from stapedius motoneurons in
different response categories, and furthermore, the differences we found were not large. Thus it is unlikely that the
different motoneuron categories have different functions

SACMN and their axons develop normally in BEN / mice
As we have described above, BEN is a rather selective marker of
SACMNs, their axons, and the SAN during an early and transient
phase of mouse spinal cord development. Together with the well
established roles for BEN in regulating the outgrowth/guidance
of a variety of CNS axons (Ott et al., 2001; Avci et al., 2004;
Weiner et al., 2004), this unique expression profile suggests that
BEN is a good candidate for mediating SACMN/SAN development. In particular, the recently reported defasciculation of mo-tor and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in BEN-deficient mice
raised the possibility that BEN may be required for the assembly
of SACMN axons into the SAN. To test this hypothesis, we examined SACMN and SAN development in a mutant mouse line in
which green fluorescent protein (GFP) was knocked into the BEN
locus (Weiner et al., 2004). In E11.5 transverse cryosections de-rived from BEN mutants, wild type-like SACMN that were
appropriately restricted to cervical levels of the spinal cord ex-pressed GFP (Fig. 7A, arrowheads). Anti-NF immunohistochemistry performed on transverse cryosections (data not shown) and
whole-mutant embryos revealed that SACMN axons and the
SAN appear to develop normally in the absence of BEN (Fig.
7C,E). Thus, despite our finding that BEN is quite selectively
expressed by SACMN, BEN does not seem to be required for their
development.

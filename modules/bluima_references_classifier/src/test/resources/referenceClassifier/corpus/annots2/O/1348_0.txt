Fig. 2. Confocal images of BrdU-positive cells in (A) control and (B) sleepdeprived rats in coronal sections. Sections were double-labeled for BrdU (in
green) and NeuN (in red) using immunofluorescence method. (C) A 3-weekold BrdU-positive cell in the DG co-localizing with NeuN (D, arrow) shown in
the box in (E) in orthogonal view. This orthogonal reconstruction allows the
evaluation of a cell in all three spatial axes to confirm the overlap of the two
immunoreactions. (F–H) Co-localization of BrdU (green) with DCX (red)
analysed by confocal microscopy. (I–K) Examples of an astrocyte (S100-b,
blue) co-localizing with BrdU (green).

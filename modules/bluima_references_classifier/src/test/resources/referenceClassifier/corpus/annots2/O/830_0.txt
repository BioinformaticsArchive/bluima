The monoamine noradrenaline (NA) can initiate and/or modulate locomotion in a variety of
vertebrates. Here we report that exogenous NA application can facilitate two completely different
fictive behaviours in embryos of the common frog Rana temporaria, depending on whether spinal
networks are connected to supraspinal centres. When the nervous system is intact, NA elicits a nonrhythmic coiling motor response, reminiscent of a spontaneous behaviour appropriate to drive
hatching movements, but has only minor effects on evoked swimming activity. After the spinal cord
has been severed from the brain, spontaneous coiling is no longer observed, nor can NA elicit it, but
the amine can `release' swimming rhythm generation in response to electrical skin stimulation. The
rhythm is similar, but relatively inflexible when compared to fictive swimming recorded from intact
animals. Our pharmacological tests indicate that a1-adrenoreceptors are involved in the permissive
role of NA during spinalised rhythmic swimming and that the fictive coiling response to NA in
intact animals involves descending inputs and the activation of b1-adrenoreceptors. Furthermore,
the subtle effects of NA on evoked swimming in intact animals were mimicked by either a1- or
a2-adrenoreceptor activation, reversibly decreasing motor burst durations and increasing their
frequency. We discuss our results with reference to the known synergistic actions of NA with
another aminergic neuromodulator, serotonin, and raise the possibility that these amines may
actively regulate the release of one another during locomotion, in addition to their respective postsynaptic targets in the spinal cord.

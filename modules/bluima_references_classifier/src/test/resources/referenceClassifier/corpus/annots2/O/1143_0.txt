area of inactivation included the ipsilateral fastigial nucleus, an-terior interpositus nucleus, posterior interpositus nucleus, dentate nucleus, lateral anterior lobe, crus I, rostral crus II, and lobule
HVI. The cerebellar nuclei and neighboring cortex in the contralateral hemisphere were unaffected by muscimol (Fig. 5). Rats
given saline infusions showed no reduction in 2-DG uptake, with
strong bilateral 2-DG uptake in all the deep nuclei, vestibular
nuclei, and throughout the gray matter of the cortex. The strongest 2-DG uptake was observed bilaterally in the vestibular, interposed, and cochlear nuclei. No increase in 2-DG uptake was ob-served in the inferior olive contralateral to the muscimol infusion
(Fig. 5). However, muscimol induced increases in inferior olive
activity might be observed with higher-resolution metabolic im-aging techniques.

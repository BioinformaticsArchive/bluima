Figure 4. GRK5 promotes -linolenic acid-induced oligomerization of S. A, To test the
effect of fatty acid (FA) on S oligomerization, HEK293– S cells expressing GRK5–FLAG were
preincubated with 20 nM OA for 8 h and then conditioned with or without -linolenic acid for
16 h along with OA. High-speed soluble cytosol fractions (30 g of protein) from cell lysates
were heat treated (65°C for 16 h) to remove lipids before gel loading and were immunoblotted
(IB) with Syn-1 (top left) or psyn#64 (top middle). For loading control, the same amounts of
non-heat-treated samples were immunoblotted with anti-actin and anti-SOD1 antibodies
(bottom left). As the molecular weight standards, S oligomers formed in vitro by the treatment of recombinant S (Rec.) with -linolenic acid (see Materials and Methods) are shown at
right. B, High-speed soluble cytosol from cells expressing S and GRK5 was loaded onto a
Superdex 75 column and eluted with ammonium acetate buffer. A large amount of pS129 – S
oligomers was eluted into the fractions of high molecular weights (45–70 kDa), indicating that
the formation of pS129 – S oligomers occurred under nondenatured conditions. Immunoblot-

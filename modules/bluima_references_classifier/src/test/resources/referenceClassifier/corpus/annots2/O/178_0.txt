10 mg/kg i.p., caused a partial inhibition (15%) of this enzymatic form. In contrast to the cortex, MAO-A activity was
only partially inhibited (30%) in liver after treatment with
FA70 at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. At this dose, clorgyline
produced 85 and 10% inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B, re-spectively, in this tissue. No recovery of MAO activity was
observed in liver after 24 h of treatment with either FA70 or
clorgyline.
Intraperitoneal administration of FA70, 2 h before decapitation, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of MAO-A (Fig.
3) with an estimated ED50 of 0.75 mg/kg i.p. (Table 2) in
mouse cortex. For MAO-B activity, i.p. treatment with
graded doses (0.25â€“10 mg/kg) of this drug did not show any
effect over this enzymatic form. Under similar experimental

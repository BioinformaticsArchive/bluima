Figure 5. Specific intergenic sequences from either mouse or zebrafish target gene expression to the forebrain of E11 mouse embryos with highly similar
patterns. A, Zebrafish zI46i. B, Mouse mI56i. In addition to the forebrain, β-galactosidase activity was observed in the first two branchial arches in two
of three lines and two of four primary transgenic embryos. C, The 187–316 fragment of zebrafish zI46i. In addition to the forebrain, β-galactosidase was
also expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb buds in one of five primary transgenic embryos carrying this construct. Note that the
forebrain expression patterns in A–C are highly similar to those of Figure 3B (full zebrafish intergenic fragment). Mx, Maxillary component of the first
branchial arch; Md, mandibular component of the first branchial arch; Hy, hyoid arch. Other abbreviations as in Figure 3.

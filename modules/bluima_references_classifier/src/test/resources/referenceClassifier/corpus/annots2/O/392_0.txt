Figure 5. Oligodendrocyte numbers are
drastically reduced early but are maintained chronically in the injured spinal
cord. A–C, E xamples of triple-label
immunohistochemistry for CC1 (brown),
GFAP (black), and P0 ( purple) used to
count oligodendrocytes. Sections are
from lesion epicenter at 28 d after in-jury and are counterstained with methyl
green. Scale bars, 5 μm. A, Several
single-labeled oligodendrocytes (brown;
arrowheads) and one astrocyte (black; ar-row) are visible. Image taken from lateral
white matter. B, Example of GFAP+ as-trocyte double-labeled with CC1. Image
from dorsolateral edge of white matter.
C, Image taken from lateral white matter
in a region in which several Schwann cells
with P0+ myelin were visible. In this
field, two Schwann cells were clearly
double-labeled with CC1 and P0 (ar-rows), whereas one Schwann cell was
single-labeled for P0 (arrowhead). D,
Quantification of oligodendrocytes singlelabeled with CC1 in epicenter crosssections. At 7 d after injury, oligodendrocytes were significantly reduced by 93%
compared with sections taken from normal spinal cords at T8 (which contained
1165 6 113 oligodendrocytes). The number of oligodendrocytes remained significantly lower than controls as late as 5
months after injury. However, between 7
and 14 d after injury, oligodendrocyte
numbers increased more than threefold. E, Quantification of cross-sectional
area of epicenter sections at different
times after injury. Digitized sections
were manually outlined and cavities were excluded such that only the remaining tissue area was measured. A continual loss of spinal cord tissue
for at least 5 months after injury was detected.

Intracellular recording
The electrodes that were used for intracellular recording
from motoneurons were glass micropipettes filled with
either 2 M potassium citrate or 3 M KCl (tip resistances:
10–15 MÙ). Hyperpolarizing pulses of current were utilized
to inject chloride ions. After the cat was fully anesthetized,
a reference Ag–AgCl electrode was placed subcutaneously
over the neck musculature and fine-wire electrodes were
inserted deep into the masseter muscle to stimulate nerve
terminals for the antidromic identification of masseter
motoneurons.4 Following intracellular penetration of a
masseter motoneuron, stimulation within the masseter
muscle evoked a characteristic antidromic spike potential.
In only one case was it possible in the present study to
record from the same masseter motoneuron before, during
and after the injection of carbachol. To record from the
same cell during these diVerent periods proved diYcult for a
number of reasons. Occasionally, our sensory stimuli would
disrupt the animal. Sometimes, the injection of carbachol
was not eVective in inducing motor atonia. During other

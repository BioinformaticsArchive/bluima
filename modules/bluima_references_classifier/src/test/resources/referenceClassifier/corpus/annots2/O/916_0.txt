males. In place of exogenous supplementation with estrogens, transplantation of Ar / ovaries into ovariectomized
Ar / female mice, which is expected to produce a physiological hormonal milieu similar to that occurring in Ar /
mice, might be the method of choice to address the issue of
whether the failure in reproduction of Ar / females is due
to a defect in estrogen synthesis in the ovary.
Estrogens acts primarily through estrogen receptors (ERs),
which are ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors (15,
16). Upon ligand binding, ERs bind to estrogen response
elements (EREs) in target gene promoters, leading to transcriptional modulation of the genes. Nevertheless, ligandbound ERs can regulate transcription of genes by other mechanisms (15). In this study we developed a line of transgenic
mouse in which an enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) gene, a variant form of the wild-type GFP gene (17),
was incorporated into the genome to be expressed in an
estrogen-dependent manner via the ERE. As EGFP is an
autofluorescent protein, the expression of the protein can
easily be visualized without the processing of samples (18).
Measurement of the expression levels of the protein in Ar /
mice with or without estrogen allows us to easily evaluate
estrogen actions via the ERE in vivo. Employing this animal
model, we established that Ar / females are readily re-sponsive to estrogen derived from the transplanted ovaries
of Ar / mice as well as to dietary estrogen. We then ex-amined the consequences of ovarian transplantation on the
reproductive activity of Ar / females by mating them with
fertile males. The findings indicate that the failure in repro-

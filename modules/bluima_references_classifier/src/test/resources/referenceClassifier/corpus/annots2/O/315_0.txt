URINARY URGE INCONTINENT GROUP
A cohort of 41 implanted urge incontinent pa-tients completed 3-year follow-up at the time of
database closure (September 15, 1999). At baseline, the patients had an average of 11.6 6 6.6 leaks
per day including 3.6 6 4.0 heavy episodes and
replaced 6.7 6 4.6 pads or diapers per day. At 3
years, leaking was significantly reduced to 5.0 6
6.1 leaks per day (P <0.0001), with 59% of pa-tients reporting 50% or greater reduction in leaks
per day and 46% of patients reporting that they
were completely dry. Heavy leaking episodes significantly decreased to an average of 1.3 6 3.5 per
day (P <0.0001), with 65% having no heavy leaking at 3 years. The average number of pads or diapers replaced per day significantly decreased to
3.4 6 4.9 per day (P <0.0001).

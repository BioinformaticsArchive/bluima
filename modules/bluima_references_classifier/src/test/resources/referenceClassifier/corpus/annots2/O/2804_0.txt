and scarring). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
(Interleukin-1ra) is an endogenous protein that
binds to interleukin-1 receptors without inducing
their activation. Recombinant human (rh)
Interleukin-1ra has been shown to block physiological and pathological eVects of Interleukin-1â in a
wide range of experimental animal models.12,13 The
first evidence that Interleukin-1â contributed to the
progression of acute brain injury was provided by a
report that pharmacological antagonism of
Interleukin-1â by intraventricular infusion of
Interleukin-1ra reduced both excitotoxic and
ischemic damage in adult rat brain.36 These observations were congruent with the growing body of
data that pharmacological blockade of ``secondary''
mediators of acute brain injury can substantially
improve neurological outcome.

information can also induce morphological changes in cortical
structures and whether these changes would be transient or long
lasting. Based on well established evidence (Eichenbaum, 2004;
Squire et al., 2004), we predicted that the medial temporal lobe
would show such structural changes.
The German preliminary medical exam, called “Physikum,” is
usually taken after 2 years at the end of the preclinical education. It
includes both oral and written exams in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, human anatomy, and physiology. Consequently,
the huge amount of new information, demanding a high level of
encoding, retrieval, and usage, requires a 3 month period of daily
study sessions and represents an ideal group for investigating possible learning-induced structural plasticity of the adult human brain.

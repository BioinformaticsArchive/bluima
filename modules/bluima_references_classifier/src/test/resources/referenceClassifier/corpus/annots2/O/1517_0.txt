Fig. 1. Electrophysiology. (A) The hen brain spheroids on an MEA dish. A collage of light microscopy images shows the spheroids on the electrode area of MEA
dish. At the centre, two focal planes of the same position in the array show the penetration of the electrodes in the spheroids. Corner images, taken at lower zoom-in
ratio help to create the complete picture of the sample. (B) Typical bursting behaviour at DIV14. (C) Typical spiking behaviour before and after the application
of acetylcholine (10-5 Moll) to the culture medium of DIV14 spheroids; average frequency almost doubles indicating receptor activity. (D) Relation between
spontaneous spiking frequency and stimulated spiking frequency over the period DIV7 to 14 which can be seen to increase to over double by DIV14. Values are
expressed as mean ± S.D., n = 18. **P < 0.04. The values were compared with day 7 data. A significant change is observed between values for DIV7 and DIV14. (E)
AchE activity in the hen brain spheroids from DIV7 to 30. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D., n = 6. **P < 0.01. The values were compared with day 7 data. No
significant change is seen up to DIV14 but a significant drop in activity occurs thereafter.

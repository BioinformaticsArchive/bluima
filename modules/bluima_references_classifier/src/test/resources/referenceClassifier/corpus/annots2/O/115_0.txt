studies of other basal ganglia nuclei, and are particularly
evident in the DAergic control of GP firing rates. Apomorphine and d-amphetamine increase mean firing rates of pallidal neurons roughly 2-fold (Bergstrom and Walters, 1981;
Bergstrom et al., 1982), and this effect is blocked by either D1
or D2 antagonists (Carlson et al., 1986). Although selective
D1 agonists have variable effects on pallidal neuron firing
rate, and D2 agonists alone cause mild rate increases, their
combination produces large excitatory effects (Carlson et al.,
1987; Walters et al., 1987; Ruskin et al., 1998). Therefore, D1
and D2 receptors interact positively to shift mean firing rates
in the GP (and other basal ganglia nuclei).
As already noted, however, neuronal firing activity in the
basal ganglia is characterized not only by firing rate but also
by slow oscillatory patterns in firing rate. The prominent
effects of apomorphine on multisecond oscillations in the GP
and entopeduncular nucleus described above were reversed
by either SCH 23390 or eticlopride (D1 and D2 subfamily
antagonists, respectively), suggesting that both D1 and D2
receptor subfamilies were involved (Ruskin et al., 1999). To
more fully characterize the D1/D2 receptor control of this
phenomenon, and to extend the previous results, which only
used a single combined dose of D1 and D2 agonists, the
present study examines the effects of selective D1 and D2
agonists, administered alone or sequentially at several doses.

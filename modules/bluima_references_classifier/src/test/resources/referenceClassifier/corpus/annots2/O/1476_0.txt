Chronic nicotine administration increases NR2B-containing
NMDAR responses via tyrosine kinase signaling
The NR1 / NR2A and NR1 / NR2B are the major subtypes of NMDAR
expressed in the hippocampus (Monyer et al., 1994). To determine
whether enhanced NMDAR function was due to a selective change in
either the NR1 / NR2A or the NR1 / NR2B subtype, we examined the
NMDAR / AMPAR ratio in the presence of the NR1 / NR2B-specific
antagonist ifenprodil (3–5 lm). We found that the NMDA
(NR1 / NR2A) / AMPAR ratio was not significantly altered by nicotine
treatment (control, 0.36 ± 0.03, n = 8; nicotine, 0.46 ± 0.04, n = 8)
(Fig. 4A), suggesting that nicotine exposure selectively affects
NR1 / NR2B subtype. To confirm this, we examined the ifenprodil
sensitivity of NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses and found a
significant increase in the ifenprodil sensitivity of NMDAR-mediated
responses following nicotine treatment (control, 36.4 ± 4.9%, n = 6;
nicotine, 55.9 ± 3.8%, n = 9; P < 0.05) (Fig. 4B and C). Enhanced
ifenprodil sensitivity indicates a higher proportion of NR1 / NR2B-

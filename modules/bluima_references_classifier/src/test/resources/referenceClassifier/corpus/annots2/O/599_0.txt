Pick's disease (PiD) is a rare progressive frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) that accounts for approximately 2%
of all cases of dementias of the elderly. Clinically, PiD
is manifested by disinhibition, apathy, language problems, memory deficits, extrapyramidal symptoms, and
apraxia. Neuropathologically, there is circumscribed
cortical atrophy, mainly of the frontal and anterior
temporal lobes, white matter degeneration, achromatic
neurons (Pick cells), and intraneuronal lesions denoted
as Pick bodies (PBs) in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and selected brainstem nuclei.1– 4
More recent studies have shown -positive glial in-clusions, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and a network
of dystrophic -immunoreactive neurites in PiD.5– 8 Al-though several different subtypes of PiD have been de-scribed,4 their classification as PiD is the subject of on-

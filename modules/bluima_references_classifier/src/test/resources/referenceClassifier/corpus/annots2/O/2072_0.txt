A small population of small diameter afferents may
remain after capsaicin treatment (undetected im-munohistochemically) which are capable of inducing
Cat-301 expression on motor neurons.22.26,37 An
essential contribution by this quantitatively small
population of afferents seems less likely than the
contribution by the remaining major population of
large diameter primary afferents.
The experiments described here suggest that feedback information from muscle afferents to motor
neurons is necessary during development for the
acquisition of normal, mature properties. Coordinated activity within a neuronal circuit has been
proposed as an organizing factor (termed “resonance”) during embryonic development31,32 and,
similarly, the coherent activity of muscle, motor
neuron and muscle afferents during the early postnatal period may be essential for normal motor neuron
maturation.
The possibility that large diameter afferents play a
role in the maturation of motor neurons is of particular interest in light of recent investigations on the
role of glutamate in activity-dependent neuronal de-velopment. Several lines of evidence suggest that Ia
afferents as well as a class of interneurons which
synapse on motor neurons are glutamatergic7,39 and
that motor neurons express N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors. lo Activity-dependent developmental events in the visual system have been demonstrated to require activation of the NMDA subclass
of glutamate receptor in early life.5,27The biophysical
properties of the NMDA receptor give it a “summing” function, which has been suggested to mediate
activity-dependent phenomena in other systems.5,27
Such a function might also fit with our observations
that the expression of Cat-301 on motor neurons
requires both descending input as well as large diameter primary afferent input. Thus, the expression of
the Cat-301 antigen, and the normal program of
motor neuron development, might be induced by
coherent muscle afferent activity operating through
NMDA receptor activation only if the general level
of excitability (controlled by the upper motor neuron)
is sufficient. Ia input to motor neurons is relatively
weak in neonates and motor neuron firing probably
requires synchronous activity from many sources
(segmental and/or suprasegmental). Preliminary ex-periments have shown that Cat-301 expression is
mediated by NMDA receptor activation in early
life.*' This further supports our hypothesis that the
expression of Cat-301 on motor neurons is activitydependent.

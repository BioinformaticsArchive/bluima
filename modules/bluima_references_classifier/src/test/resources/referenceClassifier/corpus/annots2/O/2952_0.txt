FIG. 6. Chemical cross-linking and FPLC gel filtration of phosphorylated R-tau and dephosphorylated R-tau. A, chemical crosslinking of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated R-tau by DSS. Phosphorylated R-tau and dephosphorylated R-tau were treated with DSS
with concentrations of both R-tau species of 0.3 mg/ml. After indicated
time points, samples (8 μl/each) were taken out and analyzed by SDSPAGE. Lane 1, phosphorylated R-tau control; lane 2, phosphorylated
R-tau incubated with DMF for 10 min; lanes 3–7, phosphorylated R-tau
treated with DSS for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 min, respectively; lane 8,
dephosphorylated R-tau treated with DMF for 10 min; lanes 9 –13,
dephosphorylated R-tau treated with DSS for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 min,
respectively. B, FPLC gel filtration of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated R-tau. C and D, SDS gels of fractions representing phosphorylated R-tau and dephosphorylated R-tau, respectively, from panel B.
From indicated column fractions, 15 μl was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Activity-dependent modulation
Facilitation and fatigue
The patterns of electrical activity generated at the cell bodies of OXT and AVP
neurones are so characteristically different as to be virtually diagnostic in a
number of situations (see Poulain & Wakerley, 1982). OXT neurones fire action
potentials in a relatively continuous manner at low to moderate frequencies
(1-10 Hz) except during parturition and lactation when discrete higher-frequency
bursts (10-80Hz for 1-4s) are superimposed (Wakerley & Lincoln, 1973;
Summerlee, 1981). AVP neurones, particularly when activated during, for
instance, dehydration, exhibit a phasic pattern of activity with trains of moderate
frequency discharge (3-15 Hz) lasting 4-100 s (mode 5-25 s) separated by similar
periods of electrical quiescence. Each train is often initiated with a few seconds at
a higher firing rate (up to 20-30 Hz) which then plateaus to a lower level (Poulain
& Wakerley, 1982).

the MGV and MGD (Clerici and Coleman, 1990). This
same blood vessel also demarcates the boundary
between the SG and MGM (see Fig. 4A). The lateral
boundary of the SG, between the MGD and SG, may be
distinguished by the transition from evenly spaced
rounded cells of similar size (MGD) to more unevenly distributed cells with a more elongate appearance (Clerici
and Coleman, 1990, 1998). Three of the injection sites
also appeared to encroach upon the MGD and/or MGM,
nuclei adjacent to the SG. Two of the injections were confined to the SG and were used for analysis.
We also made three injections that were confined to
the extrastriate region medial to the primary visual cortex
designated V2M (Paxinos and Watson, 2007). Based on
their locations, these injections were confined to areas
designated the anteromedial (AM) or the rostral aspect of
posteromedial (PM) regions of the extrastriate cortex as
defined by the physiological receptive field maps of Espinoza and Thomas (1983). This area has also been designated the rostral aspect of the MX by Coogan and Burkhalter (1993) based on anatomical connections. Two
injections were also made that were confined to the V2L
extrastriate region of the visual cortex. Based on their
locations, these injections were confined to rostral areas
of the extrastriate cortex designated anterolateral (AL) or
lateromedial (LM) as defined by the parcellation schemes
of both Espinoza and Thomas (1983) and Coogan and
Burkhalter (1993).
Our gross injection experiments in the SG and V2
yielded consistent and robust labeling of axons in the primary auditory cortex as well as some labeling in other au-ditory cortical areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex is defined here as any
portion of the auditory cortex that has a thick, dense
granular layer and receives its primary layer 3â€“4 thalamocortical input from the MGV. This would include areas
designated Au1 and AuV by Paxinos and Watson (2007),
also called Te1 by Romanski and LeDoux (1993), which
probably includes physiologically defined areas designated AI and P by Doron et al. (2002). These anterogradely labeled axons displayed both en passant swellings along the length of the axon (Fig. 1A,B, white
arrowheads) and en terminaux swellings at the end of
short side branches (Fig. 1B, black arrowheads). The latter were much more prevalent on the SG axons. Similar
injections confined to the primary visual cortex did not
generate such a projection to the primary auditory cortex
(not shown).

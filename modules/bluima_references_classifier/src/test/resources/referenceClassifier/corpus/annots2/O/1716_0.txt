that the P2X3 subunit was the dominant transcript, with
approximately 50% greater abundance than the P2X2 subunit;
compatible with a P2X3-P2X3-P2X2 trimer assembly (Jiang et al.,
2003). The other five P2X receptor transcripts were less abundant.
Alternative splicing of the P2X2 receptor was apparent, with
dominance of a P2X2-3 isoform (Salih et al., 1998). The
pharmacological properties of the recombinant P2X2-3/3 heteromer,
expressed in Xenopus oocytes, matched the native SGN P2X
receptor phenotype. This pharmacological profile was exploited in
a neonatal spiral ganglion explant model to demonstrate that ATP,
acting through this P2X receptor, counters the neurite extension
and branching elicited by the neurotrophin BDNF. These findings
establish a mechanism contributing to the pruning and withdrawal
of neurites contacting the sensory hair cells, which is required for
the reorganization of cochlear synaptic innervation as hearing is
established.

D-Asp, L-isoAsp, and D-isoAsp. These isomers are typically observed in long-lived proteins (3) (Fig. 1A). Mori
and his colleagues have extensively studied the effect
on aggregation properties of the racemization of Asp
residues at positions 7 and 23 of the Aβ protein (29).
Electron microscopic and fluorometric studies reveal
that racemization of Asp residues at either or both
positions 7 and 23 affects the aggregation rate of the
peptide. However, contradictory reports regarding the
rate of aggregation of racemized amyloid peptide (po-sition 7) indicate both enhanced and slowed aggregation relative to nonracemized amyloid; [D-Asp7]Aβ1-40
amyloid aggregation was enhanced, whereas
[D-Asp7]Aβ1-35 was slowed, relative to their nonracemized forms (29, 51). The present results favor the
enhanced aggregation hypothesis since, at the light
microscopic level, d7C16 forms thicker fibrils than
those consisting of the nonracemized form of Aβ. These
findings were confirmed ultrastructurally in both DS
and aged dog brain samples.
In another report describing the distribution of posttranslationally modified Aβ peptides, the authors
raised an antibody to a synthetic peptide dAEFRC
([D-Asp1]Aβ1-6), in which the aspartic acid at position 1
was replaced with a racemized aspartic acid. The im-munostaining characteristics of this antibody indicated the presence of racemized Aβ within diffuse
plaques and blood vessel walls in aged human, polar
bear, and dog brain. In addition, racemized Aβ was
detected within plaques in nondemented elderly controls and within neuritic plaques in AD brain (46, 50).
In a previous study we described the immunostaining
characteristics of an affinity-purified antibody raised
against another spontaneously modified form of Aβ
containing an isoaspartic acid at position 7. Isoaspartic-7-Aβ was found in compact plaques in both the
entorhinal and the frontal cortex of AD and DS cases
and first appeared within plaques forming clusters (9).
In addition, isoaspartic acid Aβ deposits are found
within diffuse plaques in aged dog brain (41). The
results of the current experiments support and extend
these findings to indicate the presence of racemized Aβ
(d7C16) within plaques of all subtypes in DS brain and
in particular within the cores of compact plaques. This
is consistent with previous reports of detectable levels
of racemized Aβ in a young DS case (15, 40).
Aside from the possible functional consequences of
racemization and isomerization on aggregation activity
and neurotoxicity of Aβ (22, 33), antibodies directed
against these modified versions offer possible insights
into the temporal sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in DS subjects. Previous reports of senile
plaque pathogenesis in DS brain demonstrate the initial appearance as clusters with supragranular cortical
regions being most affected (2, 12). These results are
consistent with the layer-specific deposition of racemized and isomerized forms of Aβ (1, 9). Clustering of

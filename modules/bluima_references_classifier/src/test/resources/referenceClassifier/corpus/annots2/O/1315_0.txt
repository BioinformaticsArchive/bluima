Animals and surgery for chronic electrode placements
Long–Evans rats (male, n = 28) from the Charles River breeding
colonies were used in these experiments. At the time of surgery,
animals weighed 250–300 g. They were housed in pairs prior to
surgery and individually thereafter. Animals were kept in a 12 h
on : 12 h off lighting schedule and maintained on an ad libitum
feeding schedule.

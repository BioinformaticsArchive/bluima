FIG. 3. The ZENON protein is targeted to nuclei. 293T cells were
transfected with the complete ZENON coding region (amino acids 1 to
1202) in frame with the FLAG sequence. The ZENON-FLAG fusion
protein was detected with an anti-FLAG antibody 48 h after transfection. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst reagent. The arrowhead
indicates a nucleus containing the ZENON-FLAG fusion protein. The
arrow indicates a nucleus in which the ZENON-FLAG fusion protein
is not present, probably because the cell was not transfected. Bar, 20

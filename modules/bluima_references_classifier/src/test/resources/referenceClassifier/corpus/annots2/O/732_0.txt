leptic drug phenytoin in liver and brain. CYP3A11 and 13
were predominantly expressed in neurons throughout the
brain. Non-neuronal localization of CYP3A was sporadically found in astrocytes. Since CYP3A enzymes are
strong metabolizers of xenobiotics, the neuronal and as-trocytic CYP3A expression suggests that these enzymes
might protect the brain against exogenous neurotoxic compounds. It seems of particular importance that CYP3A
expression occurs in nearly all groups of neurons in the
hippocampus being widely under the influence of steroid
hormones in ontogeny and adulthood. The ability of
CYP3A enzymes to inactivate testosterone by hydroxylation points to their involvement in the regulation of steroid
hormone action in the brain.

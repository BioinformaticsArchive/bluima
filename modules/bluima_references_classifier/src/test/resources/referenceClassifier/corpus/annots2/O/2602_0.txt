groups,it wasfound that FGF treatment significantly increased
sprouting. The repeatedmeasuresANOVA provided evidence
of a significant interaction effect between the irradiation and
FGF treatments (F = 7.6, df = 1 and 8, p = 0.025). Examining
the mean levels showsthat the difference between the axon
numbers for irradiated-treated and non-irradiation-treated
nerves was larger when FGF is present (p < 0.01) than when
FGF is not (p < 0.05). This was again determined using the
Tukey's multiple comparisonsprocedure. Finally, the average
fluctuation of optic nerve axon numbers was approximately
sixfold higher in myelin-free/FGF-treated P15 optic nervesthan
that of their normal counterparts. Using an F test to compare
the variance within animals between two treatment groups
(-irrad/+FGF and +irrad/+ FGF), we found evidence for a

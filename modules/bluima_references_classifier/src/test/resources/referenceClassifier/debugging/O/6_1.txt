Figure 1. Desensitization kinetics of wild-type GluR1flip and GluR1flip
(L497Y). Aa, Current elicited by the rapid and sustained application of 5
mM glutamate (bar) in an outside-out patch from a H EK 293 cell transfected with wild-type GluR1flip. The bi-exponential fit (smooth solid line)
to the decay of the current, as well as the residual trace (res; obtained by
subtracting the recording from the fit), are shown. The fit gave time
constants of 2.25 and 14 msec for the two components. The amplitude of
the fast component was 99% of the total peak current. Ab, Enlargement
of the same current fitted with a single exponential. Note that the fit is
poor in the tail of the current, as well as the presence of substantial
residual current near the peak. Ba, Response to 5 mM glutamate in a patch
from a cell expressing GluR1flip (L497Y). The single-exponential fit to the
decay and the corresponding residual current are shown. Bb, The rises of
the currents in A (GluR1flip ) and B [GluR1flip (L497Y)] are superposed
after the peak amplitudes are scaled. Note that the rises are virtually
identical.

visually presented objects, odors, and locations in DMS/DNMS
tasks (Suzuki et al., 1997; Young et al., 1997). In particular, some
EC neurons exhibit “delay” activity consisting of elevated spike
rates maintained during the interval between sample and test
stimulus presentations (Suzuki et al., 1997; Young et al., 1997),
providing a potential neural substrate for information held in
working memory (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Kubota and Niki,
1971). In the presence of muscarinic agonists and blockers of
synaptic transmission in vitro, many EC neurons exhibit intrinsic
bistability in that they can be switched to a sustained spiking state
from quiescence by a brief depolarizing input. Figure 3A shows an
in vitro recording made from a synaptically isolated layer V mEC
neuron during the typical protocol used to elicit persistent spiking: first, the neuron is held near threshold using tonic applied
current (A1); second, a depolarizing current step (2 s, 100 pA)
is applied to briefly drive spiking at a high frequency (A2); and
last, the applied current is returned to the previous tonic level
(A3). As Figure 3A shows, the neuron continues firing (indefinitely) after the step, whereas it had been quiescent prior to the
step. These two fundamentally different behaviors were exhibited even though the holding current applied to the neuron was
exactly the same before and after the depolarizing step. Thus, as
the phase portrait in Figure 3B illustrates, this “bistable” neuron
possesses two stable states or behaviors, quiescence, and spiking, with which it can respond to a single, fixed level of input.
The spiking state simply reflects the neuron's “memory” of the

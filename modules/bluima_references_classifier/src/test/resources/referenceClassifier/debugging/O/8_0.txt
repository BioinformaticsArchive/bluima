the cortex and to the striatum during preparation and execution
of an action are modeled as in the reduced model, except that now
a noisy nonselective component is added to both inputs (see
Materials and Methods). They are shown in Figure 8 A.
The response of the network is depicted in Figure 8 B. Before
the input onset (at t 500 ms), the activities in the various
populations are at their spontaneous level and the network is in a
symmetric state. After this onset, the activities in the cortical
populations of the two circuits begin to increase. The transient
selective external input to the striatum induces an asymmetry
first between the GPi of the two circuits and after a short while in
all of the other populations of the network. In particular, the
activity in the cortical population in one of the circuits becomes
significantly larger than its rest level, whereas it is reduced in the
other network. This asymmetry persists even after the transient
striatal input is over. Only when the network is back to rest does
the state become symmetric again. Hence, as in the reduced
model, the cortexâ€“BG network can perform action selection. The
action that is selected is the one implemented by the circuit in
which the transient striatal input is the largest. In the example
shown in Figure 8 B, the state of the network is also selected
according to this rule.
As in the reduced model, the GPi populations in the two circuits respond with opposite polarity to the
additional input. However, the random

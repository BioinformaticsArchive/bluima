Impact of NBCs in the Neocortex
A large number of synapses, highly distributed on the axonal
arbor of the presynaptic NBC and on the somato-dendritic
domain of the postsynaptic PC, provide the anatomical basis for
powerful and reliable signal transmission. The significant
fraction of axo-dendritic synapses onto PCs may enable NBCs to
influence synaptic integration and regulate AP-generation and
propagation within dendrites, while the (peri-)somatic inhibition could control the gain of summated potentials and block
A P-generation (Cobb et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996; Larkum et
al., 1999). Indeed, a single NBC can delay as well as block spontaneous AP-discharges in postsynaptic PCs (n = 2, unpublished
observations). Rough estimates indicate that each NBC targets
150–170 PCs and 25–35 interneurons within layers II/III and
within a 300 μm diameter (mean slice error of ∼25%, 1.1
synapses/bouton, 70% intracolumnar synapses, ∼16 synapses/
PC, ∼6 synapses/interneuron, 25% interneurons), indicating that
each NBC can powerfully inhibit ∼10% of the PCs within the
layer and within this lateral extent (∼1500 PCs) (Ren et al.,
1992). Basket cells constitute ∼50% of the interneurons in layer
II/III (unpublished data), of which 73% are NBCs, indicating that
these provide a major fraction of the inhibition in this layer.
While the impact on individual PCs is potentially powerful, the
low density of boutons and similar numbers of synapses
deployed in connections onto PCs compared with SBCs indicates
that each NBC innervates fewer PCs in the local microcircuit
compared to a single SBC.
NBCs are often reciprocally connected to neighboring PCs
(11/32 cases), indicating that a significant fraction of inhibition
is applied to those PCs locally involved in exciting them. These
circuit principles could enable NBCs to synchronize target-cell
activity (Cobb et al., 1995), potentially leading to network
oscillations (Buzsaki and Chrobak, 1995; McBain and Fisahn,
2001). The connectivity between NBCs and other types of
interneurons could also favor network synchrony (Buzsaki and
Chrobak, 1995; Tamas et al., 1998), as could electrical junctions
(Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999; Gibson et al., 1999).
The inhibitory impact of NBCs is temporally complex because
electrophysiological subclasses of NBCs employ synapses with
different temporal dynamics to inhibit PCs, indicating that the
convergence of different subclasses of NBCs could result in a

components embedded within the fluctuations of Ca2+
concentration within this same nanodomain (Liang et al.,
2003). Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM
triggers regulatory processes (e.g., CDF in CaV2.1) that
seem to respond preferentially to intense, spike-like
Ca2+ fluctuations driven by local Ca2+ influx through
the channel to which resident CaM is attached (local
Ca2+ preference) (Lee et al., 2000; DeMaria et al., 2001;
Soong et al., 2002; Chaudhuri et al., 2004; Chaudhuri
et al., 2005). By contrast, Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal lobe activates modulatory processes (e.g., CDI in
CaV2.1) that appear selective for smaller but long-lasting Ca2+ components reflective of Ca2+ entry through
multiple other Ca2+ channels at a distance from the
resident CaM (global Ca2+ preference). Though the
precise form of modulation (CDF or CDI) produced by
a particular lobe of CaM may vary in different types of
Ca2+ channels, the overall preference of the C-terminal
lobe of preassociated CaM for local Ca2+, and of the
N-terminal lobe for global Ca2+, appears to hold true
across the family of CaV1-2 channels (Evans and Zamponi, 2006).
Ongoing biological research is beginning to reveal
the impact of CaM/Ca2+ channel regulation on cardiac
(Alseikhan et al., 2002) and neuronal excitability
(Chaudhuri et al., 2004; Chaudhuri et al., 2005; Yang
et al., 2006). This study focuses instead upon critical gaps
in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
CaM regulation of CaV2.1. A first key uncertainty concerns the suggested selectivity of CaM/channel regulation for spatially different sources of Ca2+ influx. The
data in support of this selectivity have thus far been in-direct and based upon inferences drawn from macroscopic currents recordings from numerous channels.
Whether this intriguing design principle actually exists
could be tested directly at the single-channel level,
where the local Ca2+ signal is present, but the global
Ca2+ signal must be lacking by definition. A second critical unknown is whether CaV2.1 CDF represents a derepression of channel open probability (Po), or an actual
enhancement of Po over a normal baseline level seen
without Ca2+. Though either scenario would cohere
with the macroscopic profile of CDF, direct determination of Po by single-channel recording would definitively
adjudicate this ambiguity. Thus far, however, singlechannel data for CaV2.1 channels have been limited primarily to those obtained with Ba2+ as the charge carrier
(Dove et al., 1998; Hans et al., 1999; Colecraft et al.,
2001; Tottene et al., 2002; Fellin et al., 2004; Luvisetto
et al., 2004; Tottene et al., 2005), where experimental
resolution of signals is aided by the amplification of unitary current size (i) compared to that seen with the
physiological charge carrier Ca2+ (Tottene et al., 2002).
Rapid millisecond openings of unitary CaV2.1 Ca2+ currents are estimated to produce currents of only 300â€“400
femptoamps in amplitude (even with 100 mM Ca2+ as

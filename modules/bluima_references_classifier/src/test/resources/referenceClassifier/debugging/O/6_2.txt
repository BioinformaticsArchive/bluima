Allosteric versus subunit independent gating
Our results support the idea that AMPA receptor desensitization
proceeds via an allosteric mechanism, and they provide functional evidence consistent with dimeric receptor assembly.
AM PA receptors also show concentration-dependent substate
gating (Rosenmund et al., 1998; Smith and Howe, 2000), a property shared by cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (Ruiz and
Karpen, 1997). Interestingly, it appears that C NG channels also
behave as dimers of dimers and obey allosteric gating mechanisms, but for CNG channels it is activation, not desensitization,
that is described by modified MWC schemes (Liu et al., 1998; but
see Ruiz and Karpen, 1999).
Individual AMPA receptors show as many as four conductance
levels, the frequency of occurrence of which depends on the
number of subunits occupied by agonist (Smith and Howe, 2000;
Smith et al., 2000). One interpretation of these results, and the
staircase behavior described by Rosenmund et al. (1998), is that
individual subunits gate independently of the state of the other

were found in CCK basket and Schaffer-collateral associated cells
(Cea-del Rio et al., 2010, 2011), as well as in SOM expressing
O-LM interneurons (Lawrence et al., 2006a). This latter study
showed the emergence of the ADP was dependent on inhibition of the M-current and a slow calcium-activated potassium
channel, as well as activation of calcium-dependent non-selective
cationic current (ICAN). In contrast, the membrane potential
depolarization and increased firing frequency in CA1 PV basket
cells require activation of M1 mAChRs (Cea-del Rio et al., 2010,
2011).
Immunocytochemical studies have shown differential expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes within the whole brain
(Levey et al., 1991) and hippocampus (Levey et al., 1995; Hájos
et al., 1998). Most notably, in the hippocampus M2 mAChRs
are densely expressed on axon terminals of PV basket and axoaxonic cells, while in dendritic targeting interneurons (calretinin
and SOM) M2 mAChRs are expressed on the soma and dendrites
(Hájos et al., 1998). Similarly, M2 mAChRs are expressed on PV
basket cells of the auditory cortex (Salgado et al., 2007) and EC
(Chaudhuri et al., 2005). Activation of the M2 mAChRs has been
shown to decrease the amplitude of unitary IPSPs in CA3 pyramidal cells (Szabó et al., 2010), IPSCs in pyramidal cells of the
auditory cortex (Salgado et al., 2007) and IPSPs in pyramidal and
SCs of the EC (Apergis-Schoute et al., 2007). These data strongly
support a heterosynaptic regulatory role for M2 mAChRs, where
their activation on interneurons inhibits the synaptic release of
GABA and decreases inhibitory potentials in pyramidal cells.
In contrast, M1 mAChRs and M3 mAChRs activation have a
predominantly excitatory effect on interneurons, increasing levels of inhibition in principal cells. Interesting questions remain
unanswered within the EC. For instance, in what interneurons
are muscarinic receptors other than M2 expressed, and are they
localized in particular cellular compartments? Can muscarinic
receptor expression be correlated with interneuron innervation of
particular principal cell domains, and do the same neurochemical markers (CCK, PV, SOM, neuropeptide Y (NPY), calbindin,
calretinin, etc.) correlate with similar innervation of principal cell
domains as seen in the hippocampus (reviewed by Freund and
Buzsáki, 1996)?
Van der Zee and colleagues have contributed extensively to
mAChR immunocytochemistry of the hippocampus, neocortex,
and amygdala (reviewed in Van der Zee et al., 1999). In the
interest of space, here we will focus on their data concerning
the hippocampus. Their body of work uses M35, a pan-mAChR
antibody which labels all muscarinic receptors that are in an
activated state (André et al., 1984). Therefore, M35 immunoreactivity (ir) allows visualization of phosphorylated/internalilzed
mAChRs and can be used as a tool to investigate the functional
cholinergic properties of a cell or network. Immuncytochemical
studies in naïve animals have found M35-ir in basket cells within
stratum pyramidale of CA1-CA3 as well as other interneuron
types in SLM and stratum oriens/alveus (Van der Zee et al.,
1989, 1991a). Similar studies found a high degree of colocalization between M35 and the GABA markers PV and SOM
(Van der Zee et al., 1991a,b, 1993). Out of 2730 hippocampal
interneurons expressing mAChRs, 33% colocalized with SOM,
52% with PV, and 72.8% with SOM and/or PV. Furthermore,

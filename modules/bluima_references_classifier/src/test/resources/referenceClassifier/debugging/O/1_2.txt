Trigeminal ganglion and nerve
At E14.5, the trigeminal ganglion displayed very robust Kv1.1
hybridization signal, with Kv1.1 RNA being detected along the
pathways of all three branches of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 7A).
Kv1.1 immunoreactivity was also strong in the trigeminal ganglion and along the trigeminal nerves (Fig. 7B). There was a

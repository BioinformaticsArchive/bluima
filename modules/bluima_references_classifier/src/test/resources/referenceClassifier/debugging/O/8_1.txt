Modeling the effect of DA
Dopaminergic SNc neurons project to several BG nuclei (for review, see
Graybiel, 2000), but these projections and the dopaminergic receptors
are more numerous in the striatum (Haber and Fudge, 1997). Thus, we
have assumed that the DA primarily affects the BG dynamics via its effects
in the striatum. The effects of DA on synaptic and cellular properties in
the striatum is still a topic of debate (for review, see Calabresi et al., 2000;
O'Donnell, 2003; Nicola et al., 2004). Most of the available data regarding
the presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of DA were obtained in vitro.
These data are often contradictory, presumably because of the different
experimental conditions under which they were obtained, and whether
the changes in DA concentration are phasic and/or attributable to local
fluctuations or whether they are pathological. Here, we focus on the
pathological changes in the dynamics of the cortexâ€“BG network induced
by a depletion in the average extracellular DA concentration. Previous in
vitro studies suggest that the threshold of striatal neurons increases with
DA (Calabresi et al., 2000; O'Donnell, 2003). Consistent with this idea, in
vivo studies have shown that the activity of striatal projection neurons
increases after DA depletion both in anesthetized and awake animals
(Kish et al., 1999; Tseng et al., 2001). We modeled this increase in activity
after DA depletion phenomenologically by the following dependence of
the average threshold of striatal neurons, T , on the level of DA as

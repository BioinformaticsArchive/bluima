tical (Fig. 3 D, left), because initial gating is not appreciably different in normal versus facilitated gating
modes. However, the accelerated activation mechanism
predicts faster rising FL curves following a prepulse,
since facilitated channels would first activate faster in
this scenario (Fig. 3 D, right). With the Poo function, the
situation is reversed. The enhanced opening hypothesis
posits that, during isolated test pulses, the conditional
Po following first opening would initially feature a small
value (Po 0.04), which would then transition to a
larger level (Po 0.09). This effect should be visible as a
dip in the Poo curve before reaching a plateau at longer
t (Fig. 3 E, left). For test pulses that follow a prepulse,
the dip should be absent, as channels open directly to
the Po 0.09 level. Conversely, in the accelerated activation hypothesis, no difference exists in the conditional
Po subsequent to first opening, so Poo curves from test
pulses should be almost identical without regard to a
preceding prepulse (Fig. 3 E, right).
Turning to our data, in depth single-channel analysis
furnishes definitive evidence favoring the predominance
of an enhanced opening mechanism for CDF (Fig. 5).
First, FL distributions for Ca2+ appear essentially identical without regard to the presence of prepulse depolarization (Fig. 5 A, left, average from n = 5 patches),
contradicting an accelerated activation model. In Ba2+,
FL curves also appear superimposed (Fig. 5 A, right, av-erage from n = 4 patches). Second, Poo curves with Ca2+
do indeed show prepulse-dependent changes characteristic of the enhanced opening mechanism. Without
a prepulse, the Poo curve dips to a low point ( 0.04)
before transitioning to a higher plateau with Poo 0.09
(Fig. 5 B, left, gray curve average of n = 5 patches).
With a prepulse, the Poo rapidly achieves the higher
level without evidence of a dip (black curve average of
n = 5 patches). These prepulse-dependent differences
are confirmed by calculating the difference between
Poo curves (Fig. 5 C, top left), which reveals a roughly
single-exponential decay, with time constant 20 ms.
By integrating this difference, we emphasize further the
significance of the difference curve, as the integrated
relation flattens out at a distinctly negative value (Fig.
5 C, bottom left). Third, these prepulse-dependent differences in Poo clearly reflect CDF, because of their complete absence in the case of Ba2+ activity (Fig. 5 B, right).
Here, regardless of prepulse, the Poo functions decay im-mediately to the same lower level of 0.04, without indication of a dip. In all, the nearly exact correspondence
of these actual FL and Poo profiles to those predicted for
the enhanced opening scheme (Figs. 3, D and E, left)
furnishes direct support for this mechanism of CDF.

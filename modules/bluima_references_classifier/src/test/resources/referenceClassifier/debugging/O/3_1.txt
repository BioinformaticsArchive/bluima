Multiplex PCR
Multiplex-PCR conditions were optimized using total RNA purified
from rat neocortex, so that a PCR product could be detected from
(250 pgâ€“1 ng) of total RNA without contamination caused by nonspecific amplification. For the lists of the primer pairs included into
the different multiplexes, the name and accession number of the
genes amplified and the length of the PCR product, see Table 1. Three
different multiplex-PCR reactions were performed for testing the

range of different effects (see Fig. 6). Interneurons characteristically exert the same temporal impact onto groups of targets
(Gupta et al., 2000), indicating that while the NBC population as
a whole exerts a temporally heterogenous effect, a single NBC
exerts a temporally homogeneous effect onto groups of target
cells. It is important to note that many dynamic features are
known to change with development, thus the precise synaptic
parameters or the large spectrum of electrophysiological
patterns may not be generally extrapolated to adult animals
(Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1995; Reyes and Sakmann, 1999).

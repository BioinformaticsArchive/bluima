19152000	Entry and fusion inhibitors  Two drugs that interfere with sequential steps involved in the penetration of target cells by HIV are available as options for treatment in experienced patients. Integration of viral DNA by integrase  is the only entry inhibitor currently approved in adults and children, by blocking the fusion of the virus to the target cell. Integrase inhibitors  These drugs block the viral integrase and the insertion of DNA copy of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome. Table 1 1994 revised HIV immunological classification based on age– CD4 cell count [4]  Immunologic CD4 + lymphocyte count (cells per microliter) categories and CD4%  <12 months 1–5 years 6–12 years  1. Severe <750 or <15% <500 or <15% <200 or <15% suppression  Table 2 1994 revised HIV clinical classification system [4]  Category N: not symptomatic Children who have no signs or symptoms considered to be the result of HIV infection or who have only one of the conditions listed in category A Category A: mildly symptomatic Children with two or more of the following conditions but none of the conditions listed in categories B an C Lymphadenopathy (>0.5 cm at more than two sites; bilateral = one site) Hepatomegaly Splenomegaly Dermatitis Parotitis Recurrent or persistent upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, or otitis media Category B: moderately symptomatic Children who have symptomatic conditions attributed to HIV infection, other than those listed for category A or category C; examples of conditions in clinical category B include but are not limited to the following Anemia (<8 mg/dl), neutropenia (<1,000 cells per cubic millimeter), or thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells per cubic millimeter) persisting ≥30 days Bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis (single episode) Candidiasis, oropharyngeal (i.e., thrush) persisting for >2 months in children aged >6 months Cardiomyopathy Cytomegalovirus infection with onset before age 1 month Diarrhea, recurrent or chronic Hepatitis Herpes simplex virus stomatitis, recurrent (i.e., more than two episodes within 1 year) Herpes simplex virus bronchitis, pneumonitis esophagitis with onset before 1 month of age Herpes zoster (i.e., shingles) involving at least two distinct episodes or more than one dermatome Leiomyosarcoma Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia complex Nephropathy Nocardiosis Fever lasting >1 month Toxoplasmosis with onset before 1 month of age Varicella, disseminated (i.e., complicated chicken pox) Category C: severely symptomatic Children who have any condition listed in the 1987 surveillance case definition for AIDS, with the exception of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (which is a category B condition)  Children <12 months of age  A number of US and European cohort studies have reported better outcome in infants receiving early antiretroviral therapy [6, 14, 21, 26]. The recent Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy trial confirms that early HIV diagnosis  Table 3 Indications for initiation of antiretroviral therapy in children infected with HIV (from the NIH Working Group) [28]  Age Criteria Recommendation  <12 months Regardless of clinical signs and symptoms, immune status, or viral load Treat 1 to <5 years AIDS or significant HIV-related signs and symptomsa Treat CD4 < 25%, regardless of symptoms or HIV RNA levelb Treat Asymptomatic or mild symptomsc and CD4≥25% and HIV RNA≥100,000 copies per milliliter Deferd Asymptomatic or mild symptomsc and CD4≥25% and HIV RNA<100,000 copies per milliliter ≥5 years AIDS or significant HIV-related signs and symptomsa Treat CD4 < 350 cells per cubic millimetere Treat Asymptomatic or mild symptomsc and CD4≥350 cells per cubic millimeter and HIV RNA≥100,000 Consider copies per milliliter Asymptomatic or mild symptoms and CD4≥350 cells per cubic millimeter and HIV RNA≥100,000 Deferd copies per milliliter  Data from [28] a US Centers for Disease Control clinical category C and B (except for the following category B conditions: single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis) b The data supporting this recommendation are stronger for those with CD4 percentage <20% than for those with CD4 percentage between 20% and 24% c Centers for Disease Control clinical category A or N or the following category B conditions: single episode of serious bacterial infection or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis d Clinical and laboratory data should be re-evaluated every 3–4 months e The data supporting this recommendation are stronger for those with CD4 count <200 than for those with CD4 counts between 200 and 350 cells per cubic millimeter  and antiretroviral therapy reduced infant mortality by 76% and HIV progression by 75% [27]. Advantages of PI-based regimens include excellent virologic potency, high genetic barrier for development of resistance, and sparing NNRTI drug class.

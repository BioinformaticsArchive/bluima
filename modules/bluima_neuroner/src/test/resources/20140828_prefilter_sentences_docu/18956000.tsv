18956000	e, cyclic voltammetry of a two-electrode laboratory edlc cell in 1.5 m tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate net4+,bf4– in acetonitrile-based electrolyte, containing activated carbon powders coated on aluminium current collectors. The double layer capacitance of activated carbon reaches 100–120 F g–1 in organic electrolytes; this value can exceed 150–300 F g–1 in aqueous electrolytes, but at a lower cell voltage because the electrolyte voltage window is limited by water decomposition. A typical cyclic voltammogram of a two-electrode EDLC laboratory cell is presented in Fig. Figure 3 presents a schematic of a commercial EDLC, showing the positive and the negative electrodes as well as the separator in rolled design (Fig. 3a,b) and flat design (button cell in Fig. (Photo courtesy of batscap, Groupe bolloré, france.) c, a small button cell, which is just 1.6 mm in height and stores 5 france. To address this issue, a three-electrode cell configuration, which discriminates between anion and cation adsorption, was used45. this schematic of cyclic voltammetry for a mno2electrode cell in mild aqueous electrolyte (0.1 m K2So4) shows the successive multiple surface redox reactions leading to the pseudo-capacitive charge storage mechanism. hYbrid SYStemS to achieve hiGh enerGY denSitY  Hybrid systems offer an attractive alternative to conventional pseudocapacitors or electrochemical double layer capacitors by combining a battery-like electrode (energy source) with a capacitor-like electrode (power source) in the same cell. An appropriate electrode combination can even increase the cell voltage, further contributing to improvement in energy and power densities. Its pseudo-capacitance arises from the iii/iv oxidation state change at the surface of MnO2 particles . The association of a negative 58 EDLC-type electrode with a positive MnO2 electrode leads to a 2-V cell in aqueous electrolytes thanks to the apparent water decomposition overvoltage on MnO2 and high-surface-area carbon. The low-cost carbon–MnO2 hybrid system combines high capacitance in neutral aqueous electrolytes with high cell voltages, making it a green alternative to electrochemical double layer capacitors using acetonitrile-based solvents and fluorinated salts. Another challenge for this system is to use organic electrolytes to reach higher cell voltage, thus improving the energy density. Thin-film, printable and wearable electrochemical capacitors could find numerous applications.  from orGanic to ionic liquid electrolYteS  EC cell voltage is limited by the electrolyte decomposition at high potentials. Accordingly, the larger the electrolyte stability voltage window, the higher the supercapacitor cell voltage. Moving from aqueous to organic electrolytes increased the cell voltage from 0.9 V to 2.5–2.7 In this area, hybrid activated carbon/conducting polymer devices also show an improved performance with cell voltages higher than 3 V (refs 74–76). Replacing the heavy bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI) anion by a lighter (fluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (FSI) and preparing ionic liquid eutectic mixtures would improve both the cell voltage (because a protecting layer of AlF3 can be formed on the Al surface, shifting the de-passivation potential of Al above 4 V) and the ionic conductivity77. The modules consist of an in series/parallel assembly of 100-F, 2.7-V cells that are directly integrated into the doors to limit the use of heavy copper cables.

19966000	The diagnostic diamino acid of the cell wall was meso-diaminopimelic acid. A photomicrograph of cells of strain CBMB205T is available with the online version of this paper. Currently Gramnegative bacteria remain the best-studied plant-interacting microbes, but representatives of high and low G+C Grampositive bacteria also have excellent biocontrol, plant-growthpromoting and bioremediation activities. The cells were maintained on ammonium mineral salts medium with 0.5 % (v/v) methanol or on nutrient agar (NA, Difco) with 1 % methanol (v/v). Gram staining was performed by using a Gram staining kit (Difco) and bacterial suspensions were examined by phasecontrast microscopy for cell morphology and motility. Preparation and examination  of cells under a scanning electron microscope was carried out according to Bozzola & Russell (1998). Photomicrographs of cells of strain CBMB205T grown on the solid surface of ammonium mineral salts medium supplemented with 0.5 % methanol are shown in Supplementary Fig. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity in cell-free extracts of strain CBMB205T was 8.25 nmol a-ketobutyrate per mg protein h21. For the analysis of cellular fatty acids, the novel strain was cultured in trypticase soy agar at 28 uC for 48 h. Preparation of cell walls from strain CBMB205T and the analysis of peptidoglycan were carried out using methods described by Schleifer  Table 2.

The cell wall contains meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. Major cellular fatty acids are C15 : 0 anteiso, C15 : 0 iso, C16 : 0 iso and C17 : 0 anteiso. Methylocella species are facultatively methanotrophic.

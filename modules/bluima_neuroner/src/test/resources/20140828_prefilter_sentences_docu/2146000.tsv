Sher and Duncan Mitchell BrainFunctionResearchUnit,DepartmentofPhysiology,UniversityoftheWitwatersrandMedicalSchool,Johannesburg(SouthAfrica)  (Accepted 26 December 1989)  Key words: Ischemia; Nociception; Hyperalgesia; Dorsal horn; N-Methyl-D-aspartate; Excitatory amino acid antagonist  We have investigated the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the rat dorsal horn in mediating neuronal responses to noxious hindlimb ischemia, induced by acute occlusion of the femoral artery, as well as in the hyperalgesia evident when noxious mechanical stimuli were applied to the ischemic limb. Both 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (1/aM and 100/aM) and ketamine (1 mM and 100 mM) inhibited the increase of dorsal horn neuronal firing rate induced by ischemia, but did not alter the neuronal response to noxious pinching or innocuous brushing of the receptive field. Processes in which the EAAs and their receptors are involved include developmental plasticity9,learningandmemory28,epileptiformactivity2° and mediation of neuronal damage due to ischemia26'33. Salt35 has found that both N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate excitatory amino acids receptors are involved in synaptic responses of ventrobasal thalamic neurones to sensory stimulation. In vitro studies have shown that dorsal horn neurones mediate excitatory neurotransmission at least in part through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor2324. Willcockson et al. 43 have shown that nociceptive neurones in the primate spinal cord increased firing after iontophoretic application of glutamate. We also recorded the responses of neurones in the rat dorsal horn to noxious and innocuous stimuli applied to the hindlimb, in the presence and absence of hindlimb ischemia. Recording technique and characterisation of cells Single unit extracellular recordings were made from dorsal horn neurones at depths 50-700/zm (mean = 365 + 58/~m) below the surface of the cord, the depths being determined by readings taken from a stepping microdrive. The majority of the cells recorded (58%) lay in the superficial dorsal horn (< 275 /am), with the remaining units being located in deeper laminae. Analysis of neuronal responses with respect to depth showed no difference between superficial and deep units, and the results have thus been presented as mean responses of all convergent neurones recorded. The receptive field of each neurone was mapped out at the start of each experiment and again following 60 min ischemia. Once a suitable neurone had been identified, its spontaneous firing rate was measured; only those neurones which had a background firing rate of less than 2.5 Hz were used in this study. The reason for this limitation was to eliminate the possibility of any unit exhibiting cell injury potentials. Following the onset of ischemia, neuronal firing rate was recorded for 30 min during which no other stimuli were applied to the limb. Two doses were employed for each drug, of the order of those shown previously to antagonise amino acid-induced excitations of mammalian spinal neurones23'32'34'35.The concentrations were: 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate 1 /~M and 100gM (pH 5.4) and ketamine 1 mM and 100 mM (pH 5.5). RESULTS  Neuronal response to ischernia  Of the 8 saline-treated animals, 7 showed an increased  firing rate of dorsal horn neurones in response to  hindlimb ischemia, the increase being sustained for all 60  min of ischemia. For each of the two successive 30 min ischemic  periods, the neuronal activity was significantly greater  than pre-ischemic activity (P < 0.05, Fig. 2A demonstrates the responses of a typical  neurone recorded in a saline-treated animal before and  during ischemia. Six of the 7 neurones which responded in such a fashion had a monophasic response, while one neurone had a biphasic response, with the second peak larger than the first, and only the latter reaching a plateau. 2B shows the activity of a typical dorsal horn neurone during 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate treatment.

In the other three, the firing rate of the neurone either reached or exceeded preischemic levels, in a response similar to that of saline-treated animals. For the higher dose of 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (100/~M), 6 neurones were still inhibited after 60 min, while two showed recovery.

Application of 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (100 btM) to 6 sham-operated animals (no ischemia present) did not alter the neuronal response to either noxious pinching or innocuous stimulation of the receptive field. Following innocuous stimulation, the neuronal response was 301 + 45 spikes (mean + S.E.M.) after 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate treatment compared to 337 + 29 in the pre-ischemic period.

In both ischemic periods, neuronal activity of 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate-treated animals was significantly less (P < 0.05) than that of control animals. Effect of ketamine Spinal cord administration of ketamine hydrochloride affected dorsal horn neuronal responses in a way very similar to 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate. 2C shows the activity of a typical neurone in an animal treated with ketamine at the onset of ischemia.

For the first ischcmic period the neuronal activity of both kctaminetreated groups was significantly lessthan that of controls (P < 0.05), while in the second ischemic period (30 to 60 rain) the difference was significant for the lower dose only (P < 0.05). 7.

In preliminary recordings from 8 convergent neurones, we monitored the response to the same noxious and innocuous stimuli used in this experiment, applied at 5  Pre-ischaemia Ischaemia  APv  (lpM)  APv  (lOOpM)  Ketamine (lrnM)  (lOOmM) Fig. In 1 neurone, the response to innocuous stimulation increased by 24% at 60 min, compared to the initial response, and remained elevated at similar levels up to 90 min. DISCUSSION  Our results demonstrate that occlusion of the femoral artery induces a neuronal response in the dorsal horn of the rat consistent with sustained noxious stimulation of peripheral nociceptors, even though the hindlimb remained static throughout the experiment. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that ischemia of the rat's tail (unexercised) induced by inflating a cuff at the base of the tail resulted in both an increased firing rate of ventrobasal thalamic neurones in anaesthetised animals and a coordinated escape behaviour in conscious animals, with mean latencies of 12.1 + 1.8 min and 11.9 + 2.1 min, respectively15. These latencies correlate well with our current observation that occlusion of the femoral artery produces an increased activity in dorsal horn neurones with a mean latency of 10.3 + 2.5 min. 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate is a competitive antagonist which has been shown to antagonise the N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitation of ventrobasal thalamic neurones at a dose of 50 mM34'35in vivo, and to inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced depolarisation of spinal dorsal horn neurones at a dose of 10-250 /~M in in vitro slice preparations23'24.The dissociative anaesthetic ketamine has been described recently as a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist4'2°'37.Iontophoretic application of ketamine, in a dose of 50 mM, selectively reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated synaptic excitation of dorsal horn neurones in rats37. Irrigation of the spinal cord with both 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and ketamine resulted in profound inhibition of the firing rate of dorsal horn neurones during ischemia at the lower dose of each drug. The effects of 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and ketamine support the hypothesis that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the rat spinal cord is involved in nociceptive afferent transmission and that antagonists to the receptor inhibit the responses of convergent neurones in the dorsal horn to peripheral noxious stimulation. That the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor has a role specific to nociception is further supported by the observation that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation is not required for activation of motor neutones in the spinal cord, while sensory interneurone N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors do play a role in the spinal cord processing of afferent information41. We have shown that dorsal horn neuronal responses to both noxious pinching and innocuous brushing of the receptive field are not altered by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate in the absence of ischemia. In the presence of the conditioning stimulus, however, both 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and ketamine reduced to pre-ischemic values the neuronal response to noxious stimulation, while neither agent inhibited the response to innocuous stimulation of the receptive field. In other words, the hyperalgesia to noxious mechanical stimulation induced by ischemia was attenuated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, as was the ischemia-induced neuronal activity, while these drugs had no effect on afferent inputs in the absence of a conditioning stimulus. These findings suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor may be involved only in some forms of synaptic excitation in the central nervous system, specifically the neuronal events mediating inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. Dickenson and Sullivan11 found that 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate reduced wind-up and post-stimulus discharges of deep dorsal neurones, without inducing any marked change in the A- and C-fibre evoked inputs onto the same cell. We have found that ischemia also induces hyperalgesia to noxious mechanical stimuli, while neuronal responses to innocuous stimulation of the receptive field remained unaltered during ischemia. In the absence of ischemia, we showed that repeated stimulation of the receptive field using the natural stimuli employed in this experiment did not alter the responses of convergent neurones to subsequent stimuli, nor was there any change in receptive field size. dorsal horn interneurones7'45.In Phencyclidine has been shown to reduce selectively N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitation of mammalian spinal neurones1'4.It is possible that the frequencydependent potentiation of deep dorsal horn nociceptive neurones (wind-up), shown to be N-methyl-D-aspartate dependent11, may be one way in which hyperalgesia is mediated. After ischemia had been present for 60 min, 58% of dorsal horn neurones exhibited peripheral receptive fields which were larger than those prevailing before ischemia. 4 Anis, N.A., Berry, S.C., Burton, N.R. and Lodge, D., The dissociativeanaesthetics, ketamine and phencyclidineselectively reduce excitation of central mammalian neurones by N-methylaspartate, Br.

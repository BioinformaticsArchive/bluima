Currently, the relationship between the cell behaviour and matrix stiffness is being studied for cells seeded on planar substrates, however in three-dimensional microenvironments cells may experience mechanical signalling that is distinct from that on a two-dimensional matrix. We report a microfluidic approach for high-throughput generation of three-dimensional microenvironments with different elasticity for studies of cell fate. The application of the method was demonstrated by encapsulating two mouse embryonic stem cell lines within the agarose microgels. This work establishes a foundation for the high-throughput generation of combinatorial microenvironments with different mechanical properties for cell studies. Cells have developed mechanisms to sense the stiffness of the surrounding matrix by adhering to and pulling upon it, followed by a cytoskeletal cellular response [4]. Matrix stiffness influences many aspects of cell behaviour, e.g., cell motility [5], phagocytosis [6], and differentiation [7]. In particular, recent studies of the relationship between the stiffness of the substrate and the lineage specification of stem cells suggested the need for optimizing the mechanical properties of cellular microenvironments for regenerative applications using progenitor cells. For example, when naïve mesenchymal stem cells were seeded under identical serum conditions onto collagen-coated polyacrylamide gels with various elasticities, the cells specified their lineage towards neurons, myoblasts, and osteoblasts on matrices with low,  * Corresponding author. In other studies, matrix stiffness affected cell adhesion [9], and the formation of myofibroblasts from interstitial cells [10]. Currently, most of the research on the relationship between matrix stiffness and cell behaviour is being conducted for cells seeded on planar substrates, yet, a majority of tissue cells are exposed to three-dimensional environments, that is, they are surrounded by a complex set of extracellular matrix proteins. Matrix forces transmitted to cells in three-dimensional environments are generally different than on planar surfaces. CelleECM interactions provide biochemical and mechanical cues that directly affect cell function [11]. Encapsulation of cells within hydrogel materials with different elasticity enables the investigation of the role of the mechanical properties of three-dimensional environments on cell behaviour. Synthetic and natural hydrogel matrices have been used for cell culture, as well as for tissue-specific differentiation of stem cells [12e15]. Among these studies, the microbead format for cell culture allows the localization of cells within a small amount of a physiologically relevant matrix e a microenvironment e and an easy exchange of nutrients and gases between the encapsulated cells and the surrounding medium [16,17]. doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.033  varying mechanical properties to study the effect of varying matrix composition on cell fate, e.g., cell viability, morphology, or differentiation is yet to be reported. Recently, microfluidics heralded new opportunities for fundamental studies in cell biology [18]. In particular, microfluidics has been used for the generation of well-defined cellular microenvironments by encapsulating cells in droplets or microgels, followed by studies of cell growth and viability [19e21], gene expression [22,23], and enzymatic activity [24e26]. The MF encapsulation strategy offered several important advantages: the ability to create three-dimensional cellular microenvironments (niches) with precisely controlled dimensions and chemical and mechanical properties; the capability to vary the properties of these environments in a high-throughput, combinatorial manner; and a high frequency e on the order of 102 to 103 s1 e of the generation of cellular microenvironments that can be used as massive combinatorial libraries. The primary objective of the current study was to develop a method for the high-throughput generation of hydrogel agarose microbeads (microgels) with varying mechanical properties, which are to be used for the encapsulation of cells and subsequent studies of the effect of matrix elasticity on cell fate. It is extensively used in biomedical research, in particular, in cell culture systems, owing to the following useful properties: it is generally bio-inert, it is non-adsorptive to proteins and nonadhesive to cells, it can be readily functionalized with cell adhesion or other signalling molecules and its mechanical properties can be tuned by varying the agarose concentration in the gel [28e31]. Prior to the preparation of cell-free agarose microgels, the MF device was maintained for 48 h in an oven at 140 C. For cell encapsulation experiments, the sealed MF device was maintained for 12 h in an oven at 140 C and subsequently exposed to the vapour of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (99.9% pure, Sigma, U.S.A.). Prior to cell encapsulation, the MF device was extensively washed with 70 vol.% ethanol/water mixture and then with double distilled water. Cell encapsulation Two murine embryonic stem cell lines were used in the present work: R1 murine embryonic stem cells labelled with Vybrant Cell Tracer carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA SE “green” (Invitrogen)) and YC5eYFPeNEO murine embryonic stem cells transfected to produce yellow fluorescent protein [34]. Each cell suspension was prepared to a concentration of 8  106 cells/mL in agarose solutions in an HBSS (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD) buffer pre-heated to 37 C. Two suspensions containing an equal concentration of cells were supplied to two channels of the MF device, as shown in Fig. Following the gelation of the precursor droplets, microgels were centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 C for 5 min, washed twice with HBSS buffer, and transferred into cell culture media. Microgels laden with R1 or YC5eYFPeNEO murine embryonic stem cells were maintained in cell culture media composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM, Gibco-BRL) supplemented with 15% (v/v) Fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco-BRL), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol (BME, Sigma, St. Louise, MO), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco-BRL), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco-BRL), 50 mg/mL penicillin (Gibco-BRL), 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco-BRL), and 500 pM Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Confluent dishes of murine embryonic stem cells were fed and passaged on alternate days. Fluorescence microscopy images of encapsulated cells were captured using a Zeiss Microscope (Axio Observer D1, U.S.A.) coupled with a digital camera (Axio Cam HRm, Zeiss, U.S.A.). Results and discussion  To develop a method for MF generation of libraries of hydrogel microenvironments with different mechanical properties for cell studies we used the following considerations.  (i) The concentrations of agarose in the concentrated and dilute solutions (supplied as Streams 1 and 2, respectively) had to be such that sufficient mixing occurred in the serpentine channel  and controlled emulsification took place in the MF droplet generator with a geometry shown in Fig. 1; The lower limit of Cag in the precursor droplets was determined by the integrity of the corresponding microgels in HBSS solution at 37 C, that is, under cell culture conditions; (iii) Microgels derived from solutions with varying Cag had to have identical average dimensions; To avoid the potential impact of droplet coalescence on broadening the distribution of sizes of microgels, it was important to achieve sufficient pre-gelation of droplets in the downstream channel of the MF device (complete droplet gelation was carried out off-chip); (v) To achieve a 100% cell encapsulation efficiency, we used the Poisson distribution equation as in [35]  ellx P(x, l) = (2) x! where P(x,l) is the fraction of microgels containing x cells, and l an average number of cells per microgel. For the concentration of cells in the droplet phase of 8  106 cell/mL, we estimated that a 100% encapsulation efficiency would be achieved by generating droplets with a diameter of 110 mm. The values of G′ were determined at 4 C (the temperature of microgel preparation), room temperature (25 C), and 37 C (the temperature of cell culture). To further mimic cell culture conditions, the gels were transferred into a PBS solution and incubated overnight at 37 C. In cell encapsulation experiments, we used R1 and YC5eYFPe NEO murine embryonic stem cells suspended in the droplet phase to a concentration of 8  106 cells/mL. The representative images of R1 and YC5eYFPeNEO murine embryonic stem cells encapsulated in the agarose microgels are shown in Fig. Following the encapsulation of murine embryonic stem cells in agarose microgels, cell viability was determined to be 79.6  2.5% and 80.0  1.6% for R1 and YC5eYFPeNEO murine embryonic stem cells,  b 600  G' (Pa)  400  200  0  0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0  Fig. 7.

Optical microscopy images were taken and cell [7] viability tests were performed immediately after the transfer of the [8] cell-laden microgels into HBSS buffer. Conclusions  [10]  We have demonstrated an MF method for the continuous, fast, high-throughput generation of agarose-based three-dimensional cellular micro- [11] environments with precisely controlled dimensions and varying [12] mechanical properties. The method paves the way for efficient studies of the effect of microenvironment elasticity on the behav-[13] iour of cells, which, after incubation within agarose microgels, can be analyzed by optical microscopy and flow cytometry. The method can be extended to the generation of combinatorial of libraries of [14] cellular microenvironments from a large number of biological [15] polymers.

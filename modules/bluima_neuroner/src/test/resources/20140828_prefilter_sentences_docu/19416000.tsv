19416000	Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right lateral cervical mass was performed with the thyroglobulin concentration of the fine-needle aspiration biopsy washout liquid being >300 ng/mL and the cytology showing lymphoid elements mixed with polymorphous epithelial cells with atypical nuclei, suggesting lymph node metastasis from a cancer of epithelial origin. The great majority are papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (micro-PTCs) and have an excellent prognosis after surgical treatment (1â€“4). ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lymph node was performed and cytology displayed lymphoid elements mixed with polymorphous epithelial cells with atypical nuclei, suggesting a lymph node metastasis from a cancer of epithelial origin. Thyroid histological examination identified a unifocal micro-papillary thyroid carcinoma (3-mm maximum diameter) in the middle left lobe, composed of papillae lined by a layer of columnar epithelial cells containing nuclei with ground-glass appearance.

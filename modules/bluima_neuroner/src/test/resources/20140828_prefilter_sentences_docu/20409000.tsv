20409000	SUMMARY  Expression of BZI-1DN, a dominant-negative form of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) basic leucine zipper transcription factor BZI-1 leads to severe defects in pollen development which coincides with reduced transcript abundance of the stamen specific invertase gene NIN88 and decreased extracellular invertase enzymatic activity. Pollen development proceeds by meiotic division of the pollen mother cells to form a tetrad of haploid microspores each embedded in a callose envelope and surrounded by a callose cell wall. Enzymatic degradation of  callose leads to release of the microspores, followed by pollen mitosis I, giving rise to a large vegetative cell and a small generative sperm cell. In many plant species a second pollen mitosis of the generative cell occurs before pollen release, leading to a tricellular pollen. Alternatively, pollen mitosis takes place after pollen germination (bicellular pollen) (Scott et al., 2004). The tapetum cell layer surrounds the pollen sack and has a critical role in the nourishment of the microspores. As pollen cells are symplastically isolated from the energy supply of the source, transported sucrose is broken down by extracellular invertases in the apoplast to facilitate import of hexoses into the pollen. Transcription of the NIN88 stamen-specific invertase gene and extracellular invertase activity are reduced in BZI-1DN stamina  The pollen from BZI-1DN plants show a phenotype which resembles the one described for transgenic plants impaired in the stamen specific extracellular invertase NIN88 (Goetz et al., 2001; Hirsche et al., 2009). Extracellular invertase activity increases during pollen development and is proposed to act as an essential component controlling carbohydrate supply of the developing pollen (Goetz et al., 2001). In contrast, extracellular invertase activity assayed in BZI-1DN derived pollen does not show this strong increase (Figure 2b).

Transcription of the tobacco extracellular invertase gene NIN88 and the corresponding enzyme activity is impaired in BZI-1DN plants. (b) Extracellular invertase enzymatic activity has been assayed from wildtype (black bars) and BZI-1DN-derived pollen (gray bars) as defined in (a). As demonstrated in Figure 7, BZI-1 and BZI-2 are clearly co-expressed in the tapetum as well as during all phases of pollen development, in particular in mother cells, tetrads and binucleate pollen, enabling formation of heterodimers, which have been shown to activate transcription of target genes. Along this line, the corresponding pollen preparations show that extracellular invertase activity during late stamina development is strongly reduced (Figure 8a). Accordingly, extracellular  Figure 7. Spatial and temporal expression of BZI-1, BZI-2 and BZI-4 compared at different stages of pollen development. Given are in situ hybridisation data of younger stages characterised by the presence of pollen mother cells, tetrade stages after meiosis, binucleate pollen grains, and stages where maturated pollen grains are already isolated and therefore lost during the preparation. Whereas pollen from NIN88 antisense plants are arrested in the unicellular microspore stage, two nuclei were observed by DAPI staining in BZI-1DN pollen indicating that the block occurs at a different stage of pollen development (AS, TR unpublished results).

(a) Extracellular invertase enzyme activity (pool 3 according to Figure 2a) has been measured in stamina derived from wildtype, BZI-4-Oex and BZI-1DN plants. As BZI-4 does not show transcriptional activation or active repression properties in plant cells, we propose that by DNA binding BZI-4 homodimers efficiently block activation of target genes. Accordingly, BZI-4-Oex plants show reduced NIN88 transcription and extracellular invertase enzyme activity in pollen.

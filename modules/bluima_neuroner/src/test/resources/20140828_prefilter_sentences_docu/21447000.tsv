In animal models, chronic alcohol ingestion decreases glutathione (GSH), an important cellular antioxidant in the alveolar space (Bechara et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2001; Holguin et al., 1998). Synthesis of GSH depends on cysteine, and there is recent evidence that cysteine and its oxidized counterpart cystine (Cyss) function as an important extracellular redox pair, while GSH and its oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), operate more at the intracellular level (Iyer et al., 2009). Antioxidant defenses, of which cysteine and GSH are just 2 components, are vital for cellular protection against oxidative stress. When faced with such stresses, cells respond by activating the antioxidant response element, a genetic program that is regulated by its major transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. The recovered sample was centrifuged at 405Ã—g for 7 minutes, and the cell pellet was resuspended for cell count determination using a hemocytometer. Following cell count determination, a smear was made to evaluate for cell types, which showed >90% macrophages. To control for dilution by the lavage procedure, the GSH, GSSG, cysteine, and Cyss concentrations in extracellular lung fluid were normalized via the urea method. Determination of Nuclear Binding of PU.1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 by electrophoretic mobility shift assay electrophoretic mobility shift assay for PU.1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nuclear binding was performed to determine nuclear binding in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Interestingly, and as opposed to PU.1 binding in cells from control-fed rats where zinc treatment had no effect, zinc treatment appeared to increase nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nuclear binding in alveolar macrophages from control-fed rats (lane 2 vs. lane 1). Therefore, we next determined the effects of dietary zinc on the status of the important extracellular thiol pair, cysteine, and Cyss, in the airways of alcohol-fed rats. 6 are not restricted to zinc treatment of cells in vitro. Both phagocytosis and intracellular killing of ingested organisms are essential functions of the alveolar macrophage that are impaired by chronic alcohol ingestion. These findings are consistent with earlier recognition that granulocyte / monocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling is absolutely required for normal alveolar macrophage maturation and function (Shibata et al., 2001; Trapnell and Whitsett, 2002), and that its receptor-triggered signaling is mediated by its master transcription factor, PU.1. granulocyte / monocyte colony-stimulating factor was first discovered in mouse lung extracts and found to be primarily secreted by alveolar epithelial type II cells (Shibata et al., 2001; Trapnell and Whitsett, 2002). This is important because one of the major cellular consequences of alcoholism is increased oxidative stress, which has many implications and contributes significantly to the overall alcoholic lung phenotype (Guidot and Hart, 2005; Joshi and Guidot, 2007).

Indeed, some animal studies have shown the relationship between melatonin and extra-hypothalamic neuronal functions including the striatal serotonergic system (19,20). These results suggest that the region including serotonin cell bodies is not affected and that terminal fields are not always influenced. The altered serotonergic system in the striatum during adult period might influence the activity of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to this area (36). However, contents in monoamines in terminal fields of the monoamine neurons could be determined not only by metabolic rates but also the innervations of the neurons.

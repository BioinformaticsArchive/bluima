21496000	images in haematology  Pseudo-angiomatous growth pattern in recurrent plasma cell myeloma  A 57-year-old male patient was found to have a rising immunoglobulin G lambda paraprotein (23 g/dl), 12 months following a matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant for plasma cell myeloma. Trephine biopsy sections showed a heavy infiltrate of cytologically atypical plasma cells with an unusual pseudo-angiomatous growth pattern, the plasma cells lining vessel-like spaces (`blood lakes') filled with red blood cells and plasma (left). Immunohistochemistry showed that the plasma cells expressed lambda light chain (right) and CD138. The presence of endothelial cells in the pseudoangiomatous structures was excluded by negative staining for CD31 and CD34.This morphological pattern is rare, although it has been described in three previous cases of plasmacytoma/plasma cell myeloma. It has been suggested that the pseudo-angiomatous pattern reflects a  form of tumour angioneogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor, a cytokine expressed in up to 90% of myeloma cases, which is a potent inducer of vascular permeability and an endothelial cell mitogen. Although this particular histological pattern is rare in biopsy specimens, angiogenesis is now recognised to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of plasma cell myeloma, and underpins the success of thalidomide therapy in the disease.

18097000	T cell-specific deletion of TNFR-associated factor 6 (TNFR-associated factor 6- T) was recently shown to result in the development of multiorgan inflammatory disease and the resistance of responder T cells to suppression by CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells. We have determined that the loss of TNFR-associated factor 6 restores the ability of CD28 / T cells to proliferate and produce IL-2. Consistent with this, TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells were resistant to anergizing signals both in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal that in addition to its role in rendering T cells susceptible to control by CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells, TNFR-associated factor 6 is essential for the induction of T cell anergy, implicating TNFR-associated factor 6 as a critical mediator of peripheral tolerance. Peripheral tolerance in CD4 T cells is maintained by several mechanisms including deletion of autoreactive T cells, suppression by regulatory T cells, and functional inactivation or anergy (1, 2). Although it is clear that breakdown of any of these mechanisms can lead to the development of autoimmune disease, the molecular pathways associated with T cell peripheral tolerance are not well understood. Normal T cell activation requires integrated signaling from both TCR and CD28. CD28 costimulation acts by amplifying TCR-mediated signaling events and is thought to lower the threshold required for a productive T cell response (3, 4). Turka,† and Yongwon Choi2*  uitin ligases including Cbl-b, Itch, and Grail have been implicated in the development and maintenance of T cell anergy (6 – 10). Anergized T cells express higher levels of these E3 ligases, and T cells deficient in these E3 ligases are resistant to anergy induction. Coordinated activity of these E3 ubiquitin ligases is postulated to down-regulate T cell activation by proteasomal degradation or altered subcellular compartmentalization of T cell signaling components (14). Recently, our group identified a T cell-intrinsic role for TNFR-associated factor 6 in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance (19). T cell-specific deletion of TNFR-associated factor 6 (TNFR-associated factor 6- T) resulted in the resistance of T cells to suppression by control CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells and the subsequent development of multiorgan inflammatory disease. TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells efficiently proliferated in response to stimulation with anti-CD3 alone and exhibited enhanced activation of PI3K and Akt, indicating independence from the normal requirement for CD28 costimulation. Together, these data suggested a negative regulatory role for TNFR-associated factor 6 in costimulation-dependent T cell activation. Given the role of costimulatory signals in preventing the development of anergy both in vitro and in vivo, we investigated the susceptibility of TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells to anergy induction. We now report that TNFR-associated factor 6 deficiency relieves the requirement for costimulation to elicit productive T cell responses and renders T cells resistant to anergizing signals.

Cell purification  Single cell suspensions from spleen and lymph nodes were incubated with biotin anti-B220, biotin anti-IAb, biotin-anti-Gr1, and biotin-anti-CD8 followed by streptavidin microbeads. CD4 T cells were negatively selected after separation from bead-bound cells over a magnetic column. CD4 T cell purity was checked by FACS and typically ranged between 85 and 95%. Where indicated, naive (CD62LhighCD44low) CD4 T cells were isolated by cell sorting on a FACSDiVa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Purified CD4 T cells were stimulated with the indicated dose of plate-bound anti-CD3. For anergy experiments, purified CD4 T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (1 g/ml) in the presence of irradiated APCs with or without soluble CTLA4-Ig (15 g/ml). For Cbl-b expression levels, purified T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 g/ml) and soluble CTLA4-Ig (15 g/ml). One week later, splenic and lymph node CD4 V 5 T cells were isolated and CFSE labeled. T cells were then subcutaneously injected into congenic B6 Thy1.1 recipients followed by immunization with OVA peptide (50 g) in CFA. V 5 positive cells were analyzed for CFSE dye dilution. After 7 days, CD4 V 8 T cells were purified and stimulated in vitro with the indicated dose of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B and irradiated APCs. SDS gel-loading buffer was added to cell lysates and samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Results and Discussion  TNFR-associated factor 6 deficiency uncouples the normal requirement for CD28 costimulation Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells efficiently proliferate in response to stimulation with anti-CD3 alone (19). Because normal T cell activation requires cooperative signals from both TCR and CD28, these findings suggested removal of the re-  quirement for CD28 costimulation. No abnormalities in T cell development or peripheral T cell populations were observed in TNFR-associated factor 6- T CD28 / mice. However, similar to TNFR-associated factor 6- T mice, 8- to 10-wk-old mice doubly deficient for TNFR-associated factor 6 and CD28 exhibited the accumulation of activated (CD69 ) and effector/memory (CD44highCD62low) T cells in vivo (Fig. 1a). CD28 / deficiency in T cells results in profoundly reduced proliferation and a complete defect in IL-2 production following CD3 stimulation (19) and, as expected, sorted naive T cells from control CD28 / mice responded poorly to stimulation with anti-CD3 in vitro (Fig. 1, b and c). In contrast, TNFR-associated factor 6- T CD28 / T cells proliferated and produced IL-2 at levels similar to those of control CD28-sufficient T cells (Fig. 1, b and c). These data indicate that the absence of TNFR-associated factor 6 restores the ability of CD28 / T cells to respond efficiently to CD3 stimulation. TNFR-associated factor 6-deficient CD4 T cells resist anergy induction both in vitro and in vivo. TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cell independence from  FIGURE 1. TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells uncouple the requirement for CD28 costimulation. a, Expression of CD69, CD62 ligand, and CD44 on splenic CD4 T cells from control CD28 / and TNFR-associated factor 6- T CD28 / mice was measured by FACS analysis. Plots are gated on live CD3 CD4 T cells and TNFR-associated factor 6- T (bold black line) histogram is overlaid on control (gray-shaded) histogram. b, Sorted naive CD4 T cells from control CD28 / and TNFR-associated factor 6- T CD28 / mice were stimulated with the indicated doses of platebound anti-CD3 for 72 h. c, Sorted naive CD4 T cells from control and TNFR-associated factor 6- T mice were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 g/ml) with or without soluble CD28 (2 g/ ml) or PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 M). CD28 costimulation suggested that TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells might also be resistant to anergy induction, a normal result of TCR ligation in the absence of costimulation. To test this, we stimulated TNFR-associated factor 6- T and control T cells with anti-CD3 in the presence or absence of soluble CTLA4-Ig and irradiated APCs. T cell responses were measured following secondary stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3. Although anergy was efficiently induced in control T cells, the costimulatory blockade in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells did not impair their ability to proliferate or produce IL-2 (Fig. 2, a and b). Because CD28 signals are known to promote survival in addition to preventing anergy, we next examined the viability of control and TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells following in vitro stimulation. No differences in survival were observed between control and TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells (Fig. 2c), indicating that TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cell resistance to anergy induction was not due to enhanced survival. To examine T cell anergy induction in vivo, we used an adoptive transfer model with OT-II TCR-transgenic mice (19). Administration of high-dose Ag has been shown to induce a hyporesponsive state in Ag-specific T cells (7, 20). Ten days after the initial injection, CD4 V 5 T cells were isolated, CFSE labeled, and injected into congenic recipients followed by immunization with the OVA peptide in CFA. As expected, T cells from both PBStreated control and TNFR-associated factor 6- T mice proliferated in response to OVA challenge (Fig. 3a). This proliferation was abrogated in OVA-tolerized control T cells. In contrast, T cells from OVAinjected TNFR-associated factor 6- T mice maintained their ability to proliferate, indicating the resistance of TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells in anergy induction in vivo (Fig. 3a). Consistent with these data, T cells  FIGURE 3. TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells are resistant to anergy induction in vivo. a and b, Control OT-II and TNFR-associated factor 6- T OT-II mice were injected with either PBS or OVA peptide on days 0 and 3. a, On day 10, V 5 T cells were purified, CFSE labeled, and injected into Thy congenic recipients followed by immunization with OVA in CFA. b, ON day 10, V 5 T cells were purified and restimulated in vitro with OVA Ag. c, On day 7, V 8 CD4 T cells were isolated and stimulated in vitro for 72 h with the indicated dose of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B and irradiated APCs. TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells are resistant to anergy induction in vitro. Control or TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 ( CD3; 1 g/ ml) and irradiated APCs with or without CTLA4-Ig. After 72 h, cells were washed and cultured for an additional 24 h before restimulation with platebound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28. c, Control or TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells were stimulated with plate-bound antiCD3 (1 g/ml) or without anti-CD28 (2 g/ml). CD4 T cell survival was determined by FACS analysis after staining with the vital dye 7-aminoactinomycin D. from OVA-tolerized wild-type mice failed to produce IL-2 in response to Ag restimulation in vitro, while OVA tolerization failed to anergize TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells restimulated under the same conditions (Fig. 3b). Injection of mice with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B results in the selective expansion of V 8 T cells followed by their contraction (21). Remaining V 8 T cells are unresponsive to subsequent Staphylococcal enterotoxin B stimulation and are thus rendered functionally anergic (21). As expected, 7 days after injection with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, CD4 V 8 T cells from control mice exhibited impaired in vitro proliferation in response to stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Fig. 3c). The enhanced proliferation observed by TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells was not due to an abnormal deletion of V 8 T cells, as both control and TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells underwent similar expansion and contraction phases in response to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Fig. 3d). TNFR-associated factor 6-deficient T cells exhibit abnormal regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b  Independence from CD28 costimulation and impaired anergy induction in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells suggested that the negative regulation of costimulatory pathways might be defective in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells. Consistent with this, previous work in our laboratory showed that TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells exhibit enhanced activation of PI3K and Akt (22). Because Cbl-b / T cells can also respond to CD3 in the absence of CD28 and have recently been shown to resist anergy induction (6, 7), we next examined Cbl-b regulation in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells. Surprisingly, while control CD4 T cells stimulated under anergizing conditions strongly up-regulated Cbl-b mRNA and protein expression, TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells exhibited delayed and reduced expression of Cbl-b, a difference that was maintained at both early and later time points (Fig. 4). However, expression of other E3 ubiquitin ligases reported to be important in anergy induction, including Itch and Grail, were not altered in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells (data not shown). Concluding remarks  The data presented here conclusively demonstrate a role for TNFR-associated factor 6 in the induction of T cell anergy. Control and TNFR-associated factor 6- T CD4 T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 g/ml) and CTLA-4-Ig (15 g/ml). b, Cbl-b protein expression was measured from whole cell lysates and represents four independently performed experiments. functional T cell responses and results in dysregulation of Cbl-b, an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for anergy induction. Indeed, previous work in our laboratory showed that TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells exhibit enhanced activation of PI3K and Akt, both signaling mediators downstream from CD28 ligation (19). In addition, T cells deficient for PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), a negative regulator of PI3K activation, are also resistant to anergy induction, and mice with T cell-specific deletion of PTEN develop lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease (24, 25). Thus, it is possible that decreased Cbl-b expression in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells is responsible for the hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt, which in turn renders TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells resistant to anergy induction. However, as Cbl-b has also been implicated in phospholipase C and protein kinase C ubiquitination and degradation following anergy induction (6, 7), it will be important to examine the expression patterns of these and other known Cbl-b targets in TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells. Taken together with our previous finding that TNFR-associated factor 6- T T cells are resistant to suppression by CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells, the data presented here suggest that signals initiated by distinct T cell extrinsic factors, such as tolerizing APCs or CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells, result in the activation of common molecular signaling components, and place TNFR-associated factor 6 at a central point of convergence for the interpretation of these tolerizing signals.

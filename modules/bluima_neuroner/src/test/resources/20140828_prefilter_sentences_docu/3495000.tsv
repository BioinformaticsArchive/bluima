3495000	Since MPTP causes selective dopaminergic neurotoxicity when infused directly into rat substantia nigra, we hypothesized that systemic MPTP may be metabolized by monoamine oxidase and/or other enzymes in rat brain capillaries and possibly other peripheral organs and thus prevented from reaching its neuronal sites of toxicity. Systemic administration of small quantities of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to humans and other primates destroys nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and causes an acute and irreversible parkinsonian syndrome (1-5). Although selective uptake of MPP+ by dopaminergic neurons may explain the relative specificity of MPTP toxicity (11), many of the mechanisms that underlie the toxicity remain unknown (see ref. Although systemic MPTP does not cause nigrostriatal abnormalities in the rat, direct infusion of MPTP into rat substantia nigra selectively destroys zona compacta dopaminergic neurons and depletes striatal dopamine and its metabolites (14, 15). The results also support the concept of a "chemical" blood-brain barrier (19) that complements the "physical" blood-brain barrier with its tight endothelial cell junctions and few pinocytotic vesicles, by metabolizing substances that are not excluded by the physical barrier. The first concerns the purity of microvessels, and the possibility that any of the results could be due to contamination of microvessels with neuronal or glial elements. Another concern is the cellular heterogeneity of microvessels, which in addition to endothelium, contain pericytes and a minor component of smooth muscle cells (26). Since endothelial cells constitute the major component of microvessels, we believe that most of the MAO in rat brain microvessels is located in these cells. When MPTP and MPP+ were infused directly into the rat substantia nigra, MPTP selectively destroyed dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta, without affecting other neurons or glia at the injection site (15). We suspect that, in the rat, systemic MPTP is actively metabolized to MPP+ in brain microvessels, and the MPP+ thus formed is either dispersed into the blood or interacts with endothelial cell membranes. Such interaction may have adverse effects on endothelial cells, but in view of their short life span (33) they, unlike neurons, are better suited to withstand the cumulative toxic effects of MPTP. In particular, care should be exercised when using MAO inhibitors that primarily affect MAO in brain microvessels and peripheral tissues but which have only minor effects on neuronal and glial MAO.

This technique can also be combined with other techniques, including focal microinjection of potential agents into specific brain sites to suppress seizures, and chronic neuronal recording with implanted electrodes to observe neuronal correlates of brain sites that are contained in the neuronal network for seizures (e.g., Faingold and Riaz, 1994). Emergent properties of CNS neuronal networks as targets for pharmacology: Application to anticonvulsant drug action. Increased responsiveness of pontine reticular formation neurons associated with audiogenic seizure susceptibility during ethanol withdrawal. Decreased GABA effectiveness in the inferior colliculus neurons during ethanol withdrawal in rats susceptible to audiogenic seizures. Audiogenic seizures during ethanol withdrawal changes in amino acid neurotransmission and neuronal response patterns in the inferior colliculus and the brainstem reticular formation. Neurons in the periaqueductal gray are critically involved in the neuronal network for audiogenic seizures during ethanol withdrawal.

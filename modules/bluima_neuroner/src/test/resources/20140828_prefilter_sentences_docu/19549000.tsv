19549000	Subsequently, 300 ml was concentrated to about 2 ml in an amicon 8200 stirred cell unit (Millipore, USA) using polyacrylonitrile membrane disc of 63.5 mm diameter, providing 28.7 cm2 surface area for filtration. In the absence of a cellculture system or a small laboratory animal (except monkeys) it was not possible to assess the infectivity of the virus-recovered from the various units. Viral samples inactivated by heat or UV treatment produce significantly lower signal strength that paralleled infectivity of the sample in cultured cells (Bhattacharya et al. 2004).

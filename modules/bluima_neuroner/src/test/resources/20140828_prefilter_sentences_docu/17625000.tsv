17625000	We examined, at the cellular level, gene expression in the frontal cortex of cirrhotic alcoholics. Functionally related groups of genes were identified that are involved in cell adhesion, mitochondrial function, synaptic transmission, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. Both astrocytes and neuronal cells were affected at the transcriptional level. The regulated genes are involved in neurite growth, neuronal cell adhesion, synaptic vesicle release, and postsynaptic neurotransmission. Genes involved in cell adhesion, mitochondrial function, and synaptic transmission were over-represented in the list of down-regulated genes, while genes involved in apoptosis and mitosis were over-represented in the list of up-regulated genes. Thus, the expression levels of astrocytic-specific genes in the cirrhotic alcoholics were compared with those in noncirrhotic alcoholics to study the possible effects of cirrhosis on astrocytes at the transcriptional level. A previous study identified approximately 153 astrocyte-specific genes in mouse brain (Bachoo et al., 2004). selected based on UniGene Cluster IDs, and 79 astrocyte-specific genes (represented by 112 clones) were detected in both groups of alcoholics. Hierarchical clustering was performed on the 21 cases based on the expression level of 112 astrocyte-specific clones (Fig. 2A). Panel (A): clustering based on 112 astrocyte-specific clones and Panel (B): clustering based on 125 genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. astrocyte-specific genes except 1 (A3). Other genes such as aquaporin 4, transmembrane 4 superfamily member 2, and phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 were down-regulated. In order to exclude the possibility that the separation of the 2 groups was a result of systematic bias, a similar hierarchical clustering was performed on genes (125 clones) involved in carbohydrate metabolism, a universal cellular process (Fig. 2B). In addition to the glial cells, cirrhosis may also affect neuronal cells at the mRNA level. Genes were identified that are neuron-specific or predominantly expressed in neuronal cells based on available information resources (LocusLink, OMIM, PubMed, Gene Ontology, SWISS-Prot, and GeneCard). Of the 15,833 detected genes, a total of 213 (represented by 285 clones) were identified as neuronal genes. Hierarchical clustering of the 285 neuronal clones demonstrates that the cirrhotic alcoholics clustered together (Fig. 3). Over half of neuronal genes were down-regulated in cirrhotic alcoholics, indicated by the green bar along the right side of the graph. These regulated neuronal genes were then placed in cellular context (Fig. 4). Clusters of genes involved in neurite growth, neuronal cell adhesion, presynaptic vesicle release machinery, and postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors were identified. The majority of the postsynaptic genes and neuronal cell adhesion genes were down-regulated in cirrhotic alcoholics. Genes encoding secreted neuropeptides were also down-regulated, while genes involved in neural cytoskeleton structure and control of transcription in neurons were regulated. Widespread changes in gene expression were observed with both glial- and neuron-related transcripts. Genes involved in neurite growth, neuronal cell adhesion, and synaptic transmission were inhibited at the mRNA level in cirrhotic alcoholics. Our previous studies showed that the expression level of genes involved in cellular functions such as cell adhesion, myelination, and protein trafficking were altered by alcohol (Liu et al., 2005). Hierarchical clustering based on 285 neuron-specific clones (representing 213 unique genes). The regulated neuronal genes in a neuron cellular context. tion, transcriptional changes in cirrhotic alcoholics was also apparent at the functional group level, including cell adhesion, ion channel, synaptic transmission, and mitochondrial function. Proper cell adhesion is critical for cellular communications within and between neurons and glial cells. Studies of other neurological diseases suggest that alteration in mitochondrial machinery may result in cellular dysfunction and even cell death (Betts et al., 2004; Polster and Fiskum, 2004). The current study suggests that concomitant liver cirrhosis may specifically alter gene expression in astrocytes. In addition to providing basic structural support, they can also produce trophic factors for neurons, maintain the concentrations of ions and neurotransmitters in the extracellular space, and remove neurotoxins and cellular debris in the brain (Aschner et al., 2002). The main target of this neurotoxin is brain astrocytes (Norenberg et al., 2004). In addition, ammonia can induce mitochondrial permeability transition in cultured astrocytes possibly through increased oxidative stress, therefore causing dysfunction of astrocytes (Norenberg et al., 2004). Several astrocyte-specific genes were up regulated. ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 is a cholesterol efflux pump in the cellular lipid removal pathway. It may be involved in removal of toxic excessive cellular cholesterol (Kellner-Weibel et al., 2003). apolipoprotein E, which mediates transport and metabolism of lipoproteins, was also up regulated in cirrhotic alcoholics. Another protein, microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione to various hydrophobic electrophiles, and therefore is also involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress (Maeda et al., 2005; Nebert and Vasiliou, 2004). The up-regulation of these genes suggests an increased level of oxidative stress in astrocytes of cirrhotic alcoholic brains. Several other astrocyte-specific genes were significantly down-regulated. aquaporin 4 is the major water channel in human brain (Venero et al., 2001). aquaporin 4-null mutant mice show a water imbalance and deregulated neural signal transduction (Manley et al., 2004). transmembrane 4 superfamily member 2 is a cell surface glycoprotein that is thought to be involved in the control of neurite growth and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., X-linked mental  retardation) (Zemni et al., 2000). phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 diverts astrocytes from TNF-a-triggered apoptosis, and therefore plays a protective role in astrocyte survival (Sharif et al., 2003). It is also involved in regulating actions of the ERK MAP kinase cascade in a cell (Renault et al., 2003). A number of genes involved in neuronal activity were altered, and the majority of these were down-regulated. Genes involved in neuronal cell adhesion and neurite growth are essential components for proper development of neural plasticity (Kiss and Muller, 2001; Yamagata et al., 2003). In addition, down-regulation of neuronal genes involved in neurotransmitter release machinery and neurotransmitter receptor systems also suggests an overall inhibition of neuronal transmission in cirrhotic alcoholics. Alteration of neuronal gene expression in this brain region may contribute to the further impairment in movement and cognitive function in cirrhotic alcoholics (Arria et al., 1991; Butterworth, 1994). Long-term alcohol exposure results in sustained liver inflammation and elevated serum level of cytokines by Kupffer cells (e.g., TNF-a). As a result, cellular functions of neurons and glial cells are both affected, including cell communication, signal transduction, ion transport, and mitochondrial function. In glial cells, programmed cell death is induced, which is manifested as more severe brain atrophy. Glial cell death stimulates cell proliferation of progenitor cells through mitosis. In neuronal cells, synaptic transmission is inhibited, which may cause more severe cognitive dysfunction. The extent of neuronal loss between alcoholics with and without liver cirrhosis is similar (Kril, 1995); thus, the elevated expression level of apoptosis genes is likely to occur mostly in glial cells, which may also explain the more severe brain atrophy in cirrhotic relative to noncirrhotic alcoholics. However, cell death may also occur in neuronal cells as a result of increased levels of cytokines in the brain, at least in the hippocampus (Zou and Crews, 2005).

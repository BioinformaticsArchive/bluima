1473000	During stable recording of neuronal activity, cholecystokinin. is an analogue of glucose which impairs intracellular glucose metabolism and this produces glucopenia and reduces sympathetic activity to interscapnlar brown adipose tissue 16a7 but stimulates the adrenal nerve to release norepinephrine and epinephrinea6. A recent study using L-glutamate, a stimulator of neuronal activity, has provided a~litional understanding of the systeml'a7. Choleeystokinin has been shown to produce an excitatory effect on neuronal activity of ventromedial hypothalamie nucleus neurons32. The injection of glutamate into the ventromedial hypothalamie nucleus uniformly increases sympathetic activity and this may occur through the effects of L-glutamate on these neurons. Choleeystokinin on neuronal activity of lateral hypothalamic area neuronsa2. Choleeystokinin-containing neurons in the brain6,3s. Choleeystokinin neurons as, and the cholecystokinin. Choleeystokinin neurons innervating both regions play a role in the regulation of sympathetic nerve activity to interscapnlar brown adipose tissue.

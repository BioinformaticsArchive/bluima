21597000	Samples with a [100] or [110] surface normal were loaded in diamond anvil cells together with a small ruby chip, using either helium or neon as pressure transmitting medium. We used a 3 × 3× 3 supercell containing 108 atoms, which was sampled by using a 6 × 6 × 6 k-points mesh generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.

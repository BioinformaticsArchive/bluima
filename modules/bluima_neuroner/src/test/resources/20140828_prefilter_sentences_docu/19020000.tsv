As early as 1867, fibroblasts (they were called contractile cellular elements at the time) were thought to be descendents of migrating leukocytes.1 These fibroblasts were subsequently classified as type I (of three types) interstitial cells by Bohman3 and were thought to be a relatively homogeneous cell population. Some preexisting, resident fibroblasts convert to myofibroblasts during fibrogenesis, the term myofibroblast implying the de novo expression of -smooth muscle actin ( -SMA), whose expression is otherwise typically or physiologically confined to vascular smooth muscle cells.

A number of groups have demonstrated a tubular origin for fibroblasts,7,9 the most conclusive evidence coming from a study by Iwano et al. using lineage-tagged proximal tubular epithelial cells in a model of unilateral ureteral obstruction. That study demonstrated that up to 36% of all matrix-producing cells within the tubulointerstitial space may be of tubular epithelial origin, up to 12% of bone marrow origin, and the rest presumably of residential origin.10 Regarding the potential bone marrow origin of fibroblasts, Roufosse et al.12 used a transgenic mouse expressing both luciferase and -galactosidase reporter molecules under control of the promoter for the 2 chain of type I collagen and identified a mean of 8.6% of -SMA–positive cells being of bone marrow origin in renal fibrosis; however, these cells were negative for collagen and thus do not seem to participate in matrix synthesis. In analogy to an important source of fibroblasts in tumors,13 Wiggins et al.14 a number of years ago also proposed periadventitial cells as yet another possible source of activated fibroblasts; however, these cells at the time were not clearly characterized in the kidney. In this issue of JASN, Zeisberg et al.15 implicate endothelial cells as an alternative fibroblast precursors and add yet another way for the generation of fibroblasts to enter the fibrosis puzzle. Using three different murine models of fibrosis, the group found 30 to 50% of interstitial cells coexpress the endothelial marker CD31 with fibroblast/myofibroblast markers fibroblast-specific protein 1 and -SMA. The unilateral ureteral obstruction model displayed a somewhat lower percentage of fibroblasts deriving from endothelial cells compared with the streptozotocin diabetes and Alport models, despite similar degrees of fibrosis, although the kidneys in the last two models had longer exposure to persistent injury. This promoter is endothelial cell specific and independent of any subsequent phenotypic changes.

The transcription factor, Snail, again very comparable to what has been described previously in EMT, is required for TGF- induction, at least in embryonic stem cell– derived endothelial cells.18 We have learned in recent years that cellular plasticity is much higher than previously thought, be it for epithelial or, as now shown, for endothelial cells; in fact, traditional teaching is that endothelia-lining blood vessels and lymphatics are a specialized form of epithelia. Apparently, cells may walk down a number of different roads to become a fibroblast or myofibroblast. Zeisberg et al. have taught us that endothelial cells should not be overlooked in renal fibrogenesis.

The excess risk for death in hepatitis C virus-positive patients was partially attributed to chronic liver disease with its attendant complications, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. A newly described entity that needs to be considered in this circumstance is so-called “occult hepatitis C virus infection,” which refers to detection of hepatitis C virus viremia (hepatitis C virus RNA) in hepatocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence in serum of conventional serologic or virologic evidence of infection. Support for existence of this entity comes from the observation that hepatitis C virus, although a hepatotropic virus, also can replicate at extrahepatic sites, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells.6

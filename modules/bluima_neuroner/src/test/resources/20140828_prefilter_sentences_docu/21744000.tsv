Materials and methods  hemagglutinin genes and cells  Two hemagglutinin genes (plasmids) of representative Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/05 (accession no. 293T, MDCK, HeLa and DF-1 cells used in the pseudotype neutralization test were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and antibiotics at 37 C in 5% CO2. Expression of recombinant hemagglutinin proteins  Briefly, Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells were propagated and maintained in Sf-900 II SFM (Gibco BRL). The Spodoptera frugiperda cells were then co-transfected with the transfer vector and linearized baculovirus DNA (Invitrogen) to produce a recombinant baculoviruses containing the hemagglutinin gene. rHA proteins were expressed from the Sf-9 cells after 3 h post-infection. The supernatant from infected Sf-9 cells was collected and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (GE Healthcare), using 6-His tags that had been added to the C-termini of the hemagglutinin proteins. After a final boost, the mice were sacrificed, the splenocytes were fused with sp2/0 cells, and the hybridoma cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum at 37 C in 5% CO2. Western blotting was used to confirm the expression of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in 293T cells. pcDNA3.1-neuraminidase, and the backbone plasmid pNL4-3 encoding HIV gag-pol and a firefly luciferase reporter gene were introduced together into 293T cells to produce a pseudotype virus. The mixture was then applied to MDCK, HeLa or DF-1 cells in 96-well plates. The infection efficiency was quantified by measuring the luciferase activity in the target cells with an EG&G Berthold Microplate Luminometer LB 96V. (B) HeLa and DF-1 cells, from a human and a bird, respectively, were used to compare the infection efficiency of hemagglutinin and hemagglutinin mutant pseudotype viruses. Luciferase activities (raw light units [RLU]) of HeLa and DF-1 cells infected with nine hemagglutinin pseudotype viruses are shown. (B) HeLa and DF-1 cells, from a human and a bird, respectively, were used to compare the infection efficiency of hemagglutinin and hemagglutinin mutant pseudotype viruses. Luciferase activities (raw light units [RLU]) of HeLa and DF-1 cells infected with nine hemagglutinin pseudotype viruses are shown. Recently, several studies have suggested that different SAs on human and avian cells may not be the only major factor limiting the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans [4]. In order to determine the role of glycans in receptor specificity, HeLa and DF-1 cells, which are from a human and a bird, respectively, were used to compare the efficiency of infection of these hemagglutinin pseudotype viruses (Fig. 3B). As expected, Qinghai/1/05 pseudotype virus had high infection efficiency in DF-1 cells, while Xinjiang/1/2006 pseudotype viruses had high infection efficiency in HeLa cells. Furthermore, mutations at aa 90 or 160 affected the ability of Qinghai/1/05 pseudotype virus to infect DF-1 cells. Interestingly, VAL (A90V plus I217L) and VTI (A90V plus A160T) could easily infect DF-1 cells, while ATL (A160T and I217L) could easily infect HeLa cells. To decrease lethality for the host, cytopathic viruses have to evolve to exhibit neutralizing determinants that are bound with high avidity by the available B-cell repertoire of higher vertebrates [5].

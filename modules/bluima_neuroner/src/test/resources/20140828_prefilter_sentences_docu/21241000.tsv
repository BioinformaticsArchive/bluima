21241000	Although they show significant structural similarity, LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2 show different expression, subcellular localization, and functions. They are involved in many cellular functions, such as migration, cycle, and neuronal differentiation and also have a role in pathological processes, such as cancer cell invasion and metastatis, as well as in neurodevelopmental disorders (namely, the William's syndrome). Regulation of actin polymerization by LIMK-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of the cofilin/ADF system modulates many cellular functions including motility, differentiation, spreading, apoptosis, and metastasis progression. Although LIM kinases share the same ability to phosphorylate cofilin, they show celltype specific expression and different subcellular localization. Moreover, there are various evidences for a different subcellular localization and functions of LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2. protein kinase upregulate LIM kinase 2 modifier of cell adhesion affects the PAK/LIMK pathways Hyperosmotic stress stimulates the Rho/ROCK/LIM kinase 1 pathway Neuregulin activates LIM kinase 1 by direct interaction 14-3-3 directly interacts with LIM kinase 1 and induces cofilin phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism PKA activates LIM kinase 1 by phosphorylation at both Ser323 and Ser596 Par-3 depletion results in a selective inhibition of LIM kinase 2 protein kinase C activates LIM kinase 1 by direct interaction SDF-1α activates LIM kinase 1 Nogo-66 activates LIM kinase 1 by a ROCK-dependent phosphorylation GFRα1b induces phosphorylation of both LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2 Ionomycin/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV activate LIM kinase 1 by direct phosphorylation at Thr508  Figure 3. (A) Homodimerization of LIMK. Downstream Effectors of the Rho Family of Small GTPases The Rho family of small GTPases contains several signaling proteins that are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions. As an example, the role of Rac/PAK signals is opposite in different cell lines. In fact, Rac/ PAK are potent activators of cofilin phosphorylation in neuronal cells, while both of them are reported to promote cofilin dephosphorylation in epithelial cells, probably by activating the slingshot1 phosphatase.15 Upstream modulators (such as thrombin, hepatocyte growth factor, DGCR6L, and modifier of cell adhesion) also affect LIMK activity. hepatocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor; modifier of cell adhesion, modifier of cell adhesion. In a recent work on PC3 prostate cancer cells,22 a novel signaling pathway is proposed where a hepatocyte growth factor-mediated LIM kinase 1 phosphorylation by PAK4 leads to cofilin inactivation. The functional linkage between hepatocyte growth factor and cofilin phosphorylation, through PAK4 and LIM kinase 1, is correlated with prostate cancer cell migration. In fact, hepatocyte growth factor-induced cell migration results from a sinergistical action of PAK4 and LIM kinase 1: LIM kinase 1 overexpression leads to a quantitative phosphorylation of cofilin, that reduces cell migration by inhibiting cell protrusion23 and polarization,24 while PAK4-LIM kinase 1 coexpression allows the retention of cell polarization and prompts the cells to an increase in migration speed. In particular, the highest concentration of inactive cofilin is found 30 min after hepatocyte growth factor stimulation and decreases after 60 min, in perfect correlation with an increased spreading of PC3 cells 60 min after hepatocyte growth factor stimulation. to the inhibition of cell migration (inactivated phospho-cofilin is unable to bind F-actin filaments and thus to allow for cell migration) needs to be revised for PC3 cells. Involvement of the PAK4-LIM kinase 1 signaling pathway in cell migration is also present in human gastric cancer cells where a novel PAK4-interacting protein (DGCR6L) regulates the PAK4-mediated migration via LIM kinase 1.31 Another important class of downstream effectors of the Rho family small GTPase are Rho-associated kinases (also termed as ROCK). On the other hand, Rac-PAK1 reduce phosphorylated MLC and contractility that results in lamellipodia and cell spreading. The GRD domain of neurofibromin downregulates the Rho-ROCK-LIM kinase 2 pathway thus enhancing cell motility, while the preGRD domain (sequence 1-1163) is a negative modulator of the Rac1-PAK1-LIM kinase 1 pathway.35 The Rac/PAK/LIMK/cofilin pathway is also modulated by the modifier of cell adhesion, a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1. modifier of cell adhesion deficiency causes overactivation of cofilin, its dysfunction and abnormal distribution, similarly to that found in cultured neurons induced to neurodegeneration. The loss of modifier of cell adhesion directly affects the PAK-LIMK pathway (Fig. 4), in particular in the spinal cord and less in the cortex. As a result, loss of modifier of cell adhesion leads to axonal degeneration derived from dysregulation of actin polymerization.36 Other LIMK Activators In endothelial cells, VEGF-A induces Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 activation that in turn leads to stress fiber formation, cell migration, and tubule formation. protein kinase/MK2/LIM kinase 1 pathway by VEGF is also responsible for the phosphorylation of annexin 1, thus leading to endothelial cell migration and tube formation.39 protein kinase also phosphorylates LIM kinase 1 at Ser310, without affecting LIM kinase 1 activity in cell-free assays. polarized mammalian epithelial cells. NEGATIVE REGULATORS OF LIMK ACTIVITY  Nischarin protein46 was recently described for its role in regulation of cell migration via inhibition of PAK1 activation47 (Table 2 summarizes negative regulators of LIMK activity and their action on LIM kinases). As a consequence of this interaction, Thr508 phosphorylation, LIM kinase 1 activity, and cofilin phosphorylation are reduced (Fig. 9), thus resulting in a negative regulation of LIMK-dependent pathways of cell motility and invasion.47 Regulation of the Rac-PAKLIMK1-cofilin pathway by nischarin leads to increased levels of active cofilin and to a reduced cell migration and invasion of cancer cells, further confirming the pivotal role that LIM kinase 1 may play in cancer cell invasion.49 Accordingly, the LIM domains of LIM kinase 1 were found to directly interact with large tumor suppressor 1 (amino acid sequences 135–353 and 655–755) in vitro and in vivo, in various cell lines, leading to a marked reduction or a complete abrogation of cofilin phosphorylation by LIM kinase 1 (Fig. 9). These results are of great importance if we consider that large tumor suppressor 1 activity could suppress cytokinesis defects induced by LIM kinase 1 overexpression, such as the generation of multinucleate cells52 often found in many human tumors.53 Summary of LIM Kinase Partners Acting as Negative Regulators of LIMK Activity  Negative regulators of LIMK activity  LIM and PDZ domains of LIMK exert an autoinhibitory action toward the kinase activity of LIMK Caspase 3 produces an inactive form of LIMK by truncation at Asp240 slingshot reduces LIMK kinase activity by dephosphorylation of transphosphorylated residues PAK4 negatively affects LIM kinase 1 activity by inactivation of slingshot-1L Neurofibromin domains downregulate the Rho/ROCK/LIM kinase 2 and Rac/PAK1/LIM kinase 1 pathways modifier of cell adhesion affects the PAK/LIMK pathways: activation of cofilin corresponds to modifier of cell adhesion deficiency Nischarin inhibits the Rac/PAK activation of both LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2 by direct association with LIMK large tumor suppressor 1 reduces or abrogates LIM kinase 1 activity BMPR-II negatively regulates both LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2 by direct interaction protease-activated receptor-2/β-arrestin negatively modulate LIM kinase 1 Rnf6 and parkin ubiquitines induce proteasomal degradation of LIM kinase 1 miR-134 induces repression of LIM kinase 1 mRNA translation  Further details are described in the text. However, it is still unclear whether this dysregulation of LIM kinase 1 activity could result in endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation found in primary pulmonary hypertension. In fact, while regulation of LIM kinase 1 activity is not required for dendritogenesis of retinal ganglion cells in vivo,59 LIM kinase 1 enhances dendrite growth in vitro,  Figure 10. These requirements may control the timing of dendritogenesis, also regulating the proper development and maintenance of neuronal cytoarchitecture.57,60 As an example, LIM kinase 2 is found to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in endothelial cells. Upon treatment of these cells with leptomycin B that inhibits the chromosomal region maintenance 1-dependent export of protein from the nucleus, LIM kinase 2 localizes exclusively in the nucleus.66 Differently from LIM kinase 2, subcellular distribution of LIM kinase 1 does not depend from the deletion of LIM domains. As LIM kinase 1 does not possess phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C corresponding to Ser283 and Thr494, protein kinase C stimulation does not influence LIM kinase 1 subcellular localization, confirming that LIM kinase 1 shuttling  Figure 12. Stimulation of cyclin D1 expression and subsequent transition from G1 to S phase of cell cycle progression in endothelial cells are possible consequences of the protein kinase C-mediated exclusion of LIM kinase 2 from the nucleus. Thus, nuclear exclusion of LIM kinase 2 could represent a mechanism to relieve the suppression of Rac/Cdc42-mediated cyclin D1 expression and to stimulate cell cycle progression. The transcriptional factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB, known as an important element for regulation of proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell lines) is involved in a FGF-2-stimulated signaling pathway for the neuronal differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells.73 Upon FGF-2 stimulation, a marked increase in LIM kinase 1 selective binding to CREB occurs in mammalian cells, with the consequent CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 and stimulation of CRE-mediated gene transcription. Recently, kynurenines (small molecule metabolites of tryptophan involved in the regulation of brain functions and behavior under normal and pathological conditions) were suggested to modulate the expression of LIM kinase 1 and to be part of the same signaling pathway of glutamate receptors for memory formation and neuronal pathology.74 LIM KINASES ARE INVOLVED IN MANY CELLULAR PROCESSES  The significantly high number of molecular partners is responsible for the important role of LIM kinases in various cellular processes, such as cell migration, cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation. However, LIMK are also involved in pathological processes, such as cancer cell invasion and metastatis, as well as in neurodevelopmental disorders (namely, the William's syndrome). Cell migration is consequent to various stimuli and involves changes of cytoskeleton, resulting in polarization and protrusion (formation of lamellipodia and filipodia consequent to actin polymerization at the leading edge of cells), formation of new contacts close to the leading edge (adhesion), translocation of the cell body by contraction, and, finally, detachment and retraction of cell rear. In this context, cofilin is able to severe globular actin (G-actin, the monomeric form of actin) from filamentous actin (F-actin, actin assembled in filaments), while phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin by LIM kinase 1 serves as a modulator during the stages of cell migration. Moreover, spatial and temporal regulation of cofilin activity by both LIMK and slingshot is an additional critical key during cell migration steps.61–65,75,76 Cytoskeletal reorganization is also associated with changes of cell–cell and cell–substratum adhesion, contributing to invasion and metastasis.49 Expression of LIM kinase 1 is also correlated with tumor progression and tumor cell mobility. As an example, LIM kinase 1 is able to upregulate the urokinase-type plasminogen activator77 required for the degradation of extracellular matrix during tumor progression in breast cancer, resulting in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In addition, chemokines are involved in cell migration. Among them, the stromal-cellderived factor 1α (SDF-1α) is a CXC subfamily member whose activity is mediated by the chemokine receptor CXCR4. SDF-1α activates LIM kinase 1 in Jurkat human leukemic T cells and thus induces cofilin phosphorylation and actin reorganization mediated by Rac. Other small GTPases, such as Rho or Cdc42, are not involved in this pathway of chemotactic response of T cells.78 Different results are found in multiple myeloma cells where chemotaxis and motility involve RhoA. A collection of experimental evidences on various cell lines leads to hypothesize a signaling pathway based on the EGF-induced activation of PI3K/Akt/PKCz that results at the same time in LIMK/cofilin-based rearrangement of cell cytoskeleton and to integrin β1-based cell adhesion. PKCz regulates EGF-induced chemotaxis in human breast cancer,80 glioblastoma,81 and lung cancer82 cells, positively affecting LIM kinase 1 activity. Akt2  expression is a crucial key also for chemotaxis of breast cancer cells.84 Similarly, knockdown of PKCz impairs chemotaxis of macrophages and leukemic cells, probably because of a reduction of LIM kinase 1 phosphorylation induced by CSF-1.85 Cell Cycle LIM kinases are also involved in cell cycle progression steps. LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2 show a distinct subcellular localization during cell division, which results in different roles in the regulation of the mitotic spindle organization, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis.86 LIM kinase 1 is also important for the modulation of cellular growth in breast and prostate cancer cells. During neuritogenesis, which is the first step of neuronal differentiation, LIM kinase 1 expression and cofilin phosphorylation increase, resulting in neuritogenesis induction. The second step of neuronal differentiation (neurite outgrowth) is driven by motile nerve-ending structures, called growth cones, that are responsive to promoters of actin polymerization and neurite outgrowth, as well as to inducers of actin disassembly (outgrowth inhibitors). From a functional point of view, Rnf6 and LIM kinase 1 have opposite roles during axon outgrowth, as the inhibition of neurite outgrowth consequent to Rnf6 overexpression is reverted by LIM kinase 1 overexpression in cultured hippocampal neurons (although an interaction between endogenous proteins does also occur).92 Parkin and LIM kinase 1  reversibly regulate each other's activity in a cell-type dependent manner. In fact, parkin enhances ubiquitination of LIM kinase 1 in vitro and only in particular cell lines, as well as it modulates the levels of LIM kinase 1-derived phosphorylated cofilin. On the other hand, LIM kinase 1 inhibits the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of parkin in vitro in a cell-type dependent manner. In particular, Nogo-66, a potent inhibitory fragment of neurite outgrowth inhibitor A,95 first activates LIM kinase 1 by a ROCK-dependent phosphorylation (resulting in the myelin-dependent neuronal inhibition) and then enhances slingshot1 activity (resulting in persistently inhibited neurons).94 During neuronal differentiation, most of the dendrites develop actin-rich protrusions (spines), which build postsynaptic structures. This effect is consequent to the repression of LIM kinase 1 mRNA translation by miR-134 and could be relieved by extracellular neurotrophic stimuli, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Fig. These pathways also involve the two spliced isoforms of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked receptor GFRα1 (a and b, respectively) that mediate opposite neuritogenic effects upon interaction with their substrate, the glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor. Finally, calcium ion is involved in various neuronal functions as a second messenger. In particular, the Ca2≠/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV is activated by ionomycin to directly phosphorylate LIM kinase 1 at Thr508, thus leading to neuritogenesis in neuroblastoma cells. This signaling pathway is also involved in the BDNF-induced LIM kinase 1-dependent dendritogenesis in primary neurons.99 Prostate cancer cells show LIM kinase 1 overexpression, while aberrant expression is associated with the induction of invasion of the same cell lines.101 An important role of LIM kinase 1 is also evident in the regulation of EGFR turnover in invasive breast cancer cells, with a possible implication in the development of an aggressive disease.102 Moreover, increased LIM kinase 1 expression level is reported for melanoma cells.103 In fact, while LIM kinase 1 is activated by SDF1 stimulation of the von Hippel Lindau-deficient A498 cell line, reintroduction of von Hippel Lindau abrogates LIM kinase 1 activity.104 In a three-dimensional microenvironment, tumor cells can migrate by adopting two different migration modes. In vivo cell migration through the three-dimensional extracellular matrix allows the cells to invasion and metastasis. MLC and LIM kinase 1 in turn mediate blebs formation (membrane blebbing are reversible and specialized form of cell protrusion) that is required for cell migration. Accordingly, LIM kinase 1 overexpression induces cell rounding, while LIM kinase 1 knockdown abrogates the invasive activity of specific cell lines (namely, HT1080).106 In a different cancer cell line (namely, a breast adenocarcinoma), ROCK1 overexpression phosphorylates both LIM kinases, with LIM kinase 2 as the preferred substrate, further contributing to support the hypothesis that LIM kinases have distinct functions. In addition, neuronal degeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease and induced by amyloid β involves LIM kinase 1. The knowledge that the inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation prevents neuronal degeneration supports this hypothesis.110 In detail, the kinase domain of LIM kinase 1 and LIM kinase 2 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins using recombinant baculovirus, and Sf9 cells were used for production of the recombinant kinases. b Cytotoxicity on A549 human lung cancer cells, expressed as EC50 in nanomolar concentrations. Starting from phenyl-pyrimidyl-thiazolyl-urea derivatives belonging to the original series of Bristol-Myers Squibb compounds, the same authors derived several phenyl-pyrazolyl-thiazolyl-amides and carbamates (Fig. 15) that were tested for their inhibitory activity toward LIM kinases, as well as for their cytotoxicity in A549 cells (Table 5).116 Surprisingly, these compounds show different biological profiles. Changing the cyclopropyl group of 4 into an isopropyl chain leads to 5 that retains a nanomolar IC50 toward both kinases with a complete loss of cell inhibitory activity (cytotoxicity was >10,000 nM). In a similar way, 2, belonging to the class of phenyl-pyrimidyl-thiazolyl-urea derivatives, although significantly different in structure, shows an activity toward both LIM kinases and cells comparable to that of 5. Finally, 6 and 7, belonging to the subclass of carbamate derivatives and bearing a phenyl ring differently decorated with respect to 3–5, do not affect kinase activity, while they show a nanomolar inhibition of cell proliferation and survival. Structural similarity between compounds 3–5 and 6–7 and their different biological profile suggest the hypothesis that ability to inhibit cell growth could be distinct from inhibition of LIM kinases. As a result, no common kinase target was found for dual and cytotoxic compounds, suggesting that cell growth inhibition does not depend from the ability of compounds to target shared kinases. Additional efforts (namely, high-content phenotypic assays and expression, and mRNA expression profiling) to identify the target responsible for offtarget activity of compounds show that both dual (3–4) and cytotoxic (6–7) compounds (i.e. all the compounds able to interfere with A549 cell growth) reduce tubulin subunits mRNA thus leading to microtubule depolymerization (destabilization). Moreover, results on 3 and 4 are in disagreement with previous reports showing that the inhibition of LIM kinase 1 activity in endothelial cells results in a stabilization of microtubules.118,119 As a consequence, the ability of TPPP to promote tubulin polymerization is inhibited, thus resulting in the microtubule disassembly already found upon LIM kinase 1 activation in endothelial cells.118 Percent inhibition of primary pig trabecular meshwork cell growth at a (10 nM) dose is given in parenthesis. procedures, were assayed in vitro to check their ability to inhibit the activity of LIM kinase 2 (the full-length human kinase was expressed using recombinant baculovirus and Sf9 cells were used for production of the kinase) by monitoring the transfer of a radioactive γ-phosphate from ATP into biotinylated cofilin substrate by means of a scintillation counter. The last compounds were submitted to a preliminary cell-based assay to determine the inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation in primary pig trabecular meshwork cells. As a consequence, selective inhibition of LIM kinases by compounds unable to affect ROCK activity could avoid side effects caused by ROCK inhibitors (namely, a significant conjunctival hyperemia), and allow depolymerization of actin filaments, relaxation of trabecular meshwork cells, and reduction of intraocular pressure. Based on these excellent results, the activity of 25 was compared in vivo to that of timolol using the same formulation. Finally, an ex vivo pig anterior chamber organ culture perfusion assay123 was performed to identify the mechanism of action of the new compounds, on the basis of the fact that inhibitors of LIM kinase are also expected to increase conventional outflow facility through the relaxation of trabecular meshwork cells by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. All these results further confirmed that LIMK inhibitors could be useful and efficient tools for the treatment of glaucoma and disorders associated with ocular hypertension, by lowering ocular pressure, in agreement with previous results also reporting LIMK inhibitors as promoters of actin depolymerization in trabecular cells.124 As a result, a large amount of experimental evidences correlate LIMKs with various cellular processes in normal or aberrant conditions.

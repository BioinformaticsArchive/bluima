The underlying mechanism of such an activity probably resides in the ability of infliximab and adalimumab, but not etanercept, to efficiently recruit immune effector mechanisms, such as complement and Fc receptor-expressing cells, and to kill granulomatous cells expressing membrane tumor necrosis factor-a.10 © 2009 The International Society of Dermatology  Finally, if the appearance of granulomas with tumor necrosis factor neutralization is a result of the inability of the therapeutic agent to destroy granulomatous cells as soon as they are recruited, we have no explanation for the mechanism leading to granuloma generation, which requires further investigation.

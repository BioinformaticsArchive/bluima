19293000	Migrating larvae have been shown to stimulate an inflammatory cell response in the rat lung [8], while the intestinal phase and worm rejection are somehow thought to induce the production of leukocyte-generated free oxygen radicals [9â€“11]. Finally, adult N. brasiliensis worms excrete/secrete a myriad of products with the potential for immunomodulation [40,41], while eliciting a Th2 cytokine response and recruiting an abundance of intestinal mucosal mast cells [42].

19408000	The clinical accuracy of the perfusion in the detection of coronary heart disease was excellent (positive predictive value 91% and negative predictive value 88%) against invasive angiography. However, in the most experienced observer (OI) it was still excellent: 0.95. The preliminary clinical accuracy tested in a small yet reasonable patient population was also excellent. When global perfusion was analysed, an excellent reproducibility was found independently of the observer's experience. We found that the accuracy of quantitative perfusion was excellent in detection of coronary heart disease in invasive angiography when the cut-off value of 2.5 ml/g per min was used. Conclusion  This study has demonstrated the excellent reproducibility of myocardial perfusion quantitation with 15O-labelled water Positron emission tomography using the Cardiac Image Analysis System software. The study was conducted within the “Centre of Excellence in Molecular Imaging in Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research" supported by the Academy of Finland, University of Turku, Turku University Hospital and Åbo Academy.

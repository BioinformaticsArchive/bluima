Property Importance of measurement  Aggregation state  Elemental composition Mass concentration  Particle number concentration  Shape  Size and size distribution  Solubility Speciation  Structure  Surface area (and porosity) Surface charge Surface chemistry  Nanoparticles that have a tendency to aggregate may keep their functionality, however the increase in size could lead to decrease in uptake Different particle composition leads to different behaviour/impact, e.g. Cd versus Fe Normally increased contaminant concentration leads to increase in toxicity/impact, this is not always applicable for nanoparticles Nanoparticles have low mass concentrations, but show high percentage of total particle numbers Different particle shapes (e.g. spherical, tubular) can posses different affinities or accessibilities, e.g. transport through membranes into cells, different antibacterial behaviour Nanoparticles are defined and classed by their size, and size is one of the primary properties describing transport behaviour Soluble nanoparticles; their ionic form can be harmful or toxic (e.g. ZnO versus Zn2)) Different species can have different behaviour, toxicity, impact (e.g. C60 versus C70, Environmental nanopollutants complexes with natural organic matter or oxidation state) The structure can influence stability or behaviour (e.g. rutile or anastase as possible crystal structures of TiO2) Increase in surface area increases reactivity and sorption behaviour Surface charge has an influence on particle stability especially in dispersions Coatings can consist of different chemical compositions and influence particle behaviour or toxicity (e.g. quantum dots with CdSe core and ZnS shell)  Table 4.

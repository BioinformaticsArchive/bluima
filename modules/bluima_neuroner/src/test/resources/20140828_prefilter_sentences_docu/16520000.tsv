Thus, developing a method to control the level of PrPC expression in cells could be one way to delay or prevent the onset of clinical signs of these diseases. In this study the mechanisms controlling the expression of the Prnp gene in PC12 cells and in rat brain were examined. We observed a slight activation of a cloned fragment of the human PRNP gene promoter using the luciferase reporter system in PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth factor. We observed no increase of PrPC or Prnp mRNA levels in PC12 cells after treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent. The Prnp promoter did not display methylation either in nerve growth factor-treated and untreated PC12 cells, or in the rat brain. Keywords: Prnp gene; Expression; Rat brain; PC12 cells; nerve growth factor; mitogen-activated protein kinase  PrPC is a ubiquitous glycoprotein highly expressed in neurons and localized in elongating axons [21]. Newborn mice expressing an amino-terminally truncated PrPC show neuronal degeneration which suggests that PrPC may play a role in the maintenance and regulation of neuronal functions [22]. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor results in induction of neuronal differentiation [7]. The cell line is therefore a useful model system for neurobiological studies. PC12 cells express PrPC; the expression of the Prnp gene in these cells, both at transcriptional and translational level, is up-regulated by nerve growth factor [6,9]. mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase is the key component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, the common mechanism regulating such cellular processes as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [8]. AKT is a representative of serine/threonine kinases, the activity of which is critical for cell survival and proliferation. The signaling pathway involving AKT may influence neuronal differentiation [1]. It has been shown that both mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT signaling cascades can participate in outgrowth of neurite and neuronal survival elicited by PrPC in cell culture [4,15]. Moreover, both kinds of enzymes may be involved in the pathological processes associated with prion diseases [10,17], showing that these cell pathways may be considered as a potential target for therapeutic intervention [17]. PC12 cells and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) were cultured at 37 ◦C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, using MEM  (BIOMED) supplemented with 10% FBS, 129 g/ml l-glutamine, 10,000 U/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. The PC12 cells in their culture medium were incubated and grown in the absence or presence of demethylating agent 5-aza-dCyd (Sigma–Aldrich) that was added three times (10 M) during the 72-h period before harvest. The cells were harvested 24 h after the last addition of 5-aza-dCyd and were used for DNA, RNA and protein isolation. To induce neuronal differentiation, the cells were dissociated by washing with PBS, plated on dishes coated with rat tail collagen and cultured in MEM medium containing 2% FBS, the antibiotics and, 100 ng/ml of nerve growth factor (Promega). After 3 days exposure to nerve growth factor, cells started to develop neuron-like processes. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the vector using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) after 1, 2 or 3 days of treatment with nerve growth factor, then grown for 24 h and harvested. To test the influence of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase over the PRNP promoter, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids containing cDNA of those proteins, along with pT81 luciferase vector. 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with reporter vector using FuGENE 6 and subsequently treated or untreated with nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml medium) for 2 days and harvested; luciferase activity was then measured. At the appropriate time points the PC12 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Proteins from PC12 cells and adult normal rat brain homogenate were extracted as described elsewhere [16]. Total cellular RNA was isolated from PC12 cells treated and untreated with nerve growth factor and 5-aza-dCyd, and from rat brain homogenate, using a commercial kit (A&A Biotechnology). Genomic DNA was isolated from PC12 cells before and after treatment with 5-aza-dCyd and from rat brain homogenate, using standard procedures. Activity of the cloned human PRNP promoter was analyzed using a luciferase reporter system in PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth factor in order to evaluate the potential role of nerve growth factor in transcriptional regulation. mitogen-activated protein kinase overexpression caused 2.3 ± 3.6 times higher luciferase activity in PC12 cells grown in normal conditions. The effects of nerve growth factor on PRNP promoter activity were measured after 2, 3 and 4 days of incubation as a relative luciferase activity (i.e., compared with the equivalent cell culture without nerve growth factor treatment) in four independent experiments. The mean relative luciferase activity after 4 days of exposure to nerve growth factor was 6.1 ± 4.4 times higher than that of untreated cells. Luciferase activity of PC12 cells exposed to nerve growth factor and PD98059 was 2.1 ± 1.7 times higher than the luciferase activity of untreated PC12 cells. Interestingly, PC12 cells exposed to nerve growth factor and transfected with the mitogen-activated protein kinase expression vector showed 15.5 ± 5.4 times higher activity than untreated PC12 cells. A similar effect was caused by adding wortmannin: PC12 treated with nerve growth factor and exposed to wortmannin, showed 14.5 ± 4.7 times higher luciferase activity than untreated PC12 cells. AKT overexpression during PC12 cells differentiation inhibited the positive effects of nerve growth factor in terms of PRNP promoter activation: luciferase activity was only 2.5 ± 3.9 times higher after exposure of AKT-transfected PC12 cells to nerve growth factor (Fig. 1). Luciferase activity was significantly lower in PC12 cells cultured under normal conditions than in PC12 cells exposed to nerve growth factor and co-transfected with mitogen-activated protein kinase (p < 0.05). Luciferase activity was also significantly lower in PC12 cells grown under normal conditions than in PC12 cells exposed simultaneously to nerve growth factor and wortmannin (p < 0.05). Relative luciferase activity observed in PC12 cells in different experimental conditions. 3T3 are fibroblasts of mezodermal origin and do not differentiate to neuronal cells; therefore, they were used as a control of nerve growth factor influence on the PRNP promoter. 3T3 cells were transfected with the PRNP reporter vector and treated or not treated with nerve growth factor within 2 days after transfection. Luciferase activity of 3T3 cells exposed to nerve growth factor was 9.65 ± 2.6 higher than luciferase activity of untreated 3T3 cells. nerve growth factor caused no differentiation of 3T3 cells. The level of PrPC and its glycosylation pattern in untreated and treated with nerve growth factor and with 5-Aza-dCyd cells PC12, and in the rat brain was determined using Western blot analysis. The PC12 cells and rat brain expressed non-glycosylated (24 kDa), mono-glycosylated (26–30 kDa) and di-glycosylated (30–35 kDa) forms of PrPC. PC12 cells expressed additionally hyper-glycosylated forms of PrPC (35–38 kDa) (Fig. 2A). In extracts of rat brain, the di-glycosylated PrPC band was most prominent, while PC12 cells contained smaller amounts of di-glycosylated PrPC (Fig. 2A). At the fourth day of differentiation the level of PrPC was 1.5-fold (S.D. = 0.4) higher in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells than in untreated cells, whereas in adult normal rat brain the PrPC expression was 10-fold (S.D. = 0.9) higher than in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor. The PrPC expression remained unchanged after treatment of PC12 cells with 5-Aza-dCyd. The relative amounts of Prnp mRNA in PC12 cells and in the rat brain are shown in Table 1. The Prnp mRNA relative level in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells increased fourfold at the fourth day of differentiation and was only 1.6-fold higher in adult rat brain than in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells. The relative  expression of Prnp in PC12 cells treated with 5-Aza-dCyd displayed no increase. The level of PrPC was 1.5-fold higher in PC12 cells after 4 days of treatment with nerve growth factor than before treatment, whereas the  Fig. PrPC expression in PC12 cells and in normal adult rat brain.

In rat brain the PrPC expression was much (10-fold) higher than in NGFtreated PC12 cells, whereas the mRNA level of Prnp was only 1.6-fold higher. No methylation of the CpG island in the Prnp promoter was detected in untreated PC12 cells, in PC12 cells treated with 5-Aza-dCyd, after exposure to nerve growth factor, or in rat brain extracts. We observed sixfold increase in the luciferase activity after exposure of PC12 cells to nerve growth factor. nerve growth factor activated a cloned PRNP promoter not only in PC12 cells but also in 3T3 cells, which do not differentiate after exposure to nerve growth factor. Activation of the PRNP promoter in nerve growth factor-treated 3T3 cells suggested that the influence of nerve growth factor is differentiation independent. Our data support the hypothesis of Nordstrom et al. [17] who, after observing that prion-infected cells were freed of abnormal PrP (PrPSc) by treatment with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase, proposed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway might offer a suitable target for therapeutic intervention in prion diseases. The inhibitory activity of AKT on differentiation of PC12 cells was previously described by Bang et al. [2]. Interestingly, Cabral et al. [3] demonstrated that the Prnp promoter was not activated in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells; however, a careful comparison of their data with ours suggests that the discrepancy is illusory. Cabral et al. used stably transfected cells while we performed transient transfections. Consistent with those results, our data, from a chromatin-free reporter system, showed that nerve growth factor activated the Prnp promoter in PC12 cells. We therefore looked for evidence that the Prnp promoter in PC12 cells and in the rat brain might be methylated. We observed no increase either of PrPC or of Prnp mRNA expression in PC12 cells treated with DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-dCyd. It has been reported that 5-Aza-dCyd is able to block the neurite outgrowth of nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells because this demethylation agent unblocks genes which should be methylated to allow differentiation [19]. We found no evidence that the Prnp promoter is methylated in either PC12 cells or in the rat brain. The lack of change in levels of PrPC and Prnp mRNA in PC12 cells treated with 5-Aza-dCyd is consistent with our other data: detection of PrPC by immunoblotting before PC12 differentiation, increased PrPC and Prnp mRNA in NGFtreated PC12 cells, and failure to show by methylation-specific PCR that the Prnp promoter is methylated. Another intriguing result of this study was obtained during experiments designed to compare Prnp mRNA and PrPC levels in PC12 cells and in the rat brain. We demonstrate that PC12 cells express about 1.5 times more PrPC after 4 days of treatment with nerve growth factor than before treatment, whereas the mRNA level of Prnp in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells is increased about four times in the fourth day of differentiation. A fourfold increase of the level of Prnp mRNA has been considered by other authors as important for PC12 cells differentiation [9]. In our study the changes in protein and mRNA expression are consistent with results showing slight activation of PRNP promoter in PC12 cells after treatment with nerve growth factor. In normal rat brain, PrPC expression was much (10-fold) higher than in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells, whereas the mRNA level of Prnp was only 1.6-fold higher. Referring to data presented in the literature, a 10 times higher expression of PrPC in the brain can be considered to have an important effect for brain cells [13]. Similar levels of Prnp mRNA in rat brain and in PC12 cells, together with a much higher level of PrPC in the brain, suggest that the elevated level of PrPC in brain results either from a different rates of translation or of PrPC protein stabilization, or both. In agreement with Monnet et al. [16], we observed a dif- [6] ferent glycosylation pattern of PrPC in the brain and in PC12 cells. PC12 cells expressed unusually hyper-glycosylated forms of PrPC (35–38 kDa) (Fig. 1A). It has been suggested that alter-[7] native PrPC isoforms, comparable to the high molecular weight isoforms observed in PC12 cells, could be present in vivo at a level undetectable by immunoblot analysis, and they could [8] be addressed to specific subcellular compartments where they [9] could perform distinct functions [18]. Note that our experiments showed similar levels of Prnp mRNA in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells and in rat brain, however, PrPC protein levels were higher in the brain, suggesting some unidentified process stabilizing PrPC [10] protein in brain. Considering the discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels in PC12 cells and the brain accompanied with [11] differences in the glycosylation pattern of PrPC, we propose that glycosylation might be important for the stabilization process; [12] however, to confirm this hypothesis, further research is needed. The data presented here raise new basic questions about the mechanisms controlling PrPC expression in various cells and [13] improve our understanding of the regulation of the promoter of the Prnp gene—coding a protein involved in several neurological diseases.

20818000	This signal is related to the difference between the upper cells (A + C) and the lower cells (B + D) of the position-sensitive photodiode. However, the lateral force microscope signal, which is related to the change in the surface friction on a sample surface, measures the deflection of the cantilever in the horizontal direction as shown in figure 2 and can be represented as the difference of the signals recorded in the left cells (A + B) and the right cells (C + D): frictional information - (A + B) - (C + D). The moving distance, which means the angular twist of the cantilever, can be estimated from the following equation:  Vm L Moving distance - H Â· tan-1 (2) VD  where Vm and V are the measured lateral force and the maximum lateral force, respectively, H is the length of tip, L the cell length of position-sensitive photodiode and D is the distance between the position-sensitive photodiode and cantilever.

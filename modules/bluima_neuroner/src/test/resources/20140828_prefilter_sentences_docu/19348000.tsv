IL-23 supports the proliferation and survival of T-helper 17 cells, a novel subset of Crohn's disease4+ T cells characterized by IL-17 production (42), which help maintain chronic inflammation. A large set of melanoma genes are differentially regulated in interferon-sensitive and -resistant cell lines (87–90), generating sensitivity and resistance signatures (91) and a commercial gene array for human interferon-ab responses is available (92). Progress has been made in understanding the cellular, molecular and genetic underpinnings of melanoma. The Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK signalling pathway regulates melanoma cell proliferation, with ERK being constitutively activated in up to 90% of melanomas (96). Notably, melanoma cells with BRAF mutations are more sensitive to MEK inhibitors than cells with Ras mutations (130), suggesting that oncogenic signalling from BRAF is mediated through MEK. Laser capture-microdissection of melanoma cells from healthy surrounding tissue, followed by nuclear extraction and amplification, allows both gene expression profiling and genotyping for somatic mutations (i.e. acquired by melanoma cells) from routine surgical specimens. Large prospective studies with well-defined patient subsets that measure the genomics of neoplastic and host tissue (i.e. peripheral blood cells, tumor stroma, etc.) and correlations with phenotypic markers (protein expression in histological sections and serum) and treatment responses will improve melanoma treatment outcomes. Thiopurine methyl transferase activity can be determined in peripheral red blood cell lysates (169) and testing for these polymorphisms can be useful in preventing azathioprine toxicity in susceptible patients (170–175). 25 The influence of pharmacogenomics in predicting pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic processes, drug receptor func- 26 tion or changes in signal transduction or cell cycle control pathways could significantly improve drug responses.

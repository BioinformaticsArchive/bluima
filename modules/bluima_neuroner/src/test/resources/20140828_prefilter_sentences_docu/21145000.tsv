21145000	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscular paralysis due to degeneration of motor neurones in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. electromyography was indicative of a motor neuron disease. Interestingly our three patients shared a similar phenotype characterized by slow progression, initial distal limb muscles involvement and predominant lower motor neuron signs. Screening for this mutation should be carried out in patients with a sporadic occurrence of a relatively benign form of motor neuron disease with distal limb distribution.

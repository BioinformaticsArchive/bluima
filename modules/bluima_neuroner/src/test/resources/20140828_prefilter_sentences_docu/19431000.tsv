Surfactin has a critical micellar concentration of 9.4 μM in 0.1 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.7 (Ishigami et al. 1995) and forms rod-like micelles with an aggregation number of *170 (Heerklotz and Seelig 2001). This neutral lipopeptide has a critical micellar concentration of ca. 40 μM. It has been shown that, in addition to the monomer or micellar organizations, at higher concentrations, another type of aggregate different from the micelle is preferred, probably a lamellar vesicle, whose proportion increases as the concentration of iturin is raised. For iturin A micelles, an aggregation number of 7 has been proposed (Grau et al. 2001). Mechanistically, the action of fengycins is less well-known compared with other lipopeptides, but they also readily interact with lipid layers and to some extent retain the potential to alter cell membrane structure (packing) and permeability in a dose-dependent way (Deleu et al. 2005). However, in general the available literature related to fengycin micelle formation is far from complete. One of the commonly considered factors involved in adhesion of bacteria (vegetative cells and spores) to substrata is bacterial cell surface properties, especially hydrophobicity (Faille et al. 2002). critical micellar concentration determination The surface tension of lipopeptide solutions used for substratum conditioning was measured by the ring method using a Du Nouy tensiometer TD1 (Lauda, Ko ̈nigshofen, Germany). critical micellar concentration was determined by plotting the surface tension as a function of the lipopeptide concentration. Adherent cells were detached from the surfaces using an ultrasonic bath (Deltasonic Meaux, France, 40 kHz) for 2 min and 30 s followed by 20 s vortexing with quick speed and then an ultrasonic bath again for 2 min and 30 s. Results Critical micelle concentration of lipopeptides The different solutions of lipopeptides used in this study contain several homologous compounds from the same family. The critical micellar concentration is slightly different for each homologous compound (Deleu et al. 2003). In addition, the presence of 10% methanol could slightly modify critical micellar concentration values. The critical micellar concentration of the different mixtures used in this study was thus determined by using the ring method. When stainless steel was conditioned with fengycin, the contact angles were significantly higher (p value 50.0001) for concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 12.5 mg l71 (intermediate concentrations) and the maximal value of 61.73° was obtained at a concentration of 6.25 mg l71, which corresponds to the critical micellar concentration of the mixture of compounds used (Figure 1A). This effect increased further with increasing lipopeptide concentration (even for concentrations over the critical micellar concentration) and reached a value of 81.1° at 100 mg l71, the highest value obtained among the other tested lipopeptides.

Manne et al. (1994) proposed an adsorption model for ionic surfactant molecules at the graphite-aqueous solution interface in which at low concentration (almost 10% of critical micellar concentration), molecules are adsorbed with alkane chains extended on the substrate plane, and this chain is gradually desorbed with an increase in the concentration. At concentrations near critical micellar concentration, the surfactant molecules were oriented perpendicular to the plane of the substratum, with the hydrophilic head groups in contact with the aqueous phase (Ahimou et al. 2000). However, at concentrations higher than critical micellar concentration, different results were observed for fengycin. At concentrations higher than critical micellar concentration, fengycins might form a fully interdigitated bilayer, where each hydrocarbon tail spans the entire hydrocarbon width of the bilayer, and interacts laterally, through hydrophobic forces, with the hydrocarbon tail of fengycin molecules from the opposing lamellar leaflet. According to previous studies, pre-treatment of stainless steel by surface-active compounds produced by P. fluorescens 495 gave rise to a substantial reduction in the number of adherent cells of Listeria monocytogenes LO28 (Meylheuc et al. 2001).

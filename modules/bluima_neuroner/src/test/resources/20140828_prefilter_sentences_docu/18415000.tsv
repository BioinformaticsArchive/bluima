TEM at the polymer interface revealed osteoblasts which secreted an extracellular matrix containing matrix vesicles loaded with apatite. L. Gorski  E. H. Schacht Polymer Material Research Group, Ghent University, Krijgslaan 281 (S4), 9000 Ghent, Belgium  engineering generally requires the use of a porous, bioresorbable scaffold, which serves as a threedimensional (3-D) template for initial cell attachment and subsequent tissue formation, both in vitro and in vivo [1]. Ideally, an (injectable, in situ forming) 3-D scaffold should have the following characteristics: (1) biocompatible, (2) highly porous with an interconnected pore network, (3) biodegradable to promote new tissue formation and vascularization, (4) suitable surface chemistry to allow cell attachment and differentiation, (5) mechanical properties that match those of the tissues at the site of implantation and (6) contain osteoinductive factors [1, 2]. In this regard, the in vitro differentiation of bone marrow derived osteoblastic cells on in situ photopolymerized 3-D scaffolds based on D,L-lactide and e-caprolactone will be evaluated concerning porosity. Cell culture and scaffold/cell culturing  2.4.1 Isolation and culture of bone marrow derived cells  Bone marrow cells were obtained from the tibiae and femora of young (6 weeks old) adult male Wistar rats. The cell pellet was resuspended and seeded in T75 tissue culture dishes. After 24 h, the medium was changed to remove nonadherent cells. The cells were cultured until confluence (5%  CO2/95% air, 37 C). After 7 days of primary culture, the cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA, concentrated by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in complete MEM Alpha medium. 2.4.2 Cell seeding and growth on porous scaffolds  Before cell seeding, the scaffolds were immersed in serumfree MEM Alpha medium in Eppendorf tubes. The scaffolds were seeded with 700,000 respectively 435,000 rat bone marrow cells/90 ll/scaffold (3.6 9 106 cells/cm2 (high seeding density) respectively 2.2 9 106 cells/cm2 (low seeding density)) and incubated for 4 h. The seeded scaffolds were further incubated overnight to allow for cell attachment [12]. After 24 h, scaffolds (seeded with 435,000 cells) were evaluated for their seeding efficiency by replacing the medium by MTT containing medium (0.5 mg/ml). Three milliliter culture medium supplemented with 10 mM b-glycerophosphate was added and the cell/scaffold constructs were cultured for 21 days on a bench shaker at a constant rate of 55 rpm (5% CO2/95% air, 37 C). Thin sections (60 nm) were cut with a diamand knife, mounted on cupper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope operating at 80 KeV.  3 Results  Scaffolds seeded with rat bone marrow cells were cultured dynamically. After 21 days, the alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin secretion were evaluated as markers representative for differentiated osteoblast-like cells present on the scaffold. Influence of porosity (pore volume)  lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds with apparent porosities of 50, 60 and 70 with pore sizes of 250–355 lm (gelatin as porogen) were prepared and compared with regard to bone formation and cellular infiltration. Histological analysis of lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 50 and 60 showed empty scaffolds (Fig. 2a) or a layer of osteoblast-like cells, but detached from the scaffold (Fig. 2b). The cells were able to attach to the polymer scaffold as shown by the seeding efficiency, 53.3 ± 13% of the total number of cells adhered to lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds after 24 h. However, it seems that the cells were not able to infiltrate into the scaffold and finally detached as demonstrated by the negligible protein content. 1 Differentiation of rat bone marrow cells cultured for 21 days on lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds prepared with different apparent porosity [60 and 70], pore size (250–355 and 355–500 lm) and porogens (gelatin, sucrose, sodium chloride) (pore shape). Mean and SD, n = 3. (a) Scaffolds seeded with 700,000 cells/scaffold (high seeding density). (b) Scaffolds seeded with 435,000 cells/scaffold (low seeding density)  At the edge of the scaffold, a polymer top layer can be detected (Fig. 2a, b). Hence, cells are not able to infiltrate into a lactide in/caprolactone scaffold with an apparent porosity of 50 and 60 with pore sizes of 250–355 lm (obtained with gelatine as porogen). A layer of detached cells at the edge of the scaffolds. A layer of detached cells at the edge of the scaffolds. As seen in cross-sections, no top layer is formed and the cells can infiltrate into the scaffold (Fig. 4a, d). Transmission electron micrographs at the polymer/bone interface showed osteoblast-like cells which secreted an abundant collagen I containing extracellular matrix (Fig. 5a, c). An abundant extracellular matrix with calcium phosphate deposits has been formed on the polymer walls as shown by Masson's Trichrome (Fig. 2d) and von Kossa (Fig. 2e) staining. Hence, after a 21 days culture period, cells detached from the scaffold (data not shown). The influence of pore shape on the differentiation and cellular infiltration was compared. Masson's Trichrome (Fig. 4a, c, b′) and H&E (Fig. 4b) staining showed a typical morphology of cuboidal osteoblasts which secreted an extracellular matrix. For lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds prepared with sodium chloride as porogen, no bone ingrowth or cellular infiltration could be observed. The rat bone marrow cells differentiated and formed new bone at the edge of the scaffold. These characteristics are required for migration of cells, transport of nutrients and waste products and for cell spreading and differentiation. von Kossa stain (d, e, f); H&E stain (b)  In the present paper, we describe physical characteristics of this lactide in/caprolactone based scaffold with different pore volumes (50, 60 and 70), pore sizes (250–355 and 355–500 lm) and pore shapes obtained by gelatin, sucrose or sodium chloride leaching in correlation with the behaviour of osteoblastlike cells derived from rat bone marrow. Parameters as cell adhesion, infiltration and differentiation are evaluated. Although cell adhesion on scaffolds based on caprolactone is described, the surface chemistry is rather hydrophobic [1, 17]. For our selected lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds, with a copolymer ratio of 50/50, the seeding efficiency (or cellular adhesion) reaches an acceptable value in  comparison to tissue culture dishes. Rat bone marrow derived cells were able to attach and differentiate on these 3-D scaffolds based on lactide in/caprolactone. After three weeks, the cells expressed high alkaline phosphatase activity, secreted osteocalcin and were able to mineralize the extracellular matrix. Structurally, the polymer scaffold must initially possess porosity and pore size distribution that is sufficient for cellular infiltration as well as the transport of nutrients into and cellular waste products out of the scaffold. lactide in/caprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 50, independent of pore size, were not suitable to allow cellular infiltration as a polymer top layer was formed. Scaffolds with apparent porosity of 70 (pore size 250–355 lm) allowed cellular infiltration. Other groups often describe cellular infiltration into preformed 3-D scaffolds mostly obtained by solvent casting and the salt-leaching technique. Hence, bone cells can easily infiltrate into the scaffold [17, 23]. Our scaffolds had good bone formation and cellular ingrowth, dependent on pore volume, for both scaffolds with pore sizes of 250–355 and 355–500 lm. 5 TEM of lactide in/caprolactone scaffold with apparent porosity of 70.

Moreover, it has previously been shown that fine grooves can be useful for controlling the direction of cellular migration over a surface [19]. Since a surface with roughness is important for cellular expression, the use of gelatin is a feasible alternative for the sodium chloride which surface is very smooth. According to Suh et al., scaffolds obtained by gelatin leaching showed better attachment of cells at the initial stage [28]. This is most likely due to a diffusion limitation effect (although the scaffold/cell constructs were cultured dynamically), and a physical obstruction from the mineralized tissue surrounding the scaffold [16]. For in vivo applications, it would be beneficial to mix the in situ photopolymerizable scaffold with osteoprogenitor cells or stem cells to induce bone formation in the center of the scaffold. 5 Conclusions  This study demonstrated that rat bone marrow cells can attach and differentiate when cultured on 3-D porous in situ photopolymerizable scaffolds based on D,L-lactide and e-caprolactone. For scaffolds with lower porosity [60] and gelatin particle size 250–355 lm, no ingrowth occurred due to a polymer top layer, although cellular infiltration was possible when the gelatin particle size increased to 355–500 lm.

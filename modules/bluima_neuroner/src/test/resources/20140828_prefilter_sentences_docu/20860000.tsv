20860000	To assess the redox status in a brain-disease model in small animals, a cell-permeable nitroxide is needed, and several nitroxides, including 3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-yloxy (MCP), HMP and others such as 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinooxy (Tempol) and CMP, have been examined in EPR imaging studies in the mouse head. blood-brain barrier-permeable HMP and MCP have been reported to be appropriate imaging probes for assessing the redox status within brain tissues (10,16,28). Probing the intracellular redox status of tumors with magnetic resonance imaging and redox-sensitive contrast agents.

Such modulation involves membrane receptors for neurotransmitters, as well as mechanisms that mediate intracellular Ca2? release, and Ca2? entry, as well as those that maintain cellular Ca2? Keywords Calcium homeostasis  Calcium influx Ion channels  Fluid secretion  Salivary gland cells Physiology  Knockout-mouse models  Introduction  Ca2? has a pivotal role in the physiological function of both excitable and non-excitable cells [1, 2]. It has been conclusively established that Ca2? is the primary intracellular factor that regulates secretion in exocrine gland cells, including fluid secretion in salivary and lacrimal glands and protein secretion in pancreas [3–5]. Moreover, the exact mechanism involved in protein secretion, i.e. granule fusion, in salivary gland cells is not yet understood. This review will primarily focus on our current understanding of the regulation of Ca2? signaling in salivary gland cells and the role of Ca2? in fluid secretion. The regulation of secretion in the salivary glands is achieved by autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli via a coordinated sequence of signal transduction and intracellular signaling events. These events include activation of membrane receptors and associated signal transduction proteins in the plasma membrane, generation of intracellular second messengers, calcium mobilization, and stimulation of ion transport pathways. Salivary gland cells have receptors for a number of neurotransmitters which are localized in the plasma membrane which when stimulated lead to increases in fluid and protein secretion [3, 4]. Three subtypes of the IP3 receptor have been described (IP3 receptor1, IP3 receptor2 and IP3 receptor3), of which IP3 receptor2 and 3 are the major subtypes found in exocrine gland cells [4–10]. These are concentrated in the apical pole of the cells. The localization of IP3Rs in the acinar cells have important functional consequences. In pancreatic acinar cells, internal Ca2? release originates in the luminal region of the cell and at lower levels of stimulation this signal is restricted to this region of the cell [6, 9–11]. At higher levels of stimuli the signal subsequently propagates to the basal regions of the cell. In salivary gland acinar cells the first signal is initiated in the apical region but unlike the pancreatic cells, the signal propagates to the basal region at either low or high levels of stimuli [12, 13]. While intracellular Ca2? release is sufficient to trigger fluid secretion, sustained secretion is dependent on Ca2? influx. entry is activated by the intracellular Ca2? release process [15, 16]. Thus, the coordinated activation and regulation of intracellular Ca2? release and Ca2? entry result in generating optimal [Ca2?] signals i that are required to drive sustained fluid secretion and also for regulation of other critical cellular functions. Similar effect of external Ca2? was obtained in measurements of agonist stimulated Rb? efflux in salivary gland cells (Rb? is used as a surrogate for K?, a critical cation in fluid secretion). Increase of Rb? efflux from the cells was biphasic with an initial rapid transient increase which was independent of external Ca2? and a lower sustained release which was completely dependent on the external [Ca2?]. More direct involvement of Ca2? in salivary gland physiology was demonstrated by studies showing a flux of Ca2? following stimulation of salivary gland cells with muscarinic and a1-adrenergic receptor agonists [18]. Thus, it was suggested that intracellular Ca2? homeostasis was altered and the Ca2? permeability of the cell membrane was increased following agonist stimulation of cells. Furthermore, the release of Ca2? from the cell was temporally correlated with the activation of K? efflux and increase in fluid secretion, while Ca2? uptake was associated with prolonged K? channel activity and fluid secretion. Experiments examining uptake of isotopic Ca2? into the cell suggested the involvement of an internal Ca2? store into which Ca2? was sequestered, or released from following stimulation. Further, use of a permeabilized cell system demonstrated the presence of an ATP-dependent Ca2? uptake mechanism and a Ca2? store in the endoplasmic reticulum of exocrine gland cells which was proposed to be the likely agonist-sensitive Ca2? store. This important finding linked the increase in inositol lipid turnover following receptor stimulation to intracellular Ca2? mobilization and enzyme secretion in pancreatic acinar cells. This study has been critical to our present understanding of the receptor-stimulated Ca2? signaling since a similar mechanism is present in all non-excitable cells. The use of these dyes not only confirmed previous suggestions which were made regarding Ca2? mobilization events in the salivary glands but also clearly established the sequence and spatial aspects of the [Ca2?]i  changes at a cellular level. Studies using fluorescent dyes to monitor [Ca2?]i rapidly evolved from studies in cell populations to those in single cells. A primary observation made was that cell stimulation induced biphasic increase in [Ca2?]i; an initial rapid increase in [Ca2?]i which was transient in nature and decreased to a lower more sustained elevation [4, 5, 9, 10, 17]. These results confirmed that the second phase of Ca2? increase was due to Ca2? influx into the cell from the external medium. These studies firmly established that while fluid secretion as well as Rb? and Cl- efflux could be stimulated by intracellular Ca2? release, prolonged secretion was dependent on the sustained elevation in [Ca2?]i which was achieved primarily by Ca2? influx. Studies in single cells also demonstrated an important feature of Ca2? signaling. It was shown that low concentrations of agonists produced oscillatory changes in [Ca2?]i, some of which were also spatially restricted within a certain domain in the cell. The pattern of these oscillations was highly cell-type and agonist specific [6, 9, 10]. 21 Mechanisms that Contribute to Cytosolic [Ca ]i Increase  The major mechanisms that contribute to regulation of [Ca2?]i following agonist stimulation of cells are Ca2? channels in the intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum, and those in the plasma membrane, calcium pumps, and mitochondria. The role of mitochondria in the spreading of cytosolic calcium waves has been studied somewhat in detail in some exocrine gland cells and the function of the Ca2? pumps have also been examined in isolated cells preparations [3, 4, 6, 8–11, 13]. Here we will focus the discussion on the intracellular Ca2? release and Ca2? entry mechanisms. Channel  One of the best characterized and most important Ca2? channels in cells is the IP3-sensitive Ca2? channel in the endoplasmic reticulum which allows Ca2? to be rapidly released from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2? stores into the cytosol [19, 20]. This channel is regulated in a complex way by a number of different factors and proteins and in turn IP3 receptor regulates a number of key signaling events in the cell. As mentioned above, two major isoforms IP3 receptor2 and IP3 receptor3 are found in salivary gland acinar cells which are concentrated in the luminal end of the cell. This localization is consistent with the observation that agonist stimulated rise in [Ca2?]i initiated at the luminal pole of the cell. Such regulation provides a process by which the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2? stores can be protected and [Ca2?]i can be tightly regulated within the range required for the physiological function of the cell. Such regulation of IP3 receptor can also account for [Ca2?]i oscillations, although not in all cell types. Influx  Although evidence for the involvement of Ca2? influx in salivary fluid secretion was provided almost 30 years ago [18] the molecular mechanism(s) involved in regulating this process proved to be a major challenge in the field of salivary gland physiology as well as calcium signaling in non-excitable cells. Interestingly, some of the earliest studies of Ca2? influx were performed with salivary gland cells. These studies showed that Ca2? influx into cells was increased several fold following stimulation of the cells with an agonist and inactivated when the stimulus was removed or an antagonist was added giving rise to the suggestion that Ca2? influx was activated either directly as a result of agonist binding to the receptor, i.e. via receptoroperated Ca2? entry or by an intracellular second messenger via a second messenger operated entry (SMOC). An important study demonstrated that when cells were treated with the SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin, there was slow depletion of internal Ca2? stores and activation of  Ca2? store-operated calcium entry is the primary mode of Ca2? influx in salivary gland cells following stimulation with muscarinic and a1-adrenergic agonists [4, 5, 14]. The first model proposed by Putney for the regulation of store-operated calcium entry suggested that the internal Ca2? store is physically linked to the plasma membrane such that Ca2? entering the cell directly enters the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2? store from where it is released via the IP3-sensitive channel [15]. However, using Mn2? as a Ca2? surrogate ion researchers clarified that the route of Ca2? entry into endoplasmic reticulum was via the cytosol; i.e. Ca2? entered the cell from where it was pumped into endoplasmic reticulum by the SERCA activity [15]. This Ca2? entry pathway was shown to be involved in regulating key cellular functions; including exocrine secretion, platelet aggregation, endothelial cell permeability and migration, cell proliferation, T-lymphocyte activation, and mast cell degranulation. These studies confirmed the earlier findings by demonstrating that carbachol-induced [Ca2?]i increase was markedly impaired in submandibular gland cells from mice lacking M(3) receptors and completely absent in those lacking both M(1) and M(3) receptors. Furthermore, compared with the secretion in WT mice, Protease-activated receptor-2-mediated salivary secretion and [Ca2?]i response were enhanced in mice lacking M(3) or both M(1) and M(3) mAChRs, in which muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-stimulated secretion and  [Ca2?]i response in acinar cells were severely impaired. regulators of G protein signaling proteins accelerate the GTPase activity of Ga subunits to determine the duration of the stimulated state and control G protein-coupled receptor-mediated cell signaling. In cells derived from regulators of G protein signaling2(-/-) mice the kinetics of IP3 production was modified without an effect on the peak level of IP(3) [27]. The cells were also adapted to deletion of regulators of G protein signaling2 by reducing Ca2? signaling excitability. Functional Significance of InsP3R Family  InsP3R2 and InsP3-3 are the main receptors found in acinar cells leading to the question as to whether this is reflective of redundancy or do particular sub-types make  specific contribution to the function of the gland. In addition, Ca2? release via InsP3R was markedly influenced by the levels of cellular ATP, potentially linking the extent of Ca2? release to the metabolic status of the cell. Studies reported by Ambudkar and co-workers have provided evidence for the involvement of TRPC1 in store-operated calcium entry in the human salivary gland cell line, HSG [4, 32–35]. Further, store-operated calcium entry stimulated either by agonist- or thapsigargin was significantly reduced in salivary gland acinar cells isolated from TRPC1-/-mice. In addition, inhibitors of store-operated calcium entry, 1 lM Gd3? as well as 20 lM 2APB completely blocked store-operated calcium entry in agonist and thapsigargin-stimulated submandibular gland acini which demonstrated that store-operated calcium entry is the primary Ca2? entry pathway into these cells (this agrees with the lack of Ca2? influx in acini from IP3 receptor2 ? IP3 receptor3-/- mice discussed above). This important study finally established TRPC1 as a critical channel component of store-operated calcium entry in salivary gland acinar cells which is essential for neurotransmitter-regulation of fluid secretion. Another transient receptor potential channel protein, TRPC3, was shown to function as store-operated calcium entry channel in vivo to mediate a significant portion of the receptor-stimulated Ca2? influx in exocrine pancreatic cells. TRPC3-mediated Ca2? influx in these cells affected the frequency of Ca2? oscillations and moreover excessive Ca2? influx by TRPC3 during supramaximal receptor stimulation was toxic to acinar cells and responsible in part to the cell stress and damage in pancreatitis. Therefore, it was suggested that inhibition of acinar cell TRPC3 and/or other Ca2? influx channels may be considered as a strategy to control and reduce the severity of pancreatitis [36]. channels that are found in T lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cells. However in a recent study, TRPC1, STIM1 or Orai1 were knocked down in isolated exocrine cell preparations and this lead to reduced store-operated calcium entry and frequency of Ca2? oscillations [48]. Thus, although the exact physiological role of Orai1 and STIM1 in exocrine gland function needs to be confirmed by using relevant mouse models, these recent data provide further demonstration for the requirement of all three proteins in Ca2? signaling in exocrine acinar cells. 21 Spatial Aspects of Ca Signaling Mechanisms  The highly polarized nature of epithelial secretory cells in exocrine glands necessitates targeting of functionally relevant proteins to specific locations in the cells. Further, key  signaling proteins are assembled into complexes which confines the Ca2? signaling apparatus, and [Ca2?]i signals, to specific cellular microdomains. Such high degree of compartmentalization in the cellular localization has been shown for several Ca2? signaling molecules, including G protein coupled receptors and their associated proteins, Ca2? influx channels at the plasma membrane and Ca2? release channels in the endoplasmic reticulum [8, 49, 50]. Consistent with this prediction, immunolocalization revealed concentration of Ca2? signaling proteins at the apical pole of polarized cells. The polarized localization of proteins and organelles results in generation of Ca2? microdomains, primarily by limiting the diffusion of Ca2? in the cell and segregating locally generated Ca2? signals. An example of this is found in pancreatic acinar cells where mitochondria cause a fire wall effect and restrict [Ca2?]i elevations to the apical region [9, 10, 13]. Interestingly, TRPC1 is primarily localized in the basal and lateral regions of acinar cells while TRPC3 is also seen in the apical region of the cell [14, 48]. Following cell stimulation, STIM1 moves to the lateral and basal region of the cells where it co-localizes with Orai1 and TRPC channels which are localized there. It is important to note that ion flux components as well as AQP water channels display polarized localization in acinar cells, consistent with the vectorial transport of ions and water from the basolateral region of the cell to the apical pole. Ca2? regulated KCa channels as well as NKCC1 are localized in the basolateral region of acinar cells while TMEM16A and AQP5, which are also dependent on [Ca2?]i increase, are localized in the luminal membrane [4, 5]. Thus, it can be speculated that these different ion channels could be regulated by local changes in [Ca2?]i which are generated by the activity of Ca2? channels residing in those specific cellular domains. The exact local and global [Ca2?]i increases contributed by Orai1 channels, localized in the lateral and luminal region of the cells, as well as TRPC1 which are localized in the basolateral regions in response to stimulation of cells by agonists needs to be determined. Conclusions and Questions  In summary, in the past four decades since the identification of Ca2? as a critical factor in salivary gland function, several key components that are involved in generating and regulating cellular [Ca2?] signals have now been identified (Fig. 1). While the role of DAG, other than in activation of PKC, is not yet known, IP3 binds to IP3 receptor initiating intracellular Ca2? release. Interestingly, localization of these receptors in the cell is consistent with the  Fig. The figure Ca receptors shows Ca2? mobilizing events basolateral muscarinic (m ,m TRPC1 3 1) in acinar cells that are initiated α1 adrenergic by a stimulus and lead to fluid PMCA 1, 2, 4 PMCA purinergic secretion.

Studies from the Ambudkar lab have shown that TRPC1 is a major contributor to store-operated calcium entry in salivary gland acinar cells and thus in the regulation of salivary fluid secretion. Muallem and co-workers have reported the relevance of TRPC1 in pancreatic acini and also demonstrated that TRPC3 contributes to store-operated calcium entry in pancreatic acinar cells. Studies from several leading researchers demonstrate that Ca2? signaling proteins as well as Ca2? signals and cellular functions are compartmentalized in cells. Concentrated localization of IP3Rs in the luminal region of the cells is consistent with the [Ca2?]i signals detected at that location as well as the main secretory functions that are triggered at the luminal membrane by Ca2? elevations. Furthermore, consistent with the predicted site of Ca2? influx, key components of store-operated calcium entry; TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1, are localized in the lateral and basal membrane regions in stimulated cells. Together, these studies elucidate the key components of Ca2? signaling in exocrine gland cells and provide insight into the spatiotemporal aspects of their contribution to salivary gland function. What Ca2?  sensors are involved and how the Ca2? signal is translated to regulate specific cellular functions? The mechanisms involved in the targeting and assembly of signaling complexes to various cellular locations is another area that needs to be examined in great detail.

While glutathione S-tranferases are ubiquitously expressed, their tissue (and even cellular within the same tissue) distribution in mammals is variable and complex [14,15]. In oncology, interest in the glutathione S-transferase family of proteins has been fueled by the fact that high levels of glutathione S-transferase P (the most ubiquitous and prevalent glutathione S-transferase in nonhepatic tissues) are found in many tumors (in particular ovarian, non-small-cell lung, breast, colon, pancreas, and lymphomas) and in a wide range of drug-resistant cell lines and tumors [20]. When compared to normal tissues or wild-type cell lines, these enhanced expression ratios have not always been readily explained. However, an MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell line resistant to adriamycin was found to have approximately 50-fold more glutathione S-transferase P than the albeit low expressing wild-type line [23]. In this regard, some tumors or drug-resistant cells may depend on this protein. Because of the proliferative nature of tumor cells, kinase pathways are frequently aberrantly regulated, and consequently, there could be a homeostatic attempt to compensate by enhancing expression of glutathione S-transferase P to counterbalance increased kinase activity. Because the kinase/ phosphatase cycle effects multiple pathways critical to uncontrolled cell growth it would not be unreasonable to speculate that a relative abundance of glutathione S-transferase P may reflect roles unrelated to its capacity to enact catalytic detoxification. While it appears that cells are quite capable of adapting to high expression levels of glutathione S-transferase P, how cells might adapt to the absence of glutathione S-transferase P would also provide an insight into the importance of this protein. Mouse embryo fibroblast cells isolated from wild type differed from glutathione S-transferase P null animals in a number of characteristics relevant to signaling and growth pathways [28]. The doubling time for wild-type cells was 33.6 h versus 26.2 h for glutathione S-transferase P null. Both early passage and immortalized Mouse embryo fibroblast cells from glutathione S-transferase P null animals had elevated activities of extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1/ERK2). In general, ablation of glutathione S-transferase P influences the capacity of stress kinases to regulate gene expression impacting on cell proliferation pathways. As discussed in  the pertinent sections, pharmacological suppression of glutathione S-transferase P, while not as efficient as genetic ablation, also causes changes in these same pathways and can influence cell proliferation (particularly in the bone marrow) in a therapeutic setting. glutathione S-transferase P and cell redox homeostasis  Since most cancer drugs are not good substrates for glutathione S-transferase P, the question of why acquired drug-resistant cells have such high levels of this isozyme seems perplexing. Moreover, even without drug selection glutathione S-transferase P can be one of the more prevalent cytosolic proteins in cancer cells. These observations would seem to indicate that glutathione S-transferase P has a diversity of functions in cancer cells, some of which are likely unrelated to the detoxification of chemicals or drugs. General considerations of cellular redox homeostasis begin to shed light on the apparent conundrum. The balance between oxidation and reduction reactions determines cellular redox homeostasis and plays an essential role in numerous signaling cascades including those associated with proliferation, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and senescence. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; RNS) are invariable components of aerobic metabolism and are key contributors to cellular redox. However, within the cancer field, it is generally accepted that phosphorylation is perhaps the most critical protein modification that influences cell signaling pathways.

Partly because of the sensitivity of detection issues, there is still debate over whether S-glutathionylation is primarily a response to external stress or whether it has an important role in physiological processes in "unstressed" cells. Although this cannot yet be answered definitively, it is clear that cytoskeletal restructuring during cell growth is impacted by S-glutathionylation, particularly of actin. Actin  The most readily detected S-glutathionylated protein is actin and growth factor stimulation of cells can produce extensive actin S-glutathionylation and alter the ratios of the soluble:polymerized protein. This may influence cellular architecture and membrane ruffling with consequential changes in a number of cytoskeletal  Fig. HEK293-WT cells were treated with the indicated amounts of PABA/NO for 1 h (A). functions, including intracellular trafficking. S-glutathionylation of actin influences cell adhesion and protein–protein interactions as well as cell–cell interactions [45] and the modified protein has a weaker affinity for tropomyosin [46]. S-Glutathionylation of actin provides a primary example where the posttranslational modification results from a physiological response consequential to cell growth—rather than a stress response to an exogenous insult. Specific S-glutathionylation also causes glutathione S-transferase P oligomerization, a process with probable consequences to other components of cellular stress response. By immunoprecipitating Jun N-terminal kinase1/2 (in HEK293 cells) it was demonstrated that Cys47 and Cys101 in glutathione S-transferase P are critical for these protein–protein interactions [47]. S-Glutathionylation of Cys47 and/or  Cys101 interferes with complex formation with other proteins and with respect to the Jun N-terminal kinase:glutathione S-transferase P interaction, the result may be an attenuation of cellular signaling events mediated by Jun N-terminal kinase. Ca2+ fluxes could activate NADPH oxidase [61] and superoxide radical generated outside the cells could influx through chloride ion channel-3 channels [62]. Treatment with the NO-releasing prodrug, PABA/NO causes changes in Ca2+/NO homeostasis that start as an extracellular NO-mediated surface protein–thiol modification [63]. Intracellularly the drug generates NO and a stable nitro-aromatic GSH conjugate (PABA-SG), the latter of which inhibits SERCA initiating an intracellular Ca2+ increase, activating calmodulin, and consequently Endothelial nitric oxide synthase with the resultant NO burst [64]. It seems likely that PABA/NO causes intracellular NO levels to rise above a certain threshold through Endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation with a subsequent conversion of S-nitrosylated to S-glutathionylated cysteine(s). The first through GSNO (activated glutathione thiol) formation and subsequent reaction with protein–thiol [67]; the second through an intermediate protein–thiol nitrosylation (activated protein– thiol: analogue of sulfenic acid) and its subsequent reaction with the most abundant intracellular redox buffer, GSH [68]. Overall, indications are that PABA/NO-mediated Endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation results in its S-glutathionylation in HL60 and HDMVE cells [64]. Alternatively, in tumor cells with high levels of glutathione S-transferase P expression, the rate of PABA/NO-mediated NO increase could be substantially faster [38], outcompeting Endothelial nitric oxide synthase down-regulation through S-nitrosylation/glutathionylation and this could contribute to the cytotoxicity of the drug. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase S-glutathionylation in endothelial cells caused loss of NO and gain of superoxide generation and was associated with impaired endotheliumdependent vasodilation. They concluded that S-glutathionylation of Endothelial nitric oxide synthase provides redox regulation of cellular signaling, endothelial function, and vascular tone. Release of NO from PABA/NO caused S-glutathionylation of Protein disulfide isomerase in tumor cells [72]. There are now associations between protein S-glutathionylation and ER stress in human diseases such as ischemia/cardiovascular disease and Friedreich's ataxia, Alzheimers disease, type 2 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, cataracts, and sickle cell anemia (for discussion see [35]). Different forms of stress mediate Jun N-terminal kinase activation via various cellular pathways with resultant JNKmediated phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF2, p53, and ELK-1 and stimulation of downstream events that directly contribute to the stress response through changes in the cell cycle, DNA repair, or apoptosis [73,75]. In cells under normal growth conditions, basal activity of Jun N-terminal kinase is necessarily maintained at a low level. However activity can be enhanced in response to growth factors [76] and hence should also be observed in cells proliferating under normal growth conditions. Mouse embryo fibroblast cells null for glutathione S-transferase P contain higher levels of Jun N-terminal kinase activity than their wild-type counterparts [28]. Regulation of Jun N-terminal kinase activity in response to stress is independent of transcript and protein levels of the kinase, but several studies implicated the existence of endogenous Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitors in normal growing cells. 6 illustrates in cartoon form how in nonstressed cells, low Jun N-terminal kinase activity is maintained as a consequence of sequestration of the kinase in a multiprotein complex which includes Glutathione S-Transferase P1-Jun N-terminal kinase [54]. In cells exposed to oxidative stress (or drug treatment), Glutathione S-Transferase P1 dissociates from the complex, accumulating as glutathione S-transferase P oligomers [54], with resultant activation of released Jun N-terminal kinase impacting subsequent downstream events, which contingent on cell or tissue type can include such divergent events as proliferation or apoptosis [77]. Such a mechanism could explain why increased glutathione S-transferase P levels occur in resistant tumor cells even when the selecting drug is not a substrate for GSH conjugation. In this instance, physical interactions between the HPV-16 E7 viral factor and the Glutathione S-Transferase P1 can enact survival capabilities of host cells. Concomitant increases in GSH in HPV-16 E7-infected cells can then also increase the concentration of reduced Glutathione S-Transferase P1. Glutathione S-Transferase P1*C is an allelic variant predominant in malignant glioma cells and differs from other Glutathione S-Transferase P1 variants by two transitions resulting in Ile105Val and Ala114Val [96,97].

N0–tetrakis (2-chloroethyl)phosphorodiamidate)-sulfonyl-propionyl-(R)-(-)phenylglycine] is the most advanced lead clinical candidate from a group of rationally designed glutathione analogues designed to exploit high glutathione S-transferase P levels in solid tumors and drugresistant cells [108]. Selective targeting of susceptible tumor phenotypes is a strategy that results in release of more active drug in malignant cells compared with normal tissue, thereby enhancing the therapeutic index. In a series of Phase II clinical trials, TLK-286 was initially shown to have clinical activity and a favorable toxicity profile as a single agent in the salvage setting in ovarian, non-small-cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancers. Redox, glutathione S-transferase P, and bone marrow  While the aberrant redox potential of tumor cells is well established, it is also apparent that many normal tissues are sensitive to changes in physiological redox homeostasis. Although the importance of thiols and redox in the regulation of bone marrow cell proliferation has been appreciated for some 50 years [111], it is only recently that some mechanistic  explanations for the linkage have been forthcoming. Long-term, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells have low levels of intracellular Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and mice deficient in Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species regulating genes have hematopoietic stem cells that retain neither quiescence nor self-renewal capacities [112]. It appears that two distinct populations of hematopoietic stem cells can be identified based on their baseline Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. While both populations have similar cell surface markers, ROSlow hematopoietic stem cells retain self-renewal capabilities in serial transplantations, whereas this is diminished in ROShigh hematopoietic stem cells. N-Acetylcysteine-mediated thiol antioxidant treatment can rescue hematopoietic stem cells self-renewal [113], indicating that redox manipulation of subpopulations may influence migration and differentiation potentials. Moreover, AIDS patients have decreased GSH levels in their blood cells [114] and N-Acetylcysteine has also been shown to be effective in the management of patients with HIV, influencing Th1 versus Th2 cytokine response patterns [115]. While early preclinical testing focused on overcoming glutathione S-transferase P-associated drug resistance, further rodent studies revealed that the drug also caused an increase in circulating blood cells of all lineages [28]. Telintra increased peripheral white blood cell number in wild-type mice when compared to glutathione S-transferase P-deficient mice. Genetic ablation (i.e., glutathione S-transferase P-null animals) produced a phenotype characterized by an increase in myeloid cell differentiation and proliferation, evidenced by elevated numbers of circulating leukocytes. This could be interpreted as a consequence of increased numbers of bone marrow progenitor cells that (re)populate circulating mature blood cells [116]. 7. Representative model of the effects of Telintra, a peptidomimetic inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase P on hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Hematopoietic stem cells are located either at the osteoblastic (with the osteoblasts) or at the vascular niche. Hematopoietic stem cells in the osteoblastic niche maintain self-renewal and quiescent capabilities while temporal expression of adhesive molecules cytokines or chemokines can influence migration to the vascular niche. html), a stem cell disorder characterized by ineffective blood cell production and an increased risk for transformation to acute leukemia. Domains 1 blood cell, platelet, and growth factor support. Redox as part of the marrow environment  All differentiated hematopoietic cells traverse to the peripheral blood from distinct microenvironments where hematopoietic stem cells, hematopoetic progenitor cells, and mature plasma cells occupy their own niches (Fig. 7). A variety of local factors can maintain and influence hematopoietic stem cells number and destiny. Approximately 75% of hematopoietic stem cells are not actively cycling at any given time [118] and these quiescent cells may reside at the osteoblastic niche. Conversely, hematopoietic stem cells in the vascular niche favors proliferation and differentiation [117,119–122] (Fig. 7). Osteoclast and osteoblast-mediated bone remodeling results in a Ca2+ gradient in the endosteum, enabling calcium-sensitive Hematopoietic stem cells to sense and migrate appropriately [125]. The hypoxic osteoblastic environment encourages hematopoietic stem cells quiescence and movement along the oxygen gradient to the vascular niche promotes hematopoietic stem cells differentiation [121]. While both oxygen and calcium gradients are involved in this process, it seems probable that a redox gradient may also influence hematopoietic stem cells migration and differentiation. Older mice accumulate hematopoietic stem cells more distantly in the endosteum and have increased levels of endogenous DNA damage in their hematopoietic stem cells [127,128]. This correlates with increasing numbers, but decreasing function of aged hematopoietic stem cells [129] and perhaps may be explained by accumulation of oxidative stress associated with the aging process. For example, Nrf2 is a redox-activated transcription factor that regulates antioxidant Phase I and Phase II enzymes [130,131] and hematopoietic stem cells from Nrf2null mice have increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. In addition, the forkhead O (FoxO) family of transcription factors can protect quiescent hematopoietic stem cells from oxidative stress through regulation of Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species detoxifying genes. FoxOs are expressed commensurate with the transition of hematopoietic stem cells to myeloid progenitors and conditional silencing of FoxO increases Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and decreases repopulating capacities of hematopoietic stem cells. These observations are consistent with the fact that altered redox conditions regulate hematopoietic stem cells  differentiation.

18706000	Leading opinion  Withdrawal from statins: implications for secondary stroke prevention and acute treatment  Manuel Rodrı ́guez-Ya ́ n~ez1, Antonio Da ́ valos2, and Jose ́ Castillo1  There is increasing evidence of the benefit of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of stroke and other cardiovascular events, in relation to the reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels, and also with noncholesterol-related mechanisms, such as endothelial function, inflammatory response and proliferation of smooth cells, named pleiotropic effects. Statins have a vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effect and reduce the excitotoxic effects of glutamate during acute phase of stroke, and increase angiogenesis, endogenous cell proliferation and new synapsis formation, which contributes to neuro repair. Statins act by blocking hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase, which results in a reduction in mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor, but they also inhibit the synthesis of several isoprenoid intermediates in mevalonate pathway, which are involved in many cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, expression of cytokines and activation of nuclear factor, triggering the inflammatory response. Moreover, it has been shown that statins improve endothelial function and decrease inflammatory response, decreasing proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, the accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages and metalloproteinase expression (4). In animal models of stroke, the administration of statins increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, which exerts an antithrombotic, vasodilatatory and anti-inflammatory effect, and reduces free radical neuronal damage by decreasing inflammatory cytokine production and lipid peroxidation. This effect may be explained by the fact that statins increase nitric oxide production (9,10), which results in vasodilatation, as well as enhances angiogenesis by increasing mobilization and functionality of endothelial progenitor cells (11). It has been shown in animal models of brain ischemia that statins increase angiogenesis, endogenous cell proliferation and new synapsis formation (12). 7 Zacco A, Togo J, Spence K et al. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors protect cortical neurons from excitotoxicity. 11 Llevadot J, Murasawa S, Kureishi Y et al. hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase inhibitor mobilizes bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells.

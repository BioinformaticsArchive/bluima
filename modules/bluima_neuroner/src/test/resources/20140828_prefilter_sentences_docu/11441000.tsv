Our results showed that the 2 subunit and a closely related protein (called 3) co-sedimented and co-immunoprecipitated with neuronal Ca2 channel subunits in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the 2 subunit is an important constituent of the neuronal Ca2 channel complex and that it down-regulates neuronal Ca2 channel activity. Furthermore, the 2 subunit likely contributes to the fine-tuning of neuronal Ca2 channels by counterbalancing the effects of the 2 subunit. Voltage-activated Ca2 channels play a major role in many fundamental physiological processes including neurotransmission, muscle contraction, intracellular signaling, hormone secretion, and development. An additional auxiliary subunit, , initially detected only in skeletal muscle, has been recently suggested to be a component of the neuronal Ca2 channel complex (3). The study suggested that this novel gene encodes a subunit for neuronal Ca2 channels that has been named 2 (or stargazin). In this study, by showing the association of the 2 subunit with other Ca2 channel subunits, we provide biochemical data supporting the hypothesis that the 2 subunit is a component of the neuronal Ca2 channel complex. Furthermore, by examining the function of the 2 subunit using recombinant 1B- and 1A-class Ca2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we show that the novel 2 subunit participates in the modulation of the neuronal Ca2 channels. Our results demonstrate that the 2 subunit is a part of the neuronal Ca2 channel complex and has a 2 -dependent inhibitory effect on the channel activity.

RESULTS Association of the 2 Subunit with Neuronal Ca2 Channel Subunits—The association of the 2 subunit with the neuronal Ca2 channel complex was investigated through sucrose gradient fractionation analysis as follows. Regulation of current amplitude of neuronal Ca2 channels by the subunit in various subunit composition. The number of recorded cells is indicated in 1B 3 2 parentheses within the legends representing subunit composition. The same blots were probed with the anti- 2 antibodies to show that the whole neuronal Ca2 channel complexes were immunoprecipitated. These immunoprecipitation results strongly suggest that the 2 and 3 subunits bind to neuronal Ca2 channel complexes composed of 1A/B, 2 , and subunits. Taken together, the co-sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation of the 2 and 3 subunits with other neuronal Ca2 channel subunits constitute what is to our knowledge the first biochemical evidence that the 2 and 3 subunits are structural components of neuronal Ca2 channel complexes of the 1Band 1A-class. Effect of the 2 Subunit on the Current Amplitude of Recombinant 1B- and 1A-class Ca2 Channels—Having shown that the 2 subunit is an important part of the neuronal Ca2 channels, we next explored the effects of this subunit on Ba2 current through 1 3 2 channels using Xenopus oocytes as an expression system. 2 (A and B), peak current amplitude was 1.22 0.08 A (n 9) in cells expressing 1B 3 2 and significantly decreased to 0.76 0.07 A (n 8) and 0.82 0.08 A (n 9) upon co-expression of 2 (p 0.001) and 1 (p 0.003), respectively. Overall, the cells coexpressing 2 (n 31) showed 36.8 1.6% decrease of peak current amplitude compared with the cells expressing only 1B 3 2 (n 25). In this case, peak amplitude decreased significantly from 0.40 0.04 A (n 11) to 0.18 0.03 A (n 5) in cells expressing 1A 3 2 and 1A 3 2 2 (p 0.007), respectively. Overall, the cells co-expressing 2 (n 36) showed 39.7 5.9% decrease of peak current amplitude compared with the cells expressing only 1A 3 2 (n 25). Therefore, it seems that the inhibitory effect of the 2 subunits on neuronal Ca2 channel current amplitude is dependent on the 2 co-expression. DISCUSSION Interaction of the 2 Subunit with the Neuronal Ca2 Channel Complex—In this study, the association of the 2 subunit with neuronal Ca2 channel complexes was analyzed through sucrose density gradient fractionation and immunoprecipitation. Both biochemical analyses consistently demonstrated that the 2 subunits are associated with neuronal Ca2 channels ( 1B- and 1A-class). In addition, the biochemical analyses in this study also showed, for the first time, that the protein expression of the 2 subunit is totally absent in the brain of the stargazer mouse and that the 3 subunit is also associated with the neuronal Ca2 channels. Our biochemical and biophysical data strongly suggest that 2 is an auxiliary subunit of neuronal Ca2 channels like the and 2 subunits. 1, the 2 association with neuronal Ca2 channels was confirmed by both co-sedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation of the 2 subunit with the other components of neuronal Ca2 channels. Additionally, our biophysical studies suggest an inhibitory role for the 2 subunit on neuronal Ca2 channel activity. This is consistent with a recent patch clamp study in brain slices of the stargazer mouse that showed the current amplitude of voltage-activated Ca2 channel in thalamocortical relay neurons is significantly increased (30). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the 2 subunit is a component of neuronal Ca2 channels in vivo. However, Chen et al. showed no significant change of the Ca2 channel current in the isolated cerebellar granule cells between the stargazer and wild-type mice. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the loss of 4 subunit did not cause any significant change in the Ca2 channel current of Purkinje neurons from lethargic mouse, due to increased steady-state association of 1 subunit with the remaining 1–3 isoforms (32). Similar functional compensation might occur in the Ca2 channels of the cerebellar granule cells of the stargazer mouse. The Modulation of Neuronal Ca2 Channels by the 2 Subunit—The electrophysiological analysis in this study brought out two major points about the modulation of neuronal Ca2 channels by the 2 subunit. First, the main function of the 2 subunit on neuronal Ca2 channels seems to be an inhibitory effect on functional activity of these channels. In addition, the consistent 2 inhibitory effect in vitro and in vivo suggests that the downregulation of neuronal Ca2 channel activity by the 2 subunit may be important for the prevention of neuronal hyperexcitability that has been suggested as a mechanism of epilepsy in the stargazer mouse. 2 and 4 suggest that 2 might counteract the 2 effects on neuronal Ca2 channels. 5 strongly suggest that the 2 subunit antagonizes the modulatory effect of 2 on current amplitude of neuronal Ca2 channels. In addition, the 2 dependence of the 2 inhibitory effect could eliminate the possibility of nonspecific inhibition of 2 on the expression of neuronal Ca2 channels in our experiments. Previously, Letts et al. (3) and Klugbauer et al. (10) reported that 2 co-expression shifted the voltage dependence of steadystate inactivation to more negative potentials but had no effect on the current amplitude of 1A 2 Ca2 channels expressed in baby hamster kidney and HEK293 cells, respectively. The Modulation of Ca2 Channels by the 1 Subunit—Interestingly, the 1 subunit exerted a modulatory effect similar to that of 2 on neuronal Ca2 channels despite its muscle-specific expression and significant primary sequence divergence between the two isoforms. The 1 subunit decreased current amplitude of both neuronal 1B-class (Fig. 2, A and B) and 1A-class channels (data not shown), and modulated the activation kinetics of 1B-class channels (Fig. 4 (C and D) and Table I). Depending on the subunit composition, 1 co-expression increased or decreased the current amplitude of 1C- or 1A-class channels expressed in oocytes or HEK 293 cells (4 – 6, 9). In summary, our study demonstrates the association of the 2 subunit with the neuronal Ca2 channel complex in vivo and indicates an inhibitory function for the 2 subunit.

Surprisingly, the most common malignancy in our experience was not enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, but small bowel adenocarcinoma (three cases, 16.66%), followed by enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (two cases, 11.1%). Lymphocytes gastritis, a typical gastric T-cell infiltration often founding in celiac disease [29], may be the key point, and may activate the B-lymphocytes. The longterm chronic stimulation of T- and B-cells may lead to acquired mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and then to gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-lymphoma. celiac disease and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis may share similar pathogenetic mechanism resulting from increased tumoral necrosis factor-a and increased permeability [33], leading to translocation of gut bacteria, Kupffer cell stimulation, and reactive oxygen species production, resulting in liver inflammation [33].

Blood vessel formation occurs either by vasculogenesis, when a new network of capillaries is formed from endothelial precursor cells differentiating in situ, or by angiogenesis, when new capillaries invade the organ by forming vascular sprouts that originate from pre-existing vessels.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor-D is secreted into the extracellular space as a full-length Vascular endothelial growth factor-D homodimer. In this article human VEGF-D refers to mature human VEGF-D N C. Cellular effects of human VEGF-D depend on the receptor and target cell type. Vascular endothelial cells express VEGFR-2, and the expression is up-regulated inter alia by angiogenesis.8 Briefly, after breeding, fertilized 1-cell– stage oocytes were collected from oviducts of superovulated capillary density2F1 donor females weighing 9 to 12 g. Approximately 100 pL of 109 TU/mL hVEGFD-lentiviral was injected into the perivitelline space of the oocytes. After overnight recovery and growth in vitro, the 2-cell–stage embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant capillary density2F1 female mice. Immunohistochemistry  Paraffin-embedded sections (5 m thick) were immunostained with the following antibodies: capillary density31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1[PECAM-1], 1:50; BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Diego, CA), capillary density34 (1:20; Hycult Biotechnology, Uden, The Netherlands), lymphatic vessels (1:1000, microwave pretreatment in citrate buffer; ReliaTech, Braunschweig, Germany), human VEGF-D (1:100, microwave pretreatment in citrate buffer; R&D Systems), VEGFR-2 (1:100; eBiosciences, San Diego, CA), VEGFR-3 (1:50; R&D Systems), cytokeratin (creatine kinase, 1:50; Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), cytokeratin 7 (creatine kinase7, 1:50, microwave pr-treatment in citrate buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Well-differentiated multifocal adenocarcinomas in the lungs, as well as skin tumors (basal cell carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma) were found in some mice. Another advantage of the perivitelline injection method over the zona removal is that the fertilized oocytes are transduced at the 1-cell stage. Thus, the transgene is incorporated into each cell of the developing embryo, and mosaicism is usually avoided.

In the present study we have produced transgenic mice by using a lentiviral that, when integrated into the host cell genome, directly produces the human VEGF-D N C and does not increase the amount of full-length, unprocessed human VEGF-D. (B) Higher magnification of the solid part of mammary carcinoma shown in panel A with atypical cells and a few mitotic figures.

(W) Some tumor cells were positive for human VEGF-D immunostaining in an anaplastic carcinoma. Because myoepithelia plays an important role in mammary gland tumorigenesis, one possible mechanistic explanation could be the overexpression of Vascular endothelial growth factor-D in these cells.

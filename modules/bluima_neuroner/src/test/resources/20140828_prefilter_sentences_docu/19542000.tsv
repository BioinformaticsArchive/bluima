19542000	Survival kinetics of the mutant strain cultured in macrophages maintained with sub-optimal concentrations of the branched-chain amino acids did not show any loss of viability, indicating either that the intracellular environment was rich in these amino acids or that the other Acetohydroxyacid synthase catalytic subunits were functional under these conditions. It has also been reported that the growth of Brucella abortus inside macrophages could be inhibited by sulfonylureas, raising the possibility of using Acetohydroxyacid synthase as a drug target for intracellular pathogens (Boigegrain et al., 2005). Five microlitres of this cell lysate was used for PCR in a 25 ml volume. Intracellular infection and survival kinetics of mycobacterial strains were investigated in gamma-interferon-activated primary cultures of bone-marrow-derived macrophages, in a 24-well plate format, as described by Mun~oz-Elı ́as & McKinney (2005). Briefly, bone marrow cells were flushed from mouse femurs and cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco Laboratories) with 20 % L929 conditioned medium, for 5 days. A set of bone-marrow-derived macrophages cells infected with the wild-type or the DilvB1 mutant were lysed on days 1, 4, 7 and 11. A search for genes encoding Acetohydroxyacid synthase in another intracellular mycobacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium leprae, showed the presence of the following genes coding for large subunits of Acetohydroxyacid synthase: ilvB, ilvG and ilvX (KEGG database). In order to understand the expression profile of IlvB1 under active-growth and stationary-phase conditions, the M. tuberculosis cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis using antibodies raised against the IlvB1 protein. This clearly proves that depletion of the intracellular pool of branched-chain amino acids results in death of M. tuberculosis. Since a suboptimal concentration of isoleucine, leucine and valine (20 mg ml21) does not support the growth of the M. tuberculosis DilvB1/19 mutant culture in vitro, the macrophage survival kinetics suggested that intracellular survival of DilvB1/19 in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of isoleucine, leucine and valine was due either to an accumulation of isoleucine, leucine and valine inside macrophages by active uptake, or to other genes encoding the large subunit of Acetohydroxyacid synthase being active in the intracellular environment. Since M. tuberculosis is known to utilize C2 as the preferred carbon source for intracellular survival and replication (Mun~oz-Elias & McKinney, 2006), it can be speculated that some Acetohydroxyacid synthase isozymes might be functional under similar alternative physiological conditions. Studies of a number of branched-chain amino acids auxotrophic mutants of intracellular pathogens, such as S. typhimurium, B. pseudomallei and Listeria monocytogenes, have shown that due to limited availability of these amino acids in vivo, the mutant bacteria are attenuated in virulence, and thus have been proposed as vaccine candidates (Hoiseth & Stocker, 1981; Alexander et al., 1993; Atkins et al., 2002). Targeting of the virulence factor acetohydroxyacid synthase by sulfonylureas results in inhibition of intramacrophagic multiplication of Brucella suis.

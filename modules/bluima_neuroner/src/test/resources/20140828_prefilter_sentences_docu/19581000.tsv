19581000	In addition, flow cytometry was required in order to characterize these lymphocytes as clonal B cells, including positivity for the cell surface antigens CD5 and CD23. This immunophenotype excludes the majority of other reactive or clonal lymphoid disorders that could be confused with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, although other CD5 positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorders with a similar immunophenotype to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma have been recognized [10]. For the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, the 1996 criteria are as follows: an absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count of >5 Ã— 109/L, immunophenotype of the lymphocytes reflecting their B cell origin (CD19, CD20, and CD23 positive), CD5 expression in the absence of other T cell markers, and monoclonality as reflected by low surface density expression of Kappa or Lambda light chains. Patients Count  Total number patients identified 813 Administrative exclusions 118 Diagnosis made before January 1, 1998 115 Diagnosis made after December 31, 2003 1 Residents of another province 2 Diagnostic exclusions 79 Marginal zone lymphoma 23  Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/plasma cell dyscrasia 10 Mantle cell lymphoma 9 Monoclonal B lymphocytosis 8 T cell/LGL leukemia 8 Leukemia unspecified 9 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma-unspecified sub-type 7 Follicular lymphoma 4 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma 1 Final number of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma/Small lymphocytic lymphoma 616  LGL: large granular lymphocytic; chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma/Small lymphocytic lymphoma: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Of these 79 patients, 71 had evidence of alternative hematological neoplasia, while eight had monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis. The most common alternative diagnoses included marginal zone lymphoma (23 patients), lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas/plasma cell dyscrasias (10 patients), mantle cell lymphoma (nine patients), and T/NK cell leukemias (eight patients). However, gender differences in the biological markers and the better response of female patients to chemotherapy suggests cellular or possibly hormonal factors [13,29,30,31].

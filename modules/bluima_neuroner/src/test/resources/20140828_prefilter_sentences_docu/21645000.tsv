21645000	The effect of fca mutation on cell fate and cell autonomy of Arabidopsis seeds showed that fca mutants had no defect in cell number or cell fate in the dry seed except for the fact that it led to the production of more rosette leaves (Furner et al. 1996). Sub-cellular localization studies For localization studies in onion epidermal cells, constructs were precipitated on gold particles and bombarded onto the onion epidermal layer tissue. Sub-cellular localization of barley factors that mediate ABA signaling Consistent with the functionality of an RNA binding protein, Arabidopsis factors that mediate ABA signaling was shown to be localized in the nucleus in onion epidermal cells (Quesada et al. 2003). To determine localization within the cell, a barley factors that mediate ABA signaling construct was prepared to yield an factors that mediate ABA signaling-yellow fluorescent fusion protein. This construct was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Full length VP1 gene in translational fusion to green florescent protein that localized in the nucleus of barley aleurone cells (Marella and Quatrano 2007), was used for identification of the nucleus. Localization of barley factors that mediate ABA signaling-yellow fluorescent fusion protein in onion epidermal cells. (B) Bright field image of onion epidermal cell showing the nucleus corresponding to (A). (A and B) Untransformed cells with no background signal. (C, D, E and F) Images from the same cell transformed with HvFCA(-RRM) –red florescence protein and VP–green florescent protein (used as nuclear localization control). always a problem in aleurone protoplasts, the microscope was adjusted to the minimum laser intensity where the transformed cells had minimal fluorescence and the non-transformed cells had no fluorescence. The same cell that showed nuclear localization of VP1 was also visualized for localization of factors that mediate ABA signaling(-RRM) – red florescence protein using a different filter in the microscope that allowed only red signal to pass. The localization of factors that mediate ABA signaling(-RRM) in the nucleus of aleurone protoplasts was also confirmed in cells that were transformed with factors that mediate ABA signaling(-RRM) – red florescence protein alone (Fig. 9G, H).

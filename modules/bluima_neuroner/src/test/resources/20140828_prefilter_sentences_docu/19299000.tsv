19299000	Nine Hybrid Capture2-positive cases were negative on Human papillomavirus genotyping, including 6 with normal cytologic findings, 2 with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and a single high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion case. Because select expected cell counts were 5 or  less, Fisher exact confidence intervals were computed for prevalence estimates [18]. Of those, 11 cases (2% of the total group) were classified as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, one (b1% of the total group) was atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance, 10 (2% of the total group) were low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 15 (3% of the total group, 41% of those with abnormal cytologic findings) were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (Table 1). atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance 1 0 0 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance 11 8 72.7 (39.0-94.0) atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance 1 0 0 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance 11 8 72.7 (39.0-94.0) This resulted in single additional cases with Human papillomavirus 16 (normal cytologic findings) and 31 (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), 2 cases with Human papillomavirus 70 (both normal cytologic findings), and a single case with Human papillomavirus 67 (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). Either Human papillomavirus16 or 18 was found in 27% and 20% of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions lesions, respectively. Human papillomavirus18 was twice as prevalent as Human papillomavirus16 in those  Table 2 Frequency and prevalence of Human papillomavirus infection type by cytologic finding in Belizean women  Table 2 Frequency and prevalence of Human papillomavirus infection type by cytologic finding in Belizean women  Cytologic finding  Cytologic finding  Total (N = 463), n (%)  Total (N = 463), n (%)  Normal atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n = 426), (n = 1), (n = 11), (n = 10), (n = 15), n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)  Normal atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n = 426), (n = 1), (n = 11), (n = 10), (n = 15), n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)  Table 2 Frequency and prevalence of Human papillomavirus infection type by cytologic finding in Belizean women Cytologic finding Total (N = 463), n (%) Normal atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n = 426), (n = 1), (n = 11), (n = 10), (n = 15), n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)  Multiple types 11 (2.6) - 3 (27.3) 4 (40.0) 5 (33.3) 23 (4.97) Low-risk types 6------ 11 1 (0.2) - - - - 1 (0.22) High-risk types 16 5 (1.2) - - 1 (10.0) 7 (46.7) 13 (2.8) 18 6 (1.4) - 3 (27.3) 1 (10.0) - 10 (2.2) 26 - - - - - - 31 4 (0.9) - - - 2 (13.3) 6 (1.3) 33 4 (0.9) - 1 (9.1) - - 5 (1.1) 35 - - - 2 (20.0) 3 (20.0) 5 (1.1) 39 3 (0.7) - 1 (9.1) - - 4 (0.9) 45 5 (1.2) - 1 (9.1) - - 6 (1.3) 51 3 (0.7) - - - - 3 (0.7) 52 5 (1.2) - - 1 (10.0) 1 (6.7) 7 (1.5) 53 1 (0.2) - - 1 (10.0) - 2 (0.4) 56 4 (0.9) - 1 (9.1) 3 (30.0) - 8 (1.7) 58 2 (0.5) - - - 3 (20.0) 5 (1.1) 59 2 (0.5) - - - 1 (6.7) 3 (0.7) 66 6 (1.4) - - - - 6 (1.3) 68 4 (0.9) - 1 (9.1) 1 (10.0) - 6 (1.3) 73 1 (0.2) - - - - 1 (0.2) 82 1 (0.2) - 1 (9.1) 2 (20.0) 1 (6.7) 5 (1.1)  Table 2 Frequency and prevalence of Human papillomavirus infection type by cytologic finding in Belizean women Cytologic finding Total (N = 463), n (%) Normal atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n = 426), (n = 1), (n = 11), (n = 10), (n = 15), n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) Multiple types 11 (2.6) - 3 (27.3) 4 (40.0) 5 (33.3) 23 (4.97) Low-risk types 6------ 11 1 (0.2) - - - - 1 (0.22) High-risk types 16 5 (1.2) - - 1 (10.0) 7 (46.7) 13 (2.8) 18 6 (1.4) - 3 (27.3) 1 (10.0) - 10 (2.2) 26 - - - - - - 31 4 (0.9) - - - 2 (13.3) 6 (1.3) 33 4 (0.9) - 1 (9.1) - - 5 (1.1) 35 - - - 2 (20.0) 3 (20.0) 5 (1.1) 39 3 (0.7) - 1 (9.1) - - 4 (0.9) 45 5 (1.2) - 1 (9.1) - - 6 (1.3) 51 3 (0.7) - - - - 3 (0.7) 52 5 (1.2) - - 1 (10.0) 1 (6.7) 7 (1.5) 53 1 (0.2) - - 1 (10.0) - 2 (0.4) 56 4 (0.9) - 1 (9.1) 3 (30.0) - 8 (1.7) 58 2 (0.5) - - - 3 (20.0) 5 (1.1) 59 2 (0.5) - - - 1 (6.7) 3 (0.7) 66 6 (1.4) - - - - 6 (1.3) 68 4 (0.9) - 1 (9.1) 1 (10.0) - 6 (1.3) 73 1 (0.2) - - - - 1 (0.2) 82 1 (0.2) - 1 (9.1) 2 (20.0) 1 (6.7) 5 (1.1)  4.2. They examined squamous cell carcinoma-high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ratios for the 8 most common types and observed that the ratios consistently ranged from 1.04 to 4.6 for Human papillomavirus types 16, 18, and 45.

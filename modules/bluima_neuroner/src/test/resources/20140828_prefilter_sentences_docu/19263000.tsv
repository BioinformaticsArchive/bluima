19263000	Cellular proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex present self and non-self antigens to T cells, thus initiating the immune response (Klein 1986). Recent studies have confirmed a correlation between major histocompatibility complex polymorphism and the generation of a diverse and effective immune cell repertoire (Dyall et al. 2000; Messaoudi et al. 2002). The peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules are derived from extracellular proteins, not cytosolic, as in class I. Cloning and sequencing  After amplification, purified polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned, using the pGEM-T Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and then transformed in Escherichia coli competent cells (JM109). Dyall R, Messaoudi I, Janetzki S, Nikolić-Žugić J (2000) major histocompatibility complex polymorphism can enrich the T cell repertoire of the species by shifts in intrathymic selection.

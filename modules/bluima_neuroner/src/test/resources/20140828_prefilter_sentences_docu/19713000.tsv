19713000	Apolipoprotein E protein plays an important role in the metabolism, transport and redistribution of cholesterol carriers and other lipids which are used for membrane synthesis as well as for other cellular anabolic and catabolic activities throughout the body, including those of the CNS, a site of high lipid turnover (Poirier, 2005). apolipoprotein E protein serves as a ligand for the cell-surface low-density lipoprotein receptor family, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor, VLDLR and their related receptors, LRP1, LRP2 and apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Beffert et al., 2004). LRP1 is mainly expressed by neurons, whereas low-density lipoprotein receptor is expressed by glial cells (Fryer et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007). Lipidated apolipoprotein E 4 is less efficient than 3-isoprotein in cholesterol transport in the brain  (Rapp et al., 2006) or in promoting cholesterol efflux from neurons and astrocytes (Michikawa et al., 2000). In primary neurons, apolipoprotein E 4, but not the 3 isoform increases neurotoxicity via LRP1 (Qiu et al., 2003) and neurons seem to be less protected against apoptosis by glial apolipoprotein E 4 lipoproteins compared with 3 lipoproteins (Hayashi et al., 2007). Intriguingly, in contrast to other neurotransmitter systems, the cholinergic system relies heavily on lipids for the synthesis of its neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (Poirier, 2005) and the central cholinergic system is one of the first neuronal networks that is heavily affected by Alzheimer's disease (Davies and Maloney, 1976). The activity of cholinergic neurons also shows an age-dependent decrease (Davies and Maloney, 1976). This is to reduce the symptoms of the disease by inhibiting these enzymes and hence prolonging the action of acetylcholine at synapses of the remaining functional neurons. Inflammation clearly occurs in the Alzheimer's disease brain, through activation of microglial cells in the CNS (Zhu et al., 1999). Variable numbers of activated microglial cells and astrocytes are often situated in the vicinity of the fibrillar core of A plaques (Braak et al., 1998). 2) Recombinant human apolipoprotein E 2, 3 and 4 expressed in insect cells, from Invitrogen (>95%, P2002, P2003 and PV2004, respectively). 3.7. apolipoprotein E and butyrylcholinesterase levels are associated with CSF levels of IL-1β and IL-6  The major sources of apolipoprotein E and butyrylcholinesterase in the CNS are the glial cells, and astrogliosis is one of the characteristic features of the Alzheimer's disease brain. This view  is in agreement with observations in cultured astrocytes from APOE-targeted mice, showing that more apolipoprotein E 4 than 3 molecules are needed to generate lipid particles of a given size (Gong et al., 2002). These observations hence provide new important mechanistic clues about how apolipoprotein E protein might contribute to the acceleration of pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease, which might particularly affect both neuronal and non-neuronal central cholinergic activity. Thus, a high butyrylcholinesterase status (a high acetylcholine-hydrolyzing capacity) is expected to reduce acetylcholine levels, leading to activation of microglial cells and release of interleukin-1 in the CNS.

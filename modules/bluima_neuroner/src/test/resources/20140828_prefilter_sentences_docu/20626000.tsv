20626000	A simple, promising strategy involves the co-culture of vasculogenic cells to form an intrinsic vascular network inside the graft in vitro, which can rapidly anastomose with the host blood vessels in vivo. Recent data have shown that adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction may provide an efficient, convenient, and autologous source for both osteogenic and endothelial cells. Future studies should aim at demonstrating that this approach effectively supports survival of scaled up cell-based bone grafts at an orthotopic site. Acellular allografts (e.g., Tutoplast®) and synthetic bone substitutes made from ceramics such as hydroxyapatite or tricalciumphosphate may be safe and immunologically inert, but are often very brittle and purely osteoconductive, that is, they are slowly colonized by endogenous osteoprogenitors, since they do not contain osteogenic cells. In this approach, osteogenic cells capable of bone formation are harvested from easily accessible tissues (such as the bone marrow), without relevant donor site morbidity, expanded to obtain sufficient numbers and loaded on osteoinductive, biocompatible scaffolds, to generate implantable osteogenic grafts. In contrast to plain osteoconductive scaffolding materials, the primary mechanism of bone regeneration in such tissue-engineered grafts is not ingrowth by resident cells, but de novo bone formation by the implanted osteogenic cells. In addition to reproducibly assuring that the delivered cells are truly osteogenic, the main problem remains the maintenance of cell viability inside large-size tissue-engineered grafts. Whereas cells in the body are typically  Contract grant sponsor: Swiss National Science Foundation; Contract grant number: 310030-120432. To guarantee oxygen and nutrient supply in vitro, cells can be cultured on porous scaffolds in bioreactors in which a constant flow of fresh medium permeates the graft (Wendt et al., 2006). However, upon implantation into the patient, the cell survival depends on invasion by the recipient's blood vessels into the graft, since diffusion from the surrounding host vascular beds only reaches the outer shell of the graft. This has been shown to result in cell death and lack of tissue formation in a large central core of the implants (Radisic et al., 2006) and to limit bone tissue ingrowth to few millimeters even after 8–12 weeks of in vivo implantation (Scheufler et al., 2008). The use of purified factors, such as VEGF, has shown low efficacy in clinical tests due to a very short half-life in vivo (Semenza, 2006), whereas efficient and sustained over-expression, such as from genetically modified cells, has the potential to induce aberrant angiogenesis and growth of hemangiomas, unless the dose is tightly controlled in the microenvironment around each producing cell (Ozawa et al., 2004). In order to render this biological concept clinically applicable, we have recently developed a FACS-based high-throughput method to identify the cells expressing a specific transgene level in a heterogenous transduced population and rapidly purify them, to yield homogeneous therapeutic populations (Misteli et al., 2010). The combination of cell and gene therapy approaches holds promise as a novel strategy for efficient engraftment of tissue-engineered constructs. Preliminary results from our lab suggest that controlled VEGF expression by genetically modified and FACS-purified bone marrow-derived stromal cells (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells) accelerates vascularization of critically sized osteogenic grafts, leading to a significant reduction of the necrotic central core and increased bone formation (Banfi and Largo, personal communication). We demonstrated the feasibility of an ectopic pre-fabrication of large bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells-based engineered bone flaps in a rabbit model (Scheufler et al., 2008), although this study was not designed to test whether survival of cells inside the core of the constructs was increased by such approach. This strategy is very challenging due to the geometry and composition of the osteogenic constructs, often consisting of cells seeded in hard ceramic scaffolds. One possibility to overcome this problem involves the formation of a mouldable construct made of fibrin, cells, and ceramic granulates, which could be shaped directly around the arterio-venous loop (Beier et al., 2010), but which would likely be limited to non-structural, not weight-bearing osteogenic grafts. (iv) An alternative approach involves the supply of vasculogenic cells inside the tissue-engineered construct. A proof of principle for this strategy was provided by co-culturing the myogenic cell line C2C12 with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts on a polymeric scaffold in vitro (Levenberg et al., 2005). The endothelial cells formed a pre-vascular network, in which vascular lumen formation was observed. Upon implantation into immune-deficient mice, the engineered network efficiently connected to the blood vessels of the host and was perfused by host blood, leading to improved survival of the grafted cells. Since co-culture with endothelial cells is a promising approach to reach rapid and complete vascularization of the graft upon in vivo implantation, we will now focus on the latter strategy. In this regard, one major challenge toward a clinically relevant implementation of the approach is to identify an abundant source of autologous endothelial cells. The isolation of endothelial cells from biopsies of skin or saphenous veins, though in principle successful (Rouwkema et al., 2006), results only in limited numbers, and their subsequent expansion in vitro is limited by growth arrest after few passages. Endothelial progenitors cells have been suggested as an endothelial cell source (exhaustively reviewed in Levenberg, 2005) and could be isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood. However, the use of Endothelial progenitors cells requires a separated isolation and expansion, with subsequent seeding into the final construct (Levenberg et al., 2005; Fuchs et al., 2006). This multi-step, time-consuming cell sourcing is likely to be too complex and too expensive to become clinically relevant. Therefore, a single source of human cells, containing both osteogenic and vasculogenic progenitors in clinically relevant numbers would be highly desirable. Very recently bone repair cells, obtained from bone marrow aspirates by specific bioreactor-based culture conditions, have been proposed as a possible cell source of both osteogenic and vasculogenic progenitors (Kaigler et al., 2010). Though the study documented that a subpopulation of bone repair cells exhibit a vascularrelated phenotype, with expression of endothelial and pericytic markers, it did not show that such bone repair cells can directly contribute to the formation of vascular structures in vivo. Adipose Tissue as a Source of Vasculogenic and Osteogenic Cells Since about a decade, adipose tissue has been found to represent a very convenient cell source for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, mainly due to its abundance and ease of harvesting, with minimal associated morbidity, together with a much higher frequency of clonogenic mesenchymal progenitors compared to bone marrow (Gronthos et al., 2001; Zuk et al., 2001). In addition to these features, more recently it has been recognized that the non-adipocyte fraction of adipose tissue is also rich in endothelial cells and progenitors, suggesting that it could represent a unique and abundant source of autologous osteogenic and vasculogenic progenitors. Vasculogenic progenitors It was shown that monolayer expanded, adipose-derived stromal cells, referred to in the literature as ASC, can differentiate into endothelial cells and become vasculogenic (i.e., blood vessel forming) cells. Miranville et al. (2004), simultaneously with Planat-Benard et al. (2004), were the firsts to document, within the freshly isolated human adipose-derived cells, called the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, the presence of a cell population, positive for the progenitor marker CD34, but negative for the mature endothelial marker CD31, which exhibited characteristics of endothelial progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo in a hindlimb ischemia model in nude mice. VEGF (DiMuzio and Tulenko, 2007) and FGF-2 ) ascorbic acid (Ning et al., 2009) have been shown to play pivotal roles in the maintenance and endothelial differentiation of these cells. We have more recently demonstrated that a population of CD34)/CD31) cells, present in the stromal vascular fraction but rapidly lost upon serial passaging during expansion, have an endothelial phenotype and can form blood vessels when implanted in vivo (Scherberich et al., 2007). Taken together, these results suggest that adipose-derived cells, freshly isolated or expanded, constitute a highly relevant reservoir of vascular progenitors. Semantically, osteogenesis means "creation of bone," which is a complex multi-step process, involving a highly coordinated interplay between different cell types such as osteoprogenitors, osteoblasts, and osteoclastic cells generated by monocytes, as well as endothelial and mural vascular cells (Collin-Osdoby et al., 1995). Indeed, no specific parameter has yet been identified to correlate in vitro "osteogenic" capacity — which in fact assesses only the capacity of a cell to produce collagenous matrix and to mineralize it — with in vivo bone formation. So far, only a limited number of studies addressed the actual in vivo bone formation capacity and healing potential of adipose-derived cells. In fact, in an ectopic environment no resident osteogenic cells are present and therefore the true potential of the implanted cells can be rigorously assessed. Based on the specific experimental conditions used (e.g., scaffolding materials, cell culture, and seeding techniques, as well as in vivo durations, summarized in Table 1), we may deduce that two parameters are critically required for the maintenance and/or induction of osteogenic potential by ASC:  (i) Osteogenic commitment of ASC: Studies in which ASC successfully exhibited bone formation in vivo used either in vitro pre-differentiated cells cultured with an osteoblastic differentiation medium (typically containing ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, and beta-glycerophosphate), or cells transfected with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2, Jeon et al., 2008). In one study only, bone formation by human ASC was observed in the absence of a mineral compartment (Liu et al., 2008), by use of a platelet-rich plasma gel as cell carrier.

(2009)  The osteogenic performance of ASC has also been assessed in orthotopic in vivo environments. Such models have the advantage of providing both a more inductive environment to study bone formation, which could likely provide the required triggering of ASC into actual osteogenic cells, and a more physiological/clinically relevant model, which would allow investigating engraftment and implant response to mechanical loading. However, orthotopic models do not easily allow the evaluation of the direct contribution of implanted cells to the generation of bone tissue, since it is not trivial to distinguish bone formation by the implanted ASC or by resident osteogenic cells. Beyond the possibility of an intrinsic osteogenic capacity of the implanted cells, alternative non-mutually exclusive possible mechanisms of bone enhancement include: (1) osteoinduction by released factors; (2) recruitment of resident bone-forming cells into the construct; (3) stimulation of angiogenesis and construct vascularization (Rehman et al., 2004), which would in turn stimulate osteoconduction. Proposed Strategies to Exploit the Osteogenic and Vasculogenic Capacity of Adipose-Derived Progenitors After having presented and discussed the concept of adipose tissue as a single cell source, possibly to be used in an autologous setting, to derive both osteogenic and vasculogenic cells, we will now focus on two possible approaches to generate functional bone substitutes from freshly harvested fat tissue specimens. Three-dimensional streamlined expansion under perfusion It is becoming increasingly clear that culture on 2D plastic substrates is not physiological for progenitor cells, typically residing in vivo within specialized "niches," and result in inefficient performance. We previously reported that bone formation capacity in vivo by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells was markedly more efficient and reproducible if cells were expanded directly within the pores of 3D ceramic scaffolds under perfusion flow, as opposed to a static environment on 2D plastic dishes (Braccini  et al., 2005). The same streamlined approach can be employed to generate vasculogenic/osteogenic grafts from adiposederived cells (Fig. 1), by seeding stromal vascular fraction cells directly in hydroxyapatite porous disks and culturing them in a perfusion bioreactor for 5 days. platelet lysate-based medium supported bone formation by stromal vascular fraction cells after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice but not the formation of blood vessels of donor origin, and platelet lysate thus appears not to be suitable for the generation of osteogenic/vasculogenic constructs (Mu ̈ ller et al., 2009). In this perspective, tissue harvest, cell isolation, cell seeding onto a scaffold and subsequent implantation could occur within a few hours, with no ex vivo cell culture. This approach was initially proposed for bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Aslan et al., 2006; Evans et al., 2007), but the availability of cells in sufficient amounts to generate clinical-size constructs (in the range of several cm3) could be a severely limiting factor. In fact, clonogenic osteoprogenitor cells (colony forming unitfibroblasts, CFU-f) are present in human fresh bone marrow biopsies at a frequency of only about 0.01% of the total mononucleated cells, further decreasing with donor age (Muschler et al., 2001). Since CFU-f frequency in stromal vascular fraction from human lipoaspirates is about 5% of the total cell population, stromal vascular fraction cells could represent a suitable cell source for such a one-step  TABLE 2.

We have recently found that constructs, generated within 3 h from the harvest of stromal vascular fraction cells and immediately implanted ectopically in nude mice, after 8 weeks were vascularized by blood vessels formed by human cells and functionally connected to the recipient's vasculature (Mu ̈ ller et al., 2010). This study offered a proof-of-principle that intra-operative engineering of autologous human cell-based, intrinsically osteogenic and vasculogenic substitutes, is a promising approach. However, even with the highest cell densities tested, no frank bone tissue was detected, independently of the material used. This highlighted that — in the absence of in vitro osteoblastic commitment or of an orthotopic site of implantation — additional cues such as low dose of osteogenic factors are likely needed to support complete osteoblastic cell differentiation and bone tissue generation. This could be addressed by using the same perfusion bioreactor-based system with critically sized scaffolds, in the range of several cm3, and study engraftment of these constructs at different time-points in vivo in the presence or absence of vasculogenic cells. Nevertheless, since the biology of ASC greatly differs between species, large size, orthotopic animal models may be equally poorly predictive of the clinical effectiveness of these approaches, and ultimate tests and validation should be performed with human cells. Toward this goal, clinically compliant components and processes (i.e., scaffold materials, reagents, and cell separation systems) will have to be developed and used. Finally, another critical issue involves the high donor-related variability in cell phenotype and regenerative potential.

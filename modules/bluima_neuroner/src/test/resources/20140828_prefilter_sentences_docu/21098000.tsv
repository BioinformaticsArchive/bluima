One of these, Nogo-A, is associated with myelin and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and acts as a powerful inhibitor of axon growth (Chen et al. 2000; GrandPre et al. 2000; Prinjha et al. 2000). In particular, the Nogo-A–specific region and a 66-aa extracellular loop within the reticulon homology domain (known as Nogo-66) have been demonstrated to be responsible for the inhibitory effect of Nogo-A on neurite outgrowth (GrandPre et al. 2000; Fournier et al. 2001; Oertle, van der Haar, et al. 2003; Hu and Strittmatter 2008). Recently, however, we reported that the Nogo-66 domain of zebrafish RTN4a blocks growth cone elongation neither in fish nor in mammalian neurons (Abdesselem et al. 2009) and that it is unable to activate the cellular signals required to inhibit axon growth in mammals (Hsieh et al. 2006). Apart from Nogo and other myelin-associated molecules, strong inhibitors of axonal regeneration are also present in the mammalian glial scar. In addition, we present novel evidence suggesting that the Nogo-A–specific region was derived from an evolutionarily unrelated CSPG, an inhibitory molecule from the glial scar. Interestingly, peptides containing similar motifs are sufficient to bind b1-integrin and mediate cell adhesion in vitro (Kim et al. 2000). Produced by astrocytes in the mammalian glial scar, neurocan is a well-known inhibitor of axon regeneration (Fawcett and Asher 1999) as well as of b1-integrin–dependent cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth (Li et al. 2000). Similarly, recent data from the Strittmatter laboratory indicates that the Nogo-A–specific region can inhibit cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth by blocking various integrin complexes (including b1-integrin) and focal adhesion kinase activation (Hu and Strittmatter 2008). These data suggest that distinct inhibitory molecules  of myelin and the glial scar may act via similar receptor complexes that influence integrin-mediated growth. Growth of regenerating goldfish axons is inhibited by rat oligodendrocytes and central nervous system myelin but not but not by goldfish optic nerve tract oligodendrocytelike cells and fish central nervous system myelin.

Myelin-associated inhibitors regulate cofilin phosphorylation and neuronal inhibition through LIM kinase and Slingshot phosphatase. The N-terminal domain of Nogo-A inhibits cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth by an integrinspecific mechanism.

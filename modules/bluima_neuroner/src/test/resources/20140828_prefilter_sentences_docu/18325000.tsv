18325000	Meduri et al. (1996) showed that at 48 h after follicle rupture, there is a marked decrease in the density of luteinizing hormone receptors in luteal cells, and that 6 days after ovulation the receptor density seems to increase again. Bovine (Einspanier et al. 1990) and porcine (Ptak et al. 2003) luteal cells, for example, produce more progesterone when stimulated with Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 in vitro. Further, in vitro studies have shown not only a positive effect of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 on progesterone secretion by luteal cells (Ptak et al. 2003), but also an anti-apoptotic effect on luteal cells (Ptak et al. 2004), indicating a role of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 on both the formation and secretory function of luteal cells. Furthermore, bovine luteal cells have an increased concentration of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 receptors during the early luteal phase (Schams et al. 1999).

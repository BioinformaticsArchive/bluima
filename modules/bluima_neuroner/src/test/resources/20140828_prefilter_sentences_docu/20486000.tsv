20486000	Renewable resources including sugars, starch and lignocellulose are abundant substrates for fermentative production. The desirable characteristics of industrial microorganisms are their ability to ferment cheap raw materials rapidly and completely, requiring a minimal amount of nitrogenous substances, providing high yields of preferred stereo-specific lactic acid under conditions of low pH and high temperature production of low amounts of cell mass and negligible amounts of other by-products (Narayanan et al. 2004).

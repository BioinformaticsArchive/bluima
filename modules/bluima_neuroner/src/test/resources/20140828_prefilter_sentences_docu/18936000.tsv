18936000	Case Report: A 34-year-old female virgin patient with a primary vaginal Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas stage IEA, diffuse large cell B lineage, showed an excellent response to cytotoxic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) without surgery or radiotherapy. Conclusion: In young patients who wish to preserve their fertility, chemotherapy alone may be the treatment of choice for primary diffuse large B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the lower female genital tract. [Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol 2008; 47(3):334–337]  Key Words: chemotherapy, diffuse large B-cell, vaginal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma  Introduction  Lymphomas account for 3.5% of all malignant neoplasms in females. On admission, the following laboratory parameters were noted: white blood cell count 8.0 × 103/L (normal range, 4.5–11.0 × 103/L), hemoglobin 15 g/dL (normal range, 13.5–18 g/dL), platelet count 240 × 103/L (normal range, 150–400 × 103/L), segmented leukocytes 0.65 (normal range, 0.4–0.70), lymphocytes 0.30 (normal range, 0.29–0.44), sedimentation rate 8 mm/hr. Histopathologic diagnosis identified the tumor as a diffuse large B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Based on the Ann Arbor system used for staging Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the patient was diagnosed with IEA primary vaginal large B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas disease. Ten cases of primary vaginal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were reported in the literature between 1994 and 2007 (Table). The most common histologic subtype is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

In our case, we performed laparotomy with the suspected diagnosis of cervical myoma, but morphologic and phenotypic features supported a diagnosis of a diffuse low-grade malignant Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, consistent with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Garavaglia and colleagues reported on a patient with stage IEA Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the vagina who underwent complete remission with methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin alone [11]. However, if pelvic lymphomas are diagnosed at earlier stages, the prognosis can be excellent compared with other gynecologic malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate ranging from 80–90% [13,14]. For young patients with primary large B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the lower female genital tract who wish to retain their fertility, chemotherapy alone may be the treatment of choice. 7.

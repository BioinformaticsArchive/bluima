18719000	Mucus thickness was measured in vivo with micropipettes in anesthetized mice [isoflurane; C57BL/6, Muc1 / , inducible nitric oxide synthase (inducible NO synthases) / , and neuronal NO synthases (neuronal NOS) / ] and rats (inactin) after surgical exposure of the gastric mucosa. A new gastroprotective role for inducible NO synthases was indicated since inducible NO synthases-deficient mice had thinner firmly adherent mucus layers and a lower mucus accumulation rate, whereas neuronal NOS did not appear to be involved in mucus secretion. Mucus is secreted by epithelial cells, and its main constituents are large glycoproteins, mucins, and water. In the stomach, two cell types secreting different mucins have been identified, surface mucus cells that secrete MUC5AC and mucus neck cells that secrete MUC6 (10). mucins consist of a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain and are suggested to be involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion phenomena (31). The mucus barrier is a highly hydrated extracellular compartment with physical properties that limit the use of conventional in vitro and histological methods. Breeding pairs of heterozygous neuronal NO synthases (neuronal NOS)-deficient mice were kept under standardized conditions as mentioned above. The mice (background C57BL/6 129Sv) were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (16). The genotype of each neuronal NOS mouse was determined by PCR analysis of DNA isolated from tail tissue. Mice deficient in the inducible NO synthases gene (background C57BL/6 129SvEv) were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells as previously described (21). For wild-type controls, male C57BL/6 129Sv were used (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) and pooled with the littermates (neuronal NOS / ) from the neuronal NOS breeding. The luminal surface of the mucus gel was visualized by placing graphite particles (activated charcoal, extra pure; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) on the gel, and the gastric epithelial cell surface was visible through the microscope. The distances travelled by the micropipette from the luminal surface of the mucus gel to the epithelial cell surface were measured, and a mean value was calculated. The mucus thickness, which is the vertical distance between the cell surface and the luminal mucus surface, was then calculated. The involvement of the neuronal and inducible isoforms of nitric oxide synthesizing enzymes (neuronal NOS and inducible NO synthases) in mucus accumulation of the different mucus layers was studied in genetically modified animals. The graph presents the firmly adherent mucus thickness measured directly after the second mucus removal in C57BL/6 mice (n 6), Muc1 / mice (C57BL/6 background, n 5), mice after 30 min in mice of topical application of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (C57BL/6, n 5), C57BL/6 129Sv mice (n 11), inducible nitric oxide synthase (inducible NO synthases) / mice (C57BL/6 129Sv background, n 10), and neuronal NO synthases (neuronal NOS) / mice (C57BL/6 129Sv background, n 5). inducible NO synthases-derived, not neuronal NOS-derived, nitric oxide increases mucus accumulation. In mice with inactivated gene for neuronal NOS, total mucus accumulation did not differ compared with wild-type controls (C57BL/6 129Sv, Fig. To study the influence of NO synthases-derived nitric oxide on mucus secretion, neuronal NOS- and inducible NO synthases-deficient mice were used. neuronal NOS is found in the gastric surface mucus cells and has previously been suggested to be involved in mucus secretion (8, 9, 30). However, when mucus thickness and accumulation was measured in the neuronal NOS-deficient mice (Fig. 2), no difference was detected compared with the wild-type controls. Constitutively expressed inducible NO synthases is present in the surface epithelial cells in the mouse corpus (29). 27 and 29) because this unspecific inhibitor of NO synthases is reported to be more potent in inhibiting eNOS and neuronal NOS than inducible NO synthases (24). However, apart from water, the mucus gel consists mainly of secreted mucins (1), and there are two types of gel-forming mucins in the stomach, which are secreted by cell types located in different regions in the gastric mucosa. MUC5AC is expressed in the surface mucus cells and MUC6 by the mucus neck cells in the gastric glands (26, 34). In addition to the gel-forming mucins, Muc1, a transmembrane mucin that cannot form a mucus gel, is found at the apical membrane of epithelial cells (31). In addition to being part of the mucus gel after its secretion, it is also possible that transmembrane mucins can act as sensors and transmit outside-in signaling from the exterior to the interior of epithelial cells, providing a second line of defense.

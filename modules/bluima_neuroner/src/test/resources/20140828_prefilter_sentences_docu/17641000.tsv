17641000	Development of a Long-Acting Erythropoietin by Fusing the Carboxyl-Terminal Peptide of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin -Subunit to the Coding Sequence of Human Erythropoietin  Fuad Fares, Sherif Ganem, Taleb Hajouj, and Ester Agai  Faculty of Science (F.F.), University of Haifa, Haifa 31905, Israel; and ModigeneTech (F.F., S.G., T.H., E.A.), Weizmann Science Park, Nes-Ziona 74140, Israel  Human ERYTHROPOIETIN is a glycoprotein hormone secreted from the kidney and controls red blood cell production. (Endocrinology 148: 5081–5087, 2007)  ERYTHROPOIETIN is a glycoprotein hormone produced primarily by cells of the peritubular capillary endothelium of the kidney (1, 2). The recombinant human ERYTHROPOIETIN has been used successfully in a variety of clinical situations to increase production of red blood cells (10 –14).

DNA transfection and clone selection  Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with expression pGT vectors containing ERYTHROPOIETIN-WT or ERYTHROPOIETIN-carboxyl-terminal peptide using the calcium phosphate method as described before (26). Cell culture  Chinese hamster ovary cells cells were maintained in medium I (Ham's F-12 medium) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37 C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For hormone collection, cells secreting ERYTHROPOIETIN-WT or EPOCTP were plated and grown to confluency in T-75 flasks. Proteins were transferred to a 0.2 m pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 250 mA for 3 h using a minitrans-blot electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) according to the method described in the manual accompanying the unit. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the nitrocellulose paper was reacted with enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 5 min, dried with Whatman sheet, and exposed to x-ray film. Receptor binding  The erythroleukemia cells (TF-1) were obtained through the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used for the radioreceptor assay. On d 3 the cells were gently washed twice with cold assay medium (Waymouth MB752/1, 1 mg/ml BSA, 40 g/ml gentamicin) and incubated for 16 h at 4 C with 1 million cpm [125I]ERYTHROPOIETIN with or without different concentrations of ERYTHROPOIETIN-WT or ERYTHROPOIETIN-carboxyl-terminal peptide in a final volume of 1 ml assay medium. The next day the cells were washed twice with 2 ml cold assay medium and solubilized with 0.5 ml buffer [50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.6% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate] and transferred to plastic tubes for -counting. BFU-E colonies were grown from blood of healthy donors using a microwell modification of the methylcellulose technique (29). Low-density mononuclear cells (4 105/ml) were suspended in DMEM containing 0.8% methylcellulose (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI), 10% fetal calf serum, 0.01% 5-thioglycerol, penicillin, and streptomycin. Colonies with at least three clusters of 50 cells were defined as BFU-E (30). Results  Secretion of ERYTHROPOIETIN from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells cells was assessed by Western blot analysis under denaturing conditions using human ERYTHROPOIETIN-specific antiserum. BFU-E colonies were grown from blood of healthy donors using a microwell modification of the methylcellulose technique as described in Materials and Methods. Expression of ERYTHROPOIETIN-WT and ERYTHROPOIETIN-carboxyl-terminal peptide from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells cells. Conditioned media from transfected cells were prepared for SDS-PAGE and proteins were detected by Western blot as described in Materials and Methods. The affinities of human ERYTHROPOIETIN variants to the receptor were determined by radioreceptor assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells cells expressing human ERYTHROPOIETIN receptor. Purified cells from human peripheral blood were incubated for 20 d with or without ERYTHROPOIETIN analogs. ERYTHROPOIETIN-WT and EPOCTP were produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells cells. Binding activity was measured by displacement of 125I-hEPO binding from TF-1 cells. The amount of 125I-hEPO bound to the cells was determined and is reported as percentage of control bound.

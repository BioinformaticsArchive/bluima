Under normal conditions, a dynamic equilibrium exists between the production of Reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant capacity of the cell [11]. Oxidative stress occurs when Reactive oxygen species levels exceed the antioxidant capacity of a cell [12]. To control the effect of Reactive oxygen species, aerobic cells have antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase activities) and Catalase, as well as nonenzymatic antioxidants such as non-protein thiols, vitamin C and vitamin E to defend against oxidative stress. Discussion and conclusion  Progressive inherent or acquired changes in cellular metabolism occurring over the years may play a very important role in the development of prostate cancer [8]. Thus, excessive production of Reactive oxygen species or inadequacy in a normal cell's antioxidant defense system (or both) can cause the cell to experience oxidative stress and increased Reactive oxygen species may play a role in cellular processes associated with the initiation and development of many cancers including prostate cancer [25]. Evidence supports an integrated model of inherited and acquired deficiencies in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in the genesis of prostate cancer [31]. Studies suggest that the overexpression of superoxide dismutase activities without a compensatory increase in Catalase has deleterious effects upon the cell [32]. These findings are in agreement with another study that showed increased antioxidant defenses in the beginning of tumor development and also showed rapid GSH synthesis in tumor cells [36].

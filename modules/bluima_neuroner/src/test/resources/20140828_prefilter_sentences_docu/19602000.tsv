19602000	Terziogluâ€   Summary Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 is a cellsurface molecule providing a negative signal for T cell activation. It plays two roles in immune regulation: (i) the transduction of negative control to activated T cells, (ii) the activation of suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Bluestone, 1997). The G allele at position 49 of the Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 gene has been found to be associated with the impaired control of T cell proliferation and it has been proposed that the G allele might contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (Kristiansen et al., 2000; Ueda et al., 2003). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral mononuclear cells from each subject with a DNA extraction kit (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA). Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 is cell-surface molecule on T lymphocyte and interacts with the B7 cell-surface molecule on the antigen-presenting cells. If the negative signal caused by the Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4-B7 interaction dominates, T cell activation is suppressed, which is important in immune modulation (Salomon & Bluestone, 2001).

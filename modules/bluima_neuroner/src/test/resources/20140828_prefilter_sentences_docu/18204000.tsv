18204000	In mammals and birds, cutaneous water loss is mediated primarily by the outer layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, formed by multiple layers of cornified cells embedded in a matrix of lipids (Menon and Menon, 2000; Lillywhite, 2006); these lipids determine the rate of water permeation through the skin (Potts and Francoeur, 1991; Madison, 2003). In mammals, lipids in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum are primarily a mixture of cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides – sphingolipids that consist of a sphingosine molecule attached to a fatty acid by an ester bond (Gray and Yardley, 1975; Bouwstra et al., 2003; Lillywhite, 2006). In birds, these same lipid classes are also found in the stratum corneum, but cerebrosides, formed by a ceramide covalently linked to a hexose, also constitute a large fraction of the intercellular lipid mixture (Muñoz-Garcia and Williams, 2005). In mammalian epidermis, cerebrosides are initially extruded into the extracellular spaces, but are thereafter enzymatically converted to ceramides and therefore they do not occur in the stratum corneum. This creates a highly ordered lattice of lipids in the crystalline phase, much like the membrane of a cell, which does not allow movement of water through the lamellae. Hypothesized model for the organization of lipids in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum in house sparrows from mesic and desert environments. Hypothesized model for the organization of lipids in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum in house sparrows from mesic and desert environments. With this information, we propose a plausible model for the organization of the lipids in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum in house sparrows (Fig.·8). In mesic species of larks and mesic populations of house sparrows, increases in free fatty acid content may alter the free fatty acid to ceramide ratio, and affect the formation of the lamellae in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum (Haugen et al., 2003a; Muñoz-Garcia and Williams, 2005).

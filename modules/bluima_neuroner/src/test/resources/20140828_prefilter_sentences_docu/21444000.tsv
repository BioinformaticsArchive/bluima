Interestingly, the released adenosine produced an increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP, an effect that was antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline [8], a fact that was also observed in the heart [9]. Afterwards, it was demonstrated that the so described antilipolytic effect of adenosine on fat cells occurred with a concomitant reduction in cAMP [10]. Hence, it was assumed that adenosine exerted its actions through G protein-coupled adenosine receptors, which in turn were expressed in a large variety of cells and tissues. Extracellular adenosine in the brain is related to the intracellular concentration of adenosine and nucleotides, such as ATP, AMP and cAMP [13]. In some brain areas, like the hippocampus, most of the extracellular adenosine seems to depend mostly on intracellular adenosine, the concentration of which is related to the rate of breakdown and synthesis of ATP [13]. Thus, adenosine is released as a neuromodulator [14] by the effector cells in response to an increased metabolic demand [15]. However, in the striatum, it has been suggested that the main source of extracellular  0005-2736/$ – see front matter © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. doi:10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.03.007  adenosine is the intracellular cAMP [16]. Since cAMP can only be generated by the action of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, striatal extracellular adenosine would mostly reflect an increased activation of receptors positively linked to adenylyl cyclase. Thus, adenosine-mediated conformational change in the adenosine receptors core domain affects the conformation of the intracellular loops, which in turns determines the binding and activation of specific G proteins responsible for the activation of different intracellular signaling pathways associated to adenosine function. Finally, I wish to express my best thanks to all authors and coauthors of the issue for their commitment and to the anonymous reviewers for their excellent contributions.

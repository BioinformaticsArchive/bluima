20149000	However, large-scale utilization of these strains was mainly hampered by their sensitivity to high ethanol concentrations and metabolic inhibitors resulting from lignocellulosic materials hydrolysis (Ingram et al. 1998). ArcAB (aerobic respiration control) and CreBC (carbon source responsive) are two-component signal transduction systems of E. coli (Avison et al. 2001; Pettinari et al. 2008) responsible for modulation of the intracellular redox state and carbon source utilization, respectively. Escherichia coli strain CT1061, an arcA and creC(Con) mutant (Nikel et al. 2008b), has enhanced carbon source consumption as well as a reducing intracellular environment (characterized by a high NADH / NAD+ ratio), making it adequate as a candidate host for reduced biochemicals synthesis. All cultures were inoculated at 0·1 g l)1 initial cell dry weight with an overnight culture grown in the same medium and oxygen availability condition to be used in the experiment. At 12 h, air input was suppressed and the agitation speed was set at 75 rev min)1 to avoid cell sedimentation. Cells were washed and permeabilized for enzyme determination as detailed by Mackenzie et al. (1989), and 10–30 ll of the crude cell extract was added to a reaction mixture containing 333 mmol l)1 ethanol and 8·3 mmol l)1 NAD+ in 50 mmol l)1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 6·5) in a final volume of 1 ml. Analytical determinations Biomass (expressed as cell dry weight) was determined gravimetrically from the pellet fraction of appropriate culture aliquots, after two rounds of centrifugation (8000 g, 10 min) and washing of the cells with 150 mmol l)1 NaCl (Nikel et al. 2006). Percentage of plasmid-bearing cells was determined by their ability to form colonies in ampicillin-supplemented plates (Weber and San 1989). After 18 h of incubation at 37 C, the quantity of Ampr- and Amps-colonies formed on the plates was compared and used to estimate the percentage of plasmid-containing cells in the culture. Calculations and statistical analysis Fermentation parameters for cell growth, glycerol consumption and metabolite synthesis were used to calculate yields on substrate (g of biomass or product per g of consumed glycerol) and volumetric productivities (g l)1 h)1). An empirical biomass composition of CH1·9O0·5N0·25 was assumed for E. coli cells (Neidhardt et al. 1990).

Results represent the mean values for triplicate measurements of growth (expressed as cell dry weight, cell dry weight) and metabolic profile of two independent cultures. cell dry weight concentrations followed a similar pattern, being 1·3- and 1·6-fold higher than in control experiments (P < 0·05). As the phoshotransacetylase-acetate kinase pathway is highly reversible, elevated extracellular levels of acetate in pyruvate- and acetaldehyde-supplemented fermentations may result in an increase in intracellular acetyl-coenzyme A availability, allowing further growth and increasing ethanol production. However, addition of high levels of complex nutrients adds to the cost of ethanol production and waste treatment requirements (Lawford and Rousseau  )  10  8  6  4  Ethanol (g l–1 Residual glycerol (g l–1) cell dry weight (g l–1)  2  0  MYA SGA  -pantothenate T ryptone Vitamin Corn steep Calcium solution liquor D  In SGA medium  Figure 3 Effect of medium composition on growth (expressed as cell dry weight, cell dry weight), ethanol synthesis and glycerol consumption by Escherichia coli CT1061LER [ethanol-tolerant derivative of CT1061LE, DarcA creC(Con) DldhA, carrying acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides] in 72-h micro-oxic shaken-flask experiments. Addition of 7·5 g l)1 tryptone had a significant effect on cell growth (P < 0·05), but ethanol synthesis and glycerol consumption were not modified when compared to those in SGA medium. During the oxic phase, cells grew exponentially with a specific growth rate of 0·42 ± 0·04 h)1, reaching a cell dry weight concentration of 4·5 ± 0·2 g l)1 at 12 h (Fig. 4). Given the high cell dry weight concentration (>5 g l)1), at this point it was difficult to maintain highly oxic conditions, even with air supply and full agitation. cell dry weight concentration did not significantly increase under oxygen-restricted conditions, which suggests a metabolic switch to fermentative conditions.

Plasmid stability was estimated by plating adequately diluted culture samples onto MYA plates with or without ampicillin and was expressed as the percentage of plasmid-bearing cells (s). Plasmid stability in these cultures was tested by determining the percentage of ampicillin-resistant cells during the entire cultivation. During the oxic stage the percentage of plasmid-bearing cells steadily decreased reaching 92·1 ± 0·2% at 12 h, but under conditions of restricted oxygen supply pETLm was stably maintained. After the 48-h fermentation, 98·3 ± 0·9% of the cells maintained the plasmid. Addition of pyruvate to media has been shown to increase the intracellular pyruvate pool in E. coli (Yang et al. 2001), which in turn increases the ratio of potential electron acceptors for oxidation of NADH from glycolysis. Acetyl-coenzyme A, pyruvate and upstream metabolites in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway are used for the biosynthesis of approx. one-half of all cellular constituents (Neidhardt et al. 1990). oeni is completely  inhibited during coenzyme A-SH and / or d-pantothenate limitation, well before general growth and cell synthesis are inhibited.

18096000	A skin biopsy was performed, showing an atrophying interface dermatitis with pandermal mucinosis and striking vasculopathic changes including endothelial cell necrosis with denudement and basement membrane zone reduplication. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of endothelial cell injury. One potential hypothesis is based on the fact that terbinafine, the active agent in terbinafine, triggers apoptosis of human endothelial cells in culture. Enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis results in the displacement of various cellular antigens creating a state of neoantigenicity; its attendant sequelae is held to be one of anti-endothelial cell antibody formation, a defining pathogenetic event in the evolution of dermatomyositis. The basis of the cutaneous, muscle and lung findings may be one of autoimmune microvascular injury syndrome with C5b-9 functioning as the effector  mechanism of endothelial cell injury.4,5,6 Western blot  Confluent monolayers of human lung microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells and embryonic lung fibroblasts were lysed with a buffer consisting of 0.05 M sodium fluoride, 1% Triton ×100, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.05 mg/ml of aprotinin, pepstatin A and leupeptin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 4 C. lial cell denudement (Fig. 3). Ultrastructural studies showed endothelial cell necrosis with detachment along with lamellation of the basement membrane zone, the latter compatible with prior episodes of microvascular injury (Fig. 5).

The ultrastructural findings provided further corroboration of chronic persistent immune-based endothelial cell injury as defined by prominent lamellation along with endothelial cell necrosis. Finally, the Western blot studies showed reactivity of the patient's serum with endothelial cell lysates compatible with the presence of circulating antiendothelial cell antibodies. It has been hypothesized that the basis of the microvascular changes in the setting of dermatomyositis is one attributable to antiendothelial cell antibodies with the effector mechanism of vascular injury being C5b-9.4–6,28 The concept of antibodies with endothelial cell specificity was first introduced in the context of autoimmune disease including scleroderma, lupus erythematosus and Henoch-Scho ̈ nlein purpura.28–33 It has always been questioned whether or not antiendothelial cell antibodies are of any pathogenetic significance. Immunoglobulin derived from patients in whom anti-endothelial cell antibodies were identified, were capable of causing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.34 Upregulation of E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on cultured human endothelial cells in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus have been shown in various studies.35,36 Regarding the potential antigenic target, our patient's serum showed striking reactivity to a protein weighing 45,000, an antigenic target that has been previously implicated in other settings associated with anti-endothelial cell antibodies. Because of endothelial cell damage, new antigens such as vimentin can be released and create a state of further neoantigenicity, defining the phenomenon of epitope spreading.37,38 There are several studies, which now establish a link between the presence of anti-endothelial cell  antibodies in sera and the severity of disease activity in various autoimmune states. We recently established a direct link between the degree of anti-endothelial cell antibody activity and the extent of pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension in patients with scleroderma.33 Terbinafine has been shown to promote apoptosis of human cancer cells in culture and in vivo because of inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of the apoptotic cascade.40 Docetaxel targets actively replicating cells by disrupting microtubule assembly and disassembly (tubulin polymerization), bcl-2 phosphorylation inactivation and caspase-3 (CPP32) cleavage. The cycling cells are arrested in the G2/M phase and subsequently die by apoptosis. It has been hypothesized that docetaxel induces sub-acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus through its proapoptotic effects on replicating cells. It has been hypothesized that over-expression of these proteins may contribute to endothelial cell injury and or result in complement activation independent of an antibody trigger. Terbinafine has an established effect on T-cell immune responses. Other studies have shown that terbinafine alters the cellular immune response to fungal infection specifically in regard to the upregulation of interferon production,  Table 1.

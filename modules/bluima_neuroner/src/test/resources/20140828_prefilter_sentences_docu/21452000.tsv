However, the role of Oxidative stress in the progression of Hepatocellular carcinoma is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether Oxidative stress promotes angiogenesis in Hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2, and phosphorylated Akt were assessed, and microvessel density and the cancer-associated fibroblast population were examined by immunohistological staining in 55 Hepatocellular carcinoma samples. The expression and activation of angiogenic factors and the effect of growth stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were also assessed in vitro, using hepatoma cell line hepatoma-derived cells and conditioned medium with or without treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin; and an anti-oxidative agent, N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Oxidative stress grade of Cancer-associated fibroblasts, but not with the percentage of the CAFpopulation in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Additionally, cancer cells constituted a major population of Oxidative stress marker-positive cells in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. In vitro, H2O2 treatment induced up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor at both the mRNA and protein levels, activated Akt, and resulted in the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells; the addition of wortmannin and N-acetyl-L-cysteine counteracted the effects of Oxidative stress. Conclusions Oxidative stress enhances the malignant potential of Hepatocellular carcinoma through the stimulation of angiogenesis by activation of the Akt-vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. Keywords Hepatocellular carcinoma  Angiogenesis Oxidative stress  Vascular endothelial growth factor  Akt  Introduction  Hepatocellular carcinoma arises frequently in patients with chronic liver injury, such as chronic viral hepatitis, chronic alcoholic injury, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [1–4]. Hepatocellular carcinoma is generally hypervascular, which suggests that angiogenesis plays an important role in Hepatocellular carcinoma growth [6, 7]. Thus, a treatment approach based on the inhibition of angiogenesis may provide efficacious antitumor therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma. Oxidative stress signals act as second messengers in several intracellular signaling cascades [8]. Oxidative stress brings about anti-proliferative effects such as cell-cycle arrest,  senescence, and cell death in normal cells [9]. A continuous state of Oxidative stress in liver tissues also induces repetitive cell death, and the regeneration of hepatocytes, and therefore Oxidative stress may result in the appearance of clones with a predominant oncogenic phenotype such as a high cellular proliferation rate, genomic instability, cellular motility, and high angiogenesis activity [8, 10, 11]. Previously, we reported that Oxidative stress contributed to the progression of the clinical state of chronic liver diseases through the induction of telomere shortening in hepatocytes and enhancing the malignant features of Hepatocellular carcinoma, such as high proliferative activity and apoptotic resistance by telomerase activation in cancer cells [12–14]. Human cancer cells undergo Oxidative stress at a far greater rate than non-cancerous cells [15]; therefore, Oxidative stress, as well as telomerase activation, may play an important role in some intracellular signaling cascades. Hypoxia also produces a large amount of Oxidative stress by damaging the cellular mitochondria [18]. To study these mechanisms, we investigated whether Oxidative stress affected tumor angiogenesis through the Akt-vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, both in human Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and in a hepatoma cell line. Patients, materials, and methods  Patients  Liver tissue samples, including non-cancerous tissues, were obtained from 55 patients who underwent surgical resection for Hepatocellular carcinoma at Kyoto Prefectural University Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for using Hepatocellular carcinoma specimens for this study according to the guidelines approved by the hospital's ethics committee (the approval ID number is C-85).

Assessment of angiogenic factors using immunohistological staining  The staining intensities of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 were classified into three grades as follows: Grade 3, most of the cancer cells were vascular endothelial growth factor-positive and strongly stained, or more than 40 cancer cells per 9100 magnification field were vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2-positive; Grade 2, most of the cancer cells were vascular endothelial growth factor-positive but faintly stained, or fewer than 40 cancer cells per 9100 magnification field were vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2-positive; and Grade 1, most of the cancer cells were vascular endothelial growth factor-negative or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2-negative and were only stained by hematoxylin. Assessment of microvessel density  Tumor vessels were identified by immunostaining of CD31 antigen, a marker of endothelial cells, as described above. Any brown-stained endothelial cell that was clearly separate from the adjacent microvessels was considered a single, countable blood vessel [20]. 8-OHdG and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunostaining  The quantity of 8-OHdG, a reliable marker of oxidative DNA damage [21, 22], was determined immunohistochemically in  Hepatocellular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissues following the method of Kato et al. [23]. Immunoreactive cancer cells or normal hepatic cells (1000–2000) were counted and the percentage of 8-OHdG-positive cells was calculated. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, a marker of lipid peroxides, was also immunohistochemically investigated in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues as another oxidative stress marker [24]. The Oxidative stress grade in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues was categorized according to the percentage of 8-OHdG-positive cells: Grade 3, [90%; Grade 2, 50–90%; and Grade 1, \50%. 8-OHdG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  The quantity of 8-OHdG in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was also determined in 30 cancerous specimens that were preserved by deep freezing and were available, using an 8-OHdG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Nikken Seil). Firstly, DNA was isolated from Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and purified by the sodium iodide extraction technique, using the DNA Extractor TIS Kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and an 8-OHdG Assay Preparation Reagent Set (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of 8-OHdG and the percentage of 8-OHdGpositive cells were analyzed statistically. To investigate the characteristics of stromal cells, we performed double-staining of vimentin, a marker of cancer-associated fibroblast, with either 8-OHdG, vascular endothelial growth factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2. After an area composed of mostly cancer cells and Cancer-associated fibroblasts was identified at low magnification (940), the total number of cells was counted and the percentages of Cancer-associated fibroblasts and double-positive stained cells were calculated in a 9200 magnification field. Cell lines and cell culture  A human Hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, hepatoma cell line, was purchased from the Health Science Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin. A human umbilical vein endothelial cell preparation was purchased from Lonza Walkersville(Walkersville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured in the recommended medium, EGMTM-2 BulletKit (Lonza Walkersville) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were cultured in a 37 C humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis  hepatoma cell line cells were pre-cultured for 24 h; thereafter, the medium was changed to fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were  treated with H2O2 (25, 50, and 100 lM) or vehicle for 5 h, or with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (50 nM), for 30 min before the treatment with 100 lM H2O2 for 5 h. Total RNA was extracted from the treated hepatoma cell line cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Japan, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primer sequences were as follows: vascular endothelial growth factor forward: 5′-AATGGGCACGTGGATCCTG-3′; vascular endothelial growth factor reverse: 5′-TGTCCTCACACCATTGAAACC AC-3′; b-actin forward: 5′-TGGCACCCAGCACAATGAA-3′; b-actin reverse: 5′-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAA GCA-3′  Western blot analysis  hepatoma cell line cells were pre-treated as described above and lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fifty-microgram aliquots of this cytoplasmic protein preparation were electrophoresed on a 4–12% bis–Tris polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Cell growth assay  The growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was evaluated using a WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] colorimetric assay. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (5 9 103 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates in 100 ll of EGMTM-2 BulletKit (Lonza Walkersville) medium for 24 h, then the medium in each well was exchanged with the supernatant of hepatoma cell line treated with various concentrations of H2O2 (0, 25, 50, 100 lM) and pretreated with wortmannin or an anti-oxidative agent, N-acetyl-L-cysteine in fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The correlations of Oxidative stress grade, and other immunostaining grades in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with the various clinicopathological and biochemical factors were assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis H-test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Pearson's correlation coefficient test, the Mann–Whitney U-test, and Student's t-test. Results  Immunohistochemical analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of Oxidative stress markers  Representative microphotographs of 8-OHdG and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunohistochemical staining in Hepatocellular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissues of various Oxidative stress grades are shown in Fig. 8-OHdG was mainly found in the nuclei of cancer cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes, whereas 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and hepatocytes in a granular pattern. The percentage of 8-OHdG-positive cells was statistically significantly correlated with the staining intensity of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (P \ 0.05, Pearson's correlation coefficient test, Fig. 1 Representative photographs of the immunostaining of oxida- (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with each Oxidative stress grade.

The Oxidative stress grades of the Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were: 24 of Grade 1, 21 of Grade 2, and 10 of Grade 3 (Table 2). The differentiation grade of Hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly related to the Oxidative stress grade in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Interestingly, the Oxidative stress grade of non-cancerous tissue was also significantly related to the Oxidative stress grade of Hepatocellular carcinoma tissue (P \ 0.05, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; Table 2). Oxidative stress induced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiogenesis in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues  Representative microphotographs of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 immunohistochemical staining in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with various grades are shown in Fig. The immunostaining signals of both vascular endothelial growth factor and VEGER2 in non-cancerous tissues were weaker than those in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (Fig. 2d). The vascular endothelial growth factor staining grades in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were 10 of Grade 1, 30 of Grade 2, and 15 of Grade 3 and for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 they were 11 of Grade 1, 20 of Grade 2, and 24 of Grade 3, as shown in Table 4. 2 Representative photographs of the immunostaining of angiogenesis-related proteins in human Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues.

The higher microvessel density values were significantly associated with higher vascular endothelial growth factor expression and with a higher Oxidative stress grade (*P \ 0.05 by the Kruskal–Wallis H-test)  Table 4 The relationship of angiogenesis-related proteins in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with microvessel density and p-Akt  vascular endothelial growth factor  Grade 1 (n = 10) Grade 2 (n = 30) Grade 3 (n = 15) P value  microvessel density 24 ± 12.8 34.7 ± 12.7 54 ± 14.5 0.000011* p-Akt(-)/(?) 9/1 21/9 7/8 0.022044*  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2  Grade 1 (n = 11) Grade 2 (n = 20) Grade 3 (n = 24) P value  microvessel density 30.2 ± 11.7 35.3 ± 11.8 43.8 ± 19.5 0.2497 p-Akt(-)/(?) 7/4 11/9 19/5 0.182281  Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal–Wallis H-test for microvessel density and Mann–Whitney U-test, for p-Akt immunostaining (*P \ 0.05) standard deviation standard deviation, vascular endothelial growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor, microvessel density microvessel density, p-Akt phosphorylated Akt, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2  higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (P \ 0.05, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Table 2). The number of microvessels in each Hepatocellular carcinoma sample was calculated using the Image J software, as shown in Fig. The MVDs in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were as shown in Tables 2 and 4. A higher microvessel density value was significantly associated with a higher Oxidative stress grade in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (P \ 0.01 by Kruskal–Wallis test, Fig. A higher microvessel density value was also significantly associated with higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (P \ 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis test, Fig. Oxidative stress in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was associated with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiogenesis  Representative microphotographs of the immunohistochemical double-staining of vimentin and either 8-OHdG, vascular endothelial growth factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 in Hepatocellular carcinoma samples are shown in Fig. The percentages of Cancer-associated fibroblasts that were either 8-OHdG- or VEGFpositive were significantly correlated with the Oxidative stress grade (Table 2), although there was no significant association between the cancer-associated fibroblast population and the Oxidative stress grade in Hepatocellular carcinoma samples (Table 2). The percentage of Cancer-associated fibroblasts that were either 8-OHdG- or vascular endothelial growth factor-positive was very low (less than 5%) in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (Table 2). Oxidative stress induced Akt activation in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues  Phosphorylated-Akt, a positive regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor [27], was detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of  cancer cells (Fig. 4a). Phosphorylated-Akt-positive status was significantly related to a higher Oxidative stress grade (P \ 0.05, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Table 2), and to higher grades of vascular endothelial growth factor staining in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (P \ 0.05, by the Mann–Whitney U-test, Table 4). Oxidative stress induced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor through Akt activation in vitro  Oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide, significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor at both the mRNA and protein levels in hepatoma cell line cells (Fig. 5a, b, d). Akt, a transcription factor of vascular endothelial growth factor, was activated in hepatoma cell line cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 5c, d). The proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was accelerated by the supernatant from hepatoma cell line cells treated with H2O2, and the rate of proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was correlated with the concentration of H2O2 added to hepatoma cell line cells. The proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was attenuated by additional treatment with wortmannin or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (P \ 0.05, by the Mann–Whitney U-test, Fig. Double-positive cells are not seen.

Angiogenesis is a major target of anticancer therapy in Hepatocellular carcinoma, and several antiangiogenic agents are being actively evaluated in clinical trials [29]. Clarification of the mechanism of tumor angiogenesis could assist in the inhibition of tumor progression in Hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there are few reports on the role of Oxidative stress in the process of angiogenesis in Hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, we showed that Oxidative stress was frequently present in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (56.4% of Hepatocellular carcinoma samples had an Oxidative stress grade of 2 or 3). On the other hand, the percentage of 8-OHdG-positive Cancer-associated fibroblasts was very low; therefore, the main origin of Oxidative stress in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues appears to be in cancer cells, not Cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis of Hepatocellular carcinoma samples showed that the Oxidative stress grade was related to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, Akt activation, and microvessel density. We also showed that Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and Akt activation, and indirectly enhanced the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, wortmannin treatment counteracted the angiogenic effect exerted by Oxidative stress in hepatoma cell line cells. p-Akt phosphorfactors in Oxidative stress-positive and Oxidative stress-negative Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. 5 Oxidative stress activates the angiogenic Akt-vascular endothelial growth factor pathway in hepatoma cell line cells.

The cellular growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was determined using a WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] colorimetric assay. The results are presented as the ratio of the cellular growth of treated cells relative to that of untreated control cells.

Hash symbols indicate a significant difference compared with cells treated with 100 lM H2O2 alone (P \ 0.05 by the Mann– Whitney U-test)  vascular endothelial growth factor-positive cancer cells in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with a high Oxidative stress grade. These data mean that Cancer-associated fibroblasts may be affected by the surrounding Hepatocellular carcinoma cells and that they are partially involved in the tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 7). Oxidative stress has two opposite effects in cancer cells. As many anticancer agents exert their antitumor effects through the production of reactive oxygen species in tumors, Oxidative stress can induce cellular senescence, genomic instability, and apoptosis in cancer cells [8]. These effects cause immediate cell death in most cancer cells. On the other hand, Oxidative stress can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells directly, which leads to cancer progression through the enhancement of malignant phenotypes, such as a high cellular proliferation rate, apoptotic resistance, and a tendency to develop the ability for invasion and migration [34]. Most cancer cells tend to acquire some abilities to escape from the apoptotic process [35, 36] and resist cellular senescence through the carcinogenesis process. Therefore, the main effect of Oxidative stress in cancer cells may be to induce aggressive phenotypes both directly and indirectly. The origins of Oxidative stress in cancer cells are generally considered to be related to hypoxia and hypermetabolism under conditions of active tumor growth. In addition, the  cancer-associated fibroblast Oxidative stress Oxidative stress  Oxidative stress  Akt  Hepatocellular carcinoma cell  vascular endothelial growth factor  vascular endothelial growth factor  Angiogenesis  vascular endothelial cell  Fig. 7 Schematic representation of the relationship of Oxidative stress and angiogenesis in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. Oxidative stress is mostly generated in cancer cells and affects mainly cancer cells to enhance angiogenesis. Cancerassociated fibroblasts (Cancer-associated fibroblasts) are partially involved in this pathway  activation of oncogenes, mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells, and the release of inflammatory cytokines from tumor-associated macrophages might contribute to the generation of Oxidative stress [8]. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, a major treatment for Hepatocellular carcinoma, could induce an ischemic condition in tumor tissues. Therefore, in the present study, we omitted Hepatocellular carcinoma cases in patients in whom Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization therapy had been performed preliminarily. There was a significant correlation between the expressions of these markers, although their cellular localizations were different, as one was in the nucleus and the other in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1a–c). Moreover, the 8-OHdG concentration measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was correlated with the staining intensity of 8-OHdG in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Thus, we used 8-OHdG as a more reliable marker of Oxidative stress levels in Hepatocellular carcinoma samples. The Oxidative stress grade in non-cancerous tissues was significantly related to the patient's age and the etiology of chronic liver disease (Table 3), which suggests that cellular senescence and hepatitis C virus infection may be associated with Oxidative stress generation in hepatocytes. Additionally, the Oxidative stress grade in Hepatocellular carcinoma tissue was significantly related to both the Oxidative stress grade in non-cancerous tissue and tumor differentiation (Table 2). These data suggest the possibility that the Oxidative stress grade in Hepatocellular carcinoma is influenced by factors produced by the surrounding liver tissue, such as cytokines, and by genetic changes associated with malignant potential in cancer cells. In clinical settings, Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization therapy, using an emulsion of chemotherapeutic drug and lipiodol, is often used in  patients with advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma. Vascular disrupting agents 12. lead to the acute mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to the tumor rim [37]. As hypoxia increases Oxidative stress [8, 41], which acts as a second messenger in intracellular signaling cascades 14. associated with angiogenesis [27, 30, 31], antioxidant therapy post-Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization might inhibit the progression and recurrence of HCCs. In conclusion, our findings show that Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues are frequently exposed to high levels of Oxidative stress, which may contribute to the progression of tumor angiogenesis through 16. the Akt-vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. First, that the Oxidative stress grade is a useful marker of malignant potential in Hepatocellular carcinoma, and second, 17. that treatment with antioxidant agents could be an effective way to improve the poor prognosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma.

Cannabinoid receptors and T helper cells. Multiple peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets contributed to the tolerance-associated transcriptional patterns, although natural killer and TCR T cells exerted the predominant influence. These data suggest that transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood can be employed to identify liver transplant recipients who can discontinue immunosuppressive therapy and that innate immune cells are likely to play a major role in the maintenance of operational tolerance in liver transplantation. It also identified the patients with the highest levels of V 1TCR T cells and the highest ratios of V 1:V 2 T cells, both of which had been previously demonstrated to be associated with TOL.7,8 CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD19, and natural killer T cells showed no correlation with the 24 gene Predictive Analysis of Microarrays‚Äù set, whereas natural killer cells were significantly associated with 10 of the gene probes, V 1TCR T cells were significantly associated with nine, and TCR T cells were significantly associated with 13 of the probes. These results show that natural killer cells and TCR T cells are associated with the gene signature of liver transplant tolerance  2084 HEPATOLOGY ELSEWHERE HEPATOLOGY, December 2008  and led the investigators to examine the expression of 22 of the most significantly different genes identified by polymerase chain reaction in subsets of peripheral blood leukocytes. This used five TOL and five non-TOL patients and sorted cells into CD4, CD8, TCR T cell, and non-T cell subsets. Finally, in six TOL, six non-TOL, and five control patients, expression of protein levels of SLAMF7, interleukin-2R , KLRB1, KLRF1, CD9, CD160, and CD244 were assessed by flow cytometry on CD4, CD8, TCR T cells, T cells, natural killer cells, and CD19 (B cells). These proteins were mainly expressed on natural killer and TCR T cells, reflecting the increased levels of TCR T cells in TOL.7,8 In addition, the role of TCR T cells and natural killer cells in liver transplant acceptance is of interest because they have been identified by a number of studies of tolerant liver transplant patients. 7.

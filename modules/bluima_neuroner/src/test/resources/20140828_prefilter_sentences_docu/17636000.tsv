The endocytosis of lipoprotein receptors is dependent upon the presence of F/YxNPxY motifs located in the intracellular domains of these molecules (Chen et al., 1990; Trommsdorff et al., 1998), and members of the Disabled family of adaptor molecules have a high affinity for this motif, mediated by the highly conserved phosphotyrosine-binding domain (Stolt et al., 2003; Yun et al., 2003). elegans Disabled is required for cell-type specific endocytosis and is essential in animals lacking the AP-3 adaptor complex  Alex Holmes1, Aileen Flett1, Damien Coudreuse2, Hendrik C.

This initiates a signalling cascade that leads to modification of cell behaviour. DAB-1 can bind to the intracellular domains of the lipoprotein receptors LRP-1 and LRP-2 (Kamikura and Cooper, 2003), as well as to clathrin and the AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor proteins (Kamikura and Cooper, 2006), a feature it shares with mammalian disabled-2. A similar assay for coelomocyte endocytosis involves monitoring the expression of a secreted form of green fluorescent protein from a transgene that is expressed in body wall muscle cells (Pmyo-3::ssgfp) (Fares and Greenwald, 2001).

The only observable synthetic morphological defect was that approximately 15% of double-mutant embryos displayed a single large vacuole that invariably formed in the vicinity of the excretory cell (Fig. 10D). Arrowheads indicate vacuoles located at the approximate position of the excretory cell sometimes seen in the double-mutant embryos. The fact that DAB-1 colocalises with clathrin in coelomocytes, the other major cell type affected by loss of dab-1 function, provides further evidence that DAB-1 is a component of clathrin-coated pits. This is in contrast to recent work showing that the closely related autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein escorts megalin throughout the endocytic cycle in MDCK cells (Nagai et al., 2003). Lipoprotein receptors, such as megalin and LRP1, are able to bind to a diverse array of molecules (Nykjaer and Willnow, 2002), in part because of the large number of complement-type repeats found in their extracellular portions. In the epidermis, pharynx and cells that form structures that interface between the epidermis and internal epithelia, the DAB-1::green fluorescent protein puncta were almost exclusively associated with the apical plasma membrane. All of these cells secrete an extracellular cuticle from their apical membranes, and given the moulting defects we observed in dab-1 mutants it is likely that there is a functional connection between apical DAB-1::green fluorescent protein puncta and cuticle processing. Thus, DAB-1::green fluorescent protein puncta might correspond to sites involved in the LRP-1-mediated uptake of cholesterol required for normal moulting: possibly cells that are involved in cycles of cuticle synthesis and degradation have a particularly acute requirement for cholesterol. Alternatively, DAB-1/LRP-1 might act to remove an extracellular inhibitor of moulting, although it is hard to reconcile this with the dynamic behaviour of DAB-1 puncta in adult animals that no longer moult. The phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Disabled selectively binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Stolt et al., 2005; Stolt et al., 2003; Yun et al., 2003), but there is little evidence in any animal cell that there is an apical-basal asymmetry in the distribution of this moiety, so it is likely that DAB-1 puncta are localised by asymmetric recruitment through protein-protein interactions, possibly by the receptor molecules themselves. The first reported study of dab-1 showed that animals with reduced dab-1 function displayed reduced secretion of the fibroblast growth factor homologue EGL-17 from vulval epidermal cells, leading to its accumulation in these cells (Kamikura and Cooper, 2003).

The first reported study of dab-1 showed that animals with reduced dab-1 function displayed reduced secretion of the fibroblast growth factor homologue EGL-17 from vulval epidermal cells, leading to its accumulation in these cells (Kamikura and Cooper, 2003). Our data show that DAB-1 is exclusively associated with puncta on the apical  surface of vulval cells. Thus, DAB-1 might maintain high levels of LRP-1/LRP-2 at the recycling endosomes through endocytosis, from where they could associate with EGL-17 and facilitate its export (independent of DAB-1) through the basolateral membrane of the vulval cells. Alternatively, it may be that a significant fraction of EGL-17 is routed by default to the apical surfaces of the vulval cells from where it must be endocytosed by DAB-1/LRP-1/LRP-2 for subsequent trafficking between the apical and basolateral endosomes. This latter `transcytosis' hypothesis is supported by recent data showing that in dab-1 mutants the vulval cells accumulate green fluorescent protein-tagged EGL-17 at the apical surface (Kamikura and Cooper, 2006), as might be expected if the role of DAB-1 is to recover misrouted EGL-17 from this membrane compartment.

Given the ample evidence for AP-3-independent lysosomal sorting pathways in  mammalian cells (Dell'Angelica et al., 1999; Ihrke et al., 2004), it is possible that we have uncovered a conserved function for Disabled proteins in lysosomal trafficking. It will be interesting to determine whether disabled-2 also plays a role in trafficking of molecules to the lysosomal compartments in mammalian cells. These workers did not detect expression of plasma membrane-associated puncta, and reported a more restricted range of dab-1::gfp-expressing cells.

21160000	Because recordings obtained from the same motor unit in a second set of data (n 12) were consistent with the larger set of data made from separate motor units (n 53), the difference in discharge characteristics for the two tasks was attributed to differences in the integration of synaptic input received by the motor neuron (Riley et al. 2008). Given age-associated changes in both the synaptic input that is delivered to motor neurons (Boxer et al. 1988; Eisen et al. 1996; Oliviero et al. 2006) and in the intrinsic properties of the motor neurons (Engelhardt et al. 1989; Morales et al. 1987; Piotrkiewicz et al. 2007; Rossini et al. 1992), it seems likely that the discharge characteristics of motor units at recruitment will differ for older adults when they perform such tasks. integration of synaptic input by motor neurons during sustained contractions differs for young and old adults. This result is consistent with previous findings that at relatively low levels of synaptic input (e.g., motor unit recruitment) the motor neuron experiences fluctuations in membrane potential, resulting in variable discharge times (Berg et al. 2007, 2008; Calvin and Stevens 1968; Matthews 1996, 1999; Stein et al. 2005). The discharge characteristics at recruitment depend on how the intrinsic properties of the motor neurons integrate synaptic input (Kernell 1965; Schwindt and Calvin 1972). Studies have shown age-related reductions in the amount of synaptic input received by motor neurons from corticomotor (Eisen et al. 1996; Oliviero et al. 2006), brain stem (Johnson et al. 1993), and spinal reflex (Boxer et al. 1988; Earles et al. 2001; Kido et  B 0.5  0  -0.5 0.5 0 -0.5  44.6 Evidence suggests, for example, that changes in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs can influence the discharge characteristics of neurons (Abbott and Chance 2005; Berg et al. 2007; Stein 2010), which may explain the ageassociated difference in the discharge characteristics of motor units observed in the current study. However, the intrinsic properties of motor neurons also differ between young and old experimental animals. For example, motor neurons from older animals exhibit greater input resistance (Chase et al. 1985; Kalmar et al. 2009; Morales et al. 1987), reduced rheobase current (Kalmar et al. 2009; Morales et al. 1987), and either longer (Cameron et al. 1991; Kalmar et al. 2009) or unchanged (Engelhardt et al. 1989; Morales et al. 1987) afterhyperpolarization duration. If such age-associated adaptations can be confirmed, then the intrinsic properties of motor neurons could also contribute to the difference in discharge characteristics of motor units in young and old humans. In contrast, motor units in old adults discharged repetitively at recruitment for both target forces and there was no reduction in mean discharge rate during the 60-s contractions, which is consistent with a significant contribution by persistent inward currents to the net excitation of the motor neurons. Because the proportion of motor neurons that demonstrate persistent inward currents may increase with age (Bae et al. 2008; Kalmar et al. 2009), the different discharge characteristics of the two groups of participants may reflect an age-associated change in the contribution of persistent inward currents during such tasks.

18370000	The papillae cells will not develop well if emasculated too early. Wild-type embryos at the zygote (C), 1-cell (D, E), 4-cell (F), early globular (G), late globular (H), the heart (I), and the cotyledon (J) stages. (Lâ€“N) Homozygous fy60 embryos arrested at the 1-cell stage with aberrant cell division patterns. a, apical cell; b, basal cell; z, zygote. ZmEBE genes show a novel, continuous expression pattern in the central cell before fertilization and in specific domains of the resulting endosperm after fertilization.

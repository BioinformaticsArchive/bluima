18335000	EDITORIAL  Mesenchymal stem cells for graft-versus-host disease: a double edged sword? Convincing evidence shows that mesenchymal stem cells possess immunomodulatory properties, which may play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, the induction of transplantation tolerance and control of autoimmunity. Although there already data supporting their clinical efficacy in controlling some of the problems of hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, concerns remain over the potential of systemic immune suppression and tumor progression. In this issue of Leukemia, Ning et al.1 report the results of their study on the use of MSC for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease in patients with hematological malignancies subjected to allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. This is the first randomized study addressing benefits and disadvantages of MSC infusions in the context of hemopoietic stem cell allografting. A total of 30 patients were enrolled, most of them with acute myeloid leukemia, and randomized to receive hemopoietic stem cell from a HLA-identical sibling donor with or without culture-expanded MSC from the same hemopoietic stem cell donor, at a dose range of 0.3–15.3  105 MSC per kg. Even before testing their clinical efficacy in animal models,2,3 the immunosuppressive capacities of MSC were evaluated in the field of clinical allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation to prevent graft-versus-host disease. In an open-label multicenter clinical trial from Lazarus et al.,4 1.0–5.0  106 kg1 culture-expanded MSC derived from the bone marrow of the original hemopoietic stem cell donor were coinfused with hemopoietic stem cell in 46 patients. The first experience with the use of MSC for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease was reported by Lee et al.,5 who suggested that the injection of MSC enhanced engraftment, accelerated immune reconstitution and suppressed graft-versus-host disease following T-cell-depleted HLA haplotype-mismatched hemopoietic stem cell transplantation in a 20-yearold woman with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia. More recently, the results of a phase I–II study in children undergoing haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were reported. The co-transplantation of MSC from the same hemopoietic stem cell donor was associated with a significant reduction of graft failure rate as compared to historic controls.7 Regardless of the different experimental approaches and the diverse immune functions analyzed, MSC prevent the proliferation of T cells in response to mitogenic or antigenic stimuli both in humans and mice (reviewed in Dazzi and Horwood8). MSC also inhibit B9 and natural killer10 cell proliferation as well as dendritic cell differentiation and function.11 Glennie et al.12 demonstrated that MSC-mediated immunosuppression is produced via an antiproliferative effect, which arrests target cells at early stages of cell cycle. This translates in a profound inhibition of cell proliferation despite partial conservation of effector function. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet clarified but are likely to be mediated by direct cell-to-cell interactions and soluble factors. The antiproliferative effect of MSC is not confined to immune cells but also affects cells of different tissue origin, including hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines. Similar to what was observed on T cells, the effect is associated to an accumulation of tumor cells predominantly in G1 phase associated with the downregulation of cyclin D2.14 Furthermore, it appears that stemness is not a property required to exhibit immunosuppressive/antiproliferative activity, but is a fundamental characteristic of all stroma, as fibroblasts and terminally differentiated mesenchymal cells also inhibit the proliferation and prevent the apoptosis of activated T cells.15–17 The property of regulating stem cell renewal and differentiation as well as the capacity of suppressing cell proliferation can all be ascribed to the central role of stroma in the regulation of tissue generation, maintenance and repair in a specialized anatomic location, the `niche'.19 Cell-cycle regulation by the niche is critical for the fate of hemopoietic stem cell, as the quiescent state is indispensable for hemopoietic stem cell self-renewal and life-span. Stromal cells balance quiescence and cell division in the stem cell niche, thus regulating long-term hematopoiesis.20 The interplay between the supporting effects of MSC in stem cell growth and differentiation and their immunosuppressive properties has been exploited by some successful clinical experiences in idiopathic aplastic anemia, indicating the functional contribution of transplanted MSC to hematopoietic regeneration.7,21 For those active in the field of hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, these data are like a deja vu, when in the eighties we learnt that prevention of graft-versus-host disease was associated with loss of graft-versus-leukemia.22 In fact, the donor T cells contained in the hemopoietic stem cell preparation do not discriminate between the transplantation antigens, namely the minor histocompatibility antigens,23 expressed on leukemia and on normal tissues.24 Therefore, as the T cells affecting graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-leukemia are the same, it is not  Editorial  464  a surprise that the study by Ning et al. in this issue of Leukemia similarly shows increased leukemia relapse rate in patients treated with MSC. Cancer is organized in a manner similar to normal tissue, resourced by sub-population of stem cells dependent on a stromal cell `niche'. Multiple mechanisms are potentially capable to impair tumor eradication in hemopoietic stem cell transplantation.25 Not only the dynamic interaction between cancer and stromal cells can favor tumor progression,14,26,27 but 6 recent evidence supports the capability of the hematopoietic microenvironment to be the sole causative mechanism of cancer development.28 Thus, the transplantation of MSC could tip the 7 balance in favor of growth and progression of leukemic cells. In fact, although there is evidence that MSC can expedite tumor 10 metastasis by mechanisms depending on continuing contact with stromal cells,26 other models are not consistent with this prerequisite as the analysis of the tumor tissues failed to show the presence of MSC.14 The correlation between cotransplantation of mesenchymal stem cells and higher recurrence rate in hematologic Malignancy patients: 21 outcome of a pilot clinical study. 2 Sudres M, Norol F, Trenado A, Gregoire S, Charlotte F, Levacher B et al.

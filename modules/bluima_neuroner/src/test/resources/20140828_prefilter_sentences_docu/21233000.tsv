21233000	It is due to a mutation in the cftr gene, which encodes the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a chloride channel located in the plasma membrane of mucus-secreting epithelial cells. Cystic fibrosis is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the cftr gene, which encodes Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a chloride channel located in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells [2]. F508 produces an abnormally folded Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein that cannot locate at the apex of the respiratory epithelial cells [2,3]. The many other cellular and subcellular functions ascribed to Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator include regulation of the epithelial sodium channel and ATP, glutathione transport, control of free-radical generation  âˆ— Corresponding author. by the mitochondria, acidification of intracellular organelles, and chloride-bicarbonate ion exchange [5]. The Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein may also be involved in membrane endocytosis in renal and respiratory epithelial cells [6] and in structuring the lipid rafts [7]. Thus, Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator may play a pivotal role in controlling the magnitude of the inflammatory response of epithelial cells to a variety of stimuli [8,9]. Thus, Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-chloride channel dysfunction in bone cells may make a major contribution to dysregulation of the expression of genes involved in bone formation. [8] Borot F, Vieu DL, Faure G, et al. Eicosanoid release is increased by membrane destabilization and Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator inhibition in Calu-3 cells. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane [60] conductance regulator (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is expressed in maturation stage ameloblasts, odontoblasts and bone cells.

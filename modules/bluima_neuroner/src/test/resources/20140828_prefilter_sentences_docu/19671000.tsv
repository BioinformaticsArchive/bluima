Schendel,4 and Bernd Gansbacher1  Abstract Immunotherapy with whole cell cancer vaccines has been tested in various tumor types. This study investigated the safety profile and antitumor activity of an allogeneic prostate carcinoma cell line, LNCaP, expressing recombinant human interleukin-2 and human interferon-γ. Three patients received a dose level of 7.5 million cells, and 27 patients received 15 million cells per injection. Immune monitoring revealed T cell stimulation in the majority of patients. For this vaccine trial, an allogeneic prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) was transduced with a retroviral vector and prepared as a vaccine. Expression of tumor-associated antigens is upregulated after treatment with interferon-γ via interferon-γ-inducible genes, thereby increasing the susceptibility of tumors to MHCrestricted CD8) cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated killing (Gansbacher et al., 1990a; Propper et al., 2003). interleukin-2 is a well-known T cell growth factor, which is traditionally implicated in the agonistic stimulation of immune responses (Gansbacher et al., 1990b; Rosenthal et al., 1994). Autologous and allogeneic whole cell vaccines that showed some promising results have already been tested in clinical trials up to phase III (Hsueh et al., 2002; Jocham et al., 2004; Simons et al., 2006; Small et al., 2006; Higano et al., 2008). The use of allogeneic irradiated whole tumor cells has clear advantages in terms of vaccine production and quality, and obviates the need to procure autologous tumor tissue for vaccine production. Vector and cells Taking into account that histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-A*0201 is the most frequent histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-A allele in Western white individuals (40–50%), we chose the histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-A*0201-positive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA) for our vaccine platform. LNCaP cells are androgen sensitive and express prostate-specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, prostate-specific membrane antigen (Lu and Celis, 2002) and prostate stem cell antigen (Simons et al., 1999; Kiessling et al., 2002), and a large number of other antigens that are not restricted to expression in prostate tissue, such as survivin, NY-ESO, and the proto-oncogene HER-2/neu. Comparison by quantitative RTPCR with normal kidney tissue revealed a relative overexpression of survivin: 413-fold in LNCaP cells pretransduction and 576-fold in cells posttransduction. Intracellular staining showed protein expression in more than 85% of vaccine cells (data not shown). However, LNCaP cells express only low levels of surface MHC class I molecules, as do the majority of human Prostate cancer specimens obtained from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or biopsy of metastatic lesions (Bander et al., 1997; Pandha et al., 2003). MHC I expression of LNCaP cells was increased 2-fold by exogenous interferon-γ treatment (Lee et al., 2000). Intradermal injection was chosen as the mode of delivery because of the abundance of Langerhans cells, that is, skin-residing dendritic cells, which constitute critical antigen-presenting cells for priming immune responses to tumor cells (Simons et al., 1999). LNCaP cells were retrovirally transduced with an N2 vector, which is derived from the genome of the Moloney murine leukemia virus and contains the bacterial neomycin resistance gene (neo) as a selectable marker. By fusing DNA fragments encoding the major immediate-early human cytomegalovirus promoter and the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter with the human interferon-γ and human interleukin-2 cDNAs and cloning these fusion products into different sites of the N2 vector, an N/CIFN-γ/TIL-2 retroviral vector was established to infect LNCaP cells, resulting in interleukin-2 and interferon-γ secretion (Rosenthal et al., 1994). Immediately before administration, vaccine cells were thawed, washed three times with a 5% human albumin solution (human albumin solution; Aventis Behring, Marburg, Germany), counted and assessed for viability, lethally irradiated (150 Gy), and injected within a time frame of 2 hr.  Treatment, drug administration, and dose escalation Patients were scheduled to receive four intradermal vaccine injections on days 1, 15, 29, and 92. Designed as a dose-escalating study, the first  three patients in the trial received a dose level of 7.5106 cells in 1 ml of albumin solution (5%). Once safety at this dose was established (no dose-limiting toxicity) the next 27 patients received the second dose level of 15106 cells. Additional efficacy assessment: Immune monitoring, histopathology of vaccination sites, and artificial neural network analyses The following studies were also performed: determination of (1) frequency of antigen-specific T cells (enzyme-linked immunospot [ELISPOT] analyses) and (2) cellular composition of vaccination sites (immunohistopathology), and (3) additional statistical analysis (artificial neural network [artificial neural network] analyses). To investigate the frequency of antigen-specific T cells at defined time points pre- and postvaccination, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were directly stimulated in the interferon-γ ELISPOT analyses with histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-A*0201 peptide ligands for various antigens. The following peptides were used: prostate-specific antigen prostate-specific antigen-123 (FLTPKKLQCVDLHVISNDVCAQV, amino acids 141– 163, containing the peptides prostate-specific antigen-1, prostate-specific antigen-2, and prostate-specific antigen-3) (Correale et al., 1998), prostate-specific membrane antigen prostate-specific membrane antigen-P2 (ALFDIESKV, amino acids 711–719) (Salgaller et al., 1998), prostate-specific membrane antigen-P4 (VLAGGFFLL, amino acids 27–35) (Lu and  Celis, 2002), prostate stem cell antigen prostate stem cell antigen-P3 (VLLALLMAGL, amino acids 4–13) ( Matsueda et al., 2004), prostate stem cell antigen-P4 (ALQPGTALL, amino acids 14–22) (Dannull et al., 2000), EpCAM Ep-2H (heteroclitic ILYENNVIV, amino acids 184– 192) (Trojan et al., 2001), prostate-specific G protein-coupled receptor PSGR-1 (ILLVMGVDV, amino acids 202–210) (Brill et al., 2007), six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate STEAP-3 (LLLGTIHAL, amino acids 262–270) ( Machlenkin et al., 2005), preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma PRAME-P4 (SLLQHLIGL, amino acids 425–433) (Kessler et al., 2001), prostatic acid phosphatase prostatic acid phosphatase-5 (ALDVYNGLL, amino acids 299–307) (Peshwa et al., 1998), Survivin-P1 (ELTLGEFLKL, amino acids 95–104) (Schmitz et al., 2000), Survivin-P2 (TLPPAWQPFL amino acids 5–14) (Schmitz et al., 2000), parathyroid hormone-related protein precursor PTH-r-P1 (YLTQETNKV, amino acids 103–111) (Yao et al., 2005), NY-ESO-1 (SLLMWITQC, amino acids 157– 165) ( Ja ̈ ger et al., 1998), Her2/neu-P3 (ALCRWGLLL, amino acids 5–13) (Kawashima et al., 1998), and prostate carcinoma tumor antigen PCTA-1-P2 (IMVLKDKFQV, amino acids 106–115). Peptide synthesis and in some cases vaccine cell lysate preparation were performed as described (Brill et al., 2007). For ELISPOT analyses, preimmunization peripheral blood mononuclear cells (day 0), postimmunization peripheral blood mononuclear cells (post-1, day 8; post-2, day 22; post-3, day 36; and post-4, day 99), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two additional time points (days 57 and 183) were thawed, rested for 2 hr, and seeded at 1–2105 cells in triplicate on antibodyprecoatedpolyvinylidenedifluoride(PVDF)plates(Mabtech, Nacka, Sweden). Because of variation in the amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from different patients at different time points it was not possible to test the T cells of every patient at every time point against the full set of peptides (but all data shown in Fig. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated directly with the peptides (5 μg/ml) in culture medium containing 10% human AB serum pretested for low background (Brill et al., 2007).

LNCaP cells, in contrast to other Prostate cancer cell lines used as cancer vaccines, do not express transforming growth factor (transforming growth factor )-β (see Fig. All enrolled patients received at least three vaccinations with LNCaP(interleukin-2/interferon-γ) cells, resulting in a minimal time on vaccination therapy of 29 days. The median overall survival time (intention to treat [ITT]) since first vaccination was 32 months (mean value, 34 months). prostate-specific antigen values during vaccination with LNCaP (interleukin-2/interferon-γ) cells initially showed an ongoing increase followed by a period with stable or decreasing prostate-specific antigen values (prostate-specific antigen plateau), before a new phase of increase ()25% cutoff; Brill et al., 2007).

In all patients, interferon-γ-secreting T cells with peptide reactivity could be observed, with time courses showing variability among individuals. By ELISPOT analysis of all 30 patients, at least a 2-fold increase in antigen-specific T cells was seen in most of the patients, with variations in the numbers of reactive T cells and peptide specificity between preand posttreatment samples. For example, in one patient (patient 113) showing a prolonged and late onset of serum prostate-specific antigen decrease (90% decrease with nadir on day 246), the increase in numbers of specific T cells was detectable at later time points. This patient showed no increase in specific T cells in the periphery before study day 365 (seventh vaccination), with an exception for PSGR-1 and prostate-specific membrane antigen-P2 and -P4 after the second and third vaccinations (data not shown). There were no differences in reactivity against the vaccine cell lysates on day 0 between groups 1 and 2 (data not shown).

The magnitude of the inflammatory cell response at the injection sites appeared to increase according to the numbers of vaccine cells injected. In the biopsies, none of the residual vaccine cells were identified morphologically or by immunostaining for pan-cytokeratin (data not shown). Phenotypically, CD3) T cells predominated over B cells in all cases. The number of CD56) natural killer cells was always low. In contrast to the other trials, we have used a single cell line, LNCaP, genetically modified with interferon-γ and interleukin-2 to enhance the presentation of potential tumorassociated antigens and to augment antigen-specific T cell frequencies. Now we show that whole tumor cell vaccination can influence prostate-specific antigen doubling time without inducing significant toxicity. Compared with other whole cell vaccination trials we used relatively low numbers of vaccine cells (e.g., 15 million cells vs. up to 300 million cells) (Higano et al., 2008). prostate-specific antigen doubling time is a strong prognostic parameter used in many trials ( Michael et al., 2005; Oudard et al., 2007; Dreicer et al., 2008), and proposed by the prostate-specific antigen Working Group to measure therapeutic activity (Arlen et al., 2008), and was used as our primary end point. It is unlikely that our vaccination selectively eliminated high prostate-specific antigen-producing tumor cells, although not impossible. Skin biopsies taken from the injection sites clearly demonstrated that we induced strong immune responses against vaccine cells. The injected cells were effectively destroyed and were not present in any day 7 injection site biopsies. The combination of alloantigens with interleukin-2 and INF-γ led to the induction of a mononuclear cell infiltrate at the injection site. The absence of transforming growth factor-β expression by the vaccine cells is certainly helpful, because interleukin-2 and transforming growth factor-β are known to play a central role in the activation and maintenance of the induced form of T regulatory cells (iTreg). On the other hand, it is possible that the interleukin-2 secreted by our vaccine cells induces proliferation and survival of recently activated effector T cells, but at the same time possibly counteracts this effect by stimulating Tregs locally (Huter et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008). All patients showed an increase in T cell frequencies specific for several peptides used for analysis, but there was no correlation between prostate-specific antigen course and ELISPOT reactivity, confirming many previously published reports.

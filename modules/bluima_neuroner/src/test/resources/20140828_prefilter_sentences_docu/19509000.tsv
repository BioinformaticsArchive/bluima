19509000	These doses were based on a Phase I trial of chemotherapy using paclitaxel and nedaplatin in chemotherapy-na ̈ıve patients with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (14). Most of patients (95.8%) had pathology of squamous cell carcinoma, and others were adenocarcinoma (4.2%), and no patient had gastroesophageal junction carcinomas. Histology Squamous cell 46 (95.8) The randomized Phase II study comparing cisplatin/5-fluorouracil to cisplatin alone in advanced squamous cell esophageal cancer showed that the combination arm was superior in terms of RR of 35% when compared with cisplatin alone arm (RR 1⁄4 19%), and overall survival (33  vs. 28 weeks, respectively) (18).

Richter and colleagues (19,20) proposed that the activity of “postinspiratory” medullary respiratory neurons directly inhibits the activities of bulbospinal expiratory neurons; the latter, in turn, define the levels of spinal neural activities during phase I of expiration. In addition, as a result of these changes in inspiratory activities, activities of postinspiratory medullary respiratory neurons may be altered, which, in turn, would alter the levels of neural activities during phase I of expiration. We submit that this reversal represents the point at which activations by the tonic discharge of pulmonary stretch receptors exceed the depression by activities of postinspiratory neurons.

19388000	Imprinting Testing HapMap CEU lymphoblast cell lines were obtained from Coriell Institute of Medical Research (Camden, NJ) and maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 15% FBS at 37C and 5% CO2. RNA was extracted from approximately 106 cells using the RNeasy extraction system (Qiagen Ltd., Genotyping of cDNA from 22 HapMap cell lines heterozygous for the SNP rs11564774 (mapped to the 3′-3′-untranslated region of the dopamine transporter gene gene) was conducted using Applied Biosystems Taqman assay. However, bi-allelic expression was observed in all 22 cell lines tested indicating that dopamine transporter gene is not imprinted at least in lymphoblast cell lines. We therefore examined 22 HapMap cell lines that were heterozygous for the SNP rs11564774, an expressed SNP mapped to exon 15 of dopamine transporter gene. Using quantitative PCR we showed no evidence of mono-allelic expression in these cells as might be expected if there was imprinting at  TABLE III.

In regions of laminae VI to VIII that receive numerous degenerative primary afferents, neurons undergoing different phases of degeneration (chromatolysis, lipid accumulation, dark shrunken necrosis) were constantly found. Most of the latter belonged to spinocerebellar neurons, owing to the presence of fiber degeneration in both spinocerebellar tracts and mossy fiber degeneration in the anterior vermal lobe. This study also suggests a simple pathophysiological mechanism for the onset and the progression of the degeneration: dystonic gene action would affect perinatally specific classes of sensory receptors, producing the degeneration of the nerve terminals and, progressively, the cell death of the sensory ganglion cells at their origin. This retrograde death, which results in the massive and early deafferentation of spinocerebellar neurons, would provoke, trans-neuronally, the impairment of these second order sensory neurons and the progressive degeneration of the spinocerebellar system. The changes, appearing as axonal swellings, mostly affect the large myelinated axons of primary sensory neurons3' including the trigeminal system. 56 Central lesions in non-sensory systems have been reported in an allele of dystoniu musculorum (dystoniu musc~ulorum”lb) by Messer and Strominger,4' who described, in Nissl-stained preparations, distorted shapes and eccentric nuclei in 5&75% of the large  neurons of the red nucleus, and patches of small dark neurons in the striatum. Since in the latter, the degeneration does not necessarily need to affect cerebellar cortical neurons but only some of their extracerebellar afferent projections, we decided to analyze the CNS of dystonia musculorum mutant mice by neuroanatomical methods allowing the revelation of axonal pathway degeneration. Acid phosphatase activity was vtsualrzed usmg tilt modification of Barka and Anderson' of the lead nitrate method of Gomori, using beta-glycerophosphate as substrate at pH 5. Some of the sections were processed with the same histochemical method whilst adding 0.3 mM sodium fluoride to the incubation medium to reveal only the fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase enzyme, specitic for a distinct subpopulation of type B cells and their central projections.2”.`4 Blocks obtained from dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord (cervical, thoracic and lumbar segments), medulla oblongata and cerebellum were postfixed by immersion for 4 h in a solution of 2% osmic acid in 0.12 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 7% glucose. RESULTS  The examination of the series stained using the Kliiver and Barrera method, together with that of the l-pm thick plastic sections stained with Toluidine Blue, confirms and expands on the results previously reported by Duchen et aLI In the sensory ganglia, the density of cell bodies is decreased, and some of the remaining neurons still exhibit pathologic changes either of vacuolation or of a chromatolytic nature. The absence of argentophylic neurons in these regions strongly suggests that the pathological changes reported by Messer and Strominger4' are not a constant feature of dystoniu musc~ulorum jdt phenotype, at least on the genetic backgrounds studied here. Some of the degenerating fibers pursue their ventral course toward laminae VIII and IX, where they terminate between the perikarya of motoneurons. 29) have made it possible to distinguish at least three cytochemically different subpopulations of small cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, at the origin of the fine caliber myelinated and unmyelinated afferent fibers: (i) those containing extralysosomal acid phosphatase; (impregnation; and/or) those immunostained with anti-substance P antibodies; and (iii) those immunostained with antisomatostatin antibodies. At low magnification, neither extralysosomal acid phosphatase nor fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase activities are visible (Fig. 5) whereas, at high magnification, some granular remnants of lead precipitate can be seen between the slightly stained neurons of lamina II in extralysosomal acid phosphatase preparations (Fig. 7). A less dense network extends into lamina IX and covers some of the motoneuron perikarya. Degenerative changes in spinal neurons. In addition to the degenerative features described above, two other forms of pathological changes have been encountered: (i) gigantic axonal varicosities, and (impregnation; and/or) neuronal degeneration; in some instances, the two changes are associated. In some cases, dense bodies and a few tubular profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum can also be included among the cellular organelles clustered at the central core. Other forms, with reduced amounts of neurofilaments and increased numbers of cellular organelles, mainly tubular profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, are less abundant. All the vacuoles are surrounded by a single membrane, suggesting that they originate from intracellular organelles, particularly the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The high degree of vacuolation of these varicosities is similar to that reported in neurons of the spongiform encephalopathy of the gray tremor (gt/gt) mutant mouse. 33Although the origin of the axons bearing the varicosities is in general very difficult to determine, some of the vacuolated varicosities have been traced back to chromatolytic neurons dispersed within the ventral half of the spinal gray matter. The close examination of l-pm thick plastic sections discloses the presence of a few altered neurons predominantly located in laminae VII and VIII, at most levels of the spinal cord (Figs 12, 13). Such altered neurons are very rare either in the central cervical nucleus or in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke (Fig. 11), regions where spinocerebellar neurons are tightly packed. 4o,53According to their pathological changes, three classes of altered spinal neurons have been observed as follows. (i) The most common alterations resemble those reported for chromatolytic neurons.4v5 The arrow points to an argentophylic neuron. (impregnation; and/or) In some of the neurons, the most obvious abnormality, already visible with light microscopy (Figs 12 and 13), is the presence of numerous dense inclusions scattered throughout the cytoplasm. They resemble the commonest lipid inclusions observed in adipose cells and composed by triglycerides of fatty acids.“” Such inclusions are almost non-existent in normal neurons'” and can be considered as evidence that the neurons are undergoing degeneration. the dcgenerative state of these neurons is supported by the fact that they also exhibit the chromatolytic tigures described above (Fig. 19). (iii) In this last and less frequent category of degenerating neurons have been included cells in their final stage of dark degeneration. With light microscopic observations, these neurons are hyperchromlc (Fig. 11) and display pyknotic nuclei, while the cytoplasm appears as a homogenous dense mass, or it is formed by clumps of shrunken material.

Central region of a myelinated axonal varicosity containing numerous neurofilaments, mitochondria and intracellular membrane-bound vacuoles. Remnants of a dark, shrunken necrotic neuron surrounded by a thin microglial process (asterisks). The necrotic debris of the neuronal perikarya is often surrounded and phagocytosed by microglial cells, which are identified by their dense cytoplasm where long rough endoplasmic reticular cisterns are suspended (Fig. 16). Neither axonal nor neuronal degeneration have been encountered in upper regions of the brain stem, such as the red nucleus, the striatum and, particularly, the thalamic regions receiving spinal projections. In addition, a few dispersed degenerating axons have been observed, most of them lying within the inferior olive (dorsal accessory olive) and the medullary reticular formation [either close to midline (Fig. 26) or in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus]. These fibers are present, at the spinomedullary border, throughout the mediolateral sequence of primary fibers, indicating that they originate from caudal as  well as from rostra1 root ganglia. From their neurons of origin in the trigeminal ganglion, degenerating axons enter the pons and either ascend towards the principal sensory nucleus or descend within the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. These fibers are much thinner in the stratum zonale and inner part of substantia gelatinosa than in the inner, medial zone of the nucleus or subnucleus magnocellularis of 01szewski4' In order to determine if the selectivity in the degenerative process induced by the dystoniu musc~ulorum locus, and affecting unmyelinated axons, is similar in the spinal dorsal horn and in the caudal trigeminal substantia gelatinosa, fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase activity and substance P immunoreactivity have been studied.

Note the irregular contour of the neuron, its eccentric nucleus (N) and the fragmentation of the Nissl bodies. Chromatolytic neuron containing abundant lipid droplets as well as small tubular and vesicular profiles (asterisks). The arrow points to an axon terminal synapsing on the chromatolytic neuron. It is studded with argyrophilic debris and fragmented fibers which encompass the individual nerve cells. Terminal degeneration is present among motoneurons, probably terminating on their dendritic processes. These degenerating fibers do not seem to originate from primary afferent axons of the trigeminal ganglion but from mesencephalic trigeminal neurons. There is no concentration of impregnated axons within the monolayer of Purkinje cells, and none has been seen ascending in the molecular layer along the dendrites of this cell class. Occasionally, the dark, shrunken rosette remains in synaptic contact with its postsynaptic targets, the granule cell dendrites (Fig. 31). More frequently, the dark, shrunken rosettes are mostly (Fig. 30) or entirely (Fig. 32) surrounded by glial processes, and only fragmented small remnants of the mossy terminals (still containing synaptic vesicles, Figs 29 and 31) or the isolated presynaptic membrane (Fig. 33) remain attached to their postsynaptic partners. In this case, the greatest part of the degenerating rosette is rapidly taken off by either microglial cells (Fig. 32) or by reactive astrocytic processes (Fig. 30). The criterion used to assess the ongoing degeneration is the presence of either dense and/or clear small fragments of mossy rosettes or of patches of isolated presynaptic membrane, all of them encircled by granule cell dendrites and facing normal postsynaptic differentiation (Figs 29, 31 and 33). DISCUSSION  As first reported by Duchen ef a1.,16the autosomal recessive dystonia musculorum mutation provokes in mice a progressive degeneration affecting “mainly the dorsal root ganglion cell and its branches” as well as most sensory ganglia of the cranial nerve, with the exception of the spiral and vestibular ganglia. Although the latter findings suggest the involvement of second order sensory neurons in the degenerative process, the authors gave no conclusions on either the identification of the affected neuronal categories or on their possible existence outside the spinal cord. Moreover, the second order sensory neurons affected by the dystoniu musc~ulorum gene have been identified. Two of them belong to primary sensory afferents: dorsal root afferents from all spinal ganglia, and trigeminal afferents originated both from the trigeminal ganglion and the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus; the third affected system corresponds to the spinocerebellar projection, originated from precise second order sensory neurons of the spinal cord.40*53 57) are very much in favor of the integrity of second order sensory neurons among spinothalamic, dorsal column nuclei and trigeminothalamic neurons of the dystonic mouse. Hence, the only class of second order  sensory neurons which seems to be involved in the degeneration is that at the origin of the spinocerebellar projection. The progressive nature of the disease was shown by Duchen et a1.,16who were able to maintain alive dystoniu musc~ulorum/dystoniu musc~ulorum mice for as long as 8 months, and to observe a late involvement of lower motoneurons. Because of the limited age-span of the samplingthe results reported in this study concern mice aged 20-35 days only-the possibilities remain that: (i) some of the most precocious degenerating fiber systems have been already removed by glia and escape analysis with the Fink-Heimer silver impregnation; and/or the disease may, in its progression, later involve other fiber systems that are still unaffected in Sweek-old mutants. The facts that, despite an important neuronal loss, the sensory ganglia of the mice studied here still contain some neurons exhibiting degenerative features, and that the extent and the density of the degeneration remain very similar in 20as well as in 35day-old mice, suggest that within the studied time-window the removal of the necrotic debris evolves concomitantly with the appearance of new axons undergoing degeneration. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, Duchen et ~1.`~have reported a partial motor denervation of the limb muscles in 4- to 8-month-old mice, implying alterations in some lower motoneurons, which have normal appearance in the mice studied here. However, in the mutant this depletion is associated with a reduction in number of small ganglion cells and with the presence of some terminal degeneration among the glomeruli in lamina II. Second order sensory neurons: is the degenc~rution II,! spinocerebellar neurons the result of' u trunsneuronul process or the primary e@cr of' the mutation? ventrolateral area of lamina VII (lumbar segments) and lamina VIII, where neurons at the origin of spinocerebellar tracts are particularly located.4”i7 This suggests that the second order sensory neurons lose most of their peripheral sensory inputs. a few dcgenerating neurons are present in these spinal rcgions, which, together with the constant fiber degeneration in spinocerebellar tracts and the moss) fiber terminal degeneration in the anterior vermal lobe, provides evidence for the association between the loss of primary afferents and the death of some spinocerebellar neurons. through an anterogrdde transneuronal process, be responsible for the degeneration of spinocerebellar neurons or whether such a degeneration is also a primary elect of the mutation. In the mutant spinal cord, the presence of gigantlc axonal swellings, with morphological features resembling those encountered in peripheral nerves and sensory roots, has been interpreted by Janata” as an indication that the main lesion in dwonia musculorum is axonal, and that the pathological changes in neuronal perikarya would be the result of a  Figs 28-30. is enwrapped by microglial cytoplasm. The last one, of the clear type (C), still maintains its synaptic connections with the granule cell dendrites (arrowheads). This interpretation could explain that occasionally axons belonging to degenerative spinal neurons bear gigantic varicosities and, above all, that the common pathology of the affected neurons is a chromatolysis, alone or in association with a particular type of lipid accumulation. This interpretation permits one to assume that the mutation exerts its primary action on first order sensory neurons as well as on spinocerebellar neurons, and that the direct targets of the mutation are not the neurons themselves but their very long axons; the disease progressing as a “dying back” process.* Some arguments favor the transneuronal degeneration of spinocerebellar neurons. Dorsal rhizotomies in lumbar spinal segments of the cat provoke a chromatolytic reaction followed by degeneration of the large Clarke neurons.37.38 For some investigator$' the degeneration of large Clarke neurons is the result of an anterograde transneuronal reaction. 13) and it occurs after short post-operative survival periods, Loewy” interpreted the pathologic changes in Clarke neurons as being due to either direct surgical trauma or to vascular injury of their axons. In any case, it is known that immature neurons are much more susceptible to denervation than adult neurons. Deprivation of sensory innervation to a particular nucleus during critical stages in development can produce neuronal loss in the denervated area.36 Dorsal rhizotomy in postnatal animals does affect, in an anterograde transneuronal manner, the fate of neurons in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke. Loewy3* reported perikaryal and nuclear shrinkage in deafferented Clarke neurons in kittens. Smith,52 using Golgi impregnation, observed that primary deafferentation in kittens aged 3-5 days produced neuronal hypoplasia and abnormal dendritic orientation. Thus, primary sensory afferents are necessary for the complete normal development of Clarke neurons. Nevertheless, the lack of quantitative studies on cell numbers, in the immature dorsal nucleus of Clarke  before and after dorsal rhizotomy, does not allow one to conclude if the number of afferents influences the number of surviving Clarke neurons. Taking into consideration the experimental observations obtained after dorsal rhizotomy and the great susceptibility of immature spinal neurons to deafferentation, the results obtained on dystonic spinal cord can be considered to favor an anterograde transneuronal mechanism of the spinocerebellar neuronal degeneration. As discussed above, the denervation is precocious, since the onset of the degeneration takes place perinatally, and by 20 days it has reached a high degree of density, particularly in those areas containing spinocerebellar neurons. Furthermore, the chromatolytic degeneration evidenced by these neurons is similar to that reported after experimental dorsal rhizotomy, but in the mutant, because of its spontaneous occurrence, it cannot be the result of ischemic injury of their axons contrary to Loewy's3*interpretation in experimental animals. In conclusion, although the primary cellular target of the genetic abnormality remains uncertain, a likely, but not necessarily the only, interpretation of the results is that in the dystonia musculorum mutation causes a failure in the survival of the' peripheral branches of the axons of specific populations of sensory ganglion neurons. As a consequence, a transneuronal degeneration en cascade would take place from these peripheral axons up to the spinocerebellar mossy fibers. This interpretation has the advantages of centering the primary effect of the mutation to a population of primary sensory neurons, and to emphasize the importance of anterograde signalling on the stability of neuronal networks during their ontogeny.” However, it does not fully explain why other second order sensory neurons, in dorsal column and sensory trigeminal nuclei, are apparently normal in the dystonic mouse. Three dark, shrunken mossy rosettes (l-3) still maintain their central position in the glomeruli, and their synaptic relationships (arrowheads) with granule cell dendrites. Dense degenerating mossy fiber terminal (T) phagocytosed by a microglial cell. In peripheral nerves, there is a marked loss of large myelinated fibers belonging to sensory axons, as it can be disclosed by the heavy degeneration of large myelinated fibers in dorsal roots and the depopulation of neurons in dorsal sensory ganglia, together with the normal appearance of ventral roots.2R.4RThe spinal cord exhibits an almost complete loss of axons in the posterior columns, more marked in the gracile than in the cuneate fasciculus. Degeneration of spinocerebellar neurons, particularly in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke, and of spinocerebellar fibers in both anterior and posterior tracts, is very intense. For instance, giant axonic spheroids have not been reported in the CNS of patients with Friedreich's ataxia and, conversely, the sensory ganglia in the mutant mouse lack nodules of Nageotte, perhaps related to the early age of the ganglion cell degeneration. Moreover, the study of the dystoniu musc~ulorum mouse suggests the possibility that the somatosensory dysfunction could be initiated either by lack of trophic molecules or altered metabolism in the target cells of the sensory terminals, especially muscle spindles and mechanoreceptors. The inability of some classes of sensory endings to survive would produce, through a retrograde axonal process, the death of their neurons of origin and the subsequent degeneration of their central axonic branches, provoking a massive and early deafferentation of spinocerebellar neurons. The absence of anterograde signalling, on these still immature neurons, would cause their progressive impairment, leading to the degeneration of the spinocerebellar system. C., Chiang T.

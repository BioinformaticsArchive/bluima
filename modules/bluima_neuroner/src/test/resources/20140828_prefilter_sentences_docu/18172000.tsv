AJP - Renal Physiology publishes original manuscripts on a broad range of subjects relating to the kidney, urinary tract, and their respective cells and vasculature, as well as to the control of body fluid volume and composition. For wild-type counterparts mice subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, there was a rapid (3 h) redistribution of meprin -subunits in cells in straight segments of proximal tubules, followed by shedding of apical cell membrane and detachment of cells. An understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ischemic kidney injury is critical to developing effective treatments to reduce mortality. Expression is localized to the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells in the straight (pars recta) segment (12). Meprins are proposed to be the major matrix-degrading activity in rodent kidney, capable of degrading several extracellular matrix proteins (4, 5, 50). Homozygous meprin- knockout mice derived by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells were described previously (33). Because meprin- knockout mice were produced in C57BL/6 (B6) with 129/Sv strain embryonic stem cells, C57BL/6 129/Sv F2 littermates were used as wild-type counterparts controls for most experiments. Nearly all straight tubule segments contain detached cells (Fig. 7B, arrows). Higher magnification of the corticomedullary junction region revealed not only meprin on cells in the lumen (solid arrows) but also redistribution to lateral surfaces and between intact cells still attached to the basement membrane (Fig. 8). To examine further the intracellular localization and redistribution of meprin in ischemic mouse kidney, we labeled meprins with fluorescent secondary antibodies in optical sections using confocal microscopy (Fig. 9). By 3 h of reperfusion in ischemic kidney (Fig. 9B), meprin- was localized not only at the luminal surface but also in the cytoplasm surrounding, but not inside, nuclei of intact cells. Inflammatory cells in kidney of wild-type counterparts and meprin- knockout mice after ischemia-reperfusion. Arrows show cells staining positive. By 6 h of reperfusion, there was increased accumulation of meprin-containing cells and cellular debris in tubular lumens in the corticomedullary junction region (Fig. 10, A and B). Meprin was found on all sides of cells and in acellular tubules. In the meprinKO mouse, there is less disruption and shedding of membranes in proximal tubules cells, a less severe inflammatory response, and better preservation of kidney function after ischemia-reperfusion compared with the  wild-type counterparts mouse. The histological data show that there is a marked redistribution of meprin proteins in the wild-type counterparts kidney in response to ischemia-reperfusion, and we propose that the relocalization of meprin proteases causes severe damage to kidney proteins (in the cytosol, at cell junctions, and/or at the basal lateral membrane) that is responsible for a cascade of reactions that lead to cellular damage and an inflammatory response. B: higher magnification shows cells and cellular debris in corticomedullary tubules (arrows). Other factors that have been implicated in the injury to the kidney include cellular apoptosis and necrosis (46), inflammation (28), reactive oxygen species (45), leukocyte adhesion molecules,  Fig. Meprin is localized to membranes and cells in the lumen (arrowheads) and redistributed to lateral surfaces and between intact cells still attached to the basement membrane (arrows). dendritic cell-endothelial cell interactions (44), T-cell recruitment and activation (35), C5b-9 (52), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (13). The present studies indicate that after ischemia-reperfusion, meprins relocalize to the lateral and basolateral membranes of proximal cells in straight segments in mice. Meprins could contribute to cellular injury by damaging cell-cell interactions by hydrolyzing cell junction proteins [e.g., E-cadherin (Lottaz D, personal communication)] or extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., laminin, nidogen, fibrinogen, collagen IV), given that these proteins have been demonstrated to be substrates for meprins in vitro (5, 11, 49). Studies in rats had suggested the possibility that meprins might enter the cytoplasmic compartment of tubular cells after ischemia-reperfusion injury (10). In the present study, a series of confocal optical sections 0.4 m thick revealed intracellular localization of meprins throughout the cytoplasmic compartment of intact cells 3 h after injury. In addition, subcellular fractionation data (not shown) support the contention that meprins redistribute to the cytoplasm after ischemia-reperfusion. Thus meprins could contribute to cell injury and inflammation by hydrolyzing cytosolic proteins such as PKA and latent IL-1 (11, 20). Meprins could initiate or accelerate cell detachment thru hydrolysis of focal attachment proteins that are important in stabilizing focal adhesions. These substrates would not be encountered by meprins in the normal proximal tubule cell. This raises the possibility that meprin- is involved in oxygen sensing and in the response of the kidney proximal tubule cells to hypoxia. B: 3 h after reperfusion in ischemic mice, meprin localized in luminal regions of the tubules (asterisks) and in the cytoplasm surrounding nuclei of intact cells (arrows). B: higher magnification of the region shown in A showing cells with fragmented nuclei at the basement membranes of heavily damaged tubules (arrows). Dilated tubules are lined with cells with flattened morphology, and there is an overall loss of meprin- staining in cortical straight segments. Meprin- is downregulated during transdifferentiation of renal tubule epithelial cells to a fibroblast-like phenotype in vitro upon exposure to transforming growth factor- and EGF, suggesting a role in fibrogenesis.

ALESSI*1 *MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, U.K., †College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, U.K., and ‡Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee DD1 9SY, U.K.  The LKB1 tumour suppressor phosphorylates and activates AMP-activated protein kinase when cellular energy levels are low, thereby suppressing growth through multiple pathways, including inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase that is activated in the majority of human cancers. Blood glucose-lowering Type 2 diabetes drugs also induce LKB1 to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, indicating that these compounds could be used to suppress growth of tumour cells. In the present study, we investigated the importance of the LKB1– AMP-activated protein kinase pathway in regulating tumorigenesis in mice resulting from deficiency of the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) tumour suppressor, which drives cell growth through overactivation of the Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin kinases. We demonstrate that LKB1 is required for activators of AMP-activated protein kinase to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signalling as well as cell growth in PTEN-deficient cells. Most importantly, our results demonstrate the potential of AMP-activated protein kinase activators, such as clinically approved metformin, as anticancer agents, which will suppress tumour development by triggering a physiological signalling pathway that potently inhibits cell growth. Akt drives cell proliferation, at least in part, through its ability to activate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, via phosphorylation of TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex) 2 and proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (reviewed in [14,15]). Furthermore, overexpression of the Rheb GTPase, an  activator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, stimulates growth and proliferation of Akt1/Akt2-deficient cells [17]. One of these comprises AMP-activated protein kinase, which is phosphorylated and activated by the LKB1 tumour suppressor protein kinase when cellular energy levels are low [18,19]. Once activated, AMP-activated protein kinase functions to restore energy levels by phosphorylating key cellular substrates, leading to the stimulation of ATP-generating pathways. Pathways controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 are activated in cells and tumours possessing reduced AMP-activated protein kinase activity as a result of loss of LKB1 [2,23]. Moreover, low-energy stress or oral hypoglycaemic anti-Type 2 diabetes drugs, such as metformin or phenformin  Abbreviations used: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside; AMP-activated protein kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ES cell, embryonic stem cell; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FOXO1, Forkhead box O1; mammalian target of rapamycin, mammalian target of rapamycin; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; S6K1, S6 kinase 1; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex. that activate AMP-activated protein kinase, fail to inactivate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 or inhibit cell growth and proliferation in LKB1-deficient cells [2,23,24]. However, it has also been reported that LKB1-deficient fibroblasts undergo a greater degree of cell death under energy-deprived conditions [2]. Thus cancer cells lacking the ability to control their energy levels through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway may be more susceptible to stresses that lower energy levels. Furthermore, inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase has recently been shown to markedly sensitize a variety of cancer cells to cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent [29]. Thus inhibition of the LKB1– AMP-activated protein kinase pathway might actually be beneficial for the treatment of cancer, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells by interfering with their ability to manage energy stress and by increasing the effectiveness of cytotoxic compounds. Phosphocellulose P81 paper was from Whatman. In brief, 500 μg of different mouse tissues and ES cell (embryonic stem cell) lysates were used to immunoprecipitate LKB1, and 50 μg of lysates were used for AMPKα1 immunoprecipitation. Generation of LKB1/PTEN-knockout ES cells Female LKB1fl/+PTEN+/- mice were induced to superovulate by the injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin. Blastocysts were removed at 2.5 days post-coitus and cultured on 24-well plates on a feeder layer of mitotically inactivated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts for 1–2 weeks to allow the ES cells to grow. Wells were trypsinized, and 80 % of the aliquot was frozen in two batches, while the remaining 20 % was used to grow cells for DNA preparation. In order to generate LKB1-/- ES cell lines, LKB1fl/flPTEN-/-, LKB1fl/flPTEN+/+ ES cells obtained as above were subjected to Cre-mediated deletion to remove the floxed LKB1 allele as described previously [34]. After transfection by electroporation with 30 μg of pMC-CrePuro, the cells were seeded on to feeder layers under puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection, and colonies were picked in duplicate into 96-well tissue culture plates. The LKB1+/+PTEN-/- ES cell line was generously provided to us by Dr Pier P. Pandolfi (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, U.S.A.) [6]. Cell culture, stimulation and cell lysis LKB1+/+PTEN+/+, LKB1+/+PTEN-/-, LKB1-/-PTEN-/- and LKB1-/-PTEN+/+ ES cells were grown on gelatinized tissue culture plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10 % (v/v) FBS (fetal bovine serum) (Hyclone) supplemented with 1000 mg/l glucose, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, antibiotics (100 units of penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), antimycotic (1 μg/ml ciproxin infusion), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 25 ng/ml murine leukaemia inhibitory factor. The ES cells were cultured to 80 % confluence on 10 cm diameter dishes and then stimulated with the indicated agonists as described in the Figure legends. The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 M sucrose, 0.1 % (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and CompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail (one tablet per 50 ml)] and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4 ◦C. Cell growth assay ES cell lines were seeded in 12-well plates (30 000 cells per well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 % FBS in the presence or absence metformin or phenformin. The cell medium was changed every 24 h with freshly dissolved metformin or phenformin added. After 72 h, the cells were washed once with 1× PBS, and fixed in 4 % (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing once with water, the cells were stained with 0.1 % Crystal Violet in 10 % ethanol for 20 min and washed three times with water. Crystal Violet was extracted from cells with 0.5 ml of 10 % (v/v) ethanoic (acetic) acid for 20 min.

Architecturally, the polyps were biphasic complex growths with distorted glands and a cellular stroma (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/412/bj4120211add.htm). The gland epithelium was composed of crypts, absorptive epithelium mostly on the surface, numerous mucin-secreting cells and Paneth cells. These surface epithelial cells, but not the stromal component, stained with a broadspectrum anti-cytokeratin antibody. The stromal component had the morphology of smooth muscle, with spindle-shaped cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and cigar-shaped nuclei lying within a loose extracellular matrix. We found that 15–30 % of LKB1+/+PTEN+/- and LKB1fl/flPTEN+/- animals also developed a number of minor preneoplastic lesions, with the most common being prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and intratubular germ cell neoplasia (Table 1). This was confirmed by the finding of high levels of phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and phosphorylation of the S6 protein at Ser235 predominantly in the epithelial cells of the polyps from both genotypes (Figure 2C). Comparable levels of Ki67 staining were also seen in the epithelium and smooth muscle cells of the polyps from LKB1+/+PTEN+/- and LKB1fl/flPTEN+/-animals. The staining of the smooth muscle cells was distributed more randomly. Role of the LKB1–AMP-activated protein kinase pathway in modulating mammalian target of rapamycin signalling and growth of ES cells We next explored the role that the LKB1–AMP-activated protein kinase pathway plays in regulating Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin utilizing single LKB1+/+PTEN-/or LKB1-/-PTEN+/+, as well as double LKB1-/-PTEN-/- ES cells, generated as described in the Experimental section. The PTEN-deficient (LKB1+/+PTEN-/- and LKB1-/-PTEN-/-) ES cells displayed elevated levels of phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity, as judged by increased phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6 protein (Figure 3A). LKB1-/-PTEN+/+ cells possessed low levels of Akt phosphorylation, but elevated levels of phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389, similar to those observed in LKB1+/+PTEN-/- cells (Figure 3A). We also investigated how treatment of these ES cells with activators of AMP-activated protein kinase affected Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Treatment of wild-type LKB1+/+PTEN+/+ or LKB1+/+PTEN-/- cells with the AMP mimetic AICAR or either of the anti-Type 2 diabetes drugs metformin or phenformin stimulated phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase as well as ACC. In contrast, treatment of LKB1-deficient (LKB1-/-PTEN+/+ or LKB1-/-PTEN-/-) cells with AMP-activated protein kinase activators failed to induce phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase or ACC or inhibit phosphorylation of S6K1 or S6 protein, indicating that, in LKB1-deficient cells, AMP-activated protein kinase was not activated, and neither was mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibited (Figure 3B). Treatment of ES cells with AMP-activated protein kinase activators did not inhibit phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 (Figure 3B). We also analysed the effect of metformin and phenformin on the growth of ES cell lines. Consistent with studies performed in other cell lines [24], the growth of wild-type LKB1+/+PTEN+/+ as well as LKB1+/+PTEN-/- ES cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by metformin (Figure 3C) or phenformin (Figure 3D). In contrast, the growth of LKB1deficient LKB1-/-PTEN+/+ or LKB1-/-PTEN-/- ES cells, was inhibited to a markedly lower extent by metformin or phenformin (Figures 3C and 3D). Effect of AMP-activated protein kinase-activating drugs on PTEN tumorigenesis The finding that a reduction in LKB1 expression accelerated tumour development in PTEN+/- animals and that AMP-activated protein kinase is required to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and cell growth in PTEN-deficient cells led us to hypothesize that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase would suppress tumorigenesis in mice. Lymphomas [H&E (haematoxylin/eosin) staining ×20 objective] arise predominately in the submaxillary and parotid nodes and have the features of marginal zone low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The intestinal polyps (H&E staining ×2 and ×20 objectives) are biphasic tumours comprising complex epithelial growth with irregular branched glands and a smooth muscle cell stroma. Phaeochromocytoma (H&E staining ×20 objective) was composed of sheets of polygonal cells, supported by a rich vascular supply replacing the adrenal medulla. FOXO1 staining was seen in the cytoplasm and nucleus of both the epithelial and smooth muscle cells of the polyp, with stronger staining of the epithelial cells. Most epithelial cell staining was in crypts, but the smooth muscle staining was more randomly distributed. S6 (pSer235) reactivity was most marked in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells towards the surface of the polyp. Staining for ACC (pSer79) was represented by a weak diffuse cytoplasmic reactivity in the epithelial cells. Figure 3 Requirement of LKB1 for AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 in PTEN-deficient cells  (A) The indicated strains of ES cells were generated as described in the Experimental section and cultured to 80 % confluence in 10 % (v/v) FBS. The cells were lysed, and LKB1 or PTEN was immunoprecipitated and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cell extracts derived from two different dishes of cells were also immunoblotted with the other indicated antibodies. (B) As in (A), except that the ES cells were left untreated (-) or treated with AICAR (2 mM), metformin (metformin; 10 mM) or phenformin (phenformin; 2 mM) for 2 h. (C and D) ES cells were seeded in 12-well plates (30 000 cells/well) - in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 % FBS in the presence of indicated doses of metformin (C) or phenformin (D) for 72 h, with the medium being changed each day with freshly dissolved metformin or phenformin. The cells were stained with Crystal Violet, and, following extraction with ethanoic acid, cell growth was assessed by measuring the absorption of each sample at 590 nm. relative to the absorbance of wild-type LKB1+/+PTEN+/+ ES cells, which are given a value of 1, for two independent experiments with each condition undertaken in triplicate. We also found that AMP-activated protein kinase activators induced similar activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in LKB1fl/+ and LKB1+/+ ES cells (Supplementary Figure S3 at http://www.

This would explain why the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway is not markedly elevated in the liver, spleen and intestine tissues of LKB1fl/fl mice (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1B), compared with previous work undertaken in LKB1-/- cell lines and tissues [2,37]. As mentioned above, others have postulated that inhibition of LKB1 or AMP-activated protein kinase might actually be therapeutically advantageous for the treatment of cancer in humans, as suppression of this pathway might reduce the ability of tumour cells to tolerate and survive low energy and/or chemotherapy [2,29]. It is also likely that AMP-activated protein kinase suppresses cell growth by phosphorylating substrates other than mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 regulators. One study suggests that AMP-activated protein kinase inhibits cell-cycle progression by controlling the phosphorylation and stability of p27kip, a cell-cycle inhibitor [42]. The stabilization of p27kip was postulated to enable cancer cells to better survive conditions of nutrient and energy stress [42]. In a similar vein, AMP-activated protein kinase was claimed to enhance survival of hypoxic cancer cells by stabilizing HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-1α [43]. Taken together, these findings indicate that, in addition to suppressing proliferation and growth, activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway may also facilitate the survival of some tumour cells. Other potential AMP-activated protein kinase anticancer targets include p53, which supposedly, following phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase, induces apoptotic cell death rather than enhancing survival [44,45]. Recent work also demonstrates that AMP-activated protein kinase regulates epithelial cell polarity in part by controlling the assembly and disassembly of tight junctions [46,47]. The ability of AMP-activated protein kinase to maintain cell polarity under situations of energy stress is likely to also contribute to its anti-tumour effects. Much more work is required to delineate the diverse effects of activating AMP-activated protein kinase activity in cancer cells and to define the substrates that AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates to regulate growth, proliferation, survival and polarity. It has also been proposed that exposure of lung cells to inhaled carcinogens plays a role in promoting tumour development in LKB1-deficient lung tissue [41]. Further work is required to understand why mutations of LKB1 are so prevalent in lung cancer and the role that Ras and/or carcinogens play in promoting transformation of LKB1deficient lung cells. However, the ability of AMP-activated protein kinase to gauge and control cellular energy places it in an ideal position to ensure that cell growth and proliferation is coupled to the availability of a sufficient supply of nutrients and energy. Metformin and phenformin both activate AMP-activated protein kinase indirectly, probably by decreasing cellular energy levels by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration (reviewed in [18,19]). The effect of exercise in reducing cancer frequency is likely to be complex, but the depletion of whole-body ATP levels during exercise would raise AMP-activated protein kinase activity and have the potential to inhibit cell growth and prevent cancer.

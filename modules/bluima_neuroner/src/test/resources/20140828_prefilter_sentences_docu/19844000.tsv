19844000	This layer combination, n++-GaAs/lowtemperature-grown-GaAs, together with a Ti/Au metallization, which is deposited immediately after the epitaxial growth, provides an excellent nonalloyed shallow ohmic contact for nanodevices [9–11]. Here, accurate control of the relative lateral position of the gate around the nanocolumn is mandatory in order to achieve excellent electrical gate control. On the other hand, the column–gate distance amounts to about 20 nm, which yields an excellent gate control of the current at resonance.

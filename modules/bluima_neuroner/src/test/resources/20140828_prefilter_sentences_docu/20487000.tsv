20487000	Bioinformatic data suggested enhanced cellular apoptosis in the incisal tip segment, which, together with diminished expression of the Amelx and Enam genes, may contribute to the production of the thin enamel seen in this tooth segment. For genes exhibiting higher levels of expression in the adjacent segment where complex enamel is being formed, bioinformatic analysis suggested significant associations with cellular functions involving the actin cytoskeleton, cellular development, morphology, and movement. Key words: actin; ameloblast; Amelx; Enam; microRNA Accepted for publication January 2010  The tooth is a convenient experimental model for studying the basic mechanisms of organ development, including differentiation, cellular interaction, morphogenesis, and production and mineralization of extracellular matrices. Recent bioinformatic predictions of microRNA targets in vertebrates indicate that hundreds of MicroRNAs are responsible for regulating the expression of up to 30% of the human protein-coding genes (18, 19), and MicroRNAs have recently also been shown to regulate the expression of hundreds of mRNAs in cultured cells (20). Bioinformatic analysis Bioinformatic analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (ingenuity pathways analysis) (28) was carried out in an attempt to provide molecular and cellular functional interpretations of genes exhibiting significantly different expression (P < 0.05) in incisal tip segments compared with adjacent segments of the developing maxillary incisor. The resulting populations of common messenger RNA species targets were analyzed using ingenuity pathways analysis, enabling estimates of possible cellular functions associated with proteins coded for by these mRNAs. After completion of electrophoresis, the separated proteins were blotted onto 0.45 lm Trans-blot nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated separately with antibodies to enamelin (C-18; sc-33107), kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (H-50; sc-20622), actin (H-300; sc-10731), and calbindin D28K (H-50; sc-28285) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Results  Molecular and cellular functions with significant associations to genes that are differentially expressed  By using the analysis of variance function in the Spotfire program it was possible to screen, simultaneously across every timepoint investigated, the entire data set for genes that showed significantly different (P < 0.05) levels of expression in the incisal tip segment compared with the adjacent segment of incisor tooth germ. Bioinformatic analysis using ingenuity pathways analysis suggested significant (P < 0.05) associations between differentially expressed genes and various molecular and cellular functions (Fig. 2). The plotted data represent associations between genes and cellular/molecular functional categories. Figure 4A presents the molecular and cellular functions showing the higher numbers of associated genes and the higher levels of significance of association with those 85 genes. It is therefore likely that these cellular functions are more prominent in the adjacent segment (i.e. in the incisor segment where enamel with the characteristic mature pattern is being established). Furthermore, Actb, Actg1, Actn2, Actn3, Arpc1b, Diaph1, Pdgfa, and Rhoq were suggested to be directly, or indirectly, associated with cellular functions that regulate Actin cytoskeleton organization , Actin filament polymerization , Actin binding , Cell shape , Cell movement , and Calcium ion binding (results not shown). Bioinformatic analysis using ingenuity pathways analysis suggested significant associations between these common messenger RNA species targets and various molecular and cellular functions (Fig. 8). Bioinformatic analysis showed that genes associated with the cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell death (apoptosis) were both more numerous and exhibited a higher significance of associations in the incisal tip segment than in the adjacent segment (Fig. 2). This suggests a somewhat enhanced cellular turnover in this segment of the tooth germ. It can be speculated that cells, including ameloblasts, in the incisal tip segment may have a shorter life span than the more apically situated cells that produce the full four-layered enamel typical of mouse incisors. The cellular and molecular functions with the higher numbers of associated genes and the higher levels of significance of association are shown in the figure. In the adjacent segment, genes associated with cellular development and cellular movement were both more numerous and exhibited a higher significance of associations compared with the incisal tip segment (Fig. 2). Two proteases have been isolated from the extracellular enamel matrix of developing teeth: enamelysin (MMP20), a matrix metalloproteinase, and kallikrein-4, a serine proteinase (44, 45). The molecular and cellular functions associated with the subclusters of MicroRNAs, which exhibited higher levels of expression in the incisal tip segment than in the adjacent segment, are in general related to the regulation of activities that are integral to cellular growth and development (Fig. 8). Similarly, the associated signaling pathways are typical of those regulating cellular growth and differentiation, for example, Ephrin receptor signaling , Extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling , and PI3/AKT signaling (data not shown). Therefore, the bioinformatic results lend support to the suggestion  that cells, including ameloblasts, in the incisal tip seg- 18. ment are less developed than cells related to the adjacent segment where complex enamel is being formed.

19706000	An exercise stimulus has been shown to induce the production of free radicals, which may lead to oxidative stress and cause damage to cellular tissue (Davies et al., 1982). Oxidative damage to cellular targets is characterized by a progressive change or degradation of biomolecules as lipids, proteins, and DNA, and the recruitment of defense mechanisms may prevent or limit these changes (Djordjevic ÃÅ, 2004; Blomhoff, 2005). However, plasma glutathione can be used as a model for intracellular glutathione, as it is assumed that plasma glutathione reflects intracellular whole-blood glutathione.

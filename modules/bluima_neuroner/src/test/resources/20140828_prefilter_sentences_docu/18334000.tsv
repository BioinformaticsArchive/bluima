18334000	The generation of reactive oxygen species has been associated with oxidases in plasma membrane and the electron transport of chloroplast and mitochondrion (Laloi et al. 2004, Ye et al. 2006) and will affect photosynthetic pigments and membranes of cell ultrastructure (Foyer et al. 1994, Taylor and Craig 1971). We hypothesize that low temperature causes ultrastructural changes in leaves of cucumber and higher activities of antioxidants in a chilling-resistant cucumber cultivar may alleviate those changes and protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. After thin sections have been cut with an LKB Ultratome Nova (Bromma, Sweden) and picked on 250-mesh grids, leaf cells were poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then were observed using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1200EX; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV. Results  Changes in the cell ultrastructure To study the damage of chloroplast and other organelles caused by low temperature, ultrastructure of two cultivars was investigated with a transmission electron microscope. The membranes of chloroplast and plasma were comparatively continuous in treatments of X15, X25 and J25, while they appeared indistinct in some cells of J15 (Fig. 2). Discussion  Changes in the cell ultrastructure Because chloroplasts and mitochondria of plant cells are major sites for generating reactive oxygen species under stress conditions (Salin 1991, Xu et al. 2006), we investigated the ultrastructure of both organelles. In some cells of J15, however, the plasma membrane was discontinuous, suggesting that it is damaged seriously in J15 leaves.

18354000	Here we examine this apparent contradiction by quantifying cell surface and intracellular AMPA receptor subunits in the nucleus accumbens before and after a challenge injection in behaviorally sensitized rats. Because MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and are implicated in addiction, we also evaluated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38. Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios were increased after 14 d of withdrawal in sensitized rats but were decreased 24 h after challenge with cocaine (which elicited a sensitized locomotor response) or saline (which elicited conditioned locomotion). In sensitized rats, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens increased during withdrawal and normalized after cocaine challenge. Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation also increased after withdrawal, but after cocaine challenge, it was inversely related to Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation paralleled AMPA receptor surface expression. Finally, in tissue from the same rats used to monitor AMPA receptor trafficking, we examined the phosphorylation state of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Other saline and cocaine rats testing procedure by placement in photocell cages (one animal/cage; San were returned to activity cages on withdrawal day 14 and given a chalDiego Instruments, San Diego, CA) for 20 min. These rats were killed 24 h then remained for 2 h in the photocell cages. The overall experi-(day 1), animals were habituated to photocell cages for 20 min before mental design is depicted schematically in Figure 1 A. injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.; provided by the National Institute on Criteria for sensitization. A cocaine rat was considered sensitized if its increase in activity treatment (day 7), animals returned to photocell cages for 20 min of over the course of cocaine treatment (day 7/day 1 beam break ratio) habituation, cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.) injections, exceeded the CV of the saline group (e.g., a cocaine rat with day 7/day 1 and 2 h of locomotor activity measurement. Surface and intracellular Glutamate receptor 1–GluR3 levels were determined with a protein cross-linking assay (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005). Other membranes were incubated overnight with phospho-specific antibodies recognizing activated forms of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p38 MAP kinase (p38), or Jun N-terminal kinase and then stripped (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) before probing with phosphorylation-independent antibodies to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p38, or Jun N-terminal kinase [pERK1/2, 1:10,000; total extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase1/2, 1:20,000 (Millipore); p-p38, 1:10,000; total p38, 1:10,000; p-Jun N-terminal kinase, 1:5000; total Jun N-terminal kinase, 1:5000 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA)]. The diffuse densities of surface (S) and intracellular (I) bands in each lane were determined using TotalLab (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). A potential concern is that cross-linking might interfere with immunodetection of the surface band, preventing accurate determination of the surface/intracellular ratio. For each subunit, the sum of the density of surface and intracellular bands in the cross-linked tissue was equal to the density of the single subunit band in the non-cross-linked tissue (data not shown). After washing away the unbound antibody, 100 l of nucleus accumbens whole-cell lysate prepared in RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation) assay buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 1 protease inhibitor mixture (EMD Biosciences), 1 mM Na VO , and 1 mM NaF] was added for an 34 overnight incubation at 4°C. These values and surface/intracellular (which is independent of protein loading) were normalized to saline control values. Glutamate receptor 1 S levels and surface/intracellular ratios are increased in sensitized rats after 14 d of withdrawal but decreased 24 h after a cocaine or saline challenge. A, Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratio. Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 subunits redistribute to the cell surface during cocaine withdrawal but internalize after cocaine challenge A protein cross-linking assay (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005) was used to compare the distribution of the AMPA receptor subunits Glutamate receptor 1–3 in saline- and cocaine-treated rats. BS 3 selectively cross-links cell surface (S) proteins, forming high-molecular-weight aggregates. Intracellular (I) proteins are  4  groups. GluR2 S levels and surface/intracellular ratios are increased in sensitized rats after 14 d of withdrawal but decreased 24 h after a cocaine or saline challenge. A, GluR2 surface/intracellular ratio. SENS-WD rats had higher Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular and S values than SAL-WD or NON-WD rats, indicating redistribution of Glutamate receptor 1 from intracellular to cell surface compartments in the nucleus accumbens of sensitized rats (Fig. 2 A, B). This is not surprising, because both shorter (7 d) and longer (21 d) periods of withdrawal from the same cocaine regimen were associated with a significant elevation in the Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratio in the nucleus accumbens of cocaine-sensitized rats (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005, 2006). It should be noted that the Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratio was not elevated in cocaine-sensitized rats killed after 1 d of withdrawal, a time point when locomotor sensitization was evident (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005). SENS-COC rats had significantly decreased surface/intracellular and S values for Glutamate receptor 1 compared with SENS-WD rats (Fig. 2 A, B). Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular values in SENS-COC rats were also significantly decreased compared with SAL-SAL rats (Fig. 2 A). This indicates that cocaine challenge not only reversed the increase in Glutamate receptor 1 surface expression that occurred during cocaine withdrawal, but brought the surface/intracellular ratio below control levels. In salinetreated rats, there were no differences between S, I, and surface/intracellular values between SAL-WD and SAL-SAL groups, indicating that saline challenge on withdrawal day 14 had no effect on Glutamate receptor 1 distribution. Interestingly, however, SENS-SAL rats had Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratios significantly lower than both the SENS-WD and SAL-SAL groups. A, GluR3 surface/intracellular ratio. Alternatively, there may be some internalization occurring in both groups, but because AMPA receptor surface expression starts from a higher level in the SENS-SAL group, the decrease in the surface/intracellular ratio in response to saline challenge is detectable with our assay, whereas the decrease is below the limit of detection for the NON-SAL group. Although S and surface/intracellular values increased significantly for SENS-WD rats, there were no significant changes in I or S I, raising the question of where the additional surface receptors come from. Three additional analyses of these data indicated that small changes in I and S I, although they did not reach statistical significance, together contributed to the observed increases in S and surface/intracellular values. increased S and surface/intracellular values may be attributable, at least in part, to a shift of Glutamate receptor 1 from I to S compartments. These results indicate that both a shift from intracellular compartments (decreased I) and an increase in Glutamate receptor 1 total protein (increased S I) contributed to the observed increase in surface Glutamate receptor 1 levels in sensitized rats. For GluR2, we observed results similar to those obtained for Glutamate receptor 1. SENS-WD rats had higher GluR2 surface/intracellular and S values than SAL-WD rats, indicating redistribution of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors from intracellular to cell surface compartments (Fig. 3 A, B). SENS-COC and SENS-SAL rats had significantly decreased GluR2 surface/intracellular and S values compared with SENS-WD rats (Fig. 3 A, B), indicating that either challenge produced GluR2 internalization in sensitized rats. When samples from the same rats were immunoblotted for GluR3, we observed no differences between any of the Figure 5. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 phosphorylation is increased after 14 d of withdrawal but not 24 h after a cocaine or saline challenge. A, groups for any GluR3 measure (surface/intracellular, S, I, or Phospho-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 normalized to total extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 protein (pERK2/total extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2).

C, Total extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 levels normalized to total protein in the lane (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2/total protein). Our results suggest that was paralleled by a decrease in Glutamate receptor 1 intracellular levels. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 activation state during withdrawal and after challenge injections extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Jun N-terminal kinase have been implicated in AMPA receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation may mediate synaptic insertion of AMPA receptors during LTP (Zhu et al., 2002), whereas Jun N-terminal kinase activation is implicated in AMPA receptor synaptic removal during depotentiation (Zhu et al., 2005). p38 activation is implicated in AMPA receptor removal during some forms of long-term depression (Zhu et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2004) (but see Brown et al., 2005), whereas decreased p38 activity is associated with AMPA receptor insertion during LTP (Krapivinsky et al., 2004). SENS-WD rats exhibited significantly higher extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 phosphorylation (pERK2/total extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 and pERK2/total protein) than SAL-WD rats (Fig. 5 A, B). This increase in extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 phosphorylation occurred in the absence of changes in total extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 protein (Fig. 5C). In SENS-COC or SENS-SAL rats, levels of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 phosphorylation were not significantly different from SAL-SAL controls, indicating that a single cocaine or saline challenge reversed the increase in extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 phosphorylation that had developed during withdrawal (Fig. 5 A, B). extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 phosphorylation did not correlate with AMPA receptor surface/intracellular ratios for indiFigure 6.

In the only other study to examine extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation which extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase1 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 were quantified separately either after in the nucleus accumbens during withdrawal from repeated cocaine injections, 14 d of withdrawal or 24 h after cocaine challenge. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase1 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase2 were quantified together and measured on day 7 Jun N-terminal kinase proteins, also known as stress-activated protein kinases of withdrawal (Mattson et al., 2005). No differences between sa- (SAPKs), are the products of three genes, Jun N-terminal kinase1/SAPK , Jun N-terminal kinase2/ line and cocaine groups were apparent after withdrawal only, but SAPK , and Jun N-terminal kinase3/SAPK . Transcripts from each gene undergo cocaine rats showed greater extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation 20 min after alternative splicing, resulting in proteins with molecular weights cocaine challenge. Because surface/intracellular ratios for both Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 were significantly decreased by cocaine and saline challenge in cocainesensitized rats and Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation is implicated in AMPA receptor synaptic removal (Zhu et al., 2005), we used Spearman rank order to test for correlations between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios and Jun N-terminal kinase measures for individual rats in the SENS-COC and SENS-SAL groups, as well as the SENS-WD group. This analysis revealed a significant inverse relationship between the Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratios and p54 phosphorylation (Fig. 8 A) and a trend toward a similar relationship between GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios and Figure 7. Jun N-terminal kinase p46 phosphorylation is increased in sensitized rats after 14 d of withdrawal, whereas total protein levels of Jun N-terminal kinase p54 phosphorylation (Fig. 8C) in the p46 are increased 24 h after a cocaine challenge. Data (mean SEM) are normalized to SAL-SAL controls and represent the sum of four independent experi- Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios to p46 paramments (2 withdrawal only and 2 withdrawal plus challenge).

C, Relationship between p-p54/total protein and the GluR2 surface/intracellular ratio after cocaine challenge in sensitized rats. D, Relationship between p-p46/total protein and the GluR2 surface/intracellular ratio after cocaine challenge in sensitized rats. Finally, no significant relationships between Glutamate receptor 1 or GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios and p54 or p46 parameters (phospho-p54 or phospho-p46/total p54 or p46; phospho-p54 or phospho-p46/total protein; total p54 or p46/total protein) were found in SENS-SAL rats (data not shown). Analysis of correlations with Spearman rank order revealed a near significant inverse relationship between p38 phosphorylation and Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratios in the SENS-SAL group, indicating that the higher the p38 phosphorylation is, the lower the Glutamate receptor 1 surface expression is (r 0.90; p 0.08; data not shown). Correlations between surface/intracellular ratios for AMPA receptor subunits during withdrawal and after challenge injections Results from cross-linking experiments indicated that Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 subunits both redistribute to the cell surface during co-  caine withdrawal and redistribute to intracellular compartments after cocaine challenge. This possibility is supported by positive correlations between surface/intracellular ratios for Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 in cocaine-treated rats subjected to withdrawal only (Fig. 10 A) or withdrawal plus cocaine challenge (Fig. 10 B). We also tested the correlation between surface/intracellular ratios for Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 after separating rats in Figure 10, A and B, into sensitized and nonsensitized cohorts. For rats subjected to withdrawal but no challenge (Fig. 10 A), the significant positive correlation between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios remained for NON-WD rats (Fig. 10C) but was no longer significant for SENS-WD rats (Fig. 10 D). For rats subjected to withdrawal plus cocaine challenge, a positive correlation between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios was obtained for both sensitized rats (r 0.78; p 0.01) and nonsensitized rats (r 0.79; p 0.01). There was also a significant positive correlation between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios for saline-treated rats (SAL-WD and SAL-SAL groups were combined for this analysis; r 0.45; p 0.01). One possible explanation for loss of the correlation between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios in the SENS-WD group is related to selective changes in Glutamate receptor 1/2- versus GluR2/3-containing AMPA receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Because GluR2 is contained in both Glutamate receptor 1/2- and GluR2/3-type AMPA receptors, the GluR2 surface/intracellular ratio is actually a mixed measure of the distribution of these two receptor populations. In our previous study, conducted after 21 d of withdrawal, we reported a significant correlation for cocaine-treated rats between surface/intracellular ratios obtained with Glutamate receptor 1 antibody and antibody recognizing both GluR2 and GluR3 subunits (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005). This is not necessarily at odds with the present study (which found no correlation between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios in sensitized rats), because the correlation reported by Boudreau and Wolf (2005) could have reflected a relationship between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR3. To examine this possibility, we compared surface/intracellular ratios between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR3 in cocaine-sensitized, cocainenonsensitized, and saline-treated rats on withdrawal day 21 (tissue from Boudreau and Wolf, 2005) and on withdrawal day 14 (tissue from the present study). Spearman rank-order analysis of tissue from both withdrawal times revealed a significant positive relationship between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR3 surface/intracellular ratios in cocainesensitized but not saline-treated or nonsensitized rats (Fig. 11 A– F ). Other results in sensitized rats (tendency toward increased total protein levels of Glutamate receptor 1 but not GluR2 or GluR3; loss of correlation between Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios; and increased association  tially all of the target protein. Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios are positively correlated in all cocaine rats subjected to withdrawal, but the relationship is lost when sensitized rats subjected to withdrawal are analyzed separately.

B, Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratio versus GluR2 surface/intracellular ratio in all COC-COC rats. C, Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratios versus GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios in NON-WD rats. D, Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratios versus GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios in SENS-WD rats. For some rats, surface/intracellular ratio data were only obtained for one subunit (Glutamate receptor 1 or GluR2), accounting for a lower sample number in some of these analyses than in behavioral analyses. Discussion Withdrawal and cocaine challenge have opposite effects on AMPA receptor trafficking We have shown that AMPA receptors in nucleus accumbens neurons redistribute to the cell surface during cocaine withdrawal in sensitized but not nonsensitized rats. Thus, AMPA receptor subunit surface/intracellular ratios were increased after withdrawal for 7 d (Boudreau and Wolf, 2006), 14 d (present results), and 21 d (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005), but not 1 d (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005). However, when sensitized rats were challenged with saline or cocaine, the AMPA receptor surface/intracellular ratio decreased, indicating a reduction in cell surface expression. The increased AMPA receptor surface/intracellular ratio that occurs during withdrawal could reflect either increased AMPA receptor insertion into the membrane or a decrease in the rate of AMPA receptor removal. We favor the former explanation because the increased AMPA receptor surface/intracellular ratio is accompanied by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation, which is associated with AMPA receptor insertion in the hippocampus (Zhu et al., 2002), and is also accompanied by activation of other signaling pathways implicated in AMPA receptor insertion (Boudreau and Wolf, unpublished results). The decreased AMPA receptor surface/intracellular ratio after cocaine challenge is likely to reflect AMPA receptor internalization, as discussed in detail below. AMPA receptor subunit composition In sensitized rats, both Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR2 surface/intracellular ratios increased during withdrawal. The Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratio was also significantly decreased compared with saline controls. The GluR3 surface/intracellular  ratio did not change significantly during withdrawal or challenge. This may occur more effectively in cocaine-sensitized rats as a result of increased AMPA receptor surface expression on nucleus accumbens neurons. However, Li and Kauer (2004) used a robust LTP protocol, whereas a study showing enhanced LTP  mine (DA) levels, but this is unlikely to mediate AMPA receptor internalization, because DA agonists increase AMPA receptor surface expression in cultured nucleus accumbens neurons (Mangiavacchi and Wolf, 2004a). Saline challenge decreased the Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratio in cocaine-sensitized rats to approximately the same extent as cocaine challenge. Glutamate receptor 1 and GluR3 surface/intracellular ratios are positively correlated in sensitized rats, but not nonsensitized or saline-treated rats, at Mead et al., 1999; Hotsenpiller et al., both 14 and 21 d of withdrawal.

For some rats, surface/intracellular ratio data were only obtained for one subunit (Glutamate receptor 1 or GluR3), accounting for a lower trigger AMPA receptor internalization. MAPK phosphorylation correlates with AMPA receptor redistribution Our experiments, the first to examine Table 1. Coimmunoprecipitation of AMPA receptor subunits in nucleus accumbens tissue from MAPK involvement in AMPA receptor trafficking in striatal neurons, naive adult rats showed that sensitized rats withdrawn for 14 d exhibited inIP creased extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation in parallel with increased AMPA receptor surface/intracellular ratios. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation has been linked to AMPA receptor synIB Glutamate receptor 1 GluR2 aptic insertion during hippocampal LTP (Zhu et al., 2002). drive to nucleus accumbens neurons (see above), whereas LTP occurs rapidly and is triggered by increased afferent activity. Thus, our results, after repeated cocaine used a minimal tetanus protocol to probe while falling short of demonstrating a causal link between extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase for changes in nucleus accumbens cell responsiveness (Yao et al., 2004). activation and AMPA receptor trafficking during cocaine withdrawal, raise the possibility that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase contributes to both rapid (LTP) and Cellular mechanisms underlying AMPA receptor redistribution slowly induced (cocaine withdrawal) increases in AMPA receptor surWe speculated previously about mechanisms that trigger in- face expression. After cocaine challenge, AMPA receptor internalization creased AMPA receptor surface expression during cocaine withdrawal is accompanied by normalization of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation. The strongest hypothesis is that de- extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation parallels AMPA receptor surface expression during withcreased glutamate transmission onto nucleus accumbens neurons during co- drawal and after challenge. It is well established that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phoscaine withdrawal (Goldstein and Volkow, 2002; Baker et al., phorylation in nucleus accumbens neurons occurs after psychostimulant ad-2003) combined with decreased intrinsic excitability of nucleus accumbens neu- ministration, is an important regulator of transcription, and is rons (Zhang et al., 1998, 2002; Hu et al., 2004) leads to a compen- required for several behavioral adaptations resulting from resatory increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors via synaptic scaling, a peated psychostimulant exposure (Lu et al., 2006; Girault et al., form of homeostatic plasticity (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004).

In the SENS-SAL group, we found a significant increase in p38 phosphorylation as well as a near-significant inverse relationship between p38 phosphorylation and Glutamate receptor 1 surface/intracellular ratios. Conclusions Glutamate receptor 1/2-containing AMPA receptors redistributed to the surface of nucleus accumbens neurons during withdrawal from repeated cocaine and internalized after cocaine or saline challenge. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation paralleled AMPA receptor surface expression.

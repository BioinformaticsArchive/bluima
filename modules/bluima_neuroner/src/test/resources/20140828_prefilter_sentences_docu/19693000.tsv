19693000	V1a vasopressin receptor was found to specifically co-express at the macula densa cells with cyclooxygenase-2 and with neuronal nitric oxide synthase, which produces potent stimulators of renin, prostaglandin E2, and NO. The expression levels of renin, cyclooxygenase-2, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase were significantly decreased in V1a vasopressin receptor/ mice, which led to the suppression of renin–angiotensin system activity and consequent decreases in aldosterone and blood volume. Furthermore, V1a vasopressin receptor is also expressed in collecting duct cells and involved in regulating water reabsorption by affecting V2/aquaporin 2 function. V1a vasopressin receptor mediates vascular contraction, cellular proliferation, platelet aggregation, glycogenolysis, lipid metabolism, protein catabolism, and glucose tolerance.1,2 Both V1a vasopressin receptor and V1b receptor couple to the Gq protein and act through phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to mobilize intercellular Ca2 ) .1 V2 receptor is expressed in the thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop and the collecting ducts in the kidney. Through V2 receptor, Arg8]-vasopressin stimulates Gs protein and adenylate cyclase to increase cellular cAMP, which stimulates the translocation of aquaporin-2 in the collecting duct, and thereby increases water resorption.1 spontaneously hypertensive rats (stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats) have normal extracellular fluid volumes and become hypertensive on salt loading,16,17 whereas New Zealand genetically hypertensive rats have reduced extracellular fluid volumes and are insensitive to salt loading.18,19 Renin in the granule cells was detected through immunohistochemical study as previously described.22 In a control kidney, renin expression was detected not only in the granule cells but also in the renal tubules.20,23 As neuronal nitric oxide synthase, which is expressed in macula densa cells, and cyclooxygenase-2, expressed in macula densa cells and the thick ascending limbs, also have important roles in tubuloglomerular feedback by producing NO and prostaglandin E2, and stimulating renin production in granule cells,22 we next compared the expressions of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 between wild-type and V1a vasopressin receptor/ mice. In both wild-type and V1a vasopressin receptor/ kidneys, an immunohistochemical study revealed that neuronal nitric oxide synthase was specifically expressed in macula densa cells and cyclooxygenase-2 was present in macula densa cells and thick ascending limbs, but the expressions of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 were weaker in V1a vasopressin receptor/ kidney.20 These findings and those of other previous reports suggest that a blunted ability to regulate renin production in granule cells and the thick ascending limbs due to impairment of both local and central stimulation processes caused the decrease in renin production in V1a vasopressin receptor/ mice, which contributed to their low plasma volume and hypotension. In contrast, the functional role of V1a vasopressin receptor in the kidney has not been fully elucidated even though it has been localized in several regions of the kidney, including thick ascending limbs, collecting ducts, and renal vascular cells.3 As the expression levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 were decreased in V1a vasopressin receptor/ mouse kidneys, we performed in situ hybridization for V1a vasopressin receptor in wild-type mouse kidney to determine whether V1a vasopressin receptor was coexpressed with neuronal nitric oxide synthase or cyclooxygenase-2. V1a vasopressin receptor was detected in the macula densa cells, where it was co-localized with neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, and in the thick ascending limbs where it was co-localized with cyclooxygenase-2.20 This finding suggests that Arg8]-vasopressin regulates neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 through V1a vasopressin receptor at coexpressed cells and that the blockade of V1a vasopressin receptor leads to the suppression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, resulting in reduced renin activity. As aldosterone levels were decreased in V1a vasopressin receptor/ mice, aldosterone release from adrenal gland cells in response to Arg8]-vasopressin stimulation was examined. As in previous reports on human adrenal gland,26 Arg8]-vasopressin stimulated aldosterone release from the dispersed adrenal gland cells of wild-type mice, and this response was inhibited by the V1a vasopressin receptor antagonist, implying that Arg8]-vasopressin mediates aldosterone release from the adrenal glands in mice.27 Supporting this finding, Arg8]-vasopressin-induced aldosterone release from the adrenal gland cells of V1a vasopressin receptor/ mice was impaired, whereas there was no difference in  adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced aldosterone release between V1a vasopressin receptor/ and wild-type mice.27 In addition, increased renal vascular resistance and decreased NO production in V1a vasopressin receptor/ mouse kidneys under  Arg8]-vasopressin  Macula densa V1a vasopressin receptor Collecting V2 receptor cell duct cell  neuronal nitric oxide synthase/NO aquaporin2 cyclooxygenase2/prostaglandin E2  Granule cell  Renin Renin angiotensin system  Body fluid retention  Figure 1 | Schematic representation of the regulation of body fluid retention by vasopressin and vasopressin receptor type V1a and V2. Hyperosmolarity and decreased plasma volume under the water-deprived condition lead to secretion of vasopressin (Arg8]-vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary, which can bind to V1a receptor (V1a vasopressin receptor) in macula densa cells and to V2 receptor in collecting duct cells. Arg8]-vasopressin/V1a vasopressin receptor stimulates the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, leading to the production of NO and prostaglandin E2 by macula densa cells, respectively. Both NO and prostaglandin E2 stimulate renin production from granule cells, and subsequent increases in angiotensin II and aldosterone levels promote water reabsorption. This observation, taken together with the data from this study, indicates that Arg8]-vasopressin can regulate body fluid homeostasis through V1a vasopressin receptor in macula densa cells by activating the renin–angiotensin system and subsequently the V2 receptor–aquaporin2 system, and that Arg8]-vasopressin/V1a vasopressin receptor signaling may have a part in tubuloglomerular feedback (Aoyagi T et al.,20 Figure 1).

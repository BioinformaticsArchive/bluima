Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments, aggregates of phosphorylated protein tau that form, when levels of phosphorylated tau are elevated in the cell [1]. Amyloid plaques are deposits composed primarily of Î²-amyloid insoluble peptides of approximately 4 kDa generated from the precursor amyloid precursor protein, a type Ia transmembrane protein, characterized by a large NH2-terminal extracellular/ cytosolic domain and a small intracellular/luminal COOH terminal domain [2, 3].

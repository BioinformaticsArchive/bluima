18364000	M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages and the related myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key prototypic components of smoldering inflammation driving neoplastic progression. However, mononuclear phagocytes can exert anti-tumor activity by killing tumor cells and eliciting tissue disruptive reactions (macrophages), a likely scenario in the early phases of carcinogenesis of immunogenic tumors and following therapeutic intervention. Hallmarks of cancer-associated inflammation include the infiltration of white blood cells, the presence of polypeptide messengers of inflammation (cytokines and chemokines), and the occurrence of tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. Genetically modified mice and cell transfer experiments have provided direct evidence for the protumor function of myeloid cells and their effector molecules. These results raise the interesting possibility of targeting myelomonocytic cells associated with cancer as an innovative therapeutic strategy. While emphasis has been on the protumor functions of tumor-associated macrophages and on the related myeloid-derived suppressor cells (9), classically fully activated macrophages can exert cytotoxic activity on tumor cells and elicit tumor-destructive reactions centered on the vessel wall. Pro-tumoral function of tumor-associated macrophages Angiogenesis Tumor angiogenesis is often activated during the early preneoplastic stages of tumor development (10–12) and is controlled by a number of positive or negative regulators produced by cancer cells and tumor-associated leukocytes. In general, as for interaction with neoplastic cells, the pro-angiogenic functions of tumor-associated macrophages prevail. In several studies of human cancer, TAM accumulation has been associated with angiogenesis and with the production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (2). tumor-associated macrophages accumulate in hypoxic regions of tumors, and hypoxia triggers a pro-angiogenic program in these cells. Classical or macrophages macrophages are characterized by high capacity to present antigens, high IL-12 and IL-23 production, and consequent activation of polarized type I T-cell responses. They have cytotoxic activity toward tumor cells and toward ingested intracellular microorganisms, by releasing high levels of toxic intermediates: NO, reactive oxygen intermediates, and TNF. Therefore, they are generally considered as potent defensive effectors against the attack of pathogens and tumor cells. Therefore, macrophages recruited in situ represent an indirect pathway of amplification of angiogenesis, in concert with angiogenic molecules directly produced by tumor cells. Strikingly, it was recently reported the hypoxia-inducible factor-1-dependent chemokine CXCL12 (14) acts as a potent chemoattractant for endothelial cells of different origins bearing CXCR4, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is a participant in angiogenesis that is regulated at the receptor level by vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. In agreement with these observations, our data suggest that the angiogenic program established by hypoxia relies also on the increased expression of CXCR4 by endothelial cells (15). In human cervical cancer, vascular endothelial growth factor-C production by tumor-associated macrophages was proposed to play a role in peritumoral lymphoangiogenesis and subsequent dissemination of cancer cells with formation of lymphatic metastasis (17). Additionally, tumor-associated macrophages participate to the proangiogenic process by producing the angiogenic factor  thymidine phosphorylase, which promotes endothelial cell migration in vitro and whose levels of expression are associated with tumor neovascularization (18). A variety of chemokines, including CCL2, CXCL12, CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL13, CCL5 (57), CCL17, and CCL22, have been detected in neoplastic tissues as products of either tumor cells or stromal elements. In addition, tumor-associated dendritic cells have an immature phenotype; various cytokines [macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-colony-stimulating factor), IL-6, IL-10] present in the tumor microenvironment contribute to blocking DC maturation in tumors. Immature myeloid cells are expanded in chronic infections and cancer and act as potent suppressors of T-cell dependent anti-tumor immunity via unbalanced inducible nitric oxide synthase and arginase-1 activity (21). Thus, tumor-associated myelomonocytic cells favor progression by taming and skewing anti-tumor T-cell responses. Transgenic mice carrying the early region genes of human papilloma virus 16 under the control of the human keratin 14 promoter offer a useful model that recapitulates tumor progression of squamous cell carcinoma from hyperplasia to dysplasia to overt malignancy. Innate immunity cells, most prominently mast cells and granulocytes, infiltrate human papilloma virus 16 premalignant tissues, followed by macrophages in carcinoma. By crossing HPV transgenic mice with severely –/– immunodeficient recombination-activating gene-1 mice, it was found that genetic elimination of T and B lymphocytes blocks recruitment of innate immunity cells, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis, with an arrest of the carcinogenesis process at the stage of epithelial hyperplasia (23). Dissection of cells and molecules involved revealed that  B cells, which do not infiltrate the lesions, act as remote orchestrators of the innate immune cells in situ. M2 cells tune inflammation and adaptive immunity and promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and repair. B cells, by causing formation of immune complexes, may contribute from a distance to the M2 polarization of phagocytes, which are set in a tissue remodeling and repair mode and orchestrate the smoldering and polarized chronic inflammation associated to established neoplasia (1, 26). Invasion and metastasis Several lines of evidence indicate that inflammatory cells and cytokines found in tumors are more likely to contribute to tumor growth, progression, and immunosuppression than they are to mount an effective host anti-tumor response (2). Macrophages play an important role in this scenario, as these cells produce a large quantity of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which can promote cancer dissemination and metastasis. A recent report showed that co-cultivation of tumor cells with macrophages leads to enhanced invasiveness of the malignant cells due to TNF-α-dependent matrix metalloproteinase induction in the macrophages (30). Genetic ablation of IL-1β in mice resulted in absence of metastasis development, either with melanoma cell models or with mammary and prostate cancer cells, suggesting the importance of microenvironmental IL-1β. Hiratsuka et al. (33) provided evidence suggesting that primary tumors induce endothelial cell matrix metalloproteinase9 through an interaction between endothelial cells and lung  macrophages, via a VEGFR-1-dependent mechanism. matrix metalloproteinase9 expression in alveolar endothelial cells as well as in tumor-associated macrophages renders the pulmonary metastatic site fertile for secondary malignant cell growth, dependent upon the presence and activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor–VEGFR signaling cascade. tumor-associated macrophages contribute to endothelins production in the breast tumor microenvironment (35), thus promoting an invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells, which is the result of an interplay with other factors, including cytokines, MMPs, and activation of tumor-associated macrophages (36). The ET-1 was reported to activate inflammatory pathways in human monocytes, through the activation of nuclear factor-κB (37), while binding of the ET-1 to ovarian tumor cell lines triggers the activation and stabilization of HIF-1α, which then increases vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and protein levels in these cells (38). Local growth and invasion of solid tumors as well as metastasis depend on the controlled degradation of components of the extracellular matrix. A model by which macrophages promote tumor invasion and metastasis includes expression of their proteolytic activity and subsequent breakdown of the basement membrane around the pre-invasive tumors, thereby enhancing the ability of tumor cells to escape into the surrounding stroma (33). tumor-associated macrophages express molecules that affect tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and dissolution of connective tissues. In lung cancer, tumor-associated macrophages may favor tumor progression by contributing to stroma formation and angiogenesis through their release of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, in conjunction with transforming growth factor β1 production by cancer cells (5). tumor-associated macrophages produce several MMPs (e.g. matrix metalloproteinase2, matrix metalloproteinase9), which degrade proteins of the extracellular matrix, and also produce activators of MMPs, such as chemokines. tumor-associated macrophages also produce factors, such as transforming growth factor β, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, IL-6, urokinase plasminogen activator, and tissuetype plasminogen activator, that may cause degradation of extracellular matrix to facilitate the tumor cell invasion and migration (42). Ahmed et al. (43) described a method to observe the orientation of individual tumor cells as they enter blood vessels, in real time and in a living animal. They found that tumor cells seem to be attracted to macrophages, which line the outside of the vessels. Goswami et al. (44) described a  paracrine signaling loop between tumor cells and macrophages, in which tumor cells secrete M-colony-stimulating factor. This, in turn, causes macrophages to secrete epidermal growth factor, a chemoattractant for the tumor cells. Interrupting either of these signals results in decreased tumor cell motility. Direct evidence has been presented that matrix metalloproteinase9 derived from hematopoietic cells of host origin contributes to skin carcinogenesis (22). Hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer, is a frequent outcome of chronic inflammation triggered by hepatitis virus infection (2), with males being more susceptible to this tumor than females. Thus, carcinogen-induced tissue damage results in myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent activation of Kupffer cells present in the liver. The Kupffer cells produce IL-6, which promotes liver injury, inflammation, compensatory cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis. In females, however, estrogen steroid hormones inhibit IL-6 production in Kupffer cells and thus protect female mice from cancer. Direct and indirect anti-tumor effector mechanisms of macrophages-polarized macrophages  It has long been known that classically activated macrophages macrophages mediate extracellular killing of tumor cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, by damaging vascular cells and activating coagulation, macrophages macrophages can elicit tissue and tumordestructive reactions manifested as hemorrhagic necrosis (49). Macrophages, including tumor-associated macrophages, can mediate antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (50, 51). Galon et al. (55, 56) have ≠ shown that the frequency of CD8 cells is a strong-positive prognostic indicator in colon cancer. These cells exhibit anti-tumor activity as well as elicit specific anti-tumor adaptive immunity, which, in turn, contributes to their macrophages polarization. In established and advanced neoplasia, when persistent tumor cells have escaped the immune attack, M2-polarized macrophages predominate and suppress adaptive immunity, which, in turn, contributes to their M2 polarization. Dual function of macrophages in the context of tumor progression  The results summarized above suggest that while tumor-associated macrophages in established metastatic malignancy are a key element of protumor inflammatory reactions, these cells have the potential to express anti-tumor activity. In early stages of carcinogenesis, innate responses are beneficial and likely involved in the activation of effective surveillance by adaptive immunity as occurs in the elimination of these cells (53, 54). Pharmacological intervention with delivery or release of potent endogenous adjuvants from necrotic cells may also unleash the anti-tumor potential of innate response, as also suggested by recent data on Toll-like receptor polymorphisms and therapeutic response in breast cancer (59). In the context of established malignancy, when tumor cells have escaped immune editing, smoldering inflammation orchestrated by tumor-associated macrophages and by humoral adaptive immunity promotes progression. Therapeutic strategies targeting different sides of the macrophage balance (60) should take into account the dual potential of these cells.

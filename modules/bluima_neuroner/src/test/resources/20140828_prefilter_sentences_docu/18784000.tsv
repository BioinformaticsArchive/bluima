18784000	The Chiralpak IB is tris-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate of cellulose immobilized onto silica and is analogous to the coated Chiralpak OD CSP. The Chiralpak IC is tris-3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamate of cellulose immobilized onto silica. The primary difference between the IA and IB chiral stationary phases is the stereochemistry of the 1 → 4 saccharide bond (alpha for amylose/IA, beta for cellulose/IB), which results in a 0.3 unit difference in the b term for these two chiral stationary phases (presumably there is nominally equal coverage of chiral selector on the silica surface). 1), these differences could be due to different procedures used to immobilize amylose and cellulose. This difference between the IA and IB chiral stationary phases is surprising considering that the primary chemical difference between the IA and IB chiral stationary phases is the stereochemistry of the 1 → 4 saccharide bond (alpha for amylose/IA, beta for cellulose/IB).

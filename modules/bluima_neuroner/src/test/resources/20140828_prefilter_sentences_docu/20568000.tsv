KEY WORDS indocyanine green . thermo-sensitivity . micelle . stability . near-infrared tumor imaging  INTRODUCTION  Near-infrared fluorescence optical imaging has become an increasingly attractive technology for noninvasive disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and drug screening (1). For example, Rodriguez et al. prepared poly (styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) block-poly(styrene) micelles (diameter ∼55 nm) loaded with Indocyanine green and showed that the micelles stabilized Indocyanine green fluorescence with minimal cytotoxicity (21). The size of micelles, approximately 10–100 nm, is small enough to reduce clearance by the reticuloendothelial system and allow for enhanced enhanced permeation and retention effect (27–30). Thus, incorporating Indocyanine green into micelles using a simple aqueousbased preparation method is an advantageous way to deliver Indocyanine green for early cancer detection (20). In this study, we have employed Pluronic F-127 (PF-127, PEO100-PPO65-PEO100) polymeric micelles for Indocyanine green delivery in vivo. Additionally, the thermosensitive micellization property of PF-127 is another advantage for efficient Indocyanine green stabilization and tumor  localization in vivo (32). However, for diagnostic Near-infrared imaging applications, there is a lack of knowledge about the in vitro and in vivo stability of Indocyanine green dye encapsulated in Pluronic micelles. Therefore, to investigate the potential use of micelles for Near-infrared tumor imaging, Indocyanine green was loaded into Pluronic micelles at various concentrations of Pluronic and Indocyanine green and characterized by measuring micelle size distribution, dye loading efficiency, and both aqueous and thermal stability. Förster resonance energy transfer (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) spectroscopy was employed to monitor the release of dye and dissociation of Pluronic micelles in various aqueous solutions in vitro. To determine the circulation kinetics and biodistribution of Indocyanine green-loaded micelles in vivo, free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded micelles were injected in the tail vein of CT-26 tumorbearing mice in each group, and the concentration of Indocyanine green in tumor, plasma and various organs was determined. Finally, a Near-infrared in vivo imaging study was performed to observe the passive targeting of Indocyanine green-loaded micelles to solid tumor. Preparation of Indocyanine green-Encapsulating PF-127 Micelle  A solvent evaporation method was employed to encapsulate Indocyanine green into the micelles after complexing Indocyanine green with Tetrabutylammonium iodide to form a hydrophobic Indocyanine green-tetrabutylamine salt as previously described (21). After 30 min sonication, the Indocyanine green solution was then added dropwise to a stirring micelle solution in various concentrations of PF-127 (0, 2, 10, 20, 30, and 50 mg/mL) to achieve final Indocyanine green concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μM. The chloroform was evaporated off to incorporate Indocyanine green into the hydrophobic cores of Pluronic micelles. Free Indocyanine green was removed using Amicon regenerated cellulose centrifuge filters (MWCO 10 kDa, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the remaining Indocyanine green-loaded micelle solution was rinsed two  times using deionized water. Purified micelles were resuspended in the original volume of deionized water, and lyophilized using a Labconco FreeZone 2.5 benchtop freeze dryer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). Indocyanine green Loading Efficiency and Indocyanine green Content  Lyophilized micelles were weighed and dissolved in 1 mL of dimethylformide, causing complete dissolution of the micelle and release of the encapsulated Indocyanine green. Empty micelles dissolved in dimethylformide were used as a blank for Indocyanine green/ micelle samples. Indocyanine green content was expressed as the weight ratio between loaded Indocyanine green and total weight of Indocyanine green-loaded micelle, and loading efficiency as the weight percent of encapsulated Indocyanine green to total Indocyanine green initially used for encapsulation. Measurement of Micelle Sizes  The effective diameter of the PF-127 micelles prepared at various concentrations of Pluronic and Indocyanine green was measured using a ZetaPlus dynamic light scattering instrument (Brookhaven Instrument Co., Holtsville, NY) at a wavelength of 659 nm with a 90-deg detection angle at both room temperature and 37°C. Aqueous and Thermal Stability of Studies  The stability of Indocyanine green encapsulated within PF-127 micelles was determined by assessing Indocyanine green fluorescence emission over a 10-day period. To compare the fluorescence intensity of free Indocyanine green prepared under the same conditions as micelle-encapsulated Indocyanine green, Indocyanine green solutions were prepared by adding Indocyanine green/Tetrabutylammonium iodide complex into water, and chloroform was evaporated for the same time duration as Indocyanine green-loaded micelles were prepared. The Indocyanine green-loaded micelles were prepared in different aqueous solutions (water, phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4, 50% serum, 5% albumin, and 5% glucose) and then placed in a shaking incubator at either room temperature or 37°C. The micelle solutions were shaken horizontally at 100 rpm in the dark between readings. At predetermined time intervals, 100 μL of free Indocyanine green, unloaded micelle, and micelle-encapsulated Indocyanine green solutions were pipetted into a black 96-well plate with clear bottom, and fluorescence spectra of the Indocyanine green were measured from 786 to 850 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) using a Safire 2 microplate reader (Tecan, Austria) at an excitation of  775 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). The emission intensities of free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green loaded within micelles were compared before and after addition of different physiological solutions. fluorescence resonance energy transfer Spectroscopy  fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles formulated by loading DiI and DiO into PF-127 micelles were used to study the release of coreloaded molecules from micelles in vitro (34). fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles were prepared by the solvent evaporation method as previously described for Indocyanine green-loaded micelles, except a stock solution for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of DiI and 1 mg of DiO in 500 μL chloroform. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair solution was then added to a PF-127 micelle solution (40 mg/mL) to obtain a final composition of 0.15% DiO and 0.15% DiI by weight. For stability studies, micelles were diluted by adding the same volume of water, 2× phosphate-buffered saline, fetal bovine serum, or 10% glucose to prepare 2% Pluronic micelles in various physiological solutions, and placed in a shaking incubator (rpm:100) at 37°C in the dark. At predetermined time intervals, fluorescence spectra ranging from 495 to 620 nm of fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles were obtained on Tecan Safire 2 microplate reader with 484 nm excitation. The fluorescence spectra of lyophilized fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles dissolved in DMSO were compared with those of fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles in water. Cell Lines and Cell Culture  CT-26 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Mediatech Inc, Manassas, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimicrobial at 37°C in 5% CO2. To generate tumors, the back of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice in each group was shaved and 100 μL of single cell suspension containing 2 × 106 CT-26 cells in serum-free RPMI-1640 was injected subcutaneously under  anesthesia. After 7∼10 days, mice in each group were injected with Indocyanine green or Indocyanine green-loaded micelles. In Vivo Study—Circulation Kinetics and Biodistribution  Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded micelle solutions (150 μL) were injected intravenously through the tail vein of CT-26 tumor-bearing mice in each group at a dose of 10 μg Indocyanine green. A second injection was performed with the same dose of Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded micelles. Mice were injected with Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles via double tail vein at total dose of 20 μg Indocyanine green. RESULTS  Characterization of Indocyanine green Encapsulating-PF-127 Micelles  Indocyanine green was converted to the hydrophobic tetrabutylammonium salt and encapsulated into the hydrophobic PF-127 micelle core by solvent evaporation. The loading efficiency of Indocyanine green was calculated by determining the fraction of Indocyanine green content in the micelles compared to the amount of Indocyanine green used during micelle formulation. Efficiency of Indocyanine green loading within micelles was increased with increasing concentrations of Indocyanine green and decreasing concentrations of PF-127. The average diameter of Indocyanine green-loaded micelles was determined to be 20–30 nm at 37°C by dynamic light scattering (Table I). Encapsulation of Indocyanine green does not significantly affect micelle size for PF-127 concentrations above 2%. Indocyanine green concentration during formulation does not affect micelle size within the concentrations tested (5 μM to 20 μM). The absorbance and fluorescence spectra of free Indocyanine green were compared to the spectra of micelle-encapsulated Indocyanine green prepared in various concentrations of PF-127 at 37°C. 1, red-shifts were observed in both the absorbance and emission spectra of encapsulated Indocyanine green (9 nm and 13 nm, respectively), indicating Indocyanine green entrapment within micelle. The encapsulated Indocyanine green is likely uniformly distributed in the Pluronic micelles based on the elevated fluorescence intensity of encapsulated Indocyanine green, and Indocyanine green encapsulation is highly efficient when the concentration of Pluronic is above 1%. To determine whether encapsulation of Indocyanine green dye in PF-127 micelles protects Indocyanine green from degradation, the aqueous stability of Indocyanine green in various concentrations of PF-127 was investigated at both room temperature and 37°C. The fluorescence intensity of free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green encapsulated within various concentrations of PF-127 was monitored in water for 10 days and normalized by the initial fluorescence  Table I Characteristics of the Indocyanine green-Loaded PF-127 Micelles  Indocyanine green/Pluronic F-127 micelle Feed concentration of Indocyanine green (μM) Loading efficiency (%) [a] Indocyanine green content (μg/mg) [b] Micelle diameter (nm) [c] PDI [d]  2% PF-127 0 – – 22.5±0.8 0.068 5 μM Indocyanine green/2% PF-127 5 51.6±0.7 0.1±0.001 22.9±0.9 0.051 10 μM Indocyanine green/0.2% PF-127 10 n.d. n.d. 27.1±1.2 0.130 10 μM Indocyanine green/1% PF-127 10 77.9±1.9 0.6±0.01 28.9±1.1 0.177 10 μM Indocyanine green/2% PF-127 10 72.4±3.5 0.28±0.01 22.6±0.7 0.067 10 μM Indocyanine green/3% PF-127 10 61.4±2.8 0.16±0.01 21.8±1.1 0.067 10 μM Indocyanine green/5% PF-127 10 38.6±3.1 0.06±0.005 19.9±0.9 0.104 20 μM Indocyanine green/2% PF-127 20 78.5±0.6 0.6±0.005 22.1±0.5 0.087  [a] Weight percent of experimental Indocyanine green loading to total Indocyanine green feed (n = 3) [b] Weight ratio between encapsulated Indocyanine green and total weight of Indocyanine green-loaded micelle [c] Effective diameter measured by dynamic light scattering at 37°C with 5 runs per measurements [d] Polydispersity index measured by dynamic light scattering at 37°C n.d.= not determined  intensity of each sample. However, the fluorescence emission of micelle-encapsulated Indocyanine green showed a much slower decrease with time compared to that of free Indocyanine green at both temperatures. The Indocyanine green micelle solutions showed higher stability at 37°C compared to room temperature. Indocyanine green stability was also improved when formulated with higher concentrations of PF-127 micelles; however, there was no significant difference in Indocyanine green stability when the concentration of Indocyanine green used in the formulations is changed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the key parameter for controlling Indocyanine green stability in micelles is the concentration of PF-127 copolymer used in formulations. 1 Absorbance and emission spectra of free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelle prepared with various concentrations of PF-127 and measured at 37°C.  (a)  1.4 2 Relative fluorescence emission of free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green encapsulated in various concentrations of PF-127 micelles over 10 days incubated at (a) room temperature and (b) 37°C (n = 3). Due to this lower initial fluorescence of free Indocyanine green, the decrease of fluorescence seems to be slower than some Indocyanine green-loaded micelles at room temperature. However, the absolute intensity value was much less than that of Indocyanine green-loaded micelles (data not shown). Even after 3 weeks, 5% Pluronic micelles still maintained the same fluorescent emission value as freshly prepared Indocyanine green-loaded micelles (data not shown). The effect of temperature on Indocyanine green stability can be clearly observed by comparing the fluorescence of encapsulated Indocyanine green in 1% PF-127 micelles at both temperatures over 10 days. The fluorescence emission of free Indocyanine green solution decreased by 90% at room temperature, whereas micelleencapsulated Indocyanine green was significantly protected from thermal degradation, maintaining 90% of original emission for 96 h and showing only 48% decrease over 10 days of incubation at 37°C. This indicates higher Indocyanine green stability in polymeric micelles at physiological temperatures due to the temperature-dependent micellization property of Pluronic itself. First, the emission intensities of free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green encapsulated within 2% PF-127 micelles were compared before and after addition of either 5% glucose (injection media), phosphate-buffered saline, or fetal bovine serum. However, encapsulated Indocyanine green in micelles exhibited no significant change after addition of the various solutions, indicating the excellent protection of Indocyanine green from contact with the environmental conditions.

Therefore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy was employed to monitor the release of core-loaded dyes from Pluronic micelle in various physiological solutions in vitro. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair DiO (a green fluorescent lipophilic probe as a donor) and DiI (a red-orange fluorescent lipophilic probe as an acceptor) was loaded into 2% PF-127 micelles, and the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer was confirmed by fluorescence spectra of fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles in water or DMSO measured with 484 nm excitation. Efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer  was observed from micelles in water due to the close proximity of DiO and DiI in the micelle core with highest fluorescence intensity at 585 nm. After micelle disruption by DMSO, fluorescence resonance energy transfer disappeared due to the release of dyes increasing distance between fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair and resulting in only DiO signal at 502 nm (Fig. 4a). The stability of fluorescence resonance energy transfer micelles was then evaluated in various physiological solutions. Efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer, an indication of intact micelles, was observed even after 12 hrs of incubation in water or 5% glucose solution as shown in Fig. Micelles were slightly less stable after 12 h incubation in phosphate-buffered saline solution (Fig. 4c). A significant increase of DiO fluorescence intensity was obtained after 12 h incubation in fetal bovine serum solution, indicating the instability of micelles and faster release of dyes from the micelle core with prolonged incubation in serum (Fig. 4d). However, micelles showed good stability within 2 h incubation in fetal bovine serum solution, implying possible maintenance of micelle stability in blood serum during the 50 min biodistribution study performed in this study. In Vivo Biodistribution Study  The biodistribution of Indocyanine green in tumor-bearing mice in each group was investigated after Indocyanine green or Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles were administered to the tail vein. When Indocyanine green was delivered via Pluronic micelles, the Indocyanine green concentration in the blood was higher (3.8-fold higher at 5 min) than when given as free Indocyanine green solution. The residence time of ICGmicelles within plasma was also enhanced; nevertheless, the Indocyanine green fluorescence intensity is rapidly decreased by 20 min. After the second injection, the fluorescence intensity of Indocyanine green-micelle in plasma was highly increased. In addition, the residence time of Indocyanine green in plasma is notably increased for up to 2 hr with Indocyanine green-micelle-treated mice in each group compared to freeICG-treated mice in each group. Although not statistically significant, a trend of increased Indocyanine green levels in the most of major organs for Indocyanine green-loaded Pluronic micelle system was obtained when compared to free Indocyanine green solution. A significantly higher Indocyanine green accumulation was observed in the tumor when Indocyanine green was delivered via micelle system. Higher fluorescence signals were observed in tumor, kidney, lung, and liver when Indocyanine green was delivered by PF-127 micelles. Tumors from mice in each group treated with Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles showed significantly higher Indocyanine green fluorescence efficiency than tumors from mice in each group treated with free Indocyanine green. These results correlate with values obtained by Indocyanine green extraction (Fig. 5b) and indicate that (i) PF-127 micelles can accumulate in tumors by passive enhanced permeation and retention targeting and (ii) Near-infrared imaging is a reliable alternative method to Indocyanine green extraction for evaluating the Indocyanine green content in tissues. Whole-Body Near-infrared Imaging  Mice treated with free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles were imaged at 36 h and 5 day post-injection with representative images shown in Fig. After 36 h, Indocyanine green was mostly cleared by the liver, and the target tumor was specifically visualized with Indocyanine green-loaded micelles, whereas mice in each group injected with free Indocyanine green solution showed very weak Indocyanine green signal in tumor. From the dissected organs, a high fluorescence signal in tumor was observed 5 day after administration of Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles (Fig. 7b). These results suggest that PF-127 micelle can be an efficient Indocyanine green delivery system for tumor targeting, and also for potential tumor diagnosis for long-term follow-up. DISCUSSION  In this work, Indocyanine green was successfully encapsulated and stabilized within thermosensitive PF-127 micelles. At room temperature, both the hydrophilic EO and hydrophobic PO blocks within a Pluronic molecule are hydrated and are relatively soluble in water, but when temperature is above the critical micelle temperature, the PO block dehydrates and becomes insoluble, resulting in the formation of compact micelles of 20–30 nm size (37). Higher concentrations of PF-127 resulted in smaller micelle diameters with lower loading efficiency, possibly due to less space available for Indocyanine green molecules in the smaller micelles (Table I). At concentrations equal to or greater than 2% PF-127, micelles with good stability are formed. At 2% and 3% PF-127, unimodal distributions of micelles with average diameters ∼20–25 nm are formed.

Larger micelles with higher aggregation number have been found to be more efficient at solubilizing drugs due to their sufficiently larger and more hydrophobic core (38). Indocyanine green encapsulation was confirmed by a red-shift in the absorbance and fluorescence maxima of Indocyanine green-encapsulating Pluronic micelles (Fig. 1). The red-shifts have been previously  reported in other Indocyanine green-loaded micellar systems such as Pluronic F-68,Solutol HS 15 and Indocyanine green-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (13,20,21,39). 6 Detection of Indocyanine green fluorescence in tumor tissues (a) dissected from CT-26 tumorbearing mice in each group at 2 hr after double intravenously injections with free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelle (a) Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of dissected tumors (b) Measurement of fluorescence efficiency using Living Image® software and a ROI tool for imaging analysis (* indicates a statistically significant difference from free Indocyanine green using the student's t-test, p < 0.05, n = 4).

As reported from a previous study, the enhanced fluorescence with a red-shift of the emission peak can be observed when Indocyanine green is embedded at the interface between hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell of micelles (40). Amphiphilic Indocyanine green incorporating into the interface of the surfactant micellar structures of PF-127 can lead to the partitioning of Indocyanine green with reduction of aggregation. Rodriguez et al. obtained aqueous stability of Indocyanine green-loaded micelles over 2 weeks at room temperature, but at body temperature, 63% loss in Indocyanine green emission intensity was observed after 2 weeks (21). However, the thermosensitive PF-127 micelles showed excellent Indocyanine green stabilizing ability at body temperature (Figs. Decreases in Indocyanine green fluorescence intensity during the incubation are likely related to several factors, including micelle dissociation, release of Indocyanine green from the micelles, and the Indocyanine green degradation. After incubation of micelles for 3 weeks at 37°C, significant decreases in micelle size were observed for concentrations of 0.2% and 1% PF-127; in contrast, no significant change in micelle size was observed for concentrations of 2%, 3% and 5% PF-127. The decrease of diameter of micelles can indicate Indocyanine green release. This data indicates that less Indocyanine green is released at concen-  free Indocyanine green Indocyanine green/PF-127 micelle  free Indocyanine green Indocyanine green/PF-127 micelle  free Indocyanine green Indocyanine green/PF-127 micelle  *  free Indocyanine green Indocyanine green/PF-127 micelle *  trations of PF-127 ≥ 2%, resulting in stabilization of Indocyanine green emission intensity. Because micelle stability and albumin binding both result in stabilization of Indocyanine green fluorescence, it was not clear if Indocyanine green fluorescence in Indocyanine green-loaded micelles incubated in serum is preserved because of protection of Indocyanine green by the micelles or due to the release of Indocyanine green from micelles and subsequent binding to serum proteins. Recently, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging method was applied to reveal the release of hydrophobic molecules in vitro and in vivo from poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(D,L-lactic acid) micelles (PEG-PDLLA) (41,42). For a better understanding of Indocyanine green stabilization within Pluronic micelles, the same lipophilic fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair was entrapped into Pluronic micelle cores (Fig. 4). Pluronic micelles loaded with DiO alone or DiI alone excited at 484 nm showed minimal cross-talk and direct acceptor excitation in comparison with fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair within the micelle core (data not shown). These results support the stability of Indocyanine green-micelles shown by fluorescence measurements in Fig. A slight reduction in fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency was observed for micelles in phosphate-buffered saline, despite no decrease in Indocyanine green fluorescence from comparable formulations. One possible explanation is that Indocyanine green may experience a quenching effect in the core of micelle. (a) (a) Representative whole-body Near-infrared images of CT-26 tumorbearing mice in each group at 36 hrs and 5 days after injection of free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelle.

If Indocyanine green is partially self-quenched in the core of micelles, the fluorescence intensity of Indocyanine green can remain relatively constant even when Indocyanine green is partially released from the micelles due to a reduction in dye quenching within the micelle. The observation that no fluorescence change occurred in ICGloaded micelles despite a 25% decrease in absorbance by 9 days (data not shown) supports this hypothesis. In a recent  study, the major factor for the fast disassembly of PEGPDLLA (poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(D,L-lactic acid) micelles in vivo was found to be in blood plasma (34). However, Pluronic micelles were observed to be more stable than PEG-PDLLA micelles because no significant change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer signals was observed in 2 h incubation in serum. The kinetics of Indocyanine green release from PF-127 micelles may therefore be advantageous for tumor imaging applications if micelles  can deliver Indocyanine green to the tumor site within 2 h. Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles are stable for long periods in storage conditions at 37°C but will gradually destabilize and release their contents over the course of several hours in the presence of serum. In our study, higher Indocyanine green fluorescence intensity in plasma was initially observed at 5 min after administration of ICGencapsulating micelles such that initial micelle concentration in blood was >200-fold higher than the critical micelle -6 concentration (CMC, 2.8 × 10 M) (44). However, by 20 min post-injection, both free Indocyanine green and Indocyanine green-loaded micelles were mostly cleared from the blood (Fig. 5). A second dose of Indocyanine green-loaded PF-127 micelles administered 30 min after the first dose significantly enhanced Indocyanine green circulation time in blood. This effect can be attributed to both increased micelle concentration in the blood and a decrease in phagocytic clearance of micelles by the reticuloendothelial system due to saturation of these cells from the initial dose. In addition, the PEG outer shell of PF-127 micelles can sterically hinder interactions with proteins, leading to higher stability and longer circulation time (46). Recently, the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon for removal of PEGylated nanoparticles due to anti-PEG IgM secretion from splenic B cells was reported (47,48). One of the important factors for accelerated blood clearance phenomenon is size, and the accelerated blood clearance was not observed with 9.7–31.5 nm polymeric micelles (49). Due to thermosensitive property of PF-127, ICGloaded micelles show uniform and compact size in 20–30 nm at 37°C. At 2 hrs post-injection, the highest fluorescence signal for both Indocyanine green- and Indocyanine green-micelle-treated mice in each group was in the liver (Fig. 6). This is not surprising, because Indocyanine green is reported to be consumed by hepatic parenchymal cells lining the liver's sinusoids, which then eliminates Indocyanine green from the bloodstream unmetabolized through biliary excretion (43,50,51). Nanoparticles such as micelles are also primarily cleared from the body by resident macrophages in the liver. Although there are several reports on the in vivo biodistribution of Pluronic micelles, the published reports specifically on the biodistri-  bution of PF-127 after intravenous injection are sparse. We observed a similar trend showing slightly higher fluorescence of Indocyanine green-loaded micelles than free Indocyanine green in those organs. The utility of micellar carriers for therapeutic applications is highly correlated to their in vivo stability. In this study, we used live animal optical imaging to demonstrate that PF-127, with its excellent biocompatibility profile, can be administered at sufficient concentration to be used for tumortargeted delivery in a mouse xenograft model (Figs. Tumor localization of Indocyanine green was strongly enhanced after Indocyanine green was encapsulated within PF-127 micelles, consistent with the results of longer circulation of micelles in blood (Fig. 5). In addition, due to the thermosensitive property of PF-127, CMC is much lower at body temperature than room temperature (25°C: 0.555 mM; 35°C: 0.019 mM) (52), resulting in the formation of uniform micelles of 20–30 nm size. In summary, Pluronic micelles are a promising vehicle for Indocyanine green delivery for noninvasive tumor imaging due to their ideal size with narrow size distribution, excellent stabilizing ability at physiological temperature, and prolonged circulation time. Moreover, the surface of the micelles can potentially be engineered for specific purposes such as incorporation of a targeting ligand for active tumor targeting. This study is the first report to demonstrate that PF-127 micelle shows excellent tumor accumulation via enhanced permeation and retention effect for efficient Near-infrared tumor imaging. CONCLUSIONS  The present study demonstrated that encapsulation of Indocyanine green within polymeric micelles formed from thermosensitive PF-127 triblock copolymer showed simple aqueous-based preparation, efficient Indocyanine green loading, small size, stabilized Indocyanine green fluorescence over varied conditions and long time periods, and prolonged circulation time in vivo. Our results suggest the great potential of the PF-127 micelle system to improve noninvasive Indocyanine green imaging for cancer detection and assessment of therapeutic interventions by allowing longterm stability of Indocyanine green in vitro and tumor-targeting in vivo.

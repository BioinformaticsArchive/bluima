20424000	We have now investigated the effects of combination treatment with the oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 and the HER2targeting agents lapatinib or trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells with or without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in gastric cancer cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, but not in those without it. Lapatinib or trastuzumab also induced downregulation of thymidylate synthase expression and activity only in cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and thymidylate synthase depletion by RNA interference also exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. Preclinical studies of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents with gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification are still limited (14–17), with further investigations to clarify the efficacy and mechanism of action of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs being required. We have now investigated the effects of combination treatment  1198 Mol Cancer Ther; 9(5) May 2010  with S-1 (or 5-fluorouracil) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents lapatinib or trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells with or without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, and we have further examined the mechanism of such effects. Human gastric cancer cell lines were obtained from the following sources: NCIN87 from American Type Culture Collection; MKN-1, MKN-7, and AZ-521 from Health Science Research Resources Bank; MKN-28 from Immuno-Biological Laboratories; and SNU-216 from Korean Cell Line Bank. All cells were cultured under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The gene copy number per cell for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization with the use of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu (17q11.2-q12) TetraColor One (5 mmol/L tetrazolium monosodium salt and 0.2 mmol/L 1-methoxy-5-methyl phenazinium methylsulfate; Seikagaku) was then added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 3 hours at  37°C before measurement of absorbance at 490 nm with a Multiskan Spectrum instrument (Thermo Labsystems). Absorbance values were expressed as a percentage of that for untreated cells, and the concentration of tested drugs resulting in 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was calculated. Binding of Annexin V to cells was measured with the use of an Annexin V-FLUOS Staining kit (Roche). The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μL of Annexin V-FLUOS labeling solution, incubated for 10 to 15 minutes at 15°C to 25°C, and then analyzed for fluorescence with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur) and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). The activity of caspase-3 in cell lysates was measured with the use of a CCP32/ Caspase-3 Fluometric Protease Assay kit (MBL). The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with Blocking One solution (Nacalai Tesque) for 20 minutes at room temperature before incubation overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies including those to phosphorylated AKT (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), to AKT (1:1,000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), to phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase; 1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), to E2F1 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), to thymidylate synthase (thymidylate synthase; 1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or to β-actin (1:500 dilution, Sigma). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 1,630 × g for 15 minutes at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 hour at 4°C. S-1 and lapatinib were given by oral gavage daily for 28 days; control animals received a 0.5% (w/v) aqueous solution of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as vehicle. The un-  paired two-tailed Student's t test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in the percentage of Annexin V–positive cells, relative caspase-3 activity, or tumor volume. Results  Synergistic antiproliferative effect of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. We first examined the effect of the combination of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab on the growth in vitro of gastric cancer cells positive or negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and lapatinib exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect (combination index < 1.0) on the growth of cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, including NCIN87, SNU-216, and MKN-7 cells, but not on that of cells without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, including AZ-521, MKN-28, and MKN-1 cells (Fig. 1A and B). A synergistic interaction between 5-fluorouracil and trastuzumab was also apparent in cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those without it (Fig. 1C). The combination of 5-fluorouracil with either lapatinib or trastuzumab thus exerted a synergistic antiproliferative effect in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. Enhanced induction of apoptosis by the combination of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. To investigate the mechanism of the synergistic growth inhibition induced by the combination of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab, we examined the effects of each agent alone and in combination on apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. An assay based on the binding of Annexin V to the cell surface revealed that the frequency of apoptosis was markedly greater for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification–positive cells treated with the combination of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab than for those treated with either agent alone (Fig. 2A and B). Such an effect was not apparent in cells negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. Again, the combination of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab induced an increase in caspase-3 activity greater than that apparent with either agent alone in cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those without it (Fig. 2C). Together, these data thus indicated that the combination of 5-fluorouracil and either lapatinib or trastuzumab exhibits an enhanced proapoptotic effect in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those negative for this genetic change. Downregulation by lapatinib or trastuzumab of the expression and activity of thymidylate synthase in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. To investigate further the molecular mechanism of the synergistic antiproliferative effect of the combination of 5-fluorouracil and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting  Figure 1. Effect of the combination of 5-fluorouracil and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents on the growth in vitro of gastric cancer cells positive or negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. A, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of gastric cancer cell lines. The indicated cell lines were subjected to hybridization with a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ neu probe (orange) and a chromosome 17 centromere probe (green). B and C, gastric cancer cells with or without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification were incubated for 72 hours with lapatinib (B) or trastuzumab (C) together with 5-fluorouracil at a fixed lapatinib/5-fluorouracil molar ratio of 1:10 or a fixed trastuzumab/5-fluorouracil molar ratio of 15:1, after which cell viability was measured. Data are means of triplicates from a representative experiment.  agents, we next examined the effects of lapatinib and trastuzumab on thymidylate synthase expression and activity in gastric cancer cells, given that a reduced level of thymidylate synthase expression has been associated with a higher response rate to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (21, 22). Exposure of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification– positive cells to either lapatinib or trastuzumab resulted in downregulation of thymidylate synthase expression in a concentrationdependent manner, whereas thymidylate synthase expression was not affected by these agents in cells without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification (Fig. 3A and B). Consistent with these results, lapatinib or trastuzumab reduced thymidylate synthase activity in cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those without it (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, lapatinib or trastuzumab downregulated the expression of E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes expression of the thymidylate synthase gene (23), in cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those negative for this genetic change (Fig. 3A and B). To explore the mechanism of thymidylate synthase downregulation by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents, we examined the effects of these agents on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (propidium iodide3K)–AKT signaling pathway as well as on signaling by the mitogenactivated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Immunoblot analysis showed that phosphorylation of AKT in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification–positive cells was inhibited by lapatinib or trastuzumab, whereas phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in these cells was  inhibited only by lapatinib (Fig. 3A and B). Phosphorylation of AKT or extracellular signal-regulated kinase was not affected by either human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agent in cells without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. These data thus suggested that lapatinib and trastuzumab each induce downregulation of thymidylate synthase expression and activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification–positive gastric cancer cells and that this effect is attributable to downregulation of E2F1, possibly mediated by inhibition of the propidium iodide3K-AKTsignaling pathway. Enhancement of 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis by depletion of thymidylate synthase in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. To investigate whether the downregulation of thymidylate synthase by lapatinib or trastuzumab indeed contributes to the synergistic antiproliferative effect of these drugs with 5-fluorouracil in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, we depleted such cells of thymidylate synthase by transfection with an small interfering RNAs specific for thymidylate synthase mRNA (Fig. 4A). Similar to the action of lapatinib or trastuzumab, RNA interference–mediated depletion of thymidylate synthase enhanced the effects of 5-fluorouracil treatment on the number of apoptotic cells and the activity of caspase-3 compared with those apparent in cells transfected with a control small interfering RNAs (Fig. 4B–D).

NCI-N87 or 4-1ST cells were divided into groups for Finally, we investigated the effect of combined treatment treatment with vehicle, S-1, lapatinib, trastuzumab, or with S-1 and either lapatinib or trastuzumab on the the combination of S-1 and either lapatinib or trastuzumab  Figure 2. Effect of the combination of 5-fluorouracil and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents on apoptosis in gastric cancer cells positive or negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. A, cells were incubated for 72 hours with lapatinib, trastuzumab, or 5-fluorouracil at their IC50 concentrations unless indicated otherwise: 0.02 μmol/L, 1.5 μg/mL, and 2.5 μmol/L, respectively, for NCI-N87 cells and 2.0 μmol/L, 200 μg/mL (IC50 not determined), and 4.5 μmol/L, respectively, for AZ-521 cells. The proportion of apoptotic cells was then assessed by staining with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry. B, the proportion of apoptotic cells in experiments similar to that shown in A was determined. C, lysates prepared from cells exposed to drugs as in A for 48 hours were assayed for caspase-3 activity. Effect of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents on E2F1 and thymidylate synthase expression or activity in gastric cancer cells positive or negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. A and B, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of lapatinib for 24 hours (A) or trastuzumab for 48 hours (B), after which cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphorylated (p) or total forms of AKT or extracellular signal-regulated kinase as well as with those to E2F1, thymidylate synthase, and β-actin (loading control). C, cells were treated with lapatinib (1 μmol/L) for 24 hours or with trastuzumab (200 μg/mL) for 48 hours, after which cell lysates were prepared and assayed for thymidylate synthase activity. Data are expressed as a percentage of the corresponding value for control cells and are means ± SEM from three independent experiments. All treatments were well tolerated by (Fig. 5A) or with S-1 and trastuzumab (Fig. 5B) inhibited the mice, with no signs of toxicity or weight loss during the growth of tumors formed by NCI-N87 or 4-1ST cells therapy (data not shown). However, there has been limited examination of HER2targeting agents in gastric cancer models, and most such studies have been restricted to cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. In the present study, we have shown that the combination of S-1 (or 5-fluorouracil) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents exerts a synergistic antitumor effect in gastric cancer cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification but not in those without it. We found  that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents inhibit thymidylate synthase activity as well as thymidylate synthase expression in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification–positive gastric cancer cells, but not in cells without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that transfection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification–positive gastric cancer cells with an small interfering RNAs specific for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 mRNA resulted in marked inhibition of thymidylate synthase expression, whereas transfection with an epidermal growth factor receptor small interfering RNAs had no such effect (data not shown). We previously showed that inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor by epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors results in downregulation of thymidylate synthase and E2F1  Figure 4. Effect of RNA interference–mediated depletion of thymidylate synthase on the proapoptotic action of 5-fluorouracil in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. A, cells were transfected with nonspecific (control) or thymidylate synthase siRNAs for 48 hours, after which cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to thymidylate synthase and to β-actin. B, cells were transfected with nonspecific or thymidylate synthase siRNAs as in A, replated and incubated for 72 hours in complete medium in the absence or presence of 5-fluorouracil at IC50 concentrations (2.5 and 1.5 μmol/L for NCI-N87 and SNU-216 cells, respectively), and then evaluated for apoptosis by staining with Annexin V. C, the proportion of apoptotic cells in experiments similar to that in B was determined. D, cells treated as in B were lysed and assayed for caspase-3 activity after exposure to 5-fluorouracil for 48 hours. Figure 5. Effect of the combination of S-1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents on the growth in vivo of gastric cancer cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. Nude mice with tumor xenografts established by s.c. implantation of NCI-N87 cells were treated for 4 weeks by daily oral gavage with vehicle (control), S-1 (10 mg/kg), or lapatinib (50 × 2 mg/kg, twice a day; A) or by weekly i.p. administration of trastuzumab (20 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; B), as indicated. expression in non–small cell lung cancer cells (29, 30). likely dependent on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, Given that downregulation of thymidylate synthase was induced by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- which is essential for cell survival. targeting agents in gastric cancer cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 am- Downregulation of thymidylate synthase expression has been found to plification and by epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors in enhance the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil, possibly as a direct result non–small cell lung cancer cells, the expression of thymidylate synthase is of the decrease in the amount of this protein target of  5-fluorouracil (31). In the present study, we found that depletion of thymidylate synthase by RNA interference enhanced the induction of apoptosis by 5-fluorouracil in gastric cancer cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, suggesting that the proapoptotic effect of the combination of 5-fluorouracil and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents is attributable to thymidylate synthase inhibition. The abundance of thymidylate synthase in neoplastic cells has been found to increase after exposure to 5-fluorouracil, resulting in maintenance of the amount of the free enzyme in excess of that of enzyme bound to 5-fluorouracil (32–34). Such an increase in thymidylate synthase expression and activity has been viewed as a mechanistic driver of 5-fluorouracil resistance in cancer cells (22, 35–39). Given that the thymidylate synthase small interfering RNAs itself induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification in the present study, the depletion of thymidylate synthase by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents might also contribute directly to the combined proapoptotic action with 5-fluorouracil. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification–positive gastric cancer cell line MKN-7 has been found to be insensitive to trastuzumab. In contrast to their insensitivity to trastuzumab, we found that MKN-7 cells retain sensitivity to lapatinib (IC50 values of >200 μg/mL and 0.99 ± 0.055 μmol/L for trastuzumab and lapatinib, respectively; data not shown). One possible explanation for trastuzumab resistance in MKN-7 cells is activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway (45, 46). MKN-7 cells might prove to be a good model for the study of trastuzumab-resistant cells positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. We found that lapatinib and trastuzumab each inhibit thymidylate synthase expression and activity in MKN-7 cells, likely accounting for the synergistic antiproliferative effect observed with 5-fluorouracil. These data suggest that the synergistic antitumor effect of the combination of 5-fluorouracil and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents is conserved in trastuzumabresistant cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification. In conclusion, we have shown that the combination of S-1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeting agents exerts a synergistic antitumor effect mediated by thymidylate synthase inhibition in gastric cancer cells with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification, but not in those negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification.

21220000	Primary cell cultures of human nasal epithelium (polyps and normal tissues) were compared by investigating the uptake of a fluorescent organic cation, [4-dimethylaminostyryl-N-methylpyridinium (4-Di-1-ASP)]. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to compare the organic cation transporters gene expression levels in the cells. The Km ( M) and Vmax ( M/mg protein/15 min) for 4-Di-1-ASP uptake were higher in normal (Km = 3031 ± 559.6, Vmax = 70.8 ± 8.8) cells compared to polyps (Km = 952.4 ± 207.8, Vmax = 30.9 ± 2.1). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that OCT1-3 and organic cation/carnitine transporter 1-2 gene transcripts were expressed in both normal and polyps cells at comparable levels, with OCT-3 having the highest expression level in both cultures. Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA showed that pH and specific inhibitors had similar effects on both normal and polyps cells (p > 0.5). This study showed that polyps biopsies can be used for isolating cells to study organic cation transporters in human nasal epithelium as no major functional or molecular differences relative to normal cells could be found. Drugs administered via the nasal or pulmonary route are absorbed by passive diffusion, through the paracellular pathway, or transported via drug transporters. The limited passive diffusion and paracellular pathways available for drug transport across the respiratory mucosa imply that endogenous solute carriers often act as drug carriers across the epithelial membranes (Sun et al., 2001; Thwaites and Anderson, 2007; Daniel and Kottra, 2004). These drug transporters are expressed in specific cell membranes of various tissues, where they have pivotal roles in determining the pharmacokinetic profiles  ∗ Corresponding author at: Biopharmaceutics and Drug Delivery Laboratory, College of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Professions, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada. It is therefore important to examine the fundamental differences and similarities between normal and polyps tissues and identify possible implications of using cells from polyps biopsies for in vitro studies (active transport studies). Cell culture  The cell culture method used for the study has been described in detail elsewhere (Agu et al., 2001). Normal nasal epithelial cells were extracted from tissues obtained from patients that underwent endoscopic trans-nasal skull base surgery. cillin 100 IU/ml and used for cell culture. The cells were dissociated enzymatically for a period of 16–24 h at 4 ◦C using 0.1% pronase. The pronase was deactivated with 10% NU-serum prior to cell washing with DMEM-F12 1/1. The resulting suspension of cells was pre-plated on plastic for 1 h at 37 ◦C in a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 environment to reduce fibroblast contamination. Subsequently, the cells were counted and seeded on either 12- or 24-well plates (Fisher Scientific, ON, Canada) for uptake studies. The cells were incubated at 37 ◦C in a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 environment using DMEM F12 supplemented with Ultroser G 2%. Drug uptake studies  Once these cells reached 90–100% confluence at about 21 days in culture, they were washed twice with warm transport medium (37 ◦C) supplemented with HEPES and glucose (HBSS, pH of 7.4). The cells were allowed to equilibrate in the buffer for 30 min in a tissue culture incubator at (37 ◦C, 5% CO2/95%O2). The experiment was brought to an end by removing the test solution and immediately washing the cells three times with ice-cold transport medium. Subsequently, the cells were lysed with 500 l (24-well plate) or 1000 l (12-well plate) of 1% triton X-100 in 0.1N NaOH. Protein content of the cells was measured with Bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.Quantitative and non-quantitative RTPCR Total RNA was extracted from human nasal turbinates using TriZol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were lysed with 1 ml TriZol, followed by the addition of 200 l of chloroform per 1 ml of TriZol and vortexed. Percentage inhibition, effect of pH and comparison of OCT gene expression levels between the normal and polyps nasal cells were performed using Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance followed by Dunn's post-test.

The Km ( M) and Vmax ( M/mg protein/15 min) for 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in cells from normal tissue were 3031 ± 559.6 and 70.8 ± 8.8, respectively. The fact that the uptake of the compound at 0 ◦C was significantly lower than the values measured at 37 ◦C for both normal and polyps cells was an indication that the compound was actively taken up by the cells. At this temperature, the rate of 4-Di-1-ASP uptake was between the values observed at 0 and 37 ◦C, respectively in both polyps and normal cells. Also the compound was taken up by normal cells at 10 ◦C at a rate of 2.8 M ± 0.1/mg protein/15 min compared to 16.9 ± 0.4 M/mg protein/15 min at 37 ◦C (Fig. 1). Therefore, it was important to investigate the effect of pH on the uptake of 4-Di-1-ASP in normal and polyps cells (Fig. 3). Based on the figures, pH-dependent increase in 4-Di-1-ASP was observed between pH 4 and 8.5 for both normal and polyps cells. Based on Kruskal–Wallis analysis, pH significantly affected 4-Di-ASP-uptake in both normal and polyps cells  Fig. However, Dunn's post-test analysis showed that pH had a similar effect on normal and polyps cells within the range of tested pH (p > 0.05). The comparable pH-dependent effect on 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in normal and polyps cells implies that the electrogenic organic cation transporters (OCTN1 and OCTN2) were involved in the uptake of the compound in normal and polyps cells. The specificity of 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in the cells from normal and polyps were compared using organic cation transporters competitive and metabolic inhibitors (Fig. 4). The effect of the inhibitors was comparable in the two cell types. For instance whereas choline caused paradoxical increase in 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in both normal and polyps epithelial cells, there was no statistical difference in 4-Di-1-ASP uptake inhibition by 1 mM tetraethyl ammonium, amiloride and oubain, respectively. Nevertheless, 1 mM verapamil and quinine resulted in significant reduction in 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in polyps and normal cells. Based on Kruskal–Wallis test (p = 0.0075, H = 27.1), and Dunn's post-test analysis for differences in inhibitors/substrates effect in normal and polyps cells (p > 0.05), it can be concluded that these compounds had comparable effects on normal and polyps epithelial cells (Fig. 5). PCR-Quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies  Semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR methods were used to compare the differential expression of OCT1-3, OCTN1 and OCTN2 in cells cultured from normal and polyps biopsies. Gene products for OCT2 were not detected in either normal or polyps cells (not shown). Quantitatively, the OCT isoforms were differentially expressed in the normal and polyps cells (Fig. 6). The order of organic cation transporters expression in the normal cells was as follows: OCT3 OCTN2 > OCTN1 > OCT1 > OCT2. For polyps cells, a similar pattern was observed (OCT3 OCTN2 > OCTN1 > OCT1 > OCT2). Based on quantitative and non-quantitative PCR studies, it may be inferred that OCT2 is not reproducibly expressed in both normal and polyps cells. Although the levels of OCT gene expression significantly varied in both normal and polyps cells (p = 0.0049, H = 23.6), Dunn's post-test analysis did not show a significant difference between the pattern and levels of expression of the various OCT isoforms in normal and polyps cells (p > 0.5). It may also be usefully in interpreting and extrapolating in vitro experimental drug uptake and transport studies generated using polyps biopsies to normal cells. The major parameters used to compare the functional and molecular expression of the organic cation transporters in normal and polyps cells were effect of concentration, temperature, pH and inhibitors/substrates on 4-Di-1-ASP uptake. 1 and 2, 4-Di-1-ASP was actively absorbed in normal and polyps cells in concentration-, temperature-dependent and saturable manner. The higher Vmax and Km values at 37 ◦C for normal and polyps cells compared  to at 10 ◦C (partial active transport) indicates that cells isolated from both biopsies behaved the same way when exposed to different temperatures. Quantitatively, the observed temperaturedependency as exemplified with the uptake of 1000 M 4-Di-1-ASP in polyps cells at 37 ◦C compared to 10 ◦C (4-fold decrease) was comparable to 6-fold reduced uptake observed in normal cells. The effect of pH and inhibitors on 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in normal nasal and polyps cells also yielded comparable results. For instance, concentration-dependent increase in uptake was observed in normal and polyps cells between pH 4.5 and 8.5. The slightly higher, but not statistically significant effect of the inhibitors/substrates in polyps cells relative to normal cells again correlates with the expression level of organic cation transporters in the polyps tissue. tetraethyl ammonium, which has a high affinity for OCT1 and OCT2 transporters did not significantly inhibit 4-Di-1-ASP uptake in both normal and polyps, an indication that the uptake of the compound in both normal and polyps cells was most likely mediated by OCT3, OCTN1 and OCTN2. One of the critical differences between normal nasal mucosa and polyp is the number and cytoarchitecture of the seromucous glands and goblet cells (Bernstein, 2001). This was highlighted by lack of significant differences on the effect of temp, inhibitors and gene expression levels of OCT1-3, OCTN1 and OCTN2 in polyps and normal cells. Nevertheless, it is important to take into account the fact that histochemically polyps may be broadly classified into four groups that include (Pawankar, 2003): (1) esinophilic edematous polyps (edematous stroma with a large number of eosinophils); (2) chronic inflammatory or fibrotic polyps (large number of inflammatory cells mainly lymphocytes and neutrophils with fewer eosinophils); (3) seromucinous gland polyps; and (4) atypical stromal polyps. Although we did not find significant differences between cells from these biopsies and normal cells with respect to organic cation transport, it may still be possible that the expression of organic cation transporters is significantly different in other types of polyps.

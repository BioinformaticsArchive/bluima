Keywords cisplatin; combined therapy; docetaxel; dosing interval; dosing sequence  Introduction  The combination of cisplatin and docetaxel has a high therapeutic effect against nonsmall-cell lung cancer.[1,2] However, the combination of cisplatin and docetaxel causes severe myelosuppression and peripheral nerve injury, limiting its clinical use in many patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer.[3,4] 615  Materials and Methods  Animals and tumour cell line Male ICR (5 weeks old) and C57BL/6N (4 weeks old) mice were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc. Lewis lung carcinoma cells were purchased from Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd (Osaka, Japan). Lewis lung carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high-glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% kanamycin, penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37∞C. LCC cells (3 ¥ 106 cells) were transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of mice 4 days before drug injection. Determination of antitumour effect Four days after subcutaneous inoculation of Lewis lung carcinoma (3 ¥ 106 cells) into C57BL/6N mice, mice (n = 14 per group) were given two cycles of cisplatin and docetaxel 7 days apart.

It has been reported that the antitumour effect of coadministered cisplatin and docetaxel in human cancer cells in vitro is highly dependent on the dosing schedule: inhibition of tumour cell growth was higher when cells were exposed to cisplatin after docetaxel compared with cisplatin and docetaxel simultaneously.[36,37] The enhanced cytotoxicity of cisplatin when administered after docetaxel pre-treatment was attributed to accumulation of intracellular platinum–glutathione complexes, as docetaxel appears to suppress the MRP-1 up-regulation induced by cisplatin exposure,[37] and pre-treatment with cisplatin significantly blocked the subsequent docetaxel-induced apoptosis.[36] The antagonistic effect between docetaxel and cisplatin and the  Control Simultaneously or sequentially docetaxel were / Cisplatin were 12 h apart Cisplatin were / docetaxel were 12 h apart  intracellular cisplatin pharmacokinetics in tumour rather than plasma drug concentrations are likely to have contributed to the difference in antitumour effect between the groups.

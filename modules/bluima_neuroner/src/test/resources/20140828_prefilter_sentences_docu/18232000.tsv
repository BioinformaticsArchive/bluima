18232000	Carotid body contains two basic types of cells: chief cells (or glomus type 1) and sustentacular cells (glomus type 2). Carotid body tumor or paraganglioma arises from the chief cells of the carotid body. DiffQuik stained smears performed for immediate evaluation revealed a very cellular aspirate with single cells, loosely cohesive groups, and cells forming rosettes or acini (Fig. 1). The neoplastic cells had round to oval nuclei with moderate degree of pleomorphism and inconspicuous nucleoli. The Pap-stained smears showed large polygonal cells with abundant fragile granular cytoplasm, fine stippled chromatin, and occasional mitoses (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical stains were performed on the cell block to confirm the diagnosis. The tumor cells exhibited strong positivity for neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin (Fig. 3), synaptophysin, NSE and CD56) and were negative for cytokeratins (CAM 5.2 and cytokeratin-AE1/ 3). Very few cells were positive for S-100 protein. Histopathologic examination revealed the typical morphologic features of a paraganglioma evidenced by nests of chief cells with abundant and granular cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei with moderate degree of pleomorphism, finely clumped and evenly distributed chromatin, and small nucleoli. 1. Diff-Quik stain demonstrating a cellular smear with loose clusters and single tumor cells with mild degree of cytologic atypia (original magnification, 3200). Papanicolaou stain demonstrating a cellular smear, tumor cells with abundant fragile cytoplasm, nuclear pleomorphism, and fine stippled chromatin (original magnification, 3200). Immunostain for sustentacular cells using antibody to S-100 protein revealed marked reduction in staining. Cell block with immunohistochemical stain for Chromogranin demonstrating strong cytoplasmic reactivity in the tumor cells (original magnification, 3400). On cytology smears, the cellularity of a paraganglioma can vary from being markedly cellular to some consisting mostly of blood. The smears are composed of epitheliod type cells and spindle cells with variable degree of pleomorphism. The cells have abundant cytoplasm with indistinct cytoplasmic outlines, and often form rosettes, acini or rounded aggregates called `Zellballen.' However, it has been reported that the staining intensity of sustentacular cells is inversely related to tumor grade,8 i.e., rare positive sustentacular cells in malignant tumors, which was evident in our case. A prominent spindle cell population in smears could lead to the misdiagnosis of sarcoma. The follicular arrangement of the tumor cells may suggest follicular thyroid carcinoma.

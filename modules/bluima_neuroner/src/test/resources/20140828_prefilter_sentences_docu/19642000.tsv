19642000	A number of bacteria well known for their cellulolytic capabilities, and mostly belonging to the order Clostridiales, have been studied (Burrell et al. 2004; Chachkhiani et al. 2004; Lynd et al. 2002; O'Sullivan et al. 2005). The bacteria responsible for cellulose hydrolysis might not have been abundant. The analyses of the performance of the reactor indicated that the decrease in HRT led to the inefficient hydrolysis of solid material, mainly cellulose, the decrease of the specific methane yield by 26%, and the increase of ammonia concentration in the digestates (Lehtoma ̈ki et al. 2007). Members of the Clostridiaceae found in a methanogenic landfill leachate reactor (Burrell et al. 2004; O'Sullivan et al. 2005) and in a thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor digesting wastepaper (Shiratori et al. 2006) are capable of anaerobic cellulose hydrolysis. The Actinobacteria are a group of Gram-positive bacteria, which play an important role in the decomposition of organic materials, such as cellulose and chitin.

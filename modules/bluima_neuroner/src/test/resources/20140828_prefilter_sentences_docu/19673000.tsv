19673000	Among primary liver cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (high liver cancer) represents the major histological subtype, accounting for 70% to 85% of the total liver cancer burden worldwide.76 The most efficient and cost-effective screening techniques in low-resource countries include visual inspection using either acetic acid or Lugol's iodine and DNA testing for human papillomavirus DNA in cervical cell samples.91 Esophageal cancer usually occurs as either squamous cell carcinoma in the middle or upper one-third of the esophagus, or as adenocarcinoma in the lower onethird or junction of the esophagus and stomach.10,96 In the highest risk area, stretching from northern Iran through the central Asian republics to North-Central China, often referred to as the "esophageal cancer belt," 90% of cases are squamous cell carcinomas.97,98 Major risk factors for squamous cell carcinomas in these areas are not well understood, but are thought to include  poor nutritional status, low intake of fruits and vegetables, and drinking beverages at high temperatures.99-101 In low-risk areas such as the United States and several Western countries, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption account for about 90% of the total cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.102 In contrast, rates for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been steadily declining in these same countries because of long-term reductions in tobacco use and alcohol consumption.107 However, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus has been increasing in certain Asian countries such as Taiwan, probably as a result of increases in tobacco use and alcohol consumption.112 A majority of bladder cancers associated with schistosomiasis are squamous cell carcinoma,  FIGURE 13.

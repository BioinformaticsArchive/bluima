18982000	We suggest that the curability of these malignancies results from an intrinsic ‘locked-in’ state of sensitivity to proapoptotic stresses in these cells. A common property of such curable malignancies is that they arise from cells that undergo major genetic rearrangements or recombination as part of their normal physiology. The absence of further genetic and epigenetic changes in genes that regulate apoptosis, DNA repair and senescence allows these cells to maintain their intrinsic sensitivity to chemotherapy. This process allows the cells, when challenged with chemotherapy, to undergo the natural apoptotic pathways that contribute to their intrinsic qualities of chemosensitivity and high curability.

Similarly, in aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma the addition of rituximab to standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone chemotherapy has increased 2-year survival rates from 57% to 70%.2 AN OVERVIEW OF THE BENEFITS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Since the 1950s, chemotherapy has been used successfully to treat solid tumors,5,6 and effective curative treatment can be delivered safely and with acceptable toxicity for most patients with gestational choriocarcinoma, germ-cell tumors,  Hodgkin disease and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Similar high cure rates are seen in advanced testicular cancer and in ovarian germ-cell tumors, where treatment with BEP or POMB-ACE chemotherapy routinely achieves cure rates of up to 90%.9,10 Overall cure rates in patients with Hodgkin disease treated with chemotherapy are also high, at approximately 80%,11 and up to 70% of patients with advanced, aggressive, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who receive rituximab–cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone and chemotherapy treatment can expect to be cured.12 In metastatic solid tumors such as lung, breast, colon and prostate carcinomas, new protocols for combination chemotherapy have achieved increased response rates and lengthened intervals to relapse for malignancies such as breast cancer or small-cell lung cancer,13,14 but, in general, cure remains elusive.15 AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SENSITIVITY TO CHEMOTHERAPY Past experience suggests that the overall responsiveness of a neoplasm to chemotherapy is related more closely to the cell type the tumor originates from rather than to the specific properties and qualities of the drugs employed. With the further addition of adriamycin, and now rituximab, 60–75% of patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma can expect to be cured.12 MECHANISTIC CONSIDERATIONS OF CHEMOTHERAPY SENSITIVITY Given the fundamental difference in responsiveness to chemotherapy of these rare malignancies compared to that of common solid tumors, the key question is how do the qualities of the chemotherapy drugs and the properties of the cell type contribute to the outcome of chemotherapy? Evidence indicates that intrinsic properties of the malignant cell type are the key determinants of curability. Can increased scientific understanding of the processes within these different cell types occuring during malignant transformation and during growth suggest explanations for these very different patterns of response to chemotherapy?

The majority of chemotherapy drugs act as intracellular poisons; they disrupt essential cellular process by inducing various lesions in genomic DNA, inhibiting cytoskeletal activity, or blocking other essential metabolic pathways. These processes are followed by the induction of apoptotic cell death via a cascade that involves multiple intracellular proteins. The key difference between these two groups of malignancies probably lies in the link between the first and second steps— damage to the cell, and induction and execution of apoptosis, respectively. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMOTHERAPY SENSITIVITY AND RESISTANCE Clues as to possible mechanisms that might underlie the intrinsic and enduring sensitivity of specific cancer types to chemotherapy can be gleaned from the observation that during fetal development enormous changes occur in the sensitivity of the developing embryonic cells to chemotherapy agents. At the commencement of embryogenesis fetal cells have extreme sensitivity to chemotherapy agents, as demonstrated by the ability of very small doses of methotrexate (1 mg/kg) to produce either rapid (therapeutic) cell death in ectopic pregnancies,28 or to bring about an elective medical termination within the first 8 weeks  of conception.29 Whilst the majority of cell lines undergo differentiation and their mature phenotype is relatively resistant to DNA-damaging drugs, the three cell types that make up the chemotherapy-curable metastatic solid tumors—testicular and ovarian-germ cell tumors, gestational choriocarcinoma, and highgrade lymphomas—have a very different phenotype. Do chemotherapy-sensitive cells share any common characteristics, what mechanisms are involved in the retention of sensitivity to chemotherapy, and how could these features be exploited therapeutically? We suggest  that these three groups of malignancies have a common property that distinguishes them from other cells in the body, and which is mechanistically linked to these malignancies’ intrinsic sensitivity to chemotherapy; each cell type undergoes complex genetic events as part of its normal physiology at the point of malignant transformation. Interestingly, each cell type undergoes a distinct genetic process: germ cells prepare for meiosis, lymphocytes undergo V(D)J recombination followed by somatic hypermutation, and gestational choriocarcinoma arises from either highly abnormal molar-pregnancy cells or trophoblast cells that are closely related to pluripotent embryonic stem cells. PATHWAYS THAT RESULT IN CHEMOTHERAPY-CURABILITY Germ-cell tumors In testicular cancer, both seminoma and nonseminoma germ-cell tumors arise from spermatogonial germ cells. These cells develop early in embryogenesis and migrate from the primitive streak to the developing gonad by the eighth week of fetal life. In the testis, spermatogonial germ cells undergo mitosis and develop into type B spermatogonia, which are the cells that undergo meiosis to produce spermatids. The initiation of malignancy thus takes place in a cell that overexpresses wild-type p53 and is highly primed to recognize recombination checkpoints that activate apoptosis in the presence of DNA strand breaks.35 This process leads to aberrant reinitiation of the cell cycle, and to genomic and epigenetic instability which, in turn, allows malignant transformation to proceed with loss of expression of some tumor-suppressor genes including RB1, DCC and NME.35 In germ-cell tumors germ-cell-specific DNA repair and damage recognition pathways are also altered. For example sex-determining region Y protein, the product of the sex-determining region Y protein gene,  can bind to cisplatin-induced DNA adducts, which reduces the ability of the cell to repair this damage.36 Other proteins that have altered expression in germ-cell tumors include decreased levels of XPA, a protein involved in DNA damage recognition and facilitation of repair,37 and a high ratio of proapoptotic Bax protein to antiapoptotic Bcl2 protein—a situation that confers a predisposition to apoptosis.38 These and other processes result in a cancer cell phenotype that has high malignant potential, the capacity for rapid growth and for metastasis, yet that still retains intact the facility to initiate apoptosis effectively in response to DNA damage, such as that produced by chemotherapy. The occasional cases of spontaneous regression of testicular cancer might well represent a situation where the balance of activity within the malignant cells swings towards apoptosis, even without administration of DNA-damaging chemotherapy.39 A number of studies have demonstrated that the majority of germ-cell tumors retain intact apoptotic pathways, including expression of wild-type p53, and patients with such tumors respond extremely well to chemotherapy.40,41 By contrast, germ-cell tumors with loss-of-function mutations in p53 are frequently resistant to chemotherapy, and patients whose cancers have this characteristic are rarely cured of systemic disease.42 In summary, in germ-cell tumors malignant transformation occurs in a cell that has been preparing for meiosis. The intrinsic potential of such cells to undergo apoptosis is high and so their threshold for induction of apoptosis is low, even in the absence of therapeutically delivered DNA damage. These cells have wild-type p53, impaired DNA repair mechanisms, intact apoptotic pathways and remain exquisitely sensitive to DNAdamaging chemotherapy. The significance of these intact proapoptotic pathways, in the context of a relative lack of antiapoptotic signals in these cells, has been highlighted by cell-fusion experiments. In these studies, testicular cancer cells were fused to cells derived from a chemotherapeutically noncurable malignancy. The characteristic extreme sensitivity to cisplatin of testicular cancer cells was lost in the fused hybrids, which suggests that this imbalance is an essential feature of the chemotherapy-curable phenotype.43 This ability to replicate rapidly, combined with the powerful effector functions of the immune system, means that cells with nonfunctional receptors must be prevented from further development, and also that potentially autoreactive B and T lymphocytes must be removed. As a result, rapid growth, complex signaling and high levels of naturally occurring apoptosis and cell loss have central roles in lymphocyte development and immune homeostasis.44 In germ cells, malignant transformation leads to just two main types of tumors that have a similar chemotherapy-curable phenotype. The divergent patterns of sensitivity to chemotherapy among B-cell and T-cell malignancies that arise at different stages of lymphocyte development might be closely linked to underlying proapoptotic and antiapoptotic processes. These processes occur at the time of malignant transformation and become a fixed part of the tumor-cell phenotype. Lymphocytes undergo a very different pattern of DNA rearrangement compared to that of germ cells. High-affinity, antigen-specific receptors are produced by recombination of the V, D, and J regional genes of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in B cells and the beta chain of the T-cell receptor in T cells. Recombination of the V and J gene regions also occurs in the immunoglobulin light chains and T-cell receptor alpha chain. After these initial rearrangements, further recombination allows isotype switching (substitution of different immunoglobulin heavy chains that enables, for example, IgM and IgG antibodies of the same specificity to be produced) in the B cell before its final differentiation into an antibody-secreting plasma cell.45 V(D)J recombination takes place early in B-cell and T-cell development and commences at the stage of the common lymphoid progenitor cell.46 These early B cells retain powerful apoptotic pathways to ensure their elimination if an abnormal, nonfunctional receptor  is produced.48 Developmental advantages exist if only cells that have a functional receptor after mutation proceed to the next step in development. At this point further proapoptotic processes trigger apoptosis in cells that do not receive or respond to growth signals, a process termed ‘death by neglect’.51 At the earliest stages of B-cell development, during heavy chain V(D)J rearrangement, if transformation occurs, these malignant B cells form acute lymphocytic leukemia.52 The other main type of chemotherapy-curable B-cell lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Cells with this phenotype can arise from either germinal-center B cells that are undergoing somatic hypermutation, or from mature peripheral B cells. The importance of intrinsic proapoptotic pathways present at the point that malignancy develops is clearly illustrated by the differences in cure rates for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for cancers that arise from germinal-center cells compared with those that originate from mature B cells. Cancers that arise from germinalcenter B cells during somatic hypermutation have a chemotherapy cure rate of 76%, whereas those derived from mature, post-somatic hypermutation B cells are reported to have only a 16% cure rate.55 Key proteins involved in sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the E2F family of transcription factors, NOR1, PDE4B and PKC-B.56 The E2F family of transcription factors are involved in cell-cycle regulation, whilst the proapoptotic NOR1 gene is overexpressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and has a key role in transmission of apoptotic signals from the nucleus to mitochondria.57 The antiproliferative protein PDE4B is overexpressed in noncurable diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acts to limit the activity of protein kinase A. PKC-B is also overexpressed in chemotherapy-refractory  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other B-cell malignancies that are insensitive to chemotherapy.58 This protein is involved in the generation of a proliferative signal following B-cell receptor signaling, whilst in cells that lack functional PKC-B receptor binding leads to apoptosis.59 In contrast to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the B-cell malignancies that usually respond well to chemotherapy but are typically not cured by it (i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma) arise from cells that are not undergoing these genetic events. Chronic lymphocyte leukemia arises from CD5+ memory B cells60 whilst mantle-cell lymphoma predominantly originates from naive B cells in the mantle zone.61 Neither of these cell types are closely associated with V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation or isotype switching. The exception to this hypothesis is follicular lymphoma, which also arises from germinal-center B cells. Although follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma both arise from B cells at similar stages of development, these neoplasms differ considerably in their expression of different components of proapoptotic pathways and this discrepancy may explain their different responses to chemotherapy. Interestingly, our own data show that p53BP2 is rarely subject to transcriptional silencing in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (T Crook, unpublished data). The origin of the malignant cells that give rise to Hodgkin lymphoma has been an area of interest for a long time. Most authorities now generally accept that Hodgkin disease shares many characteristics with B-cell lymphoma, and that transformed cells evade V(D)J rearrangement and somatic mutation in the VH genes.63 Hodgkin lymphoma has a similar cellular origin to that seen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma—the B-cell germinal center—and so, unsurprisingly, is also highly curable with conventional chemotherapy. At the far end of the B-cell malignancy spectrum lies multiple myeloma, which is a malignancy of plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B cells. These cells are most distant from the key genetic recombinations in B-cell development and also lack the activated proapoptotic pathways of developing lymphocytes.64 The results of chemotherapy in myeloma are improving, but in  contrast to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, myeloma shares the lack of long-term response to chemotherapy treatment seen in most other common malignancies.65 T-cell lymphomas are less common than B-cell lymphomas; however, they also show significant variation in their overall sensitivity to chemotherapy. Malignancies of mature, terminally differentiated, effector T cells, such as CD4+ mycosis fungoides and CD8+ Lennert lymphoma, are characterized as indolent, incurable malignancies with only modest responses to chemotherapy.66,67 By contrast, large cell lymphomas that are positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase, which have a cure rate of 80%, arise from T cells that have undergone V(D)J recombination but fail to express functional T-cell receptors.68,69 These cells are characterized by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) reciprocal translocation that forms the nucleophosmin–anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion protein, which has tyrosine kinase activity and leads to proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and changes in morphology of the transformed cells. In T-cell development, the inability to produce a functional T-cell receptor after V(D)J rearrangement usually triggers apoptosis. In anaplastic large-cell lymphoma apoptosis may be held in check by the antiapoptotic activity of nucleophosmin–anaplastic lymphoma kinase. Similar to the situation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the addition of chemotherapy-induced DNA damage alters this balance strongly towards apoptosis and probably contributes to the high degree of curability of this uncommon malignancy. The cells in a complete molar pregnancy are genetically very different to any other cell type; they only contain genetic information from the father, from either one or two spermatozoa; the maternal nucleus is lost at or before conception. These cells express high levels of functional wild-type p53, have a high Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis than those in a normal placenta.71 The second predominant form of trophoblastic tumor is gestational choriocarcinoma, which arises from previously normal trophoblast cells within the placenta. These cells have the normal complement of chromosomes, one set from each parent, and develop a de novo malignancy in a similar manner to standard adult tumor cells. Trophoblast cells perform a number of complex roles throughout pregnancy. Early on the trophoblast cells differentiate and invade into the myometrium, during pregnancy they are involved in continuous remodeling of the placenta, and at the time of delivery these cells undergo apoptosis.73 A number of proapoptotic pathways are upregulated in trophoblast cells at different times in their development, these pathways involve caspases, interactions between Fas and its ligand, and XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinassociated factor 1). The expression of these proteins is regulated by inhibitors of apoptosis including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein).74–76 As such, in a situation mechanistically similar to that in spermatogonia and developing lymphocytes, trophoblast cells are poised between the effects of powerful, conflicting proapoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways that are already activated. THERAPEUTIC ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE A PROAPOPTOTIC STATE IN TUMOR CELLS A large body of experimental and correlative clinical evidence has established the key role of apoptotic pathways in causing cell death in response to chemotherapy. As such, reinstating or upregulating these proapoptotic mechanisms in malignant cells is an attractive therapeutic concept. To date, the majority of studies have looked at the introduction of functional p53 into cancer cells either by virus-mediated gene transfer or translocation of peptides.77,78 The first problem is the difficulty of achieving adequate gene or protein delivery to tumor cells in vivo. The second, more fundamental problem, is that restoring the presence of intracellular p53 is only one part of the complex apoptotic mechanisms found in chemotherapycurable malignancies. As we have discussed, the tumor cell lineages that are sensitive to chemotherapy are also genetically, epigenetically and/or phenotypically highly dissimilar to other cells, as they are poised to undergo apoptosis as part of their normal physiology. Their complex proapoptotic status is maintained after malignant transformation, which accounts for the high levels of curability with chemotherapy in malignancies derived from these cells. As a result, replacement of p53, which is only one of the components of the apoptosis system in cells that otherwise lack much of the rest of the mechanism, is in itself unlikely to dramatically change the cells’ phenotype of response to chemotherapy.78 However, despite intense clinical research activity over the past 50 years, an increased understanding of malignant processes, and the influence of work within the last few years, such as the description of cancer stem cells, many of the common advanced malignancies remain incurable with chemotherapy. We have proposed a hypothesis as to why the chemotherapy-curable tumors, and the stem cells from which they arise, are so persistently sensitive to current drug treatments, whereas tumor stem cells of other neoplasms remain ultimately resistant to chemotherapy. Herein, we have sought to identify characteristics shared by the chemotherapy-curable cancers, and to incorporate these features into existing models of cell death induced by cytotoxic drugs. The pathways we have cited control the proliferation of cells at critical developmental points and remove cells with unwanted genetic changes. Given the increasing evidence that acquired drug resistance is mediated predominantly by epigenetic changes in the cancer-cell population following challenge with cytotoxic agents, further exploration of why the curable cancers evidently lack this epigenetic plasticity and avoid the acquisition of a drug resistant phenotype will produce interesting results. With the increasing clarification of the complex nature of the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways that exists in the chemotherapy-curable malignancies, it would seem optimistic that replacement of only one component in cells that are otherwise not primed for apoptosis would radically alter their overall response to one of curability. The prospect of treatment with agents that modify the epigenetic silencing of such genes, which could restore sensitivity to apoptosis in drug-resistant cancer cells, is exciting.

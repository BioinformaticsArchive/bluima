17605000	Oxidative stress is one of the earliest events Alzheimer disease pathology seen in susceptible neurons. The generation of reac- normal mitochondria, redox transition metals, and tive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species) and its consequent cellular other factors. Previously, we demonstrated that mitochondrial-derived lysosomes and lipofuscin deposits of various densities and sizes were prominent and unchanging features of neuronal abnormalities [14] . Different stages of mitochondrial abnormality, such as formation of mitochondrialderived lysosomes and lipofuscin, were evident in almost all Alzheimer disease neurons [14]. Studies examining the presence of mitochondrial DNA in Alzheimer disease neurons have further shown that mitochondria are degraded in Alzheimer disease [15] . Quantitative morphometric measurements of the percentage of the different types of mitochondria (normal, partially damaged, and completely damaged) confirm that neurons in Alzheimer disease show a significantly lower percentage of normal mitochondria and a  significantly higher percentage of the completely damaged mitochondria compared to an aged-matched control group. The following is a ranking of factors which likely contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer disease : 1) Low vascular blood flow is a prominent feature of the brain during chronic hypoxia/hypoperfusion and has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer disease [16] ; 2) Many more sporadic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA control region, with some being unique to Alzheimer disease, were found in Alzheimer disease patients compared to controls, which is associated with deleterious functional consequences for mitochondrial homeostasis once they reach a critical mass in postmitotic cells in the brain [17] ; 3) Amyloid-b and the majority of amyloid-b protein precursor processing machinery are found in mitochondria [18,19]. Recently, we showed that RNA-bound iron plays a pivotal role for RNA oxidation in vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer disease [27] . We observed that the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons showed significantly higher redox activity and iron staining than age-matched controls. ribosomal RNA, extremely abundant in neurons, was considered to provide the greatest number of iron binding sites among cytoplasmic  RNA species. These results suggest that ribosomal RNA provides a binding site for redox-active iron and serves as a redox center within the cytoplasm of vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer disease in advance of the appearance of morphological changes indicating neurodegeneration [27]. The entry of copper to the brain is mainly mediated by ceruloplasmin, a copper binding protein that plays a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress. While ceruloplasmin is increased in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer disease [28] , neuronal levels of ceruloplasmin remain unchanged [29]. Thus, while increased ceruloplasmin may indicate a compensatory response to increased oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease, its failure to do so in neurons may play an important role in metalcatalyzed damage [29]. However, this is now far more controversial, and in fact, it appears more likely that oxidative damage associated to Alzheimer disease elicits compensatory mechanisms, such as Amyloid-b deposition and hyperphosphorylated tau, that restore redox balance in an attempt to avoid neuronal death [31]. Amyloid-b was commonly considered a dangerous byproduct of amyloid-b protein precursor processing, despite the fact that this peptide is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of healthy individuals throughout life [32] . Recently, Kamenetz et al. [33] reported that Amyloid-b is secreted from healthy neurons in response to activity and that Amyloid-b, in turn, downregulates excitatory synaptic transmission. This negative feedback loop provides a physiological homeostatic mechanism aimed to maintain normal levels of neuronal activity. Previous studies also suggest that Amyloid-b might act as a regulator of ion channel function in neurons [34, 35]. An antioxidant role for Amyloid-b in vivo is in agreement with recent data on the distribution of oxidative damage to Alzheimer disease neurons. As said above, 8OHG markedly accumulates in the cytoplasm of cerebral neurons in Alzheimer disease. However, as Amyloid-b increases in the Alzheimer disease cortex, there is a decrease in neuronal levels of 8OHG, i.e., decreased oxidative damage [36, 37]. It induces peroxidation of membrane lipids [45] and lipoproteins [46], generates H2O2 [47] and hydroxynonenal [48] in neurons, damages DNA [49] and inactivates transport enzymes [50]. Furthermore, AGEs and Amyloid-b activate specific receptors such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products and the class A scavenger-receptor to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species production and modulate gene transcription of various factors involved in inflammation through NFκB activation [76, 77]. Activated microglia/astrocytes  Similar to situations in the periphery where damaged tissue and the chronic presence of inert abnormal materials cause inflammation, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and injured neurons may well provoke inflammation in the Alzheimer disease brain. Indeed, both microglia and astrocytes cluster at sites of Amyloid-b deposition [78, 79]. Astrocytes, and to a lesser extent, neurons, are also capable of expressing a wide range of inflammatory mediators, including complement, cytokines and cyclooxygenase [80] . Obviously, the secretion of reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species by inflammatory cells is a major mechanism for attacking opsonized targets, and activated microglia/ astrocytes have the potential to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species by various mechanisms. Amyloid-b peptide can also directly activate the NADPH oxidase of microglia, which results in a burst of superoxide radicals and increased production of hydrogen peroxide [81,82] . Not surprisingly, microglial expression of NADPH oxidase subunit p22-phox is enhanced in Alzheimer disease brain [80] , implicating increased microglial respiratory burst activity. Following induction of the iNOS gene, activated microglia and astrocytes can produce large amounts of nitric oxide, which in turn can react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, leaving nitrotyrosine as an identifiable marker. Increased expression of iNOS is also detected in astrocytes surrounding plaques in Alzheimer disease brain [85, 86]. Another free-radical-generating mechanism in Alzheimer disease microglia involves the enzyme myeloperoxidase, and there is evidence that myeloperoxidase immunoreactivity is present in selective highly activated microglia around amyloid plaques in the Alzheimer disease brain and that Amyloid-b aggregates increase myeloperoxidase messenger RNA showed expression in microglia-like cells in vitro [87] . myeloperoxidase catalyzes a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and chloride to form hypochlorous acid, which can further react with other molecules to generate other reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl ions. Proteolysis dysfunction  Cells possess a remarkable and complex intracellular organization, which guarantees, among other things, that the potentially harmful and irreversible processes of proteolysis remain restricted to certain compartments such as the proteasome and lysosome. The degradation of non-functional, oxidized proteins is an essential part of the antioxidant defenses of cells. The proteasome is a large intracellular protease (26S) with more than 60 subunits that is principally responsible for the turnover of most short-lived, misfolded, oxidized and truncated proteins, which involves  ubiquitination of target proteins through sequential steps [90] . The 26S proteasome contains a core catalytic complex (i.e. , 20S) with multiple active sites and two distally positioned regulatory complexes (i.e., 19 S). Further studies demonstrate disease-specific alterations in the level and distribution of proteasomal subunits and deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCH-L1) [94] and decreased proteasome activity in the Alzheimer disease brain [95] . In fact, inhibition of proteasomal activity, in many regards, recapitulates neuropathology and neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo similar to that observed in Alzheimer disease [96,97]. Interestingly, chronic lowlevel proteasome inhibition, in addition to increased protein insolubility, induces elevated levels of protein oxidation and dramatically inhibits the activity of mitochondrial complexes I and II and alters specific aspects of mitochondrial homeostasis and turnover in neuronal cells [98–100], which could potentially proceed in a feed-forward fashion and greatly add to the oxidative burden observed in Alzheimer disease brain. Autophagic degradation of iron-containing proteins such as ferritin and mitochondrial electron-transport complexes results in the intralysosomal occurrence of redox-active low molecular weight iron [101], which can result in lysosomal oxidative stress with consequent membrane labilization and rupture [102] . Therefore, the release of lysosomal contents, including redox-active iron, not only directly adds to the oxidative stress but also induces mitochondrial damage with secondarily enhanced production of reactive oxygen species [103] . In fact, studies using antibodies to lysosomal hydrolases reveal striking intracellular and extracellular manisfestations of altered lysosomal function, including elevated acid hydrolase-containing compartments in atrophic and degeneratingneuronsortheirprocesses[104–108].In a recent study, Nixon and colleagues [109], using immunogold labeling with compartmental markers and electron microscopy on neocortical biopsies from Alzheimer disease brain, identified autophagosomes and other prelysosomal autophagic vacuoles in Alzheimer disease brains, particularly within neuritic processes, including synaptic terminals. Lysosomes also gradually accumulate non-degradable, polymeric lipofuscin, which is believed to be a result of not only continuous oxidative stress, causing oxidation of mitochondrial constituents  and autophagocytosed material, but also of the inherent inability of cells to completely remove oxidatively damaged structures [110, 111]. In this regard, it is likely not coincident that neurons showing increased oxidative damage in Alzheimer disease also have a striking and significant increase in mitochondrial DNA in neuronal cytoplasm and in vacuoles associated with lipofuscin [15], the proposed site of mitochondrial degradation by autophagy [112] . Electron microscopic analysis also shows that cytochrome oxidase-1, a mitochondrial protein, is increased in the cytosol and is associated with mitochondria undergoing phagocytosis. These observations highlight the interrelated nature of lysosomal and mitochondrial damage which may irreversibly lead to functional decay of neuronal cells (for review see [111]). Nonetheless, the overall result is damage, including advanced glycation end products [113], nitration [83, 84, 114, 115], lipid peroxidation adduction products [116 – 122] as well as carbonyl-modified neurofilament protein and free carbonyls [68, 113, 122–125], with the involvement extending beyond the lesions to neurons not displaying obvious degenerative change.

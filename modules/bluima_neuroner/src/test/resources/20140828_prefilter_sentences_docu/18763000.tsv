18763000	Influence on the Aspergillus-polymerase chain reaction yield of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid volume, cellular count and DNA content  E. Cytological data (cellularity and formula) were collected when available. Assessment of bronchoalveolar lavage quality  As bronchoalveolar lavage composition (alveolar macrophages, ciliated cells, mucus, total cellularity etc.) reflects bronchoalveolar lavage quality [25], we analysed bronchoalveolar lavage using the following indicators: (i) volume recovered for analysis, which could be associated with the sample quality [30]; (ii) total cellularity and detailed cell count, which reveal potential contamination by proximal airways or terminal bronchioles [25]; and (iii) human βglobin gene quantification by real-time polymerase chain reaction, which could reflect high cellularity of the bronchoalveolar lavage and confirm a good quality of DNA extraction, required to perform an efficient polymerase chain reaction reaction. For cell count analysis, alveolar macrophages under 80%, lymphocytes over 15% and neutrophils or bronchial cells over 10% were considered as abnormalities in the bronchoalveolar lavage formula according to the published data [25, 30]. Statistical methods  The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the duration of the antifungal treatment, bronchoalveolar lavage volume recovered, total cellularity and the β-globin level medians between invasive pulmonary aspergillosis patient subgroups classified according to their positive or negative result for direct examination/culture, Galactomannan and polymerase chain reaction.

Alveolar micro-environment: evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage quality and influence on Aspergillus detection  The volume recovered for analysis, total cellularity, detailed cell count (when available) and human β-globin gene quantification by real-time polymerase chain reaction were used as indicators of bronchoalveolar lavage quality (Table 1). bronchoalveolar lavage abnormalities of cell analysis were more frequent in patients without invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, especially due to an increase in lymphoplasmocyte or neutrophil counts (Table 3), and probably related to the underlying haematological disease or to a non-fungal infection (e.g. bacterial). In terms of bronchoalveolar lavage quality, there was no significant difference between the proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and no invasive pulmonary aspergillosis patient groups (P > 0.05, Table 3), even if large variations of volume recovered, total cellularity and β-globin individual values were observed. In patients with proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the medians of the volume recovered, total cellularity and β-globin levels between negative and positive subgroups for each test (direct examination/ culture, Galactomannan detection, polymerase chain reaction) were compared (Table 3). The volume recovered and cellularity were not significantly different in the positive and negative subgroups for any of the three tests (P > 0.05, Table 3). This excellent specificity agrees with the most recent polymerase chain reaction studies on bronchoalveolar lavage [16, 21, 26] and could result from the development of real-time polymerase chain reaction assays that have decreased the risk of contamination [36]. Alveolar micro-environment: evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage quality and influence on Aspergillus detection  Among the criteria analysed, β-globin seems to be the most discriminating, significantly related to an increased Aspergillus detection by direct examination/culture or polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that a high cellularity (reflected by a high β-globin level) could increase conidia, hypha and DNA detection. The absence of the influence of β-globin on Galactomannan detection in bronchoalveolar lavage supernatants could also result from its release in the alveolar micro-environment during growth [7], reducing the impact of cell-recovering efficiency during bronchoscopy on its detection. Detection in the cell pellet of conidia, hyphae (by direct examination/ culture) and fungal DNA (by polymerase chain reaction) results from their presumed localisation in phagocytes. As suggested by previous studies using cell pellets to detect DNA [15–20, 29] and by a recent study comparing the detection of fungal DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage pellets and supernatants [33], the major localisation of fungal DNA is probably conidia and hypha, in bronchoalveolar lavage pellets, rather than free in bronchoalveolar lavage supernatants, released by live and dead fungal material. Even if cellularity followed the same trend as β-globin quantification (higher in polymerase chain reaction-positive and in Galactomannan-negative subgroups), there was no significant difference between subgroups when volume and cellularity were analysed (Table 3). The accuracy of β-globin quantification could result from both biological and technical criteria, including cellularity, centrifugation of bronchoalveolar lavage, efficiency of DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction method and the absence of inhibitors. Contrarily to cellularity, β-globin levels could be less influenced by cell lysis during the handling of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, whereas nuclear DNA remains in the pellet and seems more reliable to control the yield of the bronchoalveolar lavage.

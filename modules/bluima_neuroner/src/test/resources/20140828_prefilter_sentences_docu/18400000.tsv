Abstract Matrix metalloproteinases play pivotal roles in inflammatory diseases including chronic periodontitis. The effects of Prevotella intermedia, a major periodontal pathogen, on matrix metalloproteinase-9 production in primary human periodontal ligament cells were examined in the present study. In contrast, Porphyromanas gingivalis ATCC 33277 supernatants, Escherichia coli lipopolysacchride and IL-1β exhibited no stimulatory effects on matrix metalloproteinase-9 production in human periodontal ligament cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinases [mitogen-activated protein kinase, including extracellular signal-related kinases, c-jun N-terminal kinases and p38] inhibitors exerted no effect on the P. intermedia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, indicating that P. intermedia induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 production through an MAPKindependent pathway. Our results demonstrated that P. intermedia may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction during chronic periodontitis by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 production in human periodontal ligament cells. The periodontal tissue destruction observed in periodontitis is mostly host mediated through inflammatory cytokines and proteinases released by immune cells and activated local resident cells in response to periodontal pathogens and their products/metabolites (Darveau et al., 1997). Matrix metalloproteinases are a group of zincand calcium-dependent proteinases capable of degrading extracellular matrix and basement membrane components. Matrix metalloproteinases produced by host cells, together with other  proteinases, are responsible for the connective tissue destruction in periodontitis (Birkedal-Hansen, 1993; Sorsa et al., 2004, 2006). Prevotella intermedia induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in human gingival  epithelial cells (Sugiyama et al., 2002) and human periodontal ligament cells (Yamamoto et al., 2006). As periodontal ligament cells are the major constituents of the periodontium and they are highly affected during periodontitis, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of P. intermedia on matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells and to explore the possible roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 production. The cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. After reaching confluence, the cells were  detached with 0.25% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA and subcultured at a 1 : 2 ratio. Cell toxicity test The toxicity of the P. intermedia supernatant on human periodontal ligament cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Briefly, passage 7 human periodontal ligament cells were trypsinized and cell density was adjusted to 0.5  105 cells mL1. An aliquot of 200 μL of the cell suspension was seeded into wells of 96-well plates (1  104 cells well1). After 24 h of attachment, the culture medium was discarded and the cells were treated with various concentrations (1–20%) of P. intermedia supernatant. Treatment of human periodontal ligament with bacterial supernatants and other reagents The human periodontal ligament cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1  105 cells mL1 and were allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium until confluence. The cells were then silenced overnight with phenol and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells without treatment and cells treated with denatured P. intermedia supernatant (boiled at 100 °C for 20 min) served as controls. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and in three cell lines. To examine the possible roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in P. intermedia-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, human periodontal ligament cells were preincubated with specific extracellular signal-related kinases, jun N-terminal kinases and p38 inhibitors U0126, SP 600125 and SB 239063 (all at 20 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h before 5% P. intermedia supernatant stimulation. The final concentration of dimethysulfoxide did not exceed 0.2%, which showed no toxicity to human periodontal ligament cells. In order to rule out the possible effects of dimethysulfoxide on  matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, 0.2% dimethysulfoxide was also added to the control cells. Reverse transcriptase-PCR Total RNA from human periodontal ligament cells (cultured for 6 h with or without 5% P. intermedia supernatant treatment) was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols and was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260/ 280 nm. Results  Cytotoxicity of P. intermedia on human periodontal ligament cells The cytotoxicity of P. intermedia supernatant on human periodontal ligament cells was determined by MTT assay. Different concentrations of P. intermedia (1–20%) were added to the culture media after the cells were attached. 1, the number of human periodontal ligament cells slightly increased when they were treated with 1–2% P. intermedia supernatant (P > 0.05). A 5% addition of the supernatant had neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects on cell growth. However, 10% P. intermedia supernatant exhibited a slight inhibitory effect on human periodontal ligament cell growth (P > 0.05) and 20% supernatant significantly inhibited the growth of the cells (P < 0.05). As 5% was the highest dosage that exerted no influence on human periodontal ligament cell growth, we used this concentration in the following experiment. Induction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells Protein secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in conditioned culture media was measured by gelatin zymography. We first stimulated the human periodontal ligament cells with 5% P. intermedia supernatant, 5% P. gingivalis supernatant, E. coli lipopolysacchride and recombinant human IL-1β for 24 h. At 24 h, P. intermedia induced a strong matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells. 1. Cytotoxicity of Prevotella intermedia supernatant to human periodontal ligament cells determined by MTT assay. human periodontal ligament cells were treated with 1–20% P. intermedia supernatant for 24 and 48 h. Prevotella intermedia supernatant at 20% showed significant toxicity to human periodontal ligament cells (P < 0.05). intermedia stimulation, matrix metalloproteinase-9 was secreted into the culture media by human periodontal ligament cells (Fig. 3a, lane 3). Regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression by Prevotella intermedia supernatant (5%), Porphyromanas gingivalis supernatant (5%), Escherichia coli lipopolysacchride (20 μg mL1) and IL-1β (10 ng mL1) in human periodontal ligament cells. human periodontal ligament cells were treated with the indicated stimulants and the conditioned culture media were subjected to gelatin zymography. A strong dose-dependent induction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression was observed: 10% P. intermedia induced the strongest matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells (Fig. 3c). 4, although inhibitors SB 239063 and SP 600125 showed a slight stimulatory effect on matrix metalloproteinase-9 production in human periodontal ligament cells, the extracellular signal-related kinases inhibitor U0126, jun N-terminal kinases inhibitor SP 600125 and p38 inhibitor SB 239063 did not show inhibitory effects on P. intermedia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells. matrix metalloproteinase-9 was not expressed in control human periodontal ligament cells. 3.

Effects of Prevotella intermedia on matrix metalloproteinase-9 mRNA expression by human periodontal ligament cells. Discussion The novel finding of the present study is that P. intermedia supernatant can time- and dose-dependently induce expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human periodontal ligament cells. These findings suggested that the ability to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells is not a common characteristic to all periodontal pathogens but limited to certain strains such as P. intermedia. A periodontal pathogen can directly cleave the extracellular matrix constituents of the periodontium by proteinase and endotoxins, and indirectly destroy the periodontal tissues  through one or more of the five distinct host degradative pathways (MMP pathway, plasminogen-dependent pathway, phagocytic pathway, PMN-serine proteinase pathway and osteoclastic bone resorption) (Birkedal-Hansen, 1993). In the present study, we showed that human periodontal ligament cells constitutively expressed MMP-2. Chang et al. (2002) stimulated the human periodontal ligament cells with P. gingivalis for 8 days. Pattamapun et al. (2003) treated human periodontal ligament cells for 48 h and they used a different bacterial strain (P. gingivalis W50). In contrast, we treated the human periodontal ligament cells for only 24 h, which might be too short for P. gingivalis to produce stimulatory effects on MMP-2 production. Second,  the cell lines used were different. Zhou & Windsor (2006) used human gingival fibroblasts, which might show a different MMP expression pattern from human periodontal ligament cells. Bodet et al. (2007) stimulated gingival fibroblasts with lipopolysacchride preparation while we treated human periodontal ligament cells with P. gingivalis supernatant, which might also produce different effects on MMP-2 production. We also tested the effects of E. coli lipopolysacchride on matrix metalloproteinase-9 production by human periodontal ligament cells and found that lipopolysacchride did not stimulate matrix metalloproteinase-9 production. Prevotella intermedia cell extracts and lipopolysacchride, by contrast, can increase MMP-2 and/or matrix metalloproteinase-9 production by human dental pulp cells and mouse fetal osteoblasts, respectively (Nakata et al., 2000; Pelt et al., 2002) and so this microorganism can evidently stimulate host cells by more than one route. Further studies to test P. intermedia and P. gingivalis cell preparations alongside the media supernatants are necessary. We did not detect stimulating effects of P. gingivalis on matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells, consistent with the result from a previous study (Chang et al., 2002). However, previous studies have demonstrated that P. gingivalis stimulated osteosarcoma cells (Chang et al., 2004) and peripheral neutrophils to secrete significantly higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Resta ́ıno et al., 2007). It also significantly up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression by oral epithelial cells in a macrophage/ epithelial cell coculture model (Bodet et al., 2006) and in an engineered human oral mucosa model (Andrian et al., 2007). These contradicting results indicate that the effect of P. gingivalis might be cell type specific. Previous studies reported that the main source of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was polymorphonuclear neutrophils (Ingman et al., 1996; Westerlund et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2004). matrix metalloproteinase-9 was also highly expressed in the inflamed junctional and gingival epithelial cells of patients with advanced periodontitis (Ejeil et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2004). Our result suggested that human periodontal ligament cells, the major constituent of the periodontium, could also become an important source of matrix metalloproteinase-9 during inflammation due to the stimulatory effects of P. intermedia. As P. intermedia induced IL-1β expression in human periodontal ligament cells (Yamamoto et al., 2006), we included IL-1β as a stimulant in our study. It is interesting to note that IL-1β did not induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells. The same result was also found in human gingival cells (Beklen et al., 2006). However, a recent report demonstrated that IL-1β increased  matrix metalloproteinase-9 release in rat cardiac cells (Brown et al., 2007). We postulate that P. intermedia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells was not through IL-1β. We included specific inhibitors of extracellular signal-related kinases, jun N-terminal kinases and p38 in order to examine the possible roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in P. intermedia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 production. None of the inhibitors showed any effect on P. intermediainduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, suggesting that P. intermedia induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 production in human periodontal ligament cells through an mitogen-activated protein kinase-independent pathway. Other researchers have found that mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways are involved in P. gingivalis stimulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in osteosarcoma cells (Chang et al., 2004) and of MMP-2 in gingival fibroblasts (Bodet et al., 2007). We aim to examine various transmembrane and intracellular signaling pathways that are likely to be involved in P. intermedia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 production in human periodontal ligament cells. In conclusion, our study has shown that P. intermedia was able to induce human periodontal ligament cells to express matrix metalloproteinase-9 in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

19472000	Since the liver is the first capillary bed traversed by neoplasmatic cells from the colon, it is the main site where metastases occur. Minimally invasive procedures such as RFA, interstitial laser ablation, and CT-guided brachytherapy as described here enable the interventionalist to destroy significant amounts of tumor cell mass at a very low risk of side effects. The excellent overall survival rate in all subgroups of [90% after 12 months (Fig. 1) demonstrates that the combination of these treatment options, intra-arterial chemotherapy via the hepatic artery and local brachytherapy, can possibly control the malignant disease and may prolong survival for patients with `liver-only' metastases of colon carcinoma (Fig. 3).

19143000	One reason for the release of Cardiac troponins T from damaged myocardial cells might be an oxygen supply-demand mismatch of the myocardium. The most likely explanation of troponin elevation and myocardial damage in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage is an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system, with the resulting excess of sympathetic activity and increased catecholamine effect on the myocardial cells.37,38 Potential Treatment Strategies Troponin is a highly sensitive biomarker that aids in the detection of myocardial cell damage, which is often but not always, due to the thrombotic obstruction of a coronary artery.

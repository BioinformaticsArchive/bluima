11402000	Despite this prominent hyperinflammation, the frequencies of intracerebral L. monocytogenes-specific CD81 T cells were reduced and the intracerebral bacterial load was not reduced in interleukin-102/2 mice compared to wild-type mice. In the brain, choroid plexus epithelial cells, ependymal cells, neurons, and macrophages are the target cells of L. monocytogenes (45). This protection is mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and is associated with augmented i.c. tumor necrosis factor, gamma interferon (IFN-g), and interleukin-1β (interleukin-1β production) production. interleukin-10, which is produced by a variety of cells including macrophages, B cells, subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and resident brain cell populations including microglia, choroid plexus epithelial cells, and even neurons, has a strong immunosuppressive capacity (7, 10, 12, 32, 47). The percentage of viable L. monocytogenes cells recovered from the frozen stocks always exceeded 95%. For i.c. infection, 102 L. monocytogenes cells in 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were injected into the right caudate nucleus of mice deeply anesthetized with methoxyflurane. For primary systemic infection as well as for immunization of mice 14 or 28 days prior to either i.c. or intraperitoneal challenge, mice were injected intraperitoneal with 104 L. monocytogenes cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Murine microglia and macrophages were identified by staining with antiCD45 (LAC)–biotin (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and anti-F4/80– fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC (Alexis Biochemicals, Gru ̈nberg, Germany) followed by avidin-PE/Cy5 (Biozol, Freising, Germany). Inflammatory leukocytes recruited to the brain are CD45high F4/80-, macrophages are CD45high F4/80+, and microglia are CD45low F4/80+. The frequency of L. monocytogenes p60-specific CD4+ T cells and L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells was determined in an IFN-g-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay as described in detail previously (14). Freshly isolated leukocytes (105/well) were cocultured with different types of antigen-presenting cell for the selective detection of L. monocytogenesspecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in nitrocellulose-backed 96-well microtiter plates coated with rat anti-mouse IFN-g monoclonal antibody. CD4+ T cells specific for L. monocytogenes p60 were detected in the presence of nonimmune syngeneic spleen cells (4 × 105/well), which had been preloaded with 5 μg of purified L. monocytogenes p60 per ml for 4 h (14). CD8+ T cells specific for L. monocytogenes were measured in the presence of L. monocytogenes-infected IC21 cells (H-2b). IC21 cells were infected with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 60 min. Thereafter, extracellular bacteria were killed by addition of gentamicin (5 μg/ml). To control for the specificity of lymphocytes activated by CD4 and CD8 target cells, 1 × 105 CD4+ T cells or 5 × 104 CD8+ T cells purified from the spleens of wild-type mice, which had been infected with L. monocytogenes 14 days earlier, were added to either 105 L. monocytogenesinfected IC21 cells or 105 p60-loaded splenic antigen-presenting cell. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were purified by magnetic activated cell sorting (magnetic activated cell sorting; Milteny, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Spleen cells were stained with either FITC-labeled rat anti-mouse CD4 or FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8 antibodies and separated after secondary labeling with paramagnetic microbeads coupled with mouse anti-FITC isomer 1 antibody (Milteny), applying the standard positive selection protocol provided by the manufacturer. The purity of separated T-cell populations was always between 80 and 90% as controlled by flow cytometry. The frequency of antigen-specific cells was calculated as the number of spots per leukocytes seeded. Survival rate, bacterial load, number of inflammatory leukocytes in the brain and liver, and frequencies of L. monocytogenes-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were compared between interleukin-10-/- and interleukin-10+/+ mice. In both groups of immunized mice, bacterial titers also increased from days 1 to 3 postinoculation From days 3 to 5 postinoculation, immunized wild-type mice showed a significantly reduced i.c. bacterial load (P < 0.05), and the bacterial titers in the single surviving interleukin-10-/- mouse were also reduced on day 5 postinoculation Thus, these experiments did not reveal significant differences for the kinetics and numbers of L. monocytogenes cells between interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice; there-  fore, the death of immunized interleukin-10-/- mice cannot be attributed to an impaired control of i.c. L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, microglial activation was more prominent and more widespread in interleukin-10-/- mice, as evidenced by a generalized major histocompatibility complex class II antigen induction (Fig. 2I and L). In contrast, microglial activation was largely confined to the periventricular parenchyma in the vicinity of bacterium-associated inflammatory infiltrates in wild-type mice (Fig. 2K and M). Interestingly, interleukin-10-/- mice developed multiple petechial hemorrhages, predominantly in the periventricular parenchyma, including the periaqueductal grey matter of midbrain and pons, as well as within large fiber tracts (Fig. 2G), which showed marked vacuolation, a hallmark of brain edema, and, interestingly, were also heavily infiltrated by inflammatory cells, in particular  Downloaded from http://iai.asm.org/ on April 29, 2012 by BIBLIOTHEQUE CENTRALE DE L'EPFL  granulocytes and macrophages (Fig. 2G). In addition, cortical neurons were damaged. In contrast, i.c. hemorrhage was not observed in immunized wild-type mice and edema with neuronal damage was also much less severe in these animals (Fig. 2H). In contrast, other cell populations including macrophages, B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not differ significantly between interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice (data not shown). To analyze whether the number of i.c. L. monocytogenesspecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was regulated by interleukin-10, an enzyme-linked immunospot assay was developed which allows the selective ex vitro quantification of the frequencies of L. monocytogenesspecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These experiments, which were performed with wild-type mice, revealed that magnetic activated cell sorting-isolated splenic CD8+ T cells of L. monocytogenes-infected mice reacted with L. monocytogenes-infected IC21 cells but not with p60-loaded syngenic splenic antigen-presenting cell (Fig. 4A). Conversely, purified L. monocytogenes-immune CD4+ T cells reacted selectively with p60-loaded spleen cells. Thus, L. monocytogenesinfected IC21 cells served as a target for CD8+ T cells while p60-loaded splenic antigen-presenting cell are a target for CD4+ T cells. To compare the frequencies of L. monocytogenes-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice, we focused on immunized mice on day 3 postinoculation, since a strong L. monocyto-  FIG.

These experiments revealed that the frequency of L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced in interleukin-10-/- mice compared to wild-type mice (P < 0.05) whereas the frequency of L.

Specificity of inflammatory T cells in L. monocytogenesinfected organs. (A) Antigen presentation by CD4 (syngenic spleen cells plus p60 protein) and CD8 (L. monocytogenes-infected IC21 cells) target cells was controlled with purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from L. monocytogenes-infected wild-type mice 14 days postinoculation Results are shown as the percentage of reactive CD4+ (open bars) and CD8+ (black bars) T cells. Three days postchallenge, leukocytes were isolated from the brain; the frequency of IFN-g-secreting p60-specific CD4+ T cells and L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells is shown as the number of spots per ×105 leukocytes (open bars; L. monocytogenes p60-specific CD4+ T cells; black bars, L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells). The indicates statistical significant differences in the numbers of the respective L. monocytogenes-specific T-cell population between interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice. monocytogenes-specific CD4+ T cells did not differ significantly between interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data show that endogenous interleukin-10 significantly influences the number of leukocytes recruited to the brain, the composition of i.c. infiltrates, and the frequencies of i.c. L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells. All interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice survived primary and secondary intraperitoneal infection with 104 or 106 L. monocytogenes cells, respectively (data not shown). The frequencies of L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells were also significantly reduced in the livers of intraperitoneal-infected interleukin-10-/- mice compared to wild-type mice (P < 0.01), thereby paralleling cerebral listeriosis (Fig. 6E). These i.c. hemorrhages, in association with a pronounced brain edema, significantly damaged neurons in interleukin-10-/- mice and, in association with the strong and ubiquitous encephalitis, caused their death. The development of i.c. hemorrhages and an aggravated brain edema in interleukin-10-/- mice may be influenced by several, non-mutually exclusive factors including hyperinflammation, increased production of cytokines and chemokines, and stronger activation of microglial cells, which are all associated with the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis and, in particular, with the development of brain edema (17, 38, 39, 44). (E) Specificity of inflammatory T cells in the L. monocytogenes-infected liver. The frequency of IFN-g secreting p60-specific CD4+ T cells and L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells was determined by use of an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The frequency of reactive cells is shown as the number of spots per 105 leukocytes. tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and NO induce cerebral edema; tumor necrosis factor may additionally be involved in the apoptosis of cortical and hippocampal neurons (4, 24, 44), which has also been observed in L. monocytogenes meningoencephalitis (46). A striking difference between interleukin-10-/- and wild-type mice was the prominent and widespread microglial major histocompatibility complex class II expression in interleukin-10-/- mice and a rather weak, locally restricted microglial major histocompatibility complex class II expression in wild-type mice. This increased activation of microglia in interleukin-10-/- mice may be directly caused by the absence of interleukin-10, since interleukin-10 suppresses microglial activation including major histocompatibility complex class II expression and their release of tumor necrosis factor-α in vitro (11). The pronounced microglial activation in interleukin-10-/- mice may be detrimental and may contribute to the fatal outcome of immunized interleukin-10-/- mice, since activated microglia produces several neurotoxic mediators and excitatory amino acids such as glutamate, which may also contribute to neuronal damage (37). Since both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a pivotal protective role in cerebral listeriosis (48), the frequencies of L. monocytogenes-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in cerebral infiltrates were assessed. In our experiments, the failure of interleukin-10-/- mice to more effectively eliminate i.c. bacteria correlated with lower i.c. frequencies of L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells in their brains while the favorable prognosis of interleukin-10+/+ mice was associated with increased frequencies of these cells. These findings indicate that the regulatory activity of interleukin-10 is crucial for focusing the i.c. immune response on antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, which is in agreement with recent studies illustrating that interleukin-10 favors the development of antigen-specific T cells, in particular CD8+ T cells (9, 15, 30, 31, 42, 43). Since interleukin-10-/mice expressed increased levels of IFN-g, a key factor for the clearance of L. monocytogenes, but lacked a more efficient clearance of the bacteria, we assume that the reduced frequency of L. monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells, which are able to eradicate L. monocytogenes by Fas- and perforin-dependent lysis of infected host cells (20, 21), accounts for this observation. In addition to Listeria-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells (8) and bystander T cells may contribute to the increased IFN-g expression of interleukin-10-/- mice. In fact, it has been demonstrated that T cells of interleukin-10-/- mice produce much higher levels of IFN-g than do T cells of wild-type mice after CD3 ligation, intracerebral, after antigen-independent stimulation (26). At present, the reason for these divergent findings cannot 17. be determined, but the reduced frequencies of L. monocytogenes-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the hepatic infiltrates 18. may account for the lack of more effective bacterial clearance in our experiments.

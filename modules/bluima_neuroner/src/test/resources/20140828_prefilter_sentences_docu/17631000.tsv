This report presents the case of a 19 -year-old male who developed severe anemia shortly after successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Retrospective examination of the donor's blood suggests that hematopoietic stem cells could be the source of infection. Grabarczyk,2 P.

On the day of admission he was found to have Hemoglobin 5.2 g/dL, red blood cells 1.55  106/μL, hematocrit 14.0%, reticulocytes 0.2%, platelets 21  103/μL, white blood cells 2.9  103/μL, and neutrophils 0.2  103/μL. At the beginning of July he underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with peripheral stem cells (2  106/kg CD34 ≠) obtained from his human leukocyte antigen-matched, ABO-compatible 11-year-old sister after a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide, £udarabine, and alemtuzumab. He quickly achieved engraftment with adequate neutrophil and platelet levels and was discharged on day ≠ 14 after peripheral blood stem cell transplant with Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit 32.0%, platelets 58  103/μL, white blood cells 5.1  103/μL, absolute neutrophil count 3.8  103/μL, and reticulocytes 2.1%. Ten days later, during a routine check-up, his Hemoglobin was 9.7 g/dL, hematocrit 27.9%, red blood cells 3.44, platelets 128  103/μL, white blood cells 1.3  103/μL, and reticulocytes 0%. Peripheral blood examination revealed severe normocytic anemia with Hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL, red blood cells 2  106/μL, hematocrit 18.7%, reticulocytes 0%, white blood cells 1.0  103/ μL, absolute neutrophil count 0.5 103/μL, and platelets 227  103/μL. Bone marrow biopsy showed hypocellular marrow with marked dyserythropoiesis and the presence of giant proerythroblasts having a morphology similar to that associated with parvovirus B19 infection. The diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia due to parvovirus B19 infection was established and treatment with immunoglobulin G, 2 g/ kg body weight, was instituted.

In October 2004, 3 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, because of lack of signs of graft-versus-host disease, immunosuppression with cyclosporine was discontinued and his hematological status had markedly improved. In December 2004, 5 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, he was in good general condition with Hemoglobin about 14 g/dL and reticulocytes 0.4%. We had examined 2 samples of donor's blood, the ¢rst one taken for human leukocyte antigen typing before HSCTand the second one taken at the time of diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia in the patient after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Analysis of donor's blood taken at the time of diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia in the patient showed normal peripheral blood parameters but positive B19 serology (immunoglobulin G 415 IU/mL, IgM 52 IU/mL) as well as the presence of B19 DNA (5.7  104 gEq B19 DNA/mL). Retrospective analysis of the sample taken before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation revealed 2  104 gEq B19 DNA/mL. This led us to the conclusion that both the donor and the recipient were infected with the same strand of virus and that, at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the donor was the asymptomatic carrier of parvovirus B19. Discussion  This case illustrates the clinical consequences of chronic parvovirus B19 infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedure and the possibility of virus transmission from the donor to the recipient. Before the procedure our patient was parvovirus B19 negative, and received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a clinically healthy donor. From the day of diagnosis of parvovirus B19 -induced pure red cell aplasia, the question of the source of the infection had arisen. Because the patient was B19 negative before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the infection had to be acquired during or shortly after the procedure. At the time of harvesting peripheral stem cells, the patient's donor, his 11-year-old sister, was healthy, with no history of recent viral infection, fever, rash, or arthralgia and with normal blood parameters.We examined her blood at the time of diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia in the recipient and found anti-B19 antibodies, and real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a low viral load of 5.7  104 gEq/mL. In the light of these ¢ndings, we suspect that at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the donor had persistent B19 DNA positivity, and her hematopoietic stem cells could be the source of the patient's infection. The patient was unable to mount a neutralizing antibody response owing to bone marrow insu/ciency shortly after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and B19 infection caused chronic anemia. Because the most probable source of his infection was the hematopoietic stem cells from his asymptomatic donor, this situation needs special consideration. 8. Corral DA, Darras FS, Jensen CW, et al.

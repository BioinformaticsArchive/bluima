19615000	Cutaneous Pathology  Solitary cutaneous histiocytosis with granular cell changes: a morphological variant of reticulohistiocytoma? We first report a case of granular cell histiocytosis occurring as a solitary polypoid lesion of the nipple in a 15-year-old girl. Histologically, the lesion was composed of a dermal population of medium- to large-sized, short spindle- to round- to epithelioid-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm containing numerous and small diastase-resistant periodic acid-Schiff positive granules. No associated inflammatory cells were observed. Based on clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical features, the diagnosis of `solitary cutaneous histiocytosis with granular cell changes' was proposed. The absence of an inflammatory cell component, such as lymphocytes and leucocytes, along with no history of a previous trauma or medical treatment, suggest that the present lesion could fit into the morphological spectrum of the so-called solitary epithelioid histiocytoma, also known as reticulohistiocytoma. Nevertheless, awareness of solitary cutaneous histiocytosis with granular cell changes is useful to avoid confusion with other dermal tumors, especially `granular cell tumor' and `dermal non-neural granular cell tumor'.

Accepted for publication March 9, 2009  Cutaneous histiocytic proliferations are a wide group of disorders characterized by histiocytes of both the monocyte-macrophage and the Langerhans cell series. In 1987, Histiocyte Society identified three classes of histiocytic proliferations: class I, corresponding to Langerhans cell histiocytoses; class II, corresponding to the histiocytoses of mononuclear phagocytes other than Langerhans cells; and class III, comprising the malignant histiocytoses.1 Classic forms of class II (non-Langerhans cell histiocytic proliferations) include generalized eruptive histiocytosis, benign cephalic histiocytosis, juvenile xanthogranuloma, papular xanthoma, xanthoma  disseminatum, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphoadenopathy, reticulohistiocytoma/multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.2 We report an unusual case of a polypoid cutaneous lesion, histologically characterized by a dermal proliferation of histiocytes with diffuse cytoplasmic granular cell changes. The dermis was entirely occupied by a population of medium- to large-sized, short spindle- to round- to epithelioidshaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm containing numerous, small, diastase-resistant periodic acid-Schiff positive granules (Fig. 1 – 3). Only focally, the epithelioid cells were bi-nucleated, but there were no multinucleated giant cells, including Touton-type giant cells. Inflammatory cells (i.e. lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes) were not seen. Immunohistochemically, the epithelioid cells were exclusively positive to vimentin and CD68 (Fig. 4). Based on clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical features, the descriptive diagnosis of solitary cutaneous histiocytosis with granular cell changes was proposed. Discussion We herein report a rare case of a solitary cutaneous histiocytosis with unusual cytoplasmic granular cell  Fig. Numerous epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm are also evident in the dermis (H & E; 5×). Epithelioid cells are arranged around lymphatic blood vessels (H & E; 10×). High magnification showing epithelioid-shaped cells containing numerous and small intracytoplasmic granules. A few cells are bi-nucleated (H & E; 40×). The epithelioid cells were stained with CD68 (immunoperoxidase; 10×).

Moreover, the absence of inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes or granulocytes, is against the reactive inflammatory nature of the lesion. The population of medium- to large-sized, short spindle- to round- to epithelioid-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, in combination with the polypoid aspect of the lesion, led us to consider the possibility that such a lesion could fit into the wide spectrum of reticulohistiocytoma or solitary epithelioid histiocytoma. – 17 Recently, some authors, reviewing a large series of similar lesions, proposed to leave the archaic term `reticulohistiocytoma', reclassifying them as solitary epithelioid histiocytoma,5 according to the WHO committee on histiocytic and reticulum cell proliferations and the reclassification working group of the Histiocyte Society.18 solitary epithelioid histiocytoma usually occurs in young adults with a slight female predominance, but it can be observed from early childhood to old age. The typical cells of solitary epithelioid histiocytoma are usually large-sized, mono- and/or multinucleated epithelioid histiocytes exhibiting an abundant, pale to eosinophilic `glassy' cytoplasm. Apart from this unusual localization, the most striking feature of the present case was the extensive granular cell changes occurring in the cytoplasm of histiocytes, which have not been previously described in solitary epithelioid histiocytoma. Differential diagnosis mainly revolved around other dermal tumors that can exhibit similar granular cell changes. Among these, cutaneous granular cell tumor, previously known as granular cell myoblastoma, can be easily confused with solitary epithelioid histiocytoma. `Dermal nonneural granular cell tumour' is another distinctive entity that can potentially mimic solitary epithelioid histiocytoma, its granular cells being negative to S-100 protein and focally positive to CD68.21 However, it is characterized by a significant cellular atypia, increased mitotic activity and expansile growth pattern,21 all features that are lacking in our case. This tumor is usually composed of uniform, variable-sized epithelioid cells, often exhibiting a perivascular arrangement.22 Unlike the histiocytic nature of solitary epithelioid histiocytoma, epithelioid fibrous  histiocytoma has a controversial histogenesis and an origin from fibro-myofibroblastic or dendritic cells has been proposed.23,24 Cytoplasmic granular cell change is a relatively common, aspecific feature which can be encountered in a wide variety of tumors, including melanocytic naevi,25 dermatofibromas,26 dermatomyofibromas,27 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,28 basal cell carcinomas,29 cutaneous angiosarcomas,30 atypical fibroxanthomas31 and cutaneous leiomyosarcomas.32 We report on an unusual lesion composed of histiocytes with granular cell changes, which can mimic cutaneous tumors, particularly granular cell tumor or `dermal non-neural granular cell tumor'. Accordingly, the descriptive term `solitary cutaneous histiocytosis with granular cell changes' seems to be currently appropriate. A pathologist should keep in mind that granular cytoplasmic change is frequently a degenerative phenomenon that does not indicate any specific cellular line of differentiation in tumor pathology. Accordingly, the final diagnosis of a lesion with granular cell changes should be based on a careful combination of morphological, immunohistochemical and clinical features.

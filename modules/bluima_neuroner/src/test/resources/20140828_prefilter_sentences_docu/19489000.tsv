19489000	High glucose-induced changes in steroid  production in adrenal cells  F. Received: 18 November 2008 Revised: 19 March 2009 Accepted: 22 April 2009  Received: 18 November 2008 Revised: 19 March 2009 Accepted: 22 April 2009  Abstract  Background Increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal) axis, resulting in enhanced adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and serum glucocorticoid levels, has been described in patients with diabetes mellitus and in animal models of this disease; however, altered steroid production by adrenocortical cells could result from local changes triggered by increased reactive oxygen species (Reactive oxygen species generation), induced in turn by chronic hyperglycaemia. Experiments were designed (1) to analyse the effects of incubating murine adrenocortical cells in hyperglycaemic media on the generation of oxidative stress, on steroid synthesis and on its modulation by the activity of haeme oxygenase; and (2) to evaluate the effect of antioxidant treatment on these parameters. Methods Y1 cells were incubated for 7 days with either normal or high glucose (high glucose, 30 mmol/L) concentrations, with or without antioxidant treatment. Basal progesterone production was reduced, while a higher response to ACTH was observed in high glucose-treated cells. Similar results were obtained by haeme oxygenase-1 gene silencing while the opposite effect was observed in Y1 cells overexpressing haeme oxygenase-1. Conclusions high glucose induces oxidative stress and affects steroid production in adrenal cells; the involvement of haeme oxygenase activity in the modulation of steroidogenesis in Y1 cells is postulated. Keywords haeme oxygenase-1; high glucose; oxidative stress; antioxidants; steroids; nitric oxide; adrenocortical cells  Introduction  Chronic hyperglycaemia, a major hallmark of diabetes mellitus, has been linked to the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (Reactive oxygen species generation) in target organs such as the retina and kidney, among others, leading to intracellular biochemical alterations involved in the development of chronic diabetes  complications (for review, see [1]). Moreover, excessive chronic oxidative stress, per se, might affect cellular functions in experimental diabetes models [2], e.g. it has been described that elevated glucose concentrations increase apoptosis by inducing oxidative and nitrosative stress in different cell types [3] and decrease mitochondrial biogenesis by augmenting Reactive oxygen species generation formation in human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line G2 (HepG2) cells [4]. Redox imbalance also induces haeme oxygenase-1 [6], and induction of haeme oxygenase-1 by high glucose concentrations has been demonstrated in many cell types [7 – 9]. In addition to the antioxidant properties attributed mainly to haeme consumption and biliverdin generation, CO generated during haeme degradation can act as a messenger molecule affecting cellular physiology [10]. Accordingly, we have previously demonstrated the induction of haeme oxygenase-1 by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in zona fasciculata adrenal cells, its role as an antioxidant enzyme and its involvement in the modulation of adrenal steroidogenesis [11]. However, little is known about the local effects of hyperglycaemia on the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal cortex. Taking the above data into account, we hypothesized that chronic hyperglycaemia increases Reactive oxygen species generation generation and that the concomitant redox imbalance and/or changes in regulatory mechanisms affect steroid production by adrenocortical cells. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to analyse the effects of incubating mouse adrenal cells in hyperglycaemic media on oxidative stress and steroid synthesis as well as on the modulation of the latter by regulatory signals originating in the activation of the haeme oxygenase system. Cell cultures and treatments  Y1 cells (generously provided by Dr B. Schimmer, University of Toronto, Canada) are an ACTH- and cAMP-responsive subclone of the mouse adrenocortical tumour cell line isolated by Yasumura et al. [21]. In some experiments, adrenocortical cells were stimulated during 180 min with ACTH (10 mIU/mL). No differences in cell viability, assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test, resulted from any of these treatments. Primary cultures of rat adrenocortical cells  Preparation of zona fasciculata cells followed published procedures with minor modifications [23]. Briefly, cells were isolated from decapsulated and demedullated adrenals by incubating the tissue in Ham's F10 medium with Type I collagenase (0.5 mg/mL, Worthington, NJ, USA) for 20 min at 37 ◦C. The cell pellet was suspended in Ham's F10 medium (supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 12.5% horse serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin) and seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 106 cells/well. Determination of intracellular Reactive oxygen species generation generation  After each treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and then incubated in phosphate buffered saline containing 10 μmol/L of 2 ,7 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for 1 h at 37 ◦C. After that, cells were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline. Protein and cellular debris were precipitated with 50% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Briefly, cells were suspended in 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline with 0.075% sodium dodecyl sulphate, and 0.5 mL of 2-thiobarbituric acid (10 mg/mL in 10% sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5) was added. RNA isolation and RT-PCR  Total RNA was extracted from Y1 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Immunoblot analysis  Y1 cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline and lysed in 20 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 1X of protease inhibitor cocktail. One day before transfection, Y1 cells (2.5 × 105 cells per well) were grown up to 80% confluence on 24-well plates. Y1 cells were stimulated with (7.5 mIU/mL) ACTH for 5 h. Overexpression of human haeme-oxygenase in Y1 cells  Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 day before transfection, 105 cells were seeded in 24-well plates in antibioticserum free medium. The DNA – Lipofectamine complex was then added to the cells and incubated at 37 ◦C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air–5% CO2. After 3 h, the medium was added with 15% serum containing Ham's F10 medium and the cells were grown for 48 h before initiating the assays. L-Arginine uptake assay  Unidirectional transport of L-[2,3,4-3H]arginine was measured in Y1 cells. The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well (1000 cells/mm2) in 12-well trays. After the treatments, the cells were washed twice with 1 mL buffer A (2 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 5.6 mmol/L D-glucose, 140 mmol/L choline chloride and 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4) and uptake was measured by adding 500 μL of buffer A containing L-[2,3,4-3H]arginine monohydrochloride (50 μmol/L, AE: 38.5 Ci/mmol, final concentration 1 μCi/mL) to each well. Incubations were terminated by rinsing the cells three times with 1 mL buffer A. Results  Figure 1(A) shows that Y1 cells incubated in media containing 30 mmol/L D-glucose (high glucose) for 7 days produced significantly less progesterone than those incubated in media with 5.5 mmol D-glucose (normal glucose). In the presence of high glucose, however, ACTH stimulation of Y1 cells resulted in a significantly higher steroid output as compared to normal glucose conditions (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained when primary cultures of rat adrenal cells were incubated in high glucose (Figure 1C and D). None of the above-mentioned parameters showed significant changes when the cells were  A 2.0  B 60  40  **  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  20  0  normal glucose L-glucose high glucose  D 250  200  150  ***  Corticosterone (ng / 106 cells)  100  50  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  1.5  1.0  0.5  0.0 C 150  Corticosterone (ng / 106 cells)  100  50  0  0  normal glucose L-glucose high glucose  ***  normal glucose L-glucose high glucose  *  normal glucose L-glucose high glucose  Figure 1.

The medium was renewed and the cells were further incubated with no additions (A) or in the presence of 10 mIU/mL ACTH for 3 h (B). Primary cultures of rat zona fasciculata cells, obtained as described in Materials and Methods, were incubated for 4 days in normal glucose, L-glucose or high glucose. After renewing the medium, cells were further incubated with no additions (C) or with 10 mIU/mL ACTH for 2 h (D). Different parameters of oxidative stress were analysed in Y1 cells incubated in media containing high glucose for 7 days. As shown in Figure 2(A), significantly higher levels of Reactive oxygen species generation were detected in this condition, as compared to cells incubated in media with normal glucose. These cells also exhibited higher levels of lipid peroxidation (Figure 2B) and lower reduced GSH levels (Figure 2C). Treatment of Y1 cells with high glucose for 7 days increased the mRNA levels or Mn-superoxide dismutase, Cu-superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase (Figure 3A). The involvement of haeme oxygenase activity in the modulation of steroid production in high glucose-treated cells was evaluated using tin-protoporphyrin IX, a competitive inhibitor of haeme oxygenase activity. The addition of tin-protoporphyrin IX to the incubation media resulted in a higher steroid output by Y1 cells, both in basal and ACTH-stimulated conditions (Figure 4A). Antioxidant treatment prevented the effects of high glucose on haeme oxygenase-1 protein levels (Figure 5A) and on basal steroid production (Figure 5B), but failed to modify the exaggerated response to ACTH induced by high glucose in Y1 cells (Figure 5C). Nitrite levels, measured in the incubation media of Y1 cells to assess the effects of high glucose on nitric oxide synthase activity, were significantly decreased by this treatment (Figure 6A). In this respect, our results show that L-arginine uptake into Y1 cells was inhibited by high glucose treatment (Figure 6B). Discussion  The main findings of our study include the following: First, steroid production by murine adrenocortical Y1 cells (basal and ACTH-stimulated) is altered by a high glucose environment. Changes in medium osmolarity were not responsible for the observed effects of high glucose, since these parameters were not altered in cells exposed to high concentrations of L-glucose. Oxidative stress is generated by high glucose treatment of Y1 cells. Y1 cells were incubated in Ham's F10 medium containing 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose (normal glucose – normal glucose), 30 mmol/L D-glucose (high glucose) or 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose plus 24.5 mmol/L L-glucose for 7 days. Values represent mean ± SEM, n = 6. ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 versus normal glucose by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test  In spite of their tumoural origin, Y1 cells behave like normal steroidogenic cells in many aspects, including the stimulation of steroid production by ACTH [22,28]; as far as the effects of high glucose on steroid production are concerned, our results obtained in primary rat adrenal cell cultures support the use of this cell line as a model of an adrenocortical cell system. high glucose treatment significantly inhibited basal steroid output in Y1 cells. Similarly, significant decreases in progesterone release by trophoblastic cells [29] and in oestradiol and progesterone production by rat primary granulosa cells [30] have been described after exposing these cells to elevated glucose concentrations. Y1 cells were incubated in Ham's F10 medium containing 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose (normal glucose – normal glucose), 30 mmol/L D-glucose (high glucose) or 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose plus 24.5 mmol/L L-glucose for 7 days. A representative western blot of haeme oxygenase-1 and actin proteins obtained from Y1 cells subjected to normal glucose, high glucose and L-glucose for 7 days is shown (C)  (e.g. resulting from inducing diabetes in rats by means of streptozotocin treatment) on steroid production, a reduced basal secretion of aldosterone and corticosterone was observed in isolated glomerulosa cells obtained from these animals [31], while a lowering in the plasma corticosterone levels was detected in streptozotocin-treated rats in which the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis had been interrupted [20]. Incubation of Y1 cells in the presence of high glucose for 7 days resulted in oxidative stress, increasing Reactive oxygen species generation generation and lipid peroxidation and decreasing reduced GSH levels. In fact, it has been suggested that depletion of reduced GSH, considered a main antioxidant molecule, predisposes cells to oxidant-induced damage [32]. Similar results were obtained in mesangial and renal tubular epithelium cells, in retinal endothelial cells and pericytes and in intestinal epithelial cells [33 – 35] exposed to high glucose environment. We propose that, in Y1 cells, oxidative stress generated by high glucose treatment negatively affects basal steroid production, as antioxidant treatment prevented this effect. In this sense, the inhibition of steroid production by hydrogen peroxide or a superoxide generator in Y1 cells [36] supports this hypothesis. Oxidative stress originated by high glucose treatment triggered the stimulation of the cellular antioxidant defense system. Our results show that incubation of Y1 adrenal cells in high glucose increases the mRNA levels of superoxide dismutases isozymes, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. A wide variety of changes in the levels of antioxidant enzymes has been described in other cell types (such as vascular smooth muscle cells, retinal epithelial cells, among others) under high glucose treatment [32,37]. 80  60  40  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  20  A3  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  1  0  B 40  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  30  20  10  0  C 40  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  30  20  10  0  2  basal  b,d,e  a  normal glucose high glucose normal glucose high glucose  SnPPIX  basal  500  * 400  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  300  200  100  0  control haeme oxygenase-1 siRNA siRNA  basal  200  * 150  Progesterone (ng / 3 · 106 cells)  100  50  0  β-Gal human haeme-oxygenase  0  ACTH  b,c,e  b  a,d  normal glucose high glucose normal glucose high glucose  SnPPIX  ACTH  ***  haeme oxygenase-1 -  Actin -  control haeme oxygenase-1 siRNA siRNA  control haeme oxygenase-1 siRNA siRNA  ACTH  *** haeme oxygenase-1 -  18S -  β-Gal human haeme-oxygenase  β-Gal human haeme-oxygenase  Figure 4.

Total cell proteins were isolated and analysed by western blotting (10 μg/lane), as described in Materials and Methods, to detect haeme oxygenase-1 and actin signals. (C) Y1 cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pCDNA3 (human haeme-oxygenase or β-Gal) and grown for 48 h as described in Materials and Methods. The medium was renewed and the cells were further incubated with no additions or with 10 mIU/mL ACTH for 3 h.

More specifically, a decrease in several oxidative stress parameters has been detected after the induction of haeme oxygenase-1 by ACTH in Y1 cells [11]. Present experiments show that incubation of Y1 cells in high glucose medium also results in increased haeme oxygenase-1 but not haeme oxygenase-2 levels. Interestingly, ACTH stimulation of high glucose-treated cells resulted in higher levels of steroid production (compared to ACTH + normal glucose treatment). The mechanism involved deserves further investigation, although it seems likely that this effect is exerted downstream cAMP generation, as no significant differences in cAMP levels were detected in high glucose-treated cells.

In this sense, reduced L-arginine uptake and lower nitrite levels were detected in high glucose-treated cells. According to our results, the effects of high glucose on ACTH-stimulated steroid production were not prevented by antioxidant treatment, suggesting that oxidative stress-dependent and -independent mechanisms are triggered by high glucose treatment of Y1 cells. Present results lead us to hypothesize that steroid production by Y1 cells is negatively regulated by haeme oxygenase activity, as steroid output was significantly increased after inhibiting haeme oxygenase activity (both by pharmacologic blockade and gene silencing). Correspondingly, overexpression of human haeme-oxygenase in  Y1 cells resulted in decreased steroid production, further supporting this hypothesis. The quantitatively lesser response obtained using this molecular approach could be attributed to a low (∼20%) efficiency of transfection, and/or to the fact that haeme oxygenase-2 activity is also involved in the modulation of steroid production in these cells. The causative mechanisms by which elevated glucose concentrations increase haeme oxygenase-1 levels in Y1 cells remain to be elucidated. Glucose-induced increases in haeme oxygenase-1 expression have been described in endothelial cells [9,45] as well as in pancreatic islets [8]. However, in contrast to the latter studies, our results indicate that in Y1 cells, the cAMP-signalling pathway might not be involved in the upregulation of haeme oxygenase-1 by high glucose, as this treatment did not modify cAMP levels. Y1 cells were incubated in Ham's F10 medium containing 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose (normal glucose – normal glucose), 30 mmol/L D-glucose (high glucose) or 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose plus 24.5 mmol/L L-glucose for 7 days. Our experiments show that incubation in high glucose of either Y1 cells or primary cultures of rat adrenal cells does not result in a decreased response to ACTH, suggesting that hyperglycaemia alone does not account for this effect and that additional regulatory mechanisms should be taken into account. In conclusion, present results demonstrate the involvement of haeme oxygenase activity in the modulation of glucocorticoid production by adrenal cells incubated with high glucose. The incubation of adrenocortical Y1 cells in the presence of high glucose concentrations modifies basal and ACTH-stimulated steroid production and triggers oxidative stress resulting in the activation of antioxidant  defense mechanisms.

19198000	Briefly, cells of the GS115 strain that had been transformed with acid glycoprotein were grown in buffered glycerolcomplex medium (BMGY; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4  105% biotin and 1% glycerol; pH 6.0) at 30°C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation (1500g, 10 min, 20°C), and the cell pellets were resuspended in buffered methanolcomplex medium (BMMY; same composition as BMGY except that 0.5% methanol was used  instead of glycerol) at 30°C. After culturing the cells, the growth medium was separated from the yeast by centrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 4°C). The recombinant acid glycoprotein that was secreted into the growth medium during cell culture was isolated using 65% ammonium sulfate (12,000g, 60 min, 4°C) and resuspended in distilled water. The nicked vector DNA carrying the desired mutations was amplified in E. coli XL10-Gold® ultracompetent cells. Fluorescence Quenching Experiments Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Jasco-FP-777 spectrofluorimeter (Tokyo, Japan) with a 1 cm  1 cm  4 cm cell at 25°C.

19787000	Richardson and Kenneth C. Anderson  thalidomide is frequently used in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma, but its role as maintenance therapy following autologous stem-cell transplantation has been an area of uncertainty. thalidomide-based maintenance therapy following autologous stem-cell transplantation in multiple myeloma is the focus of an important study by spencer and colleagues.1 the use of thalidomide in multiple myeloma was initially stimulated by observation from D’amato and colleagues that the agent possesses antiangiogenic properties.2 Further research demonstrated that thalidomide exerts its effect on multiple myeloma cells via other mechanisms, including enhancement of t-cell and natural-killer-cell mediated immunological response, disruption of adhesion between multiple myeloma cells and surrounding stromal cells, and induction of caspase-8 mediated apoptosis. along with its conventional role in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma, thalidomide has also been evaluated as maintenance therapy following autologous stem-cell transplantation. although autologous stem-cell transplantation in the aftermath of induction therapy with both conventional therapeutic and novel agents augments disease responsiveness in multiple myeloma, and thus increases rates of complete response, a substantial number of patients with multiple myeloma who undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation exhibit evidence of persistent disease following autologous stem-cell transplantation. the administration of thalidomide following autologous stem-cell transplantation could therefore improve clinical outcome by either suppressing a small clonal population of multiple myeloma cells in those patients who are in complete response, or by further reducing disease burden in those who have not achieved a complete response after autologous stem-cell transplantation. attal and colleagues subsequently conducted a randomized study in which 597 individuals with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma received vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone induction followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation, with randomization to either no maintenance, pamidronate alone, or pamidronate and thalidomide 2 months post-autologous stem-cell transplantation.8 of note, patients with chromosome 13 deletion and those who achieved at least a very good partial response with autologous stem-cell transplantation did not benefit from thalidomide maintenance with respect to event-free survival. All rights reserved  news & views  Practice point  From the standpoint of clinical practice, the results of this study suggest that maintenance therapy with a thalidomide– corticosteroid combination should be considered in patients who do not achieve at least a very good partial response following autologous stem-cell transplantation. the study by spencer and colleagues, however, contributes important insight on this practice and provides a clearer signal as to its influence on both disease progression and survival.1 in total, 269 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had successfully  undergone induction therapy followed by a single autologous stem-cell transplantation were randomly allocated to maintenance therapy with either alternate day prednisolone 50 mg alone (n = 129) or alternate day prednisolone plus thalidomide 100 mg (n = 114) for a maximum of 12 months. in addition, the combination not only produced a significant eventfree-survival benefit in patients who did not achieve at least a very good partial response post-autologous stem-cell transplantation, but also a trend towards improvement among those who achieved a very good partial response or better. the results of this study thus seem to favor a doublet as opposed to monotherapy in the maintenance setting, and especially favor utilization of this practice in patients who fail to achieve at least a very good partial response following autologous stem-cell transplantation. the results of this well-designed clinical trial cast a favorable light on the use of  thalidomide-based maintenance following autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Consolidation therapy with low-dose thalidomide and prednisolone prolongs the survival of multiple myeloma patients undergoing a single autologous stemcell transplantation procedure.

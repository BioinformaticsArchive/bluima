Such ion channels are present in many human cells, including neurons (8). In the model, provided that frequencies are below 10 Hz, A.C. magnetic fields of virtually any magnitude are said to result in minimum disruption of cellular processes. DISCUSSION  According to the Kirschvink model, deformation of the nerve cell membrane and closing of the ion gates would occur quickly enough to compensate for the forced opening of a gate as long as the frequency of the forcing field was below 10 Hz - regardless of the strength of the applied field. This time constant, however, is nearly two orders of magnitude longer than that required for the generation of action potentials in neurons as pointed out by Kirschvink et al. (3). Whether or not a nerve cell fires (ie. an action potentials is generated) is normally controlled by the release of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions. If the combination of these two types of neurotransmitters sufficiently depolarizes the membrane potentials, an action potentials is generated in the post-synaptic neuron and it fires. If, however, the membrane depolarization is held above the threshold required for an action potentials to be generated, a succession of action potentials will be generated and multiple rapid firing of the neuron will occur. This, in turn will result in the release of neurotransmitters to connected post-synaptic neurons possibly resulting in a similar effect. The membrane potentials remains depolarized and the cell begins to fire at very high frequencies. A few cells with sustained depolarization shifts can cause synchronization in a large population resulting in a recorded epileptiform spike (15). If an ion channel is forced open in the manner described by the ferromagnetic transduction model, this could throw out the normal balance of exitatory and inhibitory potentials in the post synaptic neuron and may result in a sustained depolarization and the generation of an epileptiform discharge may be recorded. approximately 0.1 s after the field has forced open the ion gate), the gate closes on its own or membrane deformation occurs, stopping the flow of calcium ions into the cell. Cellular Phone Safety Aspects The ferromagnetic transduction model may also have implications for new digital cellular telephones which employ discontinuous transmission (DSX) signals. As is the case in the clinical studies of epileptic patients described in this paper, these battery current pulses may generate magnetic fields strong enough to cause opening and closing 721  of gated ion channels and disruption of normal cellular processes in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 2. In addition, it provides a mechanism by which cellular phones which employ discontinuous transmission signals may adversely interact with the human brain, disrupting normal cellular processes. Though the model explains our clinical results and provides a possible mechanism for cellular phone interactions with human neurophysiology, it is not the only plausible mechanism. In order to determine the role of these particles in CNS physiology, it is necessary to observe them in relation to cells and structures in the nervous system either in tissue slices or cultures. H.

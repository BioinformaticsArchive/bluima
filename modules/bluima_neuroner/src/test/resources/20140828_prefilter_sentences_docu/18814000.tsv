18814000	Materials and methods  Patients  Between 2000 and 2008, 82 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, familial adenomatous polyposis, or miscellaneous disease, undergoing ileal pouchanal anastomosis under a total laparoscopic approach, were enrolled in this study. Reasons for not attempting laparoscopic approach were: several previous laparotomies (n = 9), rectal or T4 colic cancer (n = 7), and miscellaneous (anesthetic contraindication for laparoscopy, beginning of the experience, redo ileal pouchanal anastomosis, previous partial colectomy, etc.). Not only postoperative but also functional results were comparable to those reported after  Table 3 Major series of laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis in the literature<colspec colnum="5" colname="c5" align="char" "char="("/>  Author Date Number of Conversion Global Anastomotic Pelvic Reoperation Hospital patients rate morbidity leakage abscess stay (days)  Marcello [38] 2000 20 0 (0%) 4 (5%) 0 (0%) 1 (5%) 0 (0%) 7 (4–14) Ky [5] 2002 32 0 (0%) 11 (34%) 1 (3%) 1 (3%) 3 (9%) 6 (4–23) Kienkle [23] 2003 59 5 (8%) 20 (34%) 6 (10%) 1 (2%) 11 (19%) 15 (9–49) Maartense [13] 2004 30 0 6 (20%) 3 (10%) NA 3 (10%) 10 (5–31) Kienkle [22] 2005 50 8% 15 (30%) NA 4 (8%) 9 (18%) 12 (7–49) Larson [39] 2005 33 NA 2 (6%) 0 (0%) 1 (3%) 0 (0%) NA Larson [24] 2006 100 6 (6%) 33 (33%) 1 (1%) NA 3 (3%) 4 (3–22) Hasegawa [19] 2007 21 0 10 (48%) NA NA 1 (5%) 28 (14–72) Zhang [40] 2007 23 0 (0%) 5 (22%) 0 (0%) 1 (4%) 0 (0%) 9 (7–16) Polle [41] 2008 65 0 (0%) 16 (25%) 4 (6%) 1 (1%) 9 (14%) 9 (5–39) Present study 2008 82 9 (11%) 26 (32%) 7 (8%) 5 (6%) 5 (6%) 13 (7–45)  NA, not available  open approach.

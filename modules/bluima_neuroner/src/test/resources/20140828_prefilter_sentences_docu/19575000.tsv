Conclusion: The inhibition of airway relaxation and the augmentation of contraction mediated by receptors contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness and involve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. In vivo, bronchial hyperresponsiveness occurs because of a reduced threshold to a wide range of contractile stimuli acting either directly on bronchial smooth muscle via cell membrane receptors or indirectly through neural pathways and/or the release of bronchoconstrictive mediators from both inflammatory and structural cells. We hypothesize that the up-regulation of contractile receptors and/or down-regulation of dilator receptors in the airway, especially in bronchial smooth muscle cells, underlie hyperresponsiveness. Monoclonal antibodies against CD4+ T cells (OX35) and CD8+ T cells (OX8) were purified from supernatants of hybridomas using protein G affinity columns. Figure 8. Effects of OX35 (an antibody against CD4+ T cells) and OX8 (an antibody against CD8+ T cells) on relaxation mediated by isoprenaline, a β receptor agonist, of lobar bronchi of asthmatic E3 rats induced by ovalbumin. Effects of OX35 (an antibody against CD4+ T cells) and OX8 (an antibody against CD8+ T cells) on the contraction mediated by sarafotoxin 6c, an endothelin ETB receptor agonist, of lobar bronchi of asthmatic E3 rats induced by ovalbumin. We established an ovalbumin/ aluminum hydroxide-based asthma model in E3 rats that is similar to human allergic asthma in several respects[17] such as the Th-2 driven response to allergic sensitization, involvement of eosinophil infiltration of the airway, high levels of allergen specific IgE, increased number of CD4+ T cells in the phlegm of bronchi, incrassation of bronchial muscle, damage of bronchial epithelium, and infiltration by inflammatory cells. The amount of acetylcholine released from these nerves is limited locally by neuronal M2 muscarinic receptors. Both ETA and ETB receptors are present on smooth muscle cells of the airways and mediate strong contractions. The clearance of endothelin-1 in the airways through ETB receptors on epithelial cells is probably impaired, leading to enhanced access of endothelin-1 to underlying bronchial smooth muscle cells[27]. The production of relaxant factors such as nitric oxide is also compromised through endothelin-1 binding to receptors on epithelial cells. The contribution of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation has recently received increased attention [31]. Our results show that OX8 (an antibody against CD8+ T cells)  strongly and OX35 (an antibody against CD4+ T cells) modestly antagonize the inhibition of relaxation mediated by β2 adrenoceptors as well as the augmentation of contraction mediated by ETB receptors, suggesting that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells play important roles in airway hyperresponsiveness of asthmatic E3 rats and that CD8+ T cells are more potent than CD4+ T cells in asthma pathology. Our results support the suggestion that CD8+ T cells do contribute and might be necessary for airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic airway inflammation[32], and provide experimental evidence for the application of antibody against CD8 to treat asthma. CD8+ T cells, which are capable of secreting Th2 cytokines, have been described in asthmatic subjects and in animals sensitized and challenged with allergen. A subset of these IL-13producing CD8+ T cells, called effector memory CD8+ T cells in the mouse, express a high-affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (BLT1). A similar subset of CD8+/BLT1+/IL-13+ T cells has also been identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic subjects, suggesting a pathogenic role for this unique subset of CD8+ T cells in asthma. CD4+ T cells, particularly Th2 cells, play a pivotal role in allergic airway inflammation. Interactions between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in part through IL-4 during the sensitization phase, are essential to the development of CD8+IL-13+ T cell-dependent airway allergic inflammation [33]. The inhibition of relaxation and the augmentation of contraction contribute to airway hyperreactivity, and both processes involve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in asthmatic E3 rats. 16 Skripuletz T, Schmiedl A, Schade J, Bedoui S, Glaab T, Pabst R, et al.

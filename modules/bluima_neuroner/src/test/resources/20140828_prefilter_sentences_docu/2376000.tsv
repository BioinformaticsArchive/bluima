Shefner1 1Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612 (U.S.A.) and 2Department of Patho-Physiology, Medical Faculty Belgrade, Belgrade (Yugoslavia)  (Accepted 30 January 1990)  Key words: Alcohol; Ethanol; Pentobarbital; 7-Aminobutyric acid; ~,-AminobutyricacidA receptor; Locus coeruleus; Voltage clamp  y-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), pentobarbital and ethanol were applied by bath superfusion to rat locus coeruleus neurons in a brain slice preparation. Pentobarbital potentiated the GABA-induced current and conductance increase in all locus coeruleus neurons tested. In contrast, ethanol did not alter the current and conductance increase induced by bath application of GABA to locus coeruleus neurons. direct evidence comes from C1- flux studies, which have shown that ethanol stimulates GABA-activated Cl- uptake in  brainmembranevesiclesa'5°andinculturedneurons53.In some electrophysiological studies ethanol has been reported to potentiate GABA-mediated inhibition7'14'16' 29,3o,31,35, but in others, GABA responses were not affected by ethanol 8'13'24'26'28'48'56. We have shown that GABA strongly inhibits locus coeruleus neurons by activation of GABAA receptors thereby increasing membrane CI- conductance3s. Since the locus coeruleus has been implicated in behavioral arousal and anxiety41, modulation of GABA responses of locus coeruleus neurons by pentobarbital and ethanol may contribute to their sedative and anxiolytic actions. In the present study we investigated the effects of pentobarbital and ethanol on GABA responses in locus coeruleus neurons. Experiments were performed on locus coeruleus neurons in brain slices from male, Fisher 344 rats (100-200 g) obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Intracellular recordings were made from neurons in this area with glass microelectrodes filled with 2 M KCI. 1. pentobarbital potentiates GABA responses in locus coeruleus neurons. A: membrane currents recorded from an locus coeruleus neuron (a-c). B: I/V relation determined in the same locus coeruleus neuron: control (open circles), during bath application of 200 gM GABA (filled circles), during applicationof80gMPB(opensquares),andduringapplicationof200gMGABAinthepresenceof80gMPB(filledsquares).DatainGABA were obtained by measuring the initial peak amplitude of current pulse before the sag (as shown in part C, b and d). MI2 and were capable of passing steady positive and negative currents of more than 1 nA. locus coeruleus neurons were voltage-clamped with a discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp circuit (Axoclamp 2A) with a switching frequency of 3-6 kHz. B: I/V curves in an locus coeruleus neuron in the control condition (open circles), after addition of GABA (filled circles), in the presence of ethanol (open squares) and when G A B A was applied in the presence of ethanol (filled squares). Same neuron as in part A. Note that ethanol alone did not alter conductance (compare a and c) nor did it alter the current response to the voltage step in the presence of GABA (compare b and d).  Bath application of pentobarbital in concentrations of 80-200 gM consistently increased GABA-induced responses in all locus coeruleus neurons tested (n = 9). The concentrations of GABA used (100 gM-1 mM) were selected to give relatively small responses in order to avoid problems with desensitization or a possible ceiling effect; these concentrations are below the ECsofor GABA effects on locus coeruleus neurons determined in the slice preparation (1.7 mM) in our previous study38. The ECsovalue for GABA superfusion in our experiments is about two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for cultured or dissociated neurons, probably because of extensive uptake of GABA in slices, which we have not blocked. The predominant effect of GABA on locus coeruleus neurons is to increase CIconductancebyactivationofGABAAreceptors38.When KCl-filled recording electrodes are used, C1- leakage into the cell increases the intracellular C1- concentration and application of GABA leads to an inward current when measured under voltage-clamp conditions (CI- gradient is outward). The only direct effect of pentobarbital itself observed at the concentrations tested in our voltage-clamp experiments was a small increase in resting membrane conductance (5-15%) in 6 of 12 cells. The effect of bath application of ethanol was tested on currents elicited by bath application of GABA in 7 locus coeruleus neurons. Ethanol concentrations of 40-60 mM were used since these concentrations have been shown to cause potentiation of GABA-activated 36C1-flux2'4'53.In all 7 locus coeruleus neurons in which GABA (200 ~M-1 mM) was applied by bath superfusion, ethanol caused no potentiation of the GABA-induced current or conductance increase (Fig. 2A,B). The slope conductance measured in the presence of GABA was not increased by ethanol over the potential range studied in any of the neurons (see Fig. At holding potentials close to the resting membrane potential, ethanol itself caused no membrane current in 5 of 11 cells tested, and in the remaining 6 neurons elicited only very small outward membrane currents (10-15 pA). The present study demonstrates that pentobarbital enhances the GABA-induced current and conductance increase of locus coeruleus neurons in response to bath application of GABA. pentobarbital potentiated GABA responses in locus coeruleus neurons in concentrations at or below those required for surgical anesthesia (200-300 gM)42. This effect was clear and repeatable in all cells tested. This finding is consistent with the literature which indicates that pentobarbital potentiates GABAactivated responses in virtually all cell types and preparations tested (e.g. refs. Recently, single channel recordings on cultured neurons indicate that the underlying mechanism for this enhancement is that pentobarbital increases mean open time and the relative frequency of occurrence of the longest open state of GABA-activated CI- channels27. In contrast to pentobarbital, ethanol tested under the same conditions did not enhance the current or conductance increase induced by bath application of GABA to rat locus coeruleus neurons. These data are in agreement with preliminary reports of voltage-clamp studies of cultured rat hippocampal cells26 and isolated rat dorsal root ganglion cells56, which also found no potentiation of GABA-induced CI- currents. By contrast, a recent abstract reports ethanol potentiation of currents induced by bath application of GABA in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion cells35. Another voltage-clamp study describes ethanol potentiation of GABA currents seen when both ethanol and GABA were applied by pressure ejection to chick spinal cord neurons in culture14. The results of the present study and the other studies cited above indicate that GABA-induced CI- currents are generally potentiated by barbiturates, but in some neurons are not potentiated by ethanol. It is possible, therefore, that different isoforms of the GABAA/CI- channel complex may be expressed in different cell types and that some isoforms can be modulated by ethanol while others are not. The conflicting data found when individual brain regions and cell types are studied may be explained if expression of isoforms of the GABAA/C1- channel complex varies according to cell type, species or strain. Electrophysiological studies in hippocampus concur, in that ethanol has not been found to enhance GABA responses recorded in hippocampal pyramidal cells  1 Adams, ER., Constanti, A. and Banks, F.W., Voltage clamp analysis of inhibitory synaptic action in crayfish stretch receptor neurons, Fed. 5 Allan, A.M. and Harris, R.A., Involvement of neuronal chloride channels in ethanol intoxication, tolerance and dependence, Recent Dev. 8 Barker, J.L., Harrison, N.L., Lange, G.D. and Owen, D.G., Potentiation of ),-aminobutyric acid-activated chloride conductance by a steroid anaesthetic in cultured rat spinal neurons, J.

To our knowledge, no electrophysiological study of cerebellar Purkinje cells has demonstrated GABA potentiation1°'23,raising the possibility that if ethanol enhances cerebellar CI- currents in some species/strains, this may be occurring on cell types in the cerebellum other than Purkinje neurons. A preliminary report of a recent in vivo study indicates that the neurons of the medial septal nucleus show ethanol potentiation of GABA-induced inhibition, but cells in the lateral septum d o n o t 2°.

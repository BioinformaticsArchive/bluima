18671000	Adjacent to the lesions, the lens fibres sometimes appeared as bladder cells, which were swollen and spindle shaped, with retained nuclei. Focal proliferation of lens epithelial cells was found in the subcapsular regions of the annular pads and lens body (Figure 2). In all cases, neither cellular infiltration nor neovascularization was evoked, except one which coincidentally showed  Figure 1. Note no cellular reaction in the neighbouring tissue. Bar = 50 fim.)  of neovascularization and moderate infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells (Figure 8). The mucosal epithelium is hyperplastic, associated with mild infiltration of heterophils and plasma cells in the lamina propria. Neo-vascular formation and infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells are seen in the stroma of cornea. Overlying epithelial cellsshow hyperplasia. Many newly-formed capillaries and fibroblastic tissues were established, accompanied by slight infiltration of heterophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The inner stroma not only had many capillaries, but also showed severe oedema and cellular reaction. There appeared to be a cellular infiltration mainly plasma cells and lymphocytes between the two zones. In the suprachoroid layer there was a massive accumulation of eosinophilic fluid mixed with a few inflammatory cells. Most pigmented epithelial cells had disappeared and were replaced by bacterial clumps. The iris and ciliary body were heavily infiltrated by inflammatory cells, most of which were heterophils and plasma cells. In an advanced case, neo-vascular proliferation was evident with a predominance of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the inflammatory reaction. There is muck eosinophilic material associated with a few inflammatory cells in the superchoroid layer. The right side shows oedematous change with mild infiltration by inflammatory cells. The vitreous body shows necrotic change and contains many candidial blastosporesand a few inflammatory cells. Large pale or lightly basophilic inclusions were present in the germinatival cells of eyelids (Figure 16). Note no cellular reaction adjacent to the deposition site. The enlarged nuclei of the germinatival cells contain pale-staining inclusion bodies, associated with chromatin margination. pale-staining intranuclear inclusion bodies are present in the cells of the inner non-pigmented (arrowheads) and outer heavily pigmented layer (arrow) of the ciliary body. Papovavirus has an affinity for epithelial and lymphoreticular tissues, and endothelialcells(Passetal.,1987;Tsai,1987).Oneofthepathognomoniclesions is the presence of large pale or slightly basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the various organs (Davis et al., 1981;Bernier et al., 1981).

17941000	Considering that those drugs used in the combination therapy often share the metabolic pathways or cellular transport pathways, there could be high potential for pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic drug interactions between calcium channel antagonists and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Similarly, as the dual substrates of CYP3A4 and P-gp, verapamil and atorvastatin may undergo common metabolic pathways and/or cellular transport pathways after coadministration. Also other studies have shown that atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin inhibited rhodamine 123 (a P-gp probe) transport in a murine monocytic leukaemia cell line overexpressing P-gp [28,29]. Atorvastatin transport in the Caco-2 cell model: contributions of P-glycoprotein and proton-monocarboxylic acid co-transporter.

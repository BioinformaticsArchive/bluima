The specific tumor cells were isolated and collected from the tissues of six patients with lung squamous carcinoma cell by laser capture microdissection. Total proteins from the laser capture microdissection cells were extracted, digested with trypsin. The global protein profiles of lung squamous carcinoma cell cell were identified with BioworksTM software in IPI human protein database. About 720,000 tumor cells were satisfactorily collected from tissues of six patients with lung squamous carcinoma cell by laser capture microdissection and the homogeneities of cell population were estimated to be over  Y. Five candidate proteins, Prohibitin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, heat shock protein27, Annexin A1(annexin A1), and High mobility group protein B1, might play an important role in squamous carcinoma cell genesis, progression, recurrence, and metastasis according to relative literatures. We have successfully isolated the interesting cells and effectively solved the heterogeneous problem of lung squamous carcinoma cell using laser capture microdissection. The globally expressional proteins of lung squamous carcinoma cell cell were identified by shot-gun proteomics strategy. The five proteins might be hopefully used as markers of lung squamous carcinoma cell. Keywords Lung squamous cell carcinoma Laser capture microdissection  Shot-gun proteomics High-performance liquid chromatography Tandem mass spectrometry  Gene ontology  Introduction  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women in the world. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for almost 80% of lung cancers, of which 60% are lung squamous cell carcinoma (squamous carcinoma cell). Here, we collected tumor cells from the tissues of six patients with lung squamous carcinoma cell by laser capture microdissection and globally identified the expressional proteins with High-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Moreover, some proteins were screened as candidate biomarkers of lung squamous carcinoma cell by functional analysis and relative literature search. Materials and methods  Clinical materials  Six patients suffering from lung squamous carcinoma cell in this study were attended at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University from February 2005 to February 2007. Instruments and reagents  The instruments and reagents used in this study were included as follows: freezing microtome (MICROM/ HM5000, Germany), pixcell laser capture microdissection machine (Arcturus, USA), Ettan MDLC (GE healthcare, American), LTQ iontrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, American), C18 reverse phase column (RP, 180 lm 9 150 mm, BioBasic C18, 5 lm, Thermo Hypersil-Keystone), lysate (9.5 M urea, 65 mM DTT, 4%CHAPS, 0.2% IPG buffer), protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad Inc, American), acetonitrile (Sigma Inc, American), etc.  Preparation of tissue specimens  Tissues of lung squamous carcinoma cell were collected after operation immediately. Ten microliters of cell lysate buffer (9.5 M urea, 65 mM DTT, 4% CHAPS, 0.2% IPG buffer) were added to laser capture microdissection cap sample. Next, total solution was collected into an Eppendorf tube after caps were agitated on a platform shaker at 4 C for 30 min, and then cells were further crushed with ultrasound for 50 s. The cellular component, molecular function, biological process of the identified protein were analyzed using gene ontology method. The interested cells were collected on laser capture microdissection cap (Fig. 1d). Approximately 4,000 lasers hitting onto each laser capture microdissection cap yielded 12,000 cells in lung squamous carcinoma cell. A total of 720,000 tumor cells were satisfactorily collected from tissues of six patients with lung squamous carcinoma cell. The homogeneities of cell population on laser capture microdissection cap were estimated to be over 95% as determined by microscopic visualization. Separation and identification of peptide mixtures  Whole protein extracts of cells microdissected from tissues of six patients with lung squamous carcinoma cell underwent global proteolysis with trypsin, and the resulting complex peptide mixtures were desalted and separated using a surveyor High-performance liquid chromatography system on C18 reverse phase column (RP, 180 lm 9 150 mm). 1 laser capture microdissection process of NO. 1 lung squamous carcinoma tissue specimen: a 10 lm-thick cryostat section stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin (20 9 10 folds); b 8 lm-thick cryostat section stained with improved hematoxylin and eosin (20 9 10 folds) for laser capture microdissection; c Interstitial tissue remained on section after laser capture microdissection (20 9 10 folds); d Interested cells collected on laser capture microdissection cap (20 9 10 folds)  Fig. 1 laser capture microdissection process of NO. 1 lung squamous carcinoma tissue specimen: a 10 lm-thick cryostat section stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin (20 9 10 folds); b 8 lm-thick cryostat section stained with improved hematoxylin and eosin (20 9 10 folds) for laser capture microdissection; c Interstitial tissue remained on section after laser capture microdissection (20 9 10 folds); d Interested cells collected on laser capture microdissection cap (20 9 10 folds)  Fig. 2 The LC profile of peptide mixture of whole protein extracts of cell microdissected from lung squamous carcinoma patient set underwent global proteolysis with trypsin  Fig. 2 The LC profile of peptide mixture of whole protein extracts of cell microdissected from lung squamous carcinoma patient set underwent global proteolysis with trypsin  Fig. Functional analysis of the identified proteins  The cellular components, molecular functions, biological processes of the 1,982 proteins were analyzed using gene  Fig. About 789 (39.81%) proteins had definite subcellular localization and among them, 474 and 370 proteins were located on organelles and cytoplasm, respectively (Fig. 5). laser capture microdissection, a revolutionary technology in tumor study emerged in late 1990s, can exactly separate single cell or the same kind of cell population from complex tissues and effectively solve the problem of tissue heterogeneity [6]. We successfully isolated the interested tumor cells by laser capture microdissection and each type of cell populations was evaluated to be over 95% homogeneous, which was coincident with literatures [7, 8]. In this study, we identified 1,982 proteins from the laser capture microdissection cells of six cases of lung squamous carcinoma cell by the integrated shot-gun proteomics strategy. Five candidate proteins, namely, Prohibitin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, heat shock protein27, annexin A1, and High mobility group protein B1, were selected as potential markers of lung squamous carcinoma cell by further referring to relevant literatures. Prohibitin inhibits DNA synthesis and regulates cell proliferation. It is involved in both the initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and post-mitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. RNAi-mediated suppression of LIV-1 in HeLa cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasive ability, but had no effect on cell apoptosis. They demonstrated that invasion of cervical cancer cells was involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated snail and slug expression. heat shock protein27 expression levels of irinotecan-non-responder were significantly higher compared to those of irinotecanresponder, which suggested that heat shock protein27 was involved in  the irinotecan resistance of colorectal cancer cells possibly by reducing caspase-3 activity. Increased annexin A1 expression has been found in pancreatic, breast, hepatic, 4. glial, and stomach cancers. In contrast, reduced expression 5. of annexin A1 has been seen in prostate cancers and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Akaike et al. [15] found that high mobility group box chromosomal protein-1 expression in gastric cancer cells was positively correlated with the degree of macrophage infiltration inside the tumor microenviron- 9. ment. Kuniyasu et al. [16] found that High mobility group protein B1 could induce 11. growth inhibition and apoptosis in macrophages through RAGE intracellular signaling pathway. revealed the expression protein profiles of lung squamous carcinoma cell.

Keller, Mara E. Klein, Laura S. Schmidt, W. Histopathological analysis showed extramedullary hematopoiesis in liver and spleen and higher cellularity in bone marrow, which could be described as myeloproliferative disease. KO bone marrow cells formed significantly more colonies in methylcellulose than control bone marrow cells. Hematopoietic stem cell population (lin-, c-kit+, Sca1+) was expanded in KO spleen as well as KO bone marrow. To elucidate whether folliculin gene deficiency causes a cell autonomous effect or an environmental effect, we performed bone marrow transplantation experiments. KO donor cells recapitulated a phenotype identical to the original KO phenotype, indicating that loss of folliculin gene resulted in hematopoietic stem cell expansion and myeloproliferative disease in a cell autonomous manner. These experimental data indicate that folliculin gene has a physiological role in regulating the hematopoietic stem cell population and the granulo-macrophagy lineage population. Cash1, M. C. Simon2  1University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA; 2Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD  We have previously demonstrated that loss of Folliculin results in cellular resistance to apoptosis due to aberrant TGFb-mediated transcription1. We also investigated the effect of Folliculin loss on known levels of Smad-specific repressors; intriguingly all repressors examined were upregulated in Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ null UOK-257 cells and Bhd deficient ES cells. O-03 Regulation of folliculin gene protein by Von-Hippel Lindau disease and microRNAs in renal clear cell carcinoma (renal cancer carcinoma)  Maria Czyzyk-Krzeska, Prabhat Bastola, Emily Kellner, Jacek Biesiada, Jarek Meller  University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, USA  Sporadic renal cancer carcinoma is frequently characterized by an early loss of the Von-Hippel Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene. Importantly, we measured significant reverse correlation between levels of miR-511 and folliculin gene protein in the kidneys adjacent to Von-Hippel Lindau disease-negative renal cancer carcinoma tumors, and the treatment of renal cancer carcinoma cells with miR-511 resulted in repression of folliculin gene protein expression, an implication that folliculin gene is a miR-511 target. Analysis of renal cancer carcinoma cell lines with reconstituted Von-Hippel Lindau disease tumor suppressor, reveals higher levels of folliculin gene protein as compared to Von-Hippel Lindau disease(-) cell lines. These data implicate that increase in folliculin gene protein level in the kidney adjacent to the Von-Hippel Lindau disease(-) renal cancer carcinoma tumors may regulate the source of the nutrients utilized by kidney epithelial cells affected by tumor growth. O-04 Our journey with an in vivo model of Birt-Hogg-Dube disease: success, failure and histiocytic sarcoma  Anders Dydensborg, Julianna Blagih, Sylvie Sabourin, Russel Jones, Arnim Pause  McGill University, Montreal, Canada  Current mouse models of Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ syndrome suffers from several drawbacks that makes them suboptimal tools for in vivo studies of the renal cell carcinoma that Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ predisposes for. Although this phenotype is very impressive and serves to underscore the importance of folliculin protein in renal cell homeostasis it does not mimic the disease very well insofar the animals do not develop any tumors in their short lifespan. Kidney-targeted Birt-Hogg-Dube gene inactivation in a mouse model: Erk1/2 and Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin activation, cell hyperproliferation, and polycystic kidneys. Tomassetti, S., Carloni, A., Chilosi, M., Maffe, A., Ungari, S., Sverzellati, N., Gurioli, C., Casoni, G., Romagnoli, M., Ravaglia, C., et al. (2011). O-05 Loss of Folliculin causes aerobic glycolysis in an experimental oncocytic cell system: involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase and PGC1a  Anders Dydensborg, Rachael Preston, Ming Yan, Daina Avizonis, Sylvie Sabourin, Russel Jones, Maurice Van Steensel, Andrew R. Tee, Arnim Pause  McGill University, Montreal, Canada  Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ patients are at increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma, primarily of the oncocytoma and hybrid oncocytoma type. We show here that reintroduction of folliculin gene into a tumor cell line originating from a Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ patient (UOK257) results in a reduction of mitochondrial DNA. As AMP-activated protein kinase is a positive regulator of PGC-1a (Jager et al., 2007) that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function, we tested the expression of PGC-1a in both UOK257 cells and folliculin gene KO Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts and observe and strong increase in expression in these cells. We demonstrate that folliculin gene negatively regulates AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in both nematodes and mammalian cells. Moreover, we show an increase in lifespan/survival upon deletion of folliculin gene in both nematodes and mammalian cells, which is strictly dependent on autophagy. Loss of folliculin gene results in an AMP-activated protein kinase dependent increase in lifespan in both nematodes and mammalian cells, which is mediated by autophagy. Marston Linehan  Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD  Birt-Hogg-Dube′ (Birt–Hogg–Dube ́) syndrome confers an increased risk of renal neoplasia, which most frequently consists of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and hybrid oncocytic neoplasms. Ultrastructurally, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma contain varying numbers of mitochondria, which may enhance their eosinophilic staining in H&E stained sections. Previously we showed that Folliculin (folliculin gene)-interacting proteins FNIP1 and FNIP2 also interact with 5′-AMP–activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase), an important energy sensor in cells that negatively regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin. Although these findings may suggest the potential involvement of folliculin gene in cell metabolism, it remains to be elucidated how folliculin gene may regulate metabolic pathways. To investigate the role of folliculin gene in cell metabolism, we developed a musclespecific Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ knockout model by crossing Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ conditional knockout mice with mck(muscle creatine kinase)-Cre transgenic mice. Calender, S. Richard Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon cedex 03, France Germline mutations in the folliculin gene are associated with predisposition for Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ syndrome, characterized by skin fibrofolliculomas, multiple lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax and various types of renal cell carcinomas. Our hypothesis is that if a protective, mutation-proof copy of the folliculin gene could be introduced into the renal cells of Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ patients these cells would become resistant to Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-associated renal neoplasia. As the toxic consequences of some methods of gene delivery, particularly viruses, can considerably alter the vitality of a cell and its progeny we have generated safer non-viral vectors. These constructs are designed to be maintained in extra-chromosomal loci in the host cells and to provide regulated gene expression for safe, efficient and sustained gene therapy without the limitations of toxicity or insertional mutagenesis. We will describe the simple methodology for the generation of folliculin expressing cells lines using these vectors. We have utilized our constructs to generate a range of stable cell lines based on the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ cancer cell line (UOK257). We have also investigated their cellular viability and growth rates of cells with restored folliculin gene expression. We show a clear difference in these parameters between folliculin gene + UOK257 cells and untransfected controls and demonstrate the restoration of folliculin gene regulation in the TGF-b pathway in these cells. Additionally, we have injected these supplemented cells into immunodeficient mice and will describe the differences in Xenografts between the folliculin supplemented cells and their knockout controls. In combination, the proof-of-concept studies where folliculin can be safely and persistently restored to Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ cells and the new methodology for the effective delivery of these DNA vectors suggests the potential of utilizing S/MAR plasmid vectors for the genetic correction of Birt–Hogg–Dube ́. To prevent such an outcome, organisms possess a mechanism to eliminate cells carrying O6-Methylguanine by inducing apoptosis in a mismatch repair protein-dependent manner. To understand the molecular mechanism of O6-Methylguanine-induced apoptosis, we carried out retrovirus-mediated gene-trap mutagenesis, followed by the selection of MNU-resistant clones from MNUsensitive Mgmt -/- cells. The flag-tagged MAPO1 protein expressed in cells was revealed to be associated with folliculin gene and AMP-activated protein kinase. By the introduction of siRNAs specific for these genes, the production of sub-G1 population of cells following MNU treatment was severely suppressed, suggesting the important role of MAPO1-containing protein complex in the induction of apoptosis triggered by O6-Methylguanine. FNIP1 or FNIP2 knockdown in HT1080 cells by siRNAs increased TFE3 transcriptional activity as measured by increased expression of glycoprotein NMB, a transcriptional target of TFE3. The majority of tumours showed characteristics of both eosinophilic variants of clear cell and chromophobe carcinoma. In order to identify the phosphorylated residues in folliculin gene we performed whole cell metabolic labeling with radioactive orthophosphate followed by folliculin gene immunoprecipitation, tryptic digestion, HPLC separation and Edman degradation. The proband presented with typical cutaneous manifestations with fibrofolliculomas and was subsequently diagnosed with a renal cell carcinoma at the age of 36 years. In order to develop novel therapeutic approaches for Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-associated renal cancer carcinoma, and possibly sporadic renal cell carcinoma, we adopted a strategy to identify potential synthetic-lethal targets by knockdown of specific enzymes in a pair of isogenic renal cancer carcinoma UOK-257 cell line with/ without folliculin gene expression. Both UOK257-folliculin gene- and UOK257-folliculin gene+ cells were examined for their cellular viability after transfected by individual siRNAs. The ratio of cell viability from UOK257-folliculin gene+ and UOK257-folliculin gene were calculated and used as indicators for the sensitivity to mutant folliculin gene cells. In the subsequent screens, seven positive hits were selected by a combination of (a) dose-dependent increase in caspase3/7 activity in FLCNmutant UOK-257 cells and (b) cell viability assay results. Each positive hit was then further investigated in the UOK cell line and in a second pair of isogenic cell lines with/without folliculin gene expression  (thyroid carcinoma FTC-133 cell line). This approach indicated that potential synthetic lethal targets for folliculin gene null cells could be identified through siRNA library screening. In addition to two-dimensional cell culture, we investigate this using three-dimensional culture models suitable to study the effects of (mutant) folliculin on cyst formation in vitro. Marston Linehan, Ming-Hui Wei, Jorge R. Toro DC-VA Medical Center, Washington, DC and National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD Background: hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer is the autosomal dominant predisposition to uterine and cutaneous leiomyomas and renal cell cancer. Patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer develop solitary, segmental and/or disseminated CLs. Patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer had a detailed dermatologic exam and CLs were photographed and mapped on drawings. DNA was extracted from the collection of cells and genotyped with one intragenic fumarate hydratase marker and 12 polymorphic markers surrounding the fumarate hydratase locus covering a 17 kb region. Results: A total of 85 of cutaneous leiomyomas were biopsied from 47 individuals with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. To investigate the functional consequences of second allele inactivation, we measured the fumarate hydratase enzyme activity in 10 CLs from three hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer patients. Conclusion: This is the largest comprehensive molecular and genetic investigation of cutaneous leiomyomas from hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer patients with a known germline fumarate hydratase mutation. Our findings suggest that segmental cutaneous leiomyomas may arise from a second hit in an early progenitor cell. In contrast, second hits in independent lesions occur later and randomly in immediate precursor smooth muscle-like differentiated cells. O-20 Folliculin deficiency leads to defects in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion  Douglas Medvetz, Damir Khabibullin, Qi Wei, Venkatesh Hariharan, Hayden Huang, Elizabeth Henske Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA Introduction: Birt-Hogg-Dube (Birt–Hogg–Dube ́) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome associated with facial skin tumors (folliculomas), renal cell carcinoma, and destructive lung disease. We have discovered that folliculin gene loss leads to increased cell-cell and decreased cell-matrix adhesion. Methods: UOK257 (Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-null cells derived from a human Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ renal tumor, a gift from Laura Schmidt and Marston Linehan at the NIH) and UOK257-2 (Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ re-expressing UOK257 cells) cells were used. Cell-cell adhesion was analyzed in vitro by the hanging drop and wound healing assays along with electron microscopy. Cell-matrix adhesion was monitored by quantifying the number of cells that remained attached after incubation in media lacking calcium and magnesium (low attachment media). Results: In the hanging drop assay the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ re-expressing cells were present as single cells *85% of the time while the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-null cells were only present as single cells *10% of the time. On the other hand, the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-null cells formed clusters of 3 or more cells *60% of the time, with the vast majority (40%) being present in clusters of 10 or more cells. There were relatively no Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ reexpressing cells in clusters of 3 or more cells. In the wound healing assay the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ re-expressing cells closed the wound significantly faster than the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-null cells in experiments up to 80 h (P \ 0.05). Electron microscopy showed abnormally appearing and increased numbers of cell junctional complexes in the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-null cells. In the cell-matrix adhesion experiments *80% of the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ re-expressing cells remained attached to the plate compared to *45% of the Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-null cells (P \ 0.05). Conclusions: Our data indicate that folliculin gene loss leads to increased cellcell adhesion and decreased cell-matrix adhesion which may explain the phenotypic outcomes in Birt–Hogg–Dube ́. Pathogenic missense and inframe-deletion folliculin gene mutations that impaired folliculin tumour suppressor function significantly disrupted the stability of the folliculin gene gene product but two missense substitutions initially considered to be putative mutations did not impair protein stability, growth suppression activity or intracellular localisation of folliculin. O-23 Novel fumarate hydratase mutations in families with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer and patients with isolated type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma  V. Slama, P. Rustin, M. Barrois, S. Deveaux, International hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer Group, INCa, B. Bressac-de Paillerets, S. Richard  Ge ́ne ́tique Oncologique EPHE, INSERM U753, Institut de cance ́rologie Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France  Background: hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer is an autosomal dominant disorder predisposing humans to cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas; in 20% of affected families, type 2 papillary renal cell cancers (PRCCII) also occur with aggressive course and poor prognosis. hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer results from heterozygous  germline mutations in the tumour suppressor fumarate hydratase gene. Methods: As part of the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) `Inherited predispositions to kidney cancer' network, sequence analysis and a functional study of fumarate hydratase were preformed in 56 families with clinically proven or suspected hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer and in 23 patients with isolated PRCCII (5 familial and 18 sporadic). Results: The study identified 32 different germline fumarate hydratase mutations (15 missense, 6 frameshifts, 4 nonsense, 1 deletion/insertion, 5 splice site, and 1 complete deletion) in 40/56 (71.4%) families with proven or suspected hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer and in 4/23 (17.4%) probands with PRCCII alone, including 2 sporadic cases. Conclusions: This study identified and characterised 21 novel fumarate hydratase mutations and demonstrated that PRCCII can be the only one manifestation of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Due to the incomplete penetrance of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, the authors propose to extend the fumarate hydratase mutation analysis to every patient with PRCCII occurring before 40 years of age or when renal tumour harbours characteristic histologic features, in order to discover previously ignored hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer affected families. To investigate folliculin regulated pathways we analysed folliculin expressing and folliculin null FTC133 and UOK257 cell lines using the Kinexus KAM-1.2 antibody array that contains *500 pan-specific antibodies for protein expression and 300 phospho-sitespecific antibodies for phosphorylation status. Initial screening experiments revealed 73 proteins differentially expressed (normalised ratio [1.5) in the FTC133 paired cell lines and 25 proteins in UOK257. 5 proteins were altered in both pairs of cell lines. To prioritise proteins for further investigation we compared the results obtained in FTC133 cells to those of gene expression microarray (Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array) in the same cell lines. Immunoblotting confirmed that an increased level of expression of Ste20-like Kinase SLK in the presence of folliculin gene in both cell lines. In view of the alteration in mammalian target of rapamycin signalling the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, rapamycin was administered to determine the effect on protein expression and reduced expression of SLK was restored in rapamycin treated folliculin null FTC133 cells. In both patients partial nephrectomy was performed revealing a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma in one and a combination of clear cell and chromophobe carcinoma in the other. O-26 Folliculin knockdown affects growth factor signalling in human bronchial epithelial cells and provides mechanistic insights into the cause of lung cyst formation in Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ syndrome  Claire Scott University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ syndrome is associated with cyst formation in the lung but the link with the folliculin gene mutations which cause this disease remains unknown. We reasoned that the folliculin protein may participate in key growth signalling events that regulate airway epithelial cell turnover. As epidermal growth factor drives this process in lung, we tested the hypothesis that changes in folliculin protein expression alters downstream signaling from the epidermal growth factor receptor using an immortalised human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o or `HBE'). Comparisons were made with control cells which had been treated similarly using an empty expression vector or a randomised siRNA control (Allstars; Qiagen). After transfection, cells were exposed to 10 ng ml-1 epidermal growth factor for 6 h and the effects of each treatment on downstream signaling to ERK1/2 and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 was examined by western blotting. epidermal growth factor treatment raised ERK1/2 and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activity in control cells and this pattern of induction was not altered by folliculin protein overexpression. Expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9, a key regulator of lung epithelial cell turnover and basement membrane remodelling, was also suppressed in folliculin protein siRNAtreated cells suggesting that folliculin protein expression is critical for maintaining epithelial integrity in lung. Endogenous ERK1/2 activity was suppressed in  folliculin protein +/- Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts compared to wild-type cells and, in common with our HBE siRNA experiments, showed no induction with epidermal growth factor. Analysis of the growth characteristics of these cells in linear and 3-dimensional culture demonstrated that folliculin protein knockdown produced a markedly lower rate of growth compared to wild-type cells. We conclude that folliculin protein knockdown in HBE cells suppresses epidermal growth factor signalling and matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity, two critical regulators of epithelial membrane integrity in the lung. This may be linked to a reduction in the growth potential of cells bearing low levels of folliculin protein expression. Van Moorselaar, Jan-Hein Van Waesberghe, Arjen R. Mensenkamp, Fred H. Menko  University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by skin piloleiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and papillary renal cancer, due to germline mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene. Recently, metastatic renal cancer presented in an 18-year-old woman from a family with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. We here describe patient and family data and discuss current data on renal cancer risk and the options for surveillance in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Mark Davies, Stephen C. Land, Arnim Pause, Keith Baar, Maurice A.M. van Steensel Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom Under conditions of reduced tissue oxygenation, hypoxia-inducible factor controls many processes, including angiogenesis and cellular metabolism, and also influences cell proliferation and survival decisions. hypoxia-inducible factor is centrally involved in tumour growth in inherited diseases that give rise to renal cell carcinoma (renal cancer carcinoma), such as Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. For this, we analysed a BirtHogg-Dube ́ patient-derived renal tumour cell line (UOK257) that is devoid of the Birt-Hogg-Dube ́ protein (Birt–Hogg–Dube ́) and observed high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor activity. Our data also reveal that UOK257 cells have high lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Together with increased protein levels of GLUT1, our data reveal that UOK257 cells favour glycolytic rather than lipid metabolism (a cancer phenomenon termed the `Warburg effect'). UOK257 cells also possessed a higher expression level of the Llactate influx monocarboxylate transporter 1 and consequently utilized L-lactate as a metabolic fuel. As a result of their higher dependency on glycolysis, we were able to selectively inhibit the growth of these UOK257 cells by treatment with 2-deoxyglucose as well as oxamate. O-30 National Cancer Institute/Urologic Oncology Branch Human Tumor Cell Line Repository - Novel hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer Cell Line UOK262: In-Vitro and In-Vivo Model of an Aberrant Energy Metabolic Pathway in Human Cancer  Youfeng Yang, Cathy D. Marston Linehan  National Cancer Institute/Urologic Oncology Branch, Bethesda, USA The Human Renal Tumor Cell Line Repository is established by the Urologic Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute and provides scientists with the cell lines as both in vitro and in vivo models for studying kidney cancer at the preclinical, genetic, cytogenetic and molecular levels, for accelerating discoveries of disease gene regulatory pathway and function. Energy deregulation and abnormalities of tumor cell metabolism are critical issues in our understanding of cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer) is an aggressive form of hereditary renal cell carcinoma (renal cancer carcinoma) characterized by germline mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase. hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer-associated renal cancer carcinoma is known to be highly metastatic and unusually lethal. fumarate hydratase -/hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer-associated kidney cancer is thus a potentially unique model in which to study the genetic basis of the bioenergetic abnormalities of cancer described by Otto Warburg. There is significant utility in establishing novel preclinical cell and xenograft models for studying disorders of energy metabolism as well as development of new therapeutic approaches to targeting Krebs cycle deficient human cancers, such as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer associated kidney cancer. We have developed a unique kidney cancer cell line from an hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer patient with a germline mutation of fumarate hydratase, designated UOK 262. UOK 262 cells demonstrate compromised oxidative phosphorylation and in vitro dependence on anaerobic glycolysis consistent with the clinical manifestation of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. UOK 262 xenografts retain the characteristics of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer  histopathology; restored wild type fumarate hydratase (UOK262WT) in UOK262 can completely suppress tumorigenesis in xenograt model and restored OXPHOS efflux function in their mitochondria. We recently demonstrated the glucose-mediated generation of cellular reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen species dependent hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in UOK 262. To our knowledge, UOK 262 is the only cell line to date derived from a hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer patient tumor from retro cava lymph node, and thus becomes an atypical in vitro and in vivo preclinical model with which to study the de-regulated molecular pathways of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer and to evaluate novel approaches to treating a genetically defined cancer that is the embodiment of the Warburg hypothesis. The repository provides not only extensively-multilevel-characterized, immortalized cell lines, which is clearly invaluable resource for cancer research, but also related clinical annotation, both subjected to rigorous quality controls by the Urologic Oncology Branch tissue procurement repository team. National Cancer Institute/Urologic Oncology Branch has made statements of capability or interest from parties interested in collaborative research to further develop, evaluate, or commercialize particular UOK cell lines through National Cancer Institute Technology Transfer Center. UOK 262 cell line, fumarate hydratase deficient (fumarate hydratase(-)/fumarate hydratase(-)) hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma: in vitro and in vivo model of an aberrant energy metabolic pathway in human cancer.

P-03 Expression analysis of transmembrane glycoprotein NMB in patients with sporadic renal cell carcinomas  Ying Huang, Masariho Yao, Masaya Baba, Hisashi Hasumi, Yukiko Hasumi, Seung-Beom Hong, Laura S. Schmidt, W. In this research, we measured glycoprotein NMB expression in sporadic primary renal cell carcinomas and evaluated its significance and prognostic utility. Methods: We examined glycoprotein NMB expression in 113 sporadic primary renal cell carcinomas, 2 kidney tumors from Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ patients, as well as 9 normal kidney tissue samples by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Among the sporadic renal cell carcinomas, glycoprotein NMB expression was significantly higher in all renal cancer carcinoma subtypes except oncocytoma compared with normal kidney tissues. In clear cell renal cancer carcinoma, which is the most common histologic subtype, Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses determined that glycoprotein NMB was significantly correlated with patient prognosis. Clear cell renal cancer carcinoma patients in the lowexpression group showed better outcomes than those in the high-expression group in a cancerspecific survival test (P = 0.0075). Conclusion: glycoprotein NMB showed high expression in sporadic renal cell carcinomas as well as renal tumors from Birt–Hogg–Dube ́ patients, and its expression level may provide useful prognostic information for patients with clear cell renal cancer carcinoma. This result may suggest the existence of a common signaling pathway between Birt–Hogg–Dube ́-associated kidney tumors and sporadic renal cell carcinomas that could affect patient prognosis. Sporadic oncocytic tumors of the parotid gland are known to be frequently associated with disruptive mitochondrial DNA mutations, where they have been indicated to largely contribute to the occurrence of the oncocytic phenotype (Porcelli et al., 2010; Gasparre et al., 2010). Porcelli et al., 2010. M. van Steensel Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff, United Kingdom Under conditions of reduced tissue oxygenation, hypoxia-inducible factor controls many processes, including angiogenesis and cellular metabolism, and also influences cell proliferation and survival decisions. hypoxia-inducible factor is centrally involved in tumour growth in inherited diseases that give rise to renal cell carcinoma (renal cancer carcinoma), such as Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. For this, we analysed a BirtHogg-Dube ́ patient-derived renal tumour cell line (UOK257) that is devoid of the Birt-Hogg-Dube ́ protein (Birt–Hogg–Dube ́) and observed high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor activity. Our data also reveal that UOK257 cells have high lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Together with increased protein levels of GLUT1, our data reveal that UOK257 cells favour glycolytic rather than lipid metabolism (a cancer phenomenon termed the `Warburg effect'). UOK257 cells also possessed a higher expression level of the Llactate influx monocarboxylate transporter 1 and consequently utilized L-lactate as a metabolic fuel. As a result of their higher dependency on glycolysis, we were able to selectively inhibit the growth of these UOK257 cells by treatment with 2-deoxyglucose. Previous studies have shown folliculin gene to be involved in multiple signalling pathways within the cell.

19327000	PyNTTTTGT Prototype Oligonucleotide IMT504, a Novel Effective Adjuvant of the foot-and-mouth disease virus DNA Vaccine  Gan Zhao, Huali Jin, Jinyao Li, Baowei Su, Xiaogang Du, Youmin Kang, Xiao Wang, and Bin Wang  Abstract  Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides such as CpG can stimulate B and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in vertebrate immune systems. Several studies showed that non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides could also induce strong stimulation of B and T cells. PyNTTTTGT oligodeoxynucleotides, non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, can activate and cause immunoglobulin secretion by B cells and proliferation of T cells in vivo. By using PyNTTTTGT oligodeoxynucleotides as an adjuvant for a foot-and-mouth disease virus DNA vaccine, we found that levels of antibody production, T-cell proliferation, and CTL activity were significantly increased compared with the DNA vaccine alone. Compared with the adjuvant effects of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides on DNA vaccination, similar levels of antibody production and T-cell proliferation, and higher levels of CTL activity and IFN-γ expression in CD8 T cells were induced by the IMT504 oligodeoxynucleotides. DNA vaccines are a new approach to vaccination, and can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses that protect the animals against a variety of infectious agents without introducing the infectious components of viruses (6,16), and are good candidates for safer vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease virus. Among these adjuvants, the CpG dinucleotides have been demonstrated to be effective stimulators of a variety of types of immune cells in vitro and in vivo (9). Although widely used in animals, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides containing CG motifs that interact with TLR9 on APCs have thus far found to be less effective in humans, since TLR9 is not effectively expressed in human cells (5). PyNTTTTGT ODN (wherein Py is C or T, and N is A, T, C, or G), a non-CpG ODN, has recently been demonstrated to stimulate B lymphocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in vitro (3). In monkeys of the species Cebus paella, ODN IMT504 can increase the level of total IgG and stimulate spleen cells to secrete IFN-γ in vitro when combined with HBsAg vaccine (4). We evaluated its adjuvant effects and its ability to induce both humoral and cellular responses by comparing DNA plus CpG ODN to DNA vaccine alone. Our results show that ODN IMT504 can enhance the immunogenicity of foot-and-mouth disease virus DNA vaccine by increasing both humoral and cellular immune responses. foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1 peptide representing the T-cell epitope (aa133-147, SSKYG DTSTNNVRGD) was synthesized by GL Biochem Co., Ltd. T-cell proliferation assays  The mice immunized with pcD-VP1 plus ODN adjuvant were sacrificed and suspensions of lymphocytes from the spleens were prepared on day 7 after the third injection as described previously (18), and they were incubated in triplicate on 96-well plates at 2105 cells/well, in RPMI-1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator with stimulation by 10 μg/mL of Con A (positive control), 10 μg/mL GST-VP1 (specific antigen), 10 μg/mL of BSA (nonspecific antigen), or without antigen (negative control) for 48 h. T-cell proliferation was evaluated using the MTT method and OD values of the plates were read at 570 nm by a plate reader ( Magellan; Tecan Austria GmbH, ) after 4 h of incubation with MTT (8). Analysis of expression of intracellular cytokines  For the intracellular cytokine assay, T cells were isolated on day 7 after the third immunization. T cells at a concentration of 1106 cells/100 μL were stimulated in a 96-well plate with VP1 peptide (5 μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/mL) mAb (BD PharMingen) for 12 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. The cells were blocked with 0.3 μL of Fcγ mAb (0.5 μg/mL; BD PharMingen) for 15 min at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 15 min before permeabilization with 0.1% saponin at 4°C for 10 min. The cells were stained with isotype controls, or double stained with anti-CD4-FITC (BD PharMingen) plus anti-IL-4 PE (BD PharMingen), anti-CD8 PE (BD PharMingen) plus anti-IFN-γ FITC (BD PharMingen), or anti-CD4 PE (BD PharMingen) and anti-IFN-γ FITC (BD PharMingen) for 30 min at 4°C. In-vivo cytotoxic assay  In-vivo cytotoxic assay was performed as previously described (13) by the use of single suspension splenocytes from naive C57BL/6 mice pulsed with 10–6 M of VP1 peptide (SSKYGDTSTNNVRGD) and labeled with a high concentration of CFSE (2.5 μM, CFSEhigh) as the target cells. Each mouse was injected with 2107 cells after mixing with an equal number of labeled cells from both fractions into a tail vein on day 7 after the third immunization. The labeled target cells from the spleens of mice were removed and analyzed 4 h later, after transfer of their differential CFSE fluorescence intensities by the FACS Calibur. IMT504 ODN as adjuvant enhances the T-cell proliferative response  To further evaluate whether IMT504 ODN as adjuvant can influence the T-cell response, lymphocytes isolated from the mice on day 7 after the third immunization were stimulated with GST-VP1 protein as the specific antigen, ConA as a positive control, BSA as a nonspecific control, and medium as negative control. The proliferative response was significantly higher in the group co-immunized with pcD-VP1 plus IMT504 ODN or CpG ODN, and similarly high levels of proliferative responses were seen compared to the group immunized with pcD-VP1 alone or pcD-VP1 plus the control IMT022 ODN (Fig. 2), indicating that IMT504 ODN as adjuvant promotes the antigen-specific T-cell response to the VP1 DNA vaccine. The level of antigen-specific IFN-γ expression in CD8) T cells indicates CTL activity, an ability to kill target cells. T-cell proliferation in response to ODN adjuvants. T cells were isolated from animals in all groups on day 35 after the first immunization and stimulated with GST-VP1 E. coli-expressed protein as specific antigen, ConA as positive control stimulant, or BSA as non-specific antigen. A T-cell proliferation assay was analyzed using MTT and expressed as stimulation index (*p < 0.05). T cells were purified from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice on day 35 after the first immunization and stimulated for 12 h with foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1 peptide in vitro. The stimulated T cells were fixed and permeabilized before performing intracellular staining with anti-IL-4 and anti-CD4) (A), anti-IFN-γ and anti-CD4) (B), and anti-IFN-γ and anti-CD8) (C) T cells. The percentages of positive cells are shown in each dot plot in the gated area and are representative of three independent experiments. 3.  examined the expression of the antigen-specific cytokines IL-4 and IFN-γ of CD4) T cells with an intracellular cytokine staining method (13) by FACS on day 7 after the third immunization. 3A and B, the expression of antigen-induced IL-4 and IFN-γ in CD4) T cells from mice immunized with pcD-VP1 plus IMT504 ODN was significantly higher than that seen with pcD-VP1 alone or pcD-VP1 plus the control IMT022 ODN, but slightly less than that seen with pcD-VP1 plus CpG ODN. The expression of antigeninduced IFN-γ in CD8) cells from mice immunized with pcD-VP1 plus IMT504 ODN was significantly higher than that seen with pcD-VP1 alone or pcD-VP1 plus the control IMT022 ODN, and higher than that seen with pcD-VP1 plus CpG ODN (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that IMT504 ODN as an adjuvant for VP1 DNA vaccine can elevate expression of both Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines, with comparable or higher levels in CD8) T cells, with CpG ODN stimulation. In-vivo cytotoxic response To examine whether the IMT504 ODN as adjuvant can induce an antigen-specific cytotoxic response, we transferred CFSE-stained and the peptide-labeled and non-labeled na ̈ıve T cells into mice previously immunized three times. 4, the highest percentage of antigen-specific lysis against the target cells was approximately 65.4%, from the mice immunized with pcD-VP1 plus IMT504 ODN, whereas it was 51.1% with pcD-VP1 plus CpG ODN, and 36.1% and  (Continued)  31.2% with pcD-VP1 plus IMT022 ODN and pcD-VP1 alone, respectively. These data suggest that IMT504 ODN as adjuvant could preferentially enhance antigen-specific CTL activity in CD8) T cells in vivo compared with CpG ODN as adjuvant, which is consistent with the earlier results seen for expression of IFN-γ in CD8) T cells, as shown in Fig. To analyze foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1-specific cytotoxicity in vivo, splenocytes isolated from naive C57BL/6 mice were mixed with CFSEhigh with target peptides as the specific target cells, and CFSElow as the control cells, and were injected IV into various immunized groups of C57BL/6 mice on day 7 after the third immunization. cellular responses when used with the foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1 DNA vaccine. In the T-cell proliferative assay, we observed that ODN IMT504 and CpG equally induced T-cell proliferation (Fig. 2), and intracellular cytokine expression in CD4) T cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, we observed that ODN IMT504 induced the highest expression of IFN-γ in CD8) T cells of all the agents tested (Fig. 3C), a finding that is further supported by the results of the in-vivo CTL assay shown in Fig 4. This result suggests that ODN IMT504 more effectively promotes the cell-mediated response than CpG does. DNA vaccine is an attractive vaccination approach to elicit both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. For example, dsRNA activates APCs to produce type I IFNs through a TLR3-independent intracellular sensor, RIG-I, during RNA viral infection (14). Recent reports have demonstrated that there are cytosolic DNA sensors, dependent activator of IFNregulatory factors (DNA-dependent activator of IFNregulatory factors), also known as DLM-1/ZBP1, which can initiate innate immune responses in mammalian cells (10,11). Therefore, both interactions may drive a synergistic enhancement of IFN-γ expression in CD8) T cells and in vivo CTLs, as shown in Figs. Although the mechanism of activation of the immune response in animals via dependent activator of IFNregulatory factors in APCs is not fully understood, the results seen here with ODN IMT504 plus DNA vaccine provides evidence that a non-CpG sequence used as an adjuvant with DNA vaccine can stimulate stronger cell-mediated responses. Conclusion In summary, we have demonstrated that ODN IMT504 can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses effectively. Compared with ODN CpG, ODN IMT504 with DNA vaccine induced higher CTL activity and  higher levels of IFN-γ expression in CD8) T cells.

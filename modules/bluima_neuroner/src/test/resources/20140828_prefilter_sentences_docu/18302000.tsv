18302000	The arrow line indicates the distance from the Mahanadi river mouth towards off coast station-1 (4 km), Station-2 (8 km), Station-3 (24 km) and Station-4 (43 km), respectively  and transferred to a Sedgwick rafter cell (counting chamber), which was examined under an inverted optical microscope (Nikon TS100F). During blooming period, a haemocytometer was used for counting instead of a Sedgwick-rafter cell. For the analysis of nitrate NO and phosphate 3 PO3 , the water samples from required depths were 4 collected in cleaned Tarson's polypropylene bottles and filtered through a cellulose-acetate filter with 0.2 μm pores to remove the bacteria and other particulate matter. The cell densities showed linear relationship with chlorophyll-a were (Fig. 6). The mean cell densities at station-1 during monsoon was 83.5×103 cells l-1 in 2001 and 64.2× 103 cells l-1 in 2002. At Station-2 the cell density was 42.1 × 103 cells l-1 in 2001 and 27.5 × 103 cells l-1 in 2002, comparatively less than that at station-1, and their concentration was much lower in the season other than monsoon. However, the ratio of cell densities to  chlorophyll-a were for two dominant species of green algae of smaller cell abundance showed low value in monsoon when compared to other period. This is also reflected from the significant correlation between chlorophyll-a were and chlorophyll-b were values (Fig. 7a) and the fact that the smaller cells (green algae) were higher in monsoon than in non-monsoon period. 6 Relationship between the cell numbers and pigment chlorophyll-a were at three depths (0, 10 and 20 m) of station-1 and Station-2 during Apr and Jun (premonsoon), August (monsoon) and December (postmonsoon), respectively  coastal site during observation period. Lower salinity and higher cell densities and pigment at the near shore stations than at the offshore stations were normally not observed consistently other than in monsoon, suggesting that monsoonal inflow of river discharges are steered along the deep water in vertical and horizontal direction.

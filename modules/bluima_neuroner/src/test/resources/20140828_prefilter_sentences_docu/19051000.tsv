Disturbing the balance between aggressive and protective factors that control cell apoptosis and proliferation leads to gastric ulceration, which then activates the repairing system in the gastric mucosa. Gastric ulcer healing, which involves cell migration, proliferation, epithelial regeneration, angiogenesis, and matrix deposition, is largely coordinated by a variety of growth factors, transcription factors and cytokines [3–5]. Alpha-lipoic acid is readily taken up by a variety of cells and tissues and is reduced in mitochondria to the potential antioxidant dihydrolipoic acid (6,8-dithiooctanoid acid, DHLA). Alpha-lipoic acid and its active reduced counterpart DHLA have been shown to combat oxidative stress by quenching a variety of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species, by chelating copper, iron and other transitional metals and by enhancing the recycling of other cellular antioxidants including vitamins C and E, and glutathione [10, 11]. Desquamation of surface epithelium (0–3; where 0:None; 1:Mild; 2:Moderate; 3:Severe); Hemorrhage, focal necrosis and mucosal congestion (0– 3); Degeneration of glandular cells (0–3); Inflammatory cell infiltration (0–3), with a maximum score of 12. Microscopic examination of the sham group revealed a regular glandular epithelium with gastric pits and glandular cells at light microscopic or scanning electron microscopic level (Fig. 2a,b). In both saline-treated early (Fig. 2c,d) and late ulcer groups (Fig. 2e,f), severe damage of surface mucous cells and gastric pits was noticed, where glandular cells were dilated and mostly degenerated, while severe inflammatory cell infiltration and mucosal hemorrhage were evident. The gastric tissues of rats that have received Alpha-lipoic acid treatment showed mild degeneration of surface mucous cells, gastric pits and glandular cells with a moderate inflammatory cell infiltration in both early (Fig. 2g,h) and late (Fig. 2i,j) phases of ulcer. DNA Fragmentation in the Gastric Mucosa DNA fragmentation (%) in the gastric mucosa was analyzed as an indicator of cell death, including apoptosis. Sham group: (a, b) Regular gastric mucosa with surface epithelium and glandular cells. Saline-treated ulcer groups: Severe damage of surface mucous (arrow) and glandular cells with hemorrhage (*) and inflammatory cell infiltration (arrow head) in mucosa in both early (c, d) and late (e, f) ulcer groups. Alpha-lipoic acid-treated ulcer groups: Regular surface mucous (arrow) and glandular cells in most region, mild vascular congestion (*) and moderate inflammatory cell infiltration (arrow) in mucosa in both Alpha-lipoic acid-treated early (g, h) and late (i, j) ulcer groups. Gastric Glutathione Content The intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) was reduced significantly (0.4±0.04 μmol/g; p<0.05) in the  (continued)  early phase of ulcer in the saline-treated group and was returned back to control levels (0.7 ± 0.1 μmol/g; p < 0.05) on the tenth day of ulcer (Fig. 3d). Based on their antioxidant properties, the redox couple (Alpha-lipoic acid/DHLA) was reported to protect cells against a host of insults where oxidative stress is part of the underlying etiology [37]. Alpha-lipoic acid is readily absorbed from the diet, transported, taken up by cells and reduced to DHLA in various tissues including brain [11]. GSH, the major non-protein thiol in living cells, is an important endogenous antioxidant that is found in particularly high concentrations in the stomach and liver. Thus, GSH is an important  constituent of intracellular protective mechanisms in maintaining antioxidant balance against various noxious stimuli including oxidative stress. Since GSH is the most important thiol antioxidant, which cannot be directly administered, Alpha-lipoic acid, by raising intracellular GSH levels, plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of intracellular antioxidant status and has protective effects against chronic gastric damage. Alpha-lipoic acid and its reduced form DHLA have been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of several cancer and transformed cell lines [44, 45]. On the other hand, it has been also shown that Alpha-lipoic acid inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis [46]. The inhibition of apoptosis by Alpha-lipoic acid was paralleled by reduction of NF-κB [47], while Alpha-lipoic acid was shown to attenuate the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in numerous cell types [47, 48] and to inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation [11, 49]. Thus, the Alpha-lipoic acid-induced NF-κB inhibition may contribute primarily to suppress the inflammatory process inhibiting the apoptosis, cell proliferation, expression of reactive oxygen species and many other inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), which are contributing factors in healing failure. Similarly, it was demonstrated that application of the antioxidant Alpha-lipoic acid in animal and cell culture models decreases oxidative stress and supports the endogenous antioxidant systems potently- and apoptosis-related cell death in tissues exposed to oxidant injury [50, 51]. Alpha-lipoic acid prevents ethanol-induced protein oxidation in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. Role of rebamipide on induction of heatshock proteins and protection against reactive oxygen metabolitemediated cell damage in cultured gastric mucosal cells. Reactive oxygen species mediate caspase activation and apoptosis induced by lipoic acid in human lung epithelial cancer cells through Bcl-2 down-regulation. Alpha-lipoic acid induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells via the PTEN/Akt pathway. R-(+)-alphalipoic acid inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis and proliferation: involvement of Akt and retinoblastoma protein/E2F-1. Alpha-lipoic acid inhibits TNFalpha induced NF-kappaB activation and adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells. Short-term hyperglycemia produces oxidative damage and apoptosis in neurons.

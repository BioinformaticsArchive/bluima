We have examined the link between intracellular changes following mild/ moderate axonal stretch injury and secondary axotomy in rat cortical neurons cultured to relative maturity (21 days in vitro). Double-immunohistochemical analysis of neurofilaments, neuronal spectrin, a-internexin, cytochrome-c, and ubiquitin was conducted at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h postinjury. injury likely results from a progressive molecular and cellular cascade of pathological changes within the axon following initial shear stress at the time of injury, resulting in delayed degeneration and secondary axotomy (Maxwell et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2003). Axon shear stress may also cause alterations in focal  axolemmal permeability, leading to increased intracellular calcium and the harmful activation of calcium-dependant enzymatic cascades, involving calpain, caspase, and calcineurin, which contribute to cytoskeletal damage (Povlishock, 1993; Povlishock and Pettus, 1996; Wolf et al., 2001). The present study utilizes an in vitro model of transient stretch injury to the axons of cortical neurons in long-term primary culture. This culture technique produces nerve cells that are relatively mature and reflective of the adult CNS (Chuckowree and Vickers, 2003; Chung and West, 2004; King et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2007). This was followed by trypsin digestion (0.25%) for 20 min and gentle washes of the cell pellet using fresh HEPES buffer. The cell suspension was disassociated carefully using a 1-mL pipette and the cells plated onto glass coverslips (132 mm2) (Marienfeld, Germany) precoated overnight with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), at a cell density of 5 3 104 cells/well. The fresh medium contained factors that inhibited substantial glial cell proliferation (Chuckowree and Vickers, 2003; Chung et al., 2005). As initially reported (Dickson et al., 2000; Chuckowree and Vickers, 2003; Chung et al., 2005), this long-term culture technique results in the formation of large neuronal clusters across the coverslip interconnected by thick fasciculated axonal bundles. Immunolabeling of cortical cultures with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, marker for astrocytes, DAKO), ferritin(marker of activated microglia, ICN Biomedicals) and CD11b/c (marker of microglial/macrophages, CalTag), as well as counterstaining with the nuclear stain, Nuclear Yellow (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), was conducted to determine the presence/activation of nonneuronal cells relative to axonal injury.

The cells were then washed and incubated with the respective goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), applied in diluent. Secondary axotomy was identified as injured cells illustrating severed axons, and these were counted and presented as a percentage. Axolemmal Permeability  The axolemmal permeability following stretch injury was assessed using Alexa 488 hydrazide (Molecular Probes), a membrane impermeant fluorescent dye with a molecular weight of 570 Da. Intracellular accumulation of the dye demonstrates the axolemma permeability of small molecules (Smith et al., 1999). As a positive control, uninjured neuron cultures were permeabilized with a single rinse of 0.005% Saponin (Sigma) in control saline solution and incubated for 5 min with the dye solution. The cells were incubated in this medium for 20 min, the medium removed, and the cells washed in prewarmed medium without MitoTracker green. The cells were then fixed and immunolabeled for cytochrome-c. One hour prior to injury, neuronal cultures were treated with 20 nM cyclosporin-A (Sigma) (Hansson et al., 2004; Mironov et al., 2005). Scale bar, 50 lm.  treated cells were incubated with antibodies to cytoskeletal  RESULTS  Delayed Cytoskeletal Damage and Alteration to Axolemma Permeability  Axolemma permeability following injury was examined using a low-molecular-weight tracer (570 Da), Alexa 488 hydrazide dye. Intraaxonal labeling for neurofilament-M, a-internexin, and neuronal spectrin was relatively ordered and linear at 24-h postinjury (Fig. 2). By  Figure 2 Cytoskeletal alterations following axonal stretch injury to mature cortical neurons. Cytoskeletal alterations within individual axons were investigated by laser scanning confocal microscopy, confirming that neuronal alterations observed with fluorescence microscopy were due to intraaxonal cytoskeletal changes rather than just a perturbation in axon bundling (Fig. 3). 5  Figure 6 Examination of nonneuronal cells relative to stretch injury. A, B: Few astrocytes (red, GFAP) were present under these culture conditions. GFAP-labeled astrocytes were not associated with axonal bundles (green, neurofilament-M) either in uninjured cultures (B) or following stretch injury (A, 48-h postinjury). C (24-h postinjury): There was no increase in activated microglia (red, ferritin) following axonal injury, and no association of these glial cells with stretch-injured axon bundles (green, neurofilament-M). D: Similarly, there were few cells labeled for a marker of macrophages/microglia (CD11b/c, green) in either uninjured (D) or stretch-injured cultures, nor any association between microglia and axonal bundles (red, neurofilament-M). E, F: Nuclear Yellow staining (E) at 48-h postinjury confirmed a lack of association of nonneuronal cells with stretchinjured axon bundles (F, phase microimage). Glial Cells and Axonal Stretch Injury  The potential perturbation and role of nonneuronal cells relative to the stretch injury was examined using Nuclear Yellow staining as well as immunocytochemical labeling for microglia (CD11b/c), activated microglia (ferritin), and astrocytes (GFAP). Small numbers of nonneuronal cells were present within the  culture both prior and after stretch injury (Fig. 6). Substantial glial cell proliferation was inhibited by the culture medium. Nonneuronal cells were largely associated with the neuronal cell clusters and did not come in contact with the axon bundles. Stretch injury resulted in damage to the axon bundle independent to any disruption to the nonneuronal cells or subsequent glial proliferation/activation (Fig. 6). DISCUSSION  The model of axonal injury in the current study delivered dynamic uniaxial and biaxial deformation of an axon at a strain rate of *4 s1 (Chung et al., 2005) in primary cortical neurons grown to relative maturity in vitro (Chuckowree and Vickers, 2003). This study has demonstrated that axon bundles that receive this transient stretch-injury undergo a series of stereotypical cellular changes leading to delayed axotomy. Mitochondrial disruption may be a key pathological alteration leading to progressive axonal degeneration, as blocking of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and/or calcineurin with cyclosporin-A attenuated many of these cellular changes, as well as secondary axotomy. Cytoskeletal changes in stretch-injured neurons in the current in vitro model included neurofilament compaction, the loss of linear organization of filamentous proteins, and accumulation in axonal swellings. Following axonal stretch injury to NT2 cells, Smith et al. (1999) reported initial lack of membrane permeability  to dyes. In further work with the same model (Wolf et al., 2001), it was demonstrated that stretch-induced strain on the axonal membrane lead to acute and ) abnormal Na influx through mechanosensitive chan- ) 2) nels, triggering a reverse of the Na /Ca exchanger, 2) activation of voltage-gated Ca channels, and subse-2) quent pathological influx of Ca . Geddes-Klein et al. (2006) demonstrated that biaxial rather than axial stretch of the axons of cultured cortical neurons was more effective at causing acute axolemmal per-2) meability and Ca influx. Our study involved transient axonal stretch in cultured primary neurons maintained for longer periods of time, and we have shown in this model that there were no axolemmal permeability alterations immediately and up to 12 h following injury. Cytochrome-c release within traumatically injured axons has been proposed to have a role in stimulating apoptosis and neuronal degeneration (Bu Ìˆ ki et al., 2000). Although previous in vivo experiments report attenuation of cytoskeletal damage following constant injections with cyclosporin-A (Riess et al., 2001), it is difficult to translate the therapeutic time window and dosage into in vitro models, particularly as constant addition of cyclosporin-A, or changes in media, may have a further toxic effect on neurons maintained in vitro. Furthermore, as neurons were isolated in culture and the injury did not promote a change in glial cells, the neuroprotective effect of cyclosporin-A is likely to be axon-specific, potentially reducing damage to mitochondrial membrane integrity and the release of cytochrome-c into the cytosol. Likewise, another immunophilin ligand, Tacrolimus (FK506), reduced axonal  swelling, but not neurofilamentous compaction, following impact-acceleration injury in rats (Marmarou and Povlishock, 2006).These data indicate that neurofilament compaction, which likely follows cleavage of filament side-arms, occurs through the activation of intracellular processes unrelated to the site of action of the immunophilin ligands, and also strongly supports the proposal that neurofilament compaction may not be a critical pathological change leading to axonal swelling, axon transport deficits, and degeneration following traumatic brain injury (e.g. Stone et al., 2001; Marmarou et al., 2005). In summary, although limitations of a tissue culture model are an important caveat for direct translation to human traumatic brain injury, the interpretation of these results, in conjunction with previous in vivo and in vitro studies, provides evidence that cyclosporin-A treatment and the targeting of specific postinjury cellular changes that develop within axons may be a useful approach for reducing diffuse axonal injury and secondary axotomy following brain trauma.

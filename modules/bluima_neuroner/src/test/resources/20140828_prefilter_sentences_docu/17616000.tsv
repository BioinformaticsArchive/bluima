These effects contribute to the elimination of cellulite and are advocated as it is effective for weight loss. Thus, a number of Ashitaba products are marketed extensively as a socalled health food in Japan as if the physiological functions of Ashitaba are connected with the eradication of hypodermic cellulite. However, the effects of Ashitaba on cellulite, and the mechanisms involved, have not yet been elucidated scientifically.

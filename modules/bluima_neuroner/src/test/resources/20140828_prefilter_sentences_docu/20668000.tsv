20668000	Cultured enterocytes exposed to diclofenac readily underwent mPTmediated cell death. One of the early upstream events induced by nonsteroidal anti-  inflammatory drugs in the small intestinal mucosa has been postulated to be mitochondrial damage because of uncoupling (Somasundaram et al., 2000) or endoplasmic reticulum stress (Somasundaram et al., 1997; Tsutsumi et al., 2004) in enterocytes, leading to activation of mitochondria-mediated cell death. Chemical inhibition of cyclophilin D by specific ligands (e.g., cyclosporin A, cyclosporin A) that bind to cyclophilin D and prevent it from associating with other pore regulatory components has been shown to protect cells from mitochondrial permeability transition induction (Halestrap and Davidson, 1990). Cultured enterocytes cells (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA) were grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in high glucose and phenol red–free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) and 0.1 U/ml of bovine insulin (Sigma). Cells were passaged every 6 days at a density of 1 × 105 cells per flask. Cultured enterocytes cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded at a density of 3 × 103 cells per well on black 96-well plates with clear bottom (BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ) or 3 × 106 cells per dish on six-well plates, both thinly coated with Matrigel (Engelbreth-HolmSwarm mouse sarcoma basement membrane; BD Biosciences). Three days after seeding, cells were exposed to serum-free culture medium containing the drugs. Lactate dehydrogenase release was used as an indicator of cytotoxicity (activity in the culture medium as percentage of total intra- and extracellular activity). The assay is based on the principle that calcein acetoxymethyl ester is readily taken up by cells and distributes in all subcellular compartments including mitochondria, where it is enzymatically 2) cleaved to release free calcein. Cultured enterocytes cells exposed to diclofenac or solvent were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and incubated with 1lM calcein acetoxymethyl ester and 1mM CoCl2 for 20 min at 37 C. Equal amounts of protein (40 lg) from cell lysates were reduced, denatured, and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. RESULTS  diclofenac Induces Mitochondrial Permeabilization in Cultured Murine Enterocytes To determine whether the mitochondrial permeability transition might be involved as an initial mechanism leading to cell death in diclofenac-exposed enterocytes, we first used an established in vitro approach, as mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is difficult to monitor in intact animals. Cultured enterocytes cells) were exposed to various concentrations of diclofenac for up to 48 h. Similar to other cell types, diclofenac-induced cytotoxicity in enterocytes was prevented by low concen-  trations (1lM) of cyclosporin A, suggesting a role of the mitochondrial permeability transition. (A) Time course of Lactate dehydrogenase release following exposure of cells to 100lM diclofenac. Collectively, these data indicate that cyclosporin A afforded significant tissue protection against the ulcerogenic effects of diclofenac in the small intestine, suggesting that the mitochondrial permeability transition may be involved in mediating enterocyte cell death in vivo. We found that Debio 025, similar to cyclosporin A, afforded protection against diclofenac-induced cell injury in cultured injury. Cultured enterocytes cells (data not shown). It has been previously demonstrated that diclofenac induces an endoplasmic reticulum stress response in gastric mucosal cells that is directly related to cell death (Tanaka et al., 2005). One of the hallmarks of this pathway that links endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondria-mediated cell death is the upregulation of the transcription factor C/ EBP homologous protein (Gadd153) (Tanaka et al., 2005; Tsutsumi et al., 2004). To explore whether diclofenac causes C/ EBP homologous protein induction in murine small intestinal epithelial cells, we exposed injury. Cultured enterocytes cells to diclofenac (100lM) for up to 24 h and determined the increases in C/ EBP homologous protein protein levels by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 6). One important function of the mitochondrially located cyclophilin D is to participate in the regulation of apoptotic and necrotic cell death mediated through the mitochondrial permeability transition (Halestrap et al., 2002; Leung and Halestrap, 2008; Zorov et al., 2009). On the other hand, Debio 025 is approximately 3500-fold less potent than cyclosporin A in inhibiting calcineurin-mediated IL-2 production in Jurkat cells (Gallay, 2009), indicating minimal immunosuppressant effects at therapeutically relevant doses. Therefore, it is unlikely that the protective effects of Debio 025 on DCFinduced enteropathy were because of calcineurin-mediated effects on immune cells; instead, it is likely that Debio 025 prevented diclofenac-induced mitochondrial permeabilization. Indeed, both cultured guinea pig gastric mucosal cells transfected with a dominant-negative form of C/ EBP homologous protein and peritoneal macrophages isolated from Chopnull mice were protected from NSAID-induced apoptosis. These studies had revealed that hepatocytes from the 2) homozygously knockout mice were protected from Ca - or oxidant stress–induced necrotic cell death but that they were not protected from Bcl-2 protein–regulated cell death (Baines  FIG. Cultured enterocytes cells were exposed to diclofenac (100lM) or solvent (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide), and cell lysate proteins were resolved by Western blotting. Baines, C. P., Kaiser, R.

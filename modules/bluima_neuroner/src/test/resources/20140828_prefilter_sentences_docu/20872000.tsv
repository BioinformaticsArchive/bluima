Two hundred and seventeen patients with diagnosis of indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas stage IE or IIE were assessed retrospectively. Keywords B cell .

In 2005, the World Health Organization–European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification for cutaneous lymphomas [1] was introduced, subdividing primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas in three entities: primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, and primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma, leg type. The latter are highly aggressive and lead to death in estimated 50% of the cases after 5 years [1, 4], while primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma are characterized by an indolent clinical course with a 5-year overall survival ≥ 95%. Since the median age of the patients affected by primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma is below 60 years of age at time of diagnosis and the majority has a prolonged survival, it is crucial to identify poor-risk patients at time of diagnosis in order to develop risk-adapted treatment  L.

However, three of these trials [8, 13, 14] included all primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas subtypes and analyses of the subgroups were not, or only partially, performed. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group conducted this study (International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group 23) in order to develop a model for predicting the clinical course of patients affected by primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma. Materials and methods  Patients  Two-hundred and seventeen patients with diagnosis of primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas from 28 international cancer centers were assessed through retrospective chart review. primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas were defined according to the World Health Organization–European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification [1] as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma, which presented primarily as skin tumors without any involvement at other sites (stage IE or IIE). Since we considered only patients affected by indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas (primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma) for the development of the score and since they usually have a favorable clinical course leading to a low death rate, the prognostic score was developed according to progression-free survival [20], reflecting tumor growth and not being confounded by the administration of subsequent treatments. Results  Patient characteristics and treatments  From 1980 to 2007, 217 patients with indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas stage IE or IIE were assessed. 1 Overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-free survival of 217 patients used for Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma International Prognostic Index development  different treatment modalities did not influence progression-free survival significantly (data not shown) even when analyzed according to the extent of disease (Supplementary Fig. Discussion  This retrospective multi-center study was conducted to develop a prognostic score for indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas. The first two limits were due to the rarity of this disease, whereas the last one could be ascribed to the generally indolent course of this primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas and efficient salvage treatments [4]. We observed no statistical significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics and survival between the two indolent subtypes primary cutaneous marginal zone B cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma. Zinzani et al. [13] already showed that among indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas, the presence of more than one lesion influences the disease-free survival negatively. Nevertheless, already in univariate analysis, it emerged as one of the most important factors influencing the progression-free survival of indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas. This suggests that, albeit these non-Hodgkin lymphomas have a tendency to remain localized to a limited area of the skin [7], neoplastic cells could infiltrate the surrounding tissue deeply, leading to a higher relapse rate. Indeed, in a large trial of 153 patients affected by primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas and solely treated with radiotherapy, it has been shown that, despite indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas being considered as highly radiosensitive (Complete remission rate of 100%), the relapse rate is rather high and  extranodal disease can occur [10]. In conclusion, the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group 23 trial confirms that indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas have a significant rate of distant relapses which can be reliably predicted by several clinical features, and these can be assembled together to provide a strong prognostic index. However, prospective studies are warranted to validate the clinical role of Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index in patients with indolent primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas.

The Extracellular polymeric substances of the denitrifying biomarker Comamonas denitrificans strain 110, produced in different culture media and growth modes, were characterized. The Extracellular polymeric substances mainly contained protein (3–37%), nucleic acids (9–50%), and carbohydrates (3–21%). The extracellular DNA was found to be important for initial biofilm formation since biofilm, but not planktonic growth, was inhibited in the presence of DNase. Fraction B polysaccharides were mainly found in capsular Extracellular polymeric substances which was the dominant type in biofilms and agar-grown colonies. Fraction A was abundant in the released Extracellular polymeric substances, the dominant type in planktonic cultures. Biofilm and agar-grown Extracellular polymeric substances displayed similar overall properties while planktonic Extracellular polymeric substances showed clear compositional disparity.

Polysaccharides  Introduction  Oxygen depletion, eutrophication, and algal blooms—these terms are more and more often used to describe the state of the water bodies surrounding us. Biofilms are surface-associated microbial communities comprising dense, highly hydrated clusters of bacterial cells embedded in a matrix of Extracellular polymeric substances (Stewart and Franklin 2008). In wastewater treatment, the Extracellular polymeric substances protect the cells in the biofilms from environmental stress, desiccation, and toxins (Wuertz et al. 2001). Extracellular polymeric substances are biopolymers, mainly polysaccharides, proteins, extracellular DNA, and lipids, secreted by bacteria (Flemming et al. 2007). Production of Extracellular polymeric substances is essential for biofilm formation, stability, and architecture (Flemming et al. 2007). Characterization of Extracellular polymeric substances from wastewater treatment key organisms in monoculture as well as in multispecies mixtures is important for increased understanding of the structure–function relationship in biofilms. Extracellular polymeric substances from activated sludge (Liu and Fang 2002; Comte et al. 2007) and natural wastewater treatment biofilms (Gao et al. 2008) have been extensively studied; however, the dynamics of interspecies interactions and the influence thereof on Extracellular polymeric substances synthesis are not yet fully understood. To date, Extracellular polymeric substances from very few wastewater treatment key organisms have been characterized in monoculture and, consequently, little information is available for evaluation of multispecies biofilms. We have previously shown that strain 110 demonstrates good biofilm forming properties and substantial Extracellular polymeric substances production in pure culture and in multispecies mixed consortia (Andersson et al. 2008). However, the Extracellular polymeric substances have thus far not been characterized in detail. We describe here, for the first time, the molecular characteristics of Extracellular polymeric substances from strain 110 and its involvement in biofilm formation. The monomer composition of the polysaccharides and a preliminary linkage analysis, the biofilm formation over time, and the influence of nutrients and growth mode on Extracellular polymeric substances composition are presented here. The same assay was used to assess the importance of extracellular DNA in the biofilm matrix by measuring biofilm formation in min-acetate medium with and without DNase I (90 U/mL, Fermentas; Whitchurch et al. 2002). Growth, Extracellular polymeric substances extraction, and Extracellular polymeric substances composition  Biofilms were grown on pieces of polystyrene in 50 mL tubes with 10 mL culture medium for 7 or 10 days in 30°C, 100 rpm. In addition, samples were grown in biofilm, on agar, and planktonically in min-acetate medium for 12 h to 8 days to determine the time dependency of the Extracellular polymeric substances polysaccharide composition. Crude Extracellular polymeric substances was chemically extracted from biofilm, agar, and planktonically grown samples  according to the (formaldehyde, 0.2%, 4°C, 1 h; NaOH 0.3 M, 4°C, 3 h) method described by Liu and Fang (2002). Cultures prepared for the time dependency study were centrifuged (10,000×g, 20 min) prior to the chemical extraction in order to separate released and cell-associated (capsular) Extracellular polymeric substances. The physical condition of the cells was monitored with phase contrast microscopy throughout the extraction procedure. DNA was measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and by electrophoresis of 0.2 mg crude Extracellular polymeric substances (0.8% agarose). The protein profile was determined by loading crude Extracellular polymeric substances corresponding to 0.1 mg protein based on the colorimetric result and 0.1 mg cell lysate on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (Laemmli 1970) using pre-stained protein standard marker (Invitrogen LC5925). The cell lysate was prepared from cells grown on min-acetate agar medium by mixing with gram negative lysis buffer followed by centrifugation. Polysaccharide purification and sample preparation  To obtain pure polysaccharides from crude Extracellular polymeric substances, proteins and nucleic acids were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (20%, 4°C, 30 min) and the supernatant was then precipitated twice with 2 volumes of 96% ethanol (24 h, 4°C) to recover the polysaccharides. High-performance size exclusion chromatography  The extracted Extracellular polymeric substances were diluted to 1 mg mL-1 in MilliQ-water and filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane before injection into the High-performance size exclusion chromatography. Sterile culture media, reference sugars, cell lysate (min-acetate medium), and DNA and  RNA extracted (GE Healthcare) from strain 110 underwent the same treatment. Standard sugars, subjected to extraction and hydrolysis procedures, in the concentrations 0.01–0.5 mM, were used as references: D-glucose, D-mannose, D-ribose, D-fructose, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, L-fucose, L-sorbose, xylose, glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, N-acetylglucoseamine, N-acetylgalactoseamine, glucose-6-phosohate, cellobiose, α-lactose, maltose, melibiose, saccharose, raffinose, D-galacturonic acid, D-glucuronic acid, L-guluronic acid, and D-mannuronic acid. Results  Biofilm formation in different culture media  In order to select culture media for the Extracellular polymeric substances production, the biofilm formation ability and growth rate of strain 110 in different culture media was examined. These five media were selected for Extracellular polymeric substances production to represent biofilm promoting (min-acetate, min-isobutyric acid), biofilm deficient (NB, min-citrate), and natural (WW) wastewater treatment conditions. 2a, initial attachment occurred within 24 h, forming scattered, microcolonies with little Extracellular polymeric substances. Six days later, the microcolonies had expanded to macrocolonies of cells embedded in smooth Extracellular polymeric substances in an incipient three-dimensional architecture (Fig. 2b). Within 12 days, a multilayer biofilm with a more sophisticated structure and higher Extracellular polymeric substances content had developed, and on day 20, the micrographs revealed a filamentous network of extracellular fibers where the threedimensional structure of micro- and macropores could be clearly seen (Fig. 2c, d). During the maturation process, the proportion of Extracellular polymeric substances compared to cells increased drastically. Extracellular polymeric substances  In order to characterize the composition of Extracellular polymeric substances produced under different growth conditions, strain 110 was cultured as biofilm on polystyrene, on agar plates, and planktonically in five different media. Composition by colorimetric analysis  The relative composition of the extracted Extracellular polymeric substances, as determined by colorimetric analysis, was rather similar for samples grown as biofilm on polystyrene and on agar plates (Fig. 3a), with an average protein to carbohydrate ratio of 5:2 for biofilm Extracellular polymeric substances and 3:2 for agar Extracellular polymeric substances. Extracellular polymeric substances produced in planktonic cultures, however, had a protein to carbohydrate ratio of 1:2 and the recovery, i.e., by the  Fig. 2 Scanning electron microscope micrographs of different developmental stages of biofilm Extracellular polymeric substances, c the edge of a 12-day-old biofilm with a three-dimensional maturation of C. denitrificans strain 110 grown on polystyrene in min- architecture, and d a 20-day-old biofilm made up of few cells and acetate medium. a Microcolonies of cells and Extracellular polymeric substances formed after 24 h, much Extracellular polymeric substances with clearly visible micro- and macropores.

The lipid content was low (<2.5% w/w of Extracellular polymeric substances) in all samples except WW biofilms, where it reached 6.4% (w/w of Extracellular polymeric substances). The content of nucleic acids in the extracted Extracellular polymeric substances was high according to the spectrophotometric measurements (9–50% w/w of Extracellular polymeric substances), in particular in the biofilm and the agar samples. Hence, the DNA fractions of the Extracellular polymeric substances samples were also analyzed by running an agarose gel (results not shown). Thick bands of small DNA fragments, 100–300 bp, and thinner bands of approximately genomic size were present in the biofilm and agar Extracellular polymeric substances. The planktonic Extracellular polymeric substances did not show any distinct bands. These results confirm that nucleic acids were present in the Extracellular polymeric substances. Phase contrast microscopy showed that very few cells were damaged during extraction, implying that the nucleic acids were components in the biofilm matrix. Extracellular polymeric substances protein profile  The protein profile of the extracted Extracellular polymeric substances was determined on SDS-PAGE gel. In agar-grown and biofilm Extracellular polymeric substances, one to three major protein bands of approximate sizes 36, 50, and 100 kDa were visible, whereas only one band could be seen in planktonically grown Extracellular polymeric substances (Fig. 3b). All samples, including the cell lysate, showed a clear band with an approximate size of 36 kDa as well as various degrees of background signal. No Extracellular polymeric substances samples gave rise to more than five distinct bands on the gel while the cell lysate resulted  in more than 20 bands. This implies that the intracellular contamination during the extraction procedure was low. The white dots sugar composition of purified polysaccharides and b shows the sugar show the normalized amount of extracted crude Extracellular polymeric substances from each sample composition of released and capsular polysaccharides from min-acetate  fraction, ribose was found to constitute at least 40% of the sugars detected (Fig. 4b). Hydrolyzed DNA, RNA, and cell lysate all gave rise to a characteristic high and narrow peak with a short elution time (High-performance anion-exchange chromatography) which was not detected in any other reference sample.

We have thus studied the biofilm formation properties, with emphasis on Extracellular polymeric substances characteristics, of strain 110. The results show that strain 110 is capable of forming a three-dimensional biofilm with a high Extracellular polymeric substances content and a relative decrease of cells and increase of Extracellular polymeric substances over time in min-acetate medium, as observed by Scanning electron microscope (Fig. 2). This is normal when high concentrations of utilizable substrate and low concentrations of limiting nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) are supplied, restricting cell growth and promoting exopolysaccharide synthesis (Sutherland 1990; Qureshi et al. 2005). In contrast, the nitrogen-rich WW with fewer easily available carbon sources produced less Extracellular polymeric substances and more cells, resulting in a thinner biofilm. In general, the composition of the crude Extracellular polymeric substances, their protein profile, and polysaccharides were similar in all culture media (except for WW), but the amount of produced Extracellular polymeric substances varied, thus giving rise to differences in biofilm formation. The crude Extracellular polymeric substances produced by strain 110 in biofilm, agar, and planktonic growth mode showed both similarities and differences. The biofilm and agar Extracellular polymeric substances displayed resemblances in overall composition (Fig. 3a), protein profile (Fig. 3b), and sugar composition (Fig. 4a). The planktonic Extracellular polymeric substances, on the other hand, showed clear compositional differences in all analyses. These results stress the relevance to compare the characteristics of Extracellular polymeric substances from biofilm and agar-grown samples, but not Extracellular polymeric substances from planktonically grown samples. Other recent studies have also identified clear compositional differences between planktonic and biofilm Extracellular polymeric substances (Beech et al. 1999; Kives et al. 2006). Extracellular proteins were abundant in Extracellular polymeric substances from biofilm and agar-grown samples. In strain 100 Extracellular polymeric substances, one major protein band (36 kDa) was detected on the SDS-PAGE gel. Kachlany et al. (2001) also found one major band (80 kDa) in the Extracellular polymeric substances from Pseudomonas putida G7, which was identified as a flagellin protein. Further studies are needed to elucidate if the 36 kDa protein found in strain 110 Extracellular polymeric substances is a flagellin protein. The smeared appearance of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel is most likely due to extracellular proteolytic activity or nucleic acid contamination (Fig. 3b). The nucleic acid content of the Extracellular polymeric substances, as determined spectrophotometrically, was high (Fig. 3a). The possibility that the nucleic acids to some extent originate from cell lysis during the extraction procedure cannot be completely out ruled although various observations in this study indicated negligible cell lysis (intact cells in microscopic inspection, lack of intracellular protein bands on SDS gel). Extracellular DNA has been found to be an important structural component in biofilms (Whitchurch et al. 2002; Böckelmann et al. 2007; Flemming et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2008) with a sequence close, but not identical, to genomic DNA (Böckelmann et al. 2006). A previously proposed mechanism for transport of extracellular DNA is a release through the outer membrane in specific vesicles (Whitchurch et al. 2002). Crude Extracellular polymeric substances consisted of 5–20% carbohydrates, which is in accordance with other studies (Kachlany et al. 2001). Assuming that the capsule of strain 110 consists of different polysaccharide polymers with different properties, the observed change in capsule sugar composition over time could be explained by a heterogeneous dispersion of Extracellular polymeric substances. This paper describes, for the first time, the composition and characteristics of Extracellular polymeric substances produced by the denitrifying microorganism C. denitrificans strain 110. We report that both released and capsular Extracellular polymeric substances with distinct composition and polysaccharide structure are synthesized regardless of culture media. Biofilms and agar cultures produced mainly capsular Extracellular polymeric substances, while planktonic cultures produced more of the released type. We also show that the composition of crude Extracellular polymeric substances, their protein profile, and polysaccharides are similar in biofilm and agar-grown samples. The rapid, lush growth and convenient handling of cultures on agar plates allows a faster and more reliable characterization of Extracellular polymeric substances.

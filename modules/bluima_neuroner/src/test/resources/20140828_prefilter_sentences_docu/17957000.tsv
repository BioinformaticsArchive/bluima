17957000	MONOHYDRATE supplementation has been shown to increase fat-free mass and muscle power output possibly via cells swelling. Little is known about the cellular response to CREATINE MONOHYDRATE. Also, CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation significantly upregulated (1.3- to 5.0-fold) the mRNA content of genes and protein content of kinases involved in osmosensing and signal transduction, cytoskeleton remodeling, protein and glycogen synthesis regulation, satellite cells proliferation and differentiation, DNA replication and repair, RNA transcription control, and cells survival. We are the first to report this large-scale gene expression in the skeletal muscle with short-term CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation, a response that suggests changes in cellular osmolarity. ergogenic aid; osmosensing; cells signaling; cDNA microarray; realtime PCR  CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation has a number of biochemical and physiological effects and enhances muscle performance in humans (89). Intracellular phosphocreatine functions as an energy buffer to prevent ATP depletion in the skeletal muscle, especially during short-duration repetitive high-intensity exercise bouts (22, 43, 75, 89). The increase in fat-free mass and total body weight is partly due to fluid retention in myocytes caused by the osmotic potential of high intracellular CREATINE MONOHYDRATE abundance (45, 47, 60). Whether the aforementioned phenotypic effects are due to energy buffering, physiochemical attributes of the compound, cells volume regulation, or CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation's direct influence on cellular metabolism through changes in gene expression remains unclear. Studies have found significant increases in total body water in men after both short-term (106) and long-term (47) CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation, and that this acute increase in fluid volume is limited to the intracellular compartment only (106). Our group has shown that 9 days of CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation decreased whole body protein breakdown and leucine oxidation in young men (66), and this was directionally similar to studies infusing a hypoosmotic solution to induce cells swelling (6, 34). Consequently, we hypothesized that CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation would induce cells swelling, which in turn would activate downstream cells volume-sensitive signaling cascades, and affect overall cellular metabolism (66). If cells volume changes modulate the anti-proteolytic effects of CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation, then this should involve the intrinsic and/or extrinsic signaling kinases. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation enhances satellite cells differentiation in vitro (93) and satellite cells mitotic activity during compensatory hypertrophy in rat skeletal muscle (16). Also, CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation in conjunction with strength exercise training increases satellite cells number, myonuclei concentration (63), and type II muscle fiber area (94). Given the emerging interest in CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation in the management of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (44), Huntington's disease (56), Parkinson's disease (55), Alzheimer's disease (9), and muscular dystrophies (13, 85, 87, 88), our aim was to elucidate potential cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie its therapeutic efficacy. The objectives of this study were 1) to examine the intracellular global gene expression in human skeletal muscle following 10 days of CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation using cDNA microarray analysis, and 2) to evaluate the effect of short-term CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation on targeted mRNA expression and pro-  tein content of kinases associated with cells volume regulation. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation increased total muscle creatine content by 14% (P 0.0009), indicating excellent compliance (Table 2). We found that CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation increased mRNA expression and protein content of genes involved in osmosensing and signal transduction [integrin-1 (ITGA1), focal adhesion kinase, wingless-type MMTV integration site family member-2 (WNT2), GNAS complex locus (GNAS), and calcium-sensing receptor], cytoskeleton remodeling [collagen (type V, 3; collagen), filamin A, Rho GTPase activating protein-8 (ARHGAP8), and peripherin], protein and glycogen synthesis regulation (PKBa/Akt), satellite cells proliferation and differentiation [sphingosine kinase-1, PKBa/Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK6, and megakaryoblastic leukemia-1], DNA replication and repair [replication initiator-1, histone-1 (HIST1H2BK), and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I], RNA transcription control [human transcription factor Dp-2, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein- (CEBPZ), PRP8 pre-mRNA processing factor-8 homolog, exonuclease NEF-sp, ROD1, RNA binding motif protein-4, and matrin-3], cells survival [Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule-2 and angiopoietin-like-4], and other miscellaneous  Fig. focal adhesion kinase, focal adhesion kinase; PKBa/Akt1, protein kinase B ; p38 MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK6, extracellular-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase-6. We are the first to report this novel differential gene expression in the skeletal muscle with 10 days of CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation, a response that appears to reflect a homeostatic adaptation to changes in cellular osmolarity. These gains are attributed to the acute increase in fluid volume, limited to the intracellular compartment only, due to an osmotic load caused by cellular CREATINE MONOHYDRATE accumulation (106). We speculate that the increase in cellular total creatine and osmolarity following creatine supplementation leads to an increase in cells volume. We have previously shown that 9 days of CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation (similar to the present protocol) decreases whole body proteolysis and leucine oxidation in young men (66), and these results were directionally similar to studies showing cells swelling after infusion of a hypoosmotic solution (6, 34). In vitro studies have also described the stimulating effect of increased cells volume on glycogen synthesis (1, 72). On the basis of research from our group and others, we hypothesized that CREATINE MONOHYDRATE-mediated cells swelling would activate cells volume-sensitive signaling cascades to adapt to the intracellular and extracellular changes in osmolarity by activating  Downloaded  from  on October 29,  2011  signal transduction pathways for maintaining proper cells function (66). Both ITGA1 and focal adhesion kinase play a vital role in osmosensing, especially during the earlier phase of cells swelling, by promoting cells adhesion to the extracellular matrix and inducing intracellular signal transduction (77, 97). We also observed that CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation activates genes that constitute the cells signal transduction network including WNT2, GNAS, and calcium-sensing receptor. WNT2 is a signal transducer and is implicated in several developmental processes, including regulation of cells fate and patterning during embryogenesis (98). calcium-sensing receptor senses extracellular calcium concentration and assists in maintaining calcium homeostasis (35). The activity of this receptor is mediated by a G protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (28), which we speculate would be because of CREATINE MONOHYDRATE-mediated cells swelling. Cytoskeleton rearrangements have been previously implicated as a result of cells swelling, as an adaptive homeostatic response (68). collagen encodes an -chain for one of the low-abundance fibrillar collagens that plays a role in muscle development and cells adhesion (40). peripherin is a type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein that participates in the signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cells development, activation, and growth (90). We speculate that this CREATINE MONOHYDRATE-mediated cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis is an early event that may be central to the modulation of cells shape. Creatine supplementation increases glycogen content, but the cellular mechanisms supporting this observation are unclear (65). Together with the GLUT4 data, these observations indicate that the intracellular glucose available for cellular functions is being directed toward glycogen accretion through a decrease in glycogen breakdown and glycolysis. In vitro, L6 muscle cells overexpressing PKBa significantly increase glucose transport, to a level comparable to that elicited normally by insulin in nontransfected control cells, because of an increase in the recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (30). CREATINE MONOHYDRATE May Promote Satellite Cell Proliferation and Differentiation via an Induction of sphingosine kinase-1 and MAPK Pathway  In vitro and in vivo, CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation alone (41, 93) or in combination with progressive strength training or increased functional loading and compensatory hypertrophy (synergist ablation) (16) induces satellite cells (postnatal myogenic stem cells) proliferation and differentiation. This effect may be  mediated, at least in part, by CREATINE MONOHYDRATE-induced cells swelling, an early cellular response to CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation. Cell swelling may act as an anabolic stimulus facilitating downstream myogenic regulatory factor pathways that, in turn, may stimulate satellite cells to proliferate and fuse with existing myofibers (36, 63). Nonetheless, we did observe an early transcriptional and translational response at the cellular level, which explains previously observed effects of creatine supplementation on satellite cells proliferation and differentiation (16, 36, 41, 63, 93). sphingosine-1-phosphate is a bioactive intracellular lipid mediator and a ligand for sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors that trigger various key mitogenic signaling pathways (i.e., MAPK, phospholipase D, Rho, and cytosolic calcium increase) involved in the regulation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation and skeletal muscle fatigue prevention (17, 58, 82). p38 MAPK, a stress-sensitive kinase, is upregulated in response to cells swelling (61). CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation induced the expression of genes involved in osmosensing, signal transduction, cytoskeleton remodeling, metabolism, cells survival, and genomic replication, repair, and transcription. The coordinated induction of these genes will regulate satellite cells proliferation and differentiation with CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation. In vitro, replication initiator-1 possesses ATPdependent DNA helicase activity and is involved in initiating chromosomal DNA synthesis in mammalian cells (15), which could explain the increase in DNA synthesis during satellite  cells mitotic activity following creatine supplementation. A deficiency in this DNA repair pathway in humans causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy by affecting terminally differentiated neurons (83), and hence CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation may be a potential therapeutic agent for spinocerebellar ataxia patients. transcription factor Dp-2 is a transcription factor that heterodimerizes with E2F transcription factor-1 to regulate genes required for the progression of the S phase, such as DHFR and DNA polymerase- , and thus is essential in cells cycle regulation and differentiation (103). In vitro, dominant-negative CEBPZ mutants reduce the expression of various genes including the -2 collagen, E2F transcription factor-1, and topoisomerase II , resulting in fibroblast cells growth delay (38). Hence, CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation activates the transcription of genes that may play a role in downstream cellular proliferation and differentiation in addition to influencing DNA replication and repair regulation. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE Supplementation Activates Genes That Promote Cell Survival  CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation activated genes involved in cells survival and anti-apoptotic pathways, including PKBa, sphingosine kinase-1, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule-2, and angiopoietin-like-4. Both PKBa and sphingosine kinase-1 act as antiapoptotic and cells survival signaling kinases, in addition to their role in regulating cellular metabolism (PKBa) and myogenesis (sphingosine kinase-1) (50, 79). In cells culture, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule-2 has an anti-apoptotic function that provides protection from Fas-mediated cells death (81). This is in parallel with previous findings that CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation has potential neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of Huntington's disease (19, 25) and cerebral ischemia (105), including buffering of intracellular energy  reserves, stabilizing intracellular calcium, and inhibiting activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, all of which have been linked to excitotoxic and apoptotic cells death. In this study, we have identified that short-term CREATINE MONOHYDRATE supplementation in healthy young men activates genes in the skeletal muscle that are involved in various aspects of osmosensing, protein and glycogen synthesis regulation, satellite cells proliferation and differentiation, cells survival, DNA replication and repair, RNA transcription control, and cytoskeleton remodeling (Fig. 3).

Alterations in redox state (decrease in the NAD+/NADH redox ratio), microsomal generation of hydroxyl radicals, production of the reactive metabolite acetaldehyde, and one-electron oxidation of ethanol to 1-hydroxy ethyl radical are documented to be the mechanisms of ethanol-induced oxidative stress and cell injury (Tsukamoto and Lu 2001). The seeds are reported to be rich in polyphenolic flavonoids (100 mg/g; Gupta and Nair 1999).We showed that the polyphenolic extract of fenugreek seeds has antioxidant activity in vitro (Kaviarasan et al. 2004) and prevents ethanolinduced apoptosis in Chang liver cells (Kaviarasan et al. 2006).To further explore the hepatoprotective action, we studied the effect of fenugreek seed polyphenol extract on ethanol-induced lipid and protein damage in the liver of alcohol-treated rats by measuring lipid peroxidation indices, antioxidant levels, protein carbonyl content (spectrophotometry and immunohistochemistry), and 4-hydroxynonenal-protein adducts (immunohistochemistry) by localizing nitrated proteins (immunohistochemistry) and compared it with a standard hepatoprotective drug silymarin. The red blood cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, and hemolysate was prepared in icecold water. 4-hydroxynonenal is a potent electrophile that rapidly modifies proteins on several amino acid residues especially lysine (Cohn et al. 1996) and is responsible for cellular protein modification and loss of function (Ando et al. 1997; Yoritaka et al. 1996). Low GSH and ascorbate levels may result from their increased utilization to scavenge free radicals and to protect other cellular constituents from oxidative damage. Our data suggest that fenugreek seed polyphenol extract could restore antioxidant potential of hepatic cells and protect them from oxidative damage.

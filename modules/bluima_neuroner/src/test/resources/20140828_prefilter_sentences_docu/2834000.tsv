2834000	We propose that the time course of decay of subthreshold responses is determined by the passive cable properties of bi- or multistratified neurons with one dendritic arbor in the optic neuropil and a second arbor 100-250 lÂ¢m deeper. but we further propose that: (1) in the absence of second-order tectal activity, the flow of excitatory current from the optic neuropii to deeper tectal elements decays with a time constant of 3.5-4.5 ms: (2) the distribution of sources for the subthreshold response suggests flow of current in certain known ~) neuronal types: and (3) when the strength of excitatory retinotectal transmission is sufficient, feedback inhibition is delivered polysynaptically to those same dendrites which were depolarized earlier by afferent activity. (3) The isolated monosynaptic current decays exponentially with a time constant of 3.3-4.5 ms, Since the method of analysis only detects those currents which flow intracellularly in a radial direction, this time constant is likely to represent the equalization time constant 22"3for flow of current within a population of postsynaptic dendrites (Fig. 5). The decay time constants, rl and r2 Consistent with previous interpretations of waves l and 2. and of similar field potentials in other systemsz'3"c"n4s, ubthreshold responses were attributed to a brief inflow of depolarizing current into dendritic arbors in the SO and SFGS, downward flow of this current via dendritic trunks, and return of this current to the extracellular compartment in the SGC (Fig. 5). Such values are within the range of typical estimates for the dominant equalizing time constants of central neurons, especially those with relatively far-ranging dendritic arbors (reviewed by Rail23). Voltage-clamp analysis of such receptors in cultured spinal cord neurons has indicated that they pass short  duration EPSCs for which the mean open-channel lifetime is less than 1 ms21. It has been shown that many tectal neurons extend radially oriented dendrites with bi- or multistratified arbors, often with one arbor in the SO or SFGS and another at the SFGS-SGC border or deeper in the SGC 19. The SGC arbors of these neurons may provide sufficient capacitance to cause passive concentration of current sources there, as well as providing a passive sink during complex responses (Fig. 5, and below). 14 Llinfis, R. and Nicholson, C., Electrophysiological properties of dendrites and somata in alligator Purkinje cells, J.

18627000	DNA damage was measured as a pseudo-percentage score (comparable to % tail DNA) converted from a  total visual score calculated from the distribution of cells with different degrees of damage (normal, mild, moderate and severe). A suitable tool to study DNA repair capacity is the alkaline comet assay (also known as the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay), as it can be designed to measure the repair as well as the level of single-stranded breaks induced by a genotoxic agent [Tice et al., 2000; Collins, 2004]. The most common polymorphisms identified in these genes are APEX1 Asp148Glu, x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 Arg194Trp, and x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 Arg399Gln, which have previously been associated with altered cancer risk [Zhou et al., 2003; Ito et al., 2004; Hung et al., 2005a]. methylmethane sulphonate also induces other types of adducts and secondary lesions that may have an impact on cellular recovery following methylmethane sulphonate treatment. The repair of double-strand breaks is dependent on the homologous recombination repair pathway, since the sensitivity of cells to methylmethane sulphonate increases significantly if homologous recombination is compromised [Krogh and Symington, 2004]. Cells were washed in RPMI 1640 medium (Dulbecco, Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) prior to cryopreservation at 2 3 106 cells/vial in a freezing medium consisting of 50% RPMI, 40% foetal calf serum, and 10% dimethylsulphoxide.

For each sample, 12 ll of a cell suspension containing 1 3 106 viable cells/ml were collected and mixed with 108 ll of 1% low-melting-point agarose in phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C. This cell suspension was placed on a microscope slide previously coated with 1% normal-melting-point agarose in phosphate-buffered saline. Comet cells were scored manually by evaluating 100 cells per slide. Each cell with a visible head was scored, starting in the center and continuing out towards the right shoulder of the slide. Cells within 5 mm from the edge of the slide were not included, since mechanical damage of cells by the cover slip may occur in this area. When the right shoulder of the slide was reached, the scoring continued from the center towards the left shoulder, until 100 cells were scored. The visual scoring system used in this study was based on arbitrary classification of cells into four categories: normal cells, and mild, moderate and severe comets (Fig. 1). The terms used are indicative of the visual appearance of the comet cells, taking into account both tail size and intensity. A visual score was calculated by assigning each counted cell a value between 0 and 4 according to degree of damage: 0 for normal cells, 1.33 for mild comets, 2.67 for moderate comets, and 4 for severe comets, as previously suggested [Collins et al., 1997; Collins, 2004; MØller, 2006]. With a total of 100 cells, the total score for a slide was between 0 and 400 "arbitrary units." By dividing by four, the visual score was converted to a pseudo-percentage score (Percentage Score 5 visual score/4). 2) confirmed a dynamic transition of cells from a more damaged state to a less damaged state with increasing repair time following methylmethane sulphonate treatment. A steady increase in the number of normal cells was seen, derived from the repair of cells that were previously classified as mild or moderate in the visual scoring system used. The proportion of normal cells increased from 11.1% (69.2%) at the earliest possible observation time point (0 min after washing) to 38.3% (617.8%) 120 min later. Overall distribution of cells classified as normal (black), mild (dark grey), moderate (grey) and severe comets (white) at various time points after methylmethane sulphonate treatment (immediately after a 6-min washing step, and 15, 40, and 120 min later). Overall distribution of cells classified as normal (black), mild (dark grey), moderate (grey) and severe comets (white) at various time points after methylmethane sulphonate treatment (immediately after a 6-min washing step, and 15, 40, and 120 min later). The Percentage Score decreased over time as the cells repaired DNA damage after the initial methylmethane sulphonate exposure. Elevated levels of strand breaks and diminished repair have been demonstrated in methylmethane sulphonate-treated x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1(-/-) cell lines compared  with wild-type cells [Horton et al., 2008]. Consistent with our results, introduction of the x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 194Trp allele to x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1(-/-) cells fully restored the methylmethane sulphonate sensitivity as the wild-type allele, while the less common x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 280His allele only partially restored the methylmethane sulphonate sensitivity and showed diminished initial repair as determined by the alkaline comet assay [Takanami et al., 2005]. Similarly, the x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 399Gln allele complemented methylmethane sulphonate sensitivity of x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1-deficient cells, and reduced single-stranded breaks after a 3-hr repair incubation, equally well as the wild-type allele [Taylor et al., 2000]. The decreased repair observed at early time points after methylmethane sulphonate exposure in cells carrying the variant x-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 241Met allele is consistent with the previously reported association of the variant allele with a reduced repair of bulky DNA adducts [Matullo et al., 2001]. The initial lower repair in cells with the variant Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 185Gln allele is in agreement with a recent study [Medina et al., 2003] in which homozygosity for this allele was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of p53 mutations in lung cancer patients. The apparently decreased damage, at subsequent later time points, in cell populations with the variant allele, could possibly be explained by formation of apoptotic cells due to overload of DNA damage in the repair-inefficient cells. Apoptotic cells were not scored in the present study. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for associations between gene variants in the base excision repair and homologous recombination repair pathways and altered repair efficiency following methylmethane sulphonate treatment, with a lower degree of repair in cells carrying the APEX1 Asp148 allele, the x-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 241Met allele or the Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 185Gln allele.

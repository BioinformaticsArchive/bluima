In this study, we evaluate soluble CD44 as an early detection tool for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by determining whether it reliably distinguishes Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from benign disease of the upper aerodigestive tract. Methods: We carried out the soluble CD44 ELISA on oral rinses from 102 patients with Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 69 control patients with benign diseases of upper aerodigestive tract to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test for differentiating Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from benign disease. Furthermore, we did a pilot study using methylation-specific PCR primers on oral rinses from 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with low soluble CD44 levels and 10 benign disease controls. Results: Mean salivary soluble CD44 levels were 24.4 F 32.0 ng/mL for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (range, 0.99-201 ng/mL) and 9.9 F 16.1 ng/mL (range, 0.73-124 ng/mL) for the patients with benign disease (P < 0.0001). Depending on cutoff point and Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma site, sensitivity ranged from 62% to 70% and specificity ranged from 75% to 88%. Nine of 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 0 of 10 controls with low soluble CD44 levels showed hypermethylation of the CD44 promoter. Conclusions: SolCD44 is elevated in the majority of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and distinguishes cancer from benign disease with high specificity. Our pilot data indicate that, together, these markers will detect Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with very high sensitivity and specificity. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(7):1348 â€“ 55)  Introduction  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma accounts for most cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx (1). Tobacco and alcohol exposure are the main risk factors and account for f85% of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (4). The majority of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is identified in advanced stage (6). Early detection of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma would improve treatment outcomes (8, 9) and may be cost-effective if directed at known high-risk populations (10). The detection rate of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma increases from 1 in 1,000 asymptomatic individuals >50 years of age to 1 per 200 high-risk smokers and drinkers (7). In addition to tobacco and alcohol exposure, other factors increase susceptibility to Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. According to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, black males have a higher incidence of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, present at later stage, and have  Received 1/11/06; revised 3/1/07; accepted 4/17/07. Low socioeconomic status may also be associated with increased risk of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (12, 13). Most Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma screening trials to date use physical exam as the screening method. Much of the work on Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor markers done in serum has been replicated in whole unstimulated saliva or oral rinses. More recently, Wong's group, using quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA in saliva, showed that a panel of four markers detect Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with 91% sensitivity and 91% specificity (21). Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and antibody microarrays have been used to analyze samples from Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and normals to develop a protein level signature for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (22, 23). Salivary hyaluronic acid was elevated in 8 of 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 0 of 6 normal controls. Salivary hyaluronidase was elevated in 11 of 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 0 of 6 controls (25). Interleukin-8 detected Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in saliva with 86% sensitivity and 97% specificity in 32 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and matched controls (26). SolCD44 was elevated in oral rinses from 19 of 24 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with disease invading mucosa and none of 10 normal controls (27). This overexpression is seen not only in dysplasias but also in 90% of invasive Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (29). A few isoforms such as CD44 standard and CD44 variant isoforms3-10 are found in normal cells, whereas CD44 variant isoforms are differentially expressed in some tumors and promote tumorigenesis (32). One member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, cleaves CD44 to its soluble form (soluble CD44), resulting in increased cell migration (34, 35). Studies in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues show increased membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase expression in tumors with lymph node metastases (38), which could contribute to increased soluble CD44 in bodily fluids such as saliva. Studies involving soluble CD44 in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been few and were reviewed in our pilot study (27). Briefly, for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, plasma levels of a soluble CD44 isoform were not significantly elevated in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients versus controls. Because the tumor load of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is relatively low, soluble CD44 released from these tumors is not able to significantly exceed the basal level (39). A recent report shows that mean soluble CD44 levels in serum are almost 2.5 times higher in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with normal controls (40). In oral rinses, our pilot study indicated that soluble CD44 levels were >7 times higher in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with normal controls. Furthermore, levels were elevated in almost 80% of the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and none of the controls (27). To be useful as an early detection test, the soluble CD44 test will have to be able to distinguish Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from benign diseases of the upper aerodigestive tract. In our pilot study, >20% of patients with Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma had low soluble CD44 levels (27). It is possible that in some Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, the CD44 gene is turned off by promoter hypermethylation. Many genes, including those involved with tumor suppression, cell adhesion, and hormone response, are known to undergo hypermethylation that is associated with tumor progression (43). To our knowledge, no studies have been done to determine if CD44 expression is turned off by promoter hypermethylation in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In this report, we evaluate the soluble CD44 ELISA test for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in a larger group of patients. We suspect that Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients but not controls with low soluble CD44 levels have undergone gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation. If this is the case, methylation status of the CD44 gene and the soluble CD44 test may complement each other and, in combination, distinguish Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with high sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis in a pilot study of 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 10 controls with low soluble CD44 levels. One hundred two Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 69 controls were enrolled from otolaryngology clinics at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital. We hypothesized that levels may be elevated in benign reactive, hyperplastic, and inflammatory processes in addition to invasive Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. To ensure that benign disease patients included mainly smokers and drinkers (as is true of the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma population), they were approached if they answered "yes" to tobacco or alcohol use on the clinic intake questionnaire. All Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients had biopsyproven, newly diagnosed or recurrent Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We included all stages and sites except nasopharynx because nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to behave differently than Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in  other sites. They detected no cross-reactivity between this test and tumor necrosis factor a, tumor necrosis factor h, tumor necrosis factor receptor, IFN-a2c, IFN-g, interleukin-8, annexin, soluble endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, soluble L-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. We have also previously confirmed specificity of the antibody by Western blot (27). Samples (73 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 54 control specimens) were repeated in triplicates at full concentration and 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions. The mean soluble CD44 levels and protein levels were calculated separately for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and patients with benign disease with corresponding confidence limits. Resulting means for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients were compared with means for patients with benign disease using the Student's t test. A good screening test for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma must have high sensitivity and specificity. Using results from 102 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 69 subjects without Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the sensitivity and specificity of the soluble CD44 test were calculated at several cutoff points, thereby deriving its receiver-operator characteristic curve. Because Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is tightly linked to risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol, we made efforts to control for such factors. We have this information available on 43 stage I-IV newly diagnosed Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 63 controls with benign disease. Whereas CD44 overexpression seems to promote Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumorigenesis, some Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients showed low soluble CD44 levels in their oral rinses, indicating that the CD44 gene may be turned off in some cancer patients. Subjects included 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 10 benign disease control subjects enrolled in the main soluble CD44 study who had low soluble CD44 levels and adequate DNA in their oral rinses. Controls were selected so that the group was similar to the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with respect to tobacco and alcohol exposure, age, race, gender, and soluble CD44 level. The experiment was repeated with specimens from Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases and controls tested in the same PCR run. Salivary soluble CD44 levels are elevated in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with normal nonsmokers and patients with benign disease. Differences between Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and the two groups without cancer both were highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The mean soluble CD44 level was 24.4 F 32.0 ng/mL for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 9.9 F 16.1 ng/mL for the patients with benign disease (P < 0.0001). When these were removed from the analysis, the SD decreased to less than the mean value for all tumor characteristics, and differences in means between Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and benign disease were still highly statistically significant (Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: mean, 17.76 F 14.23; benign disease: mean, 8.25 F 8.13; P < 0.0001). Interestingly, five Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with cervical lymph node squamous cell carcinoma but no identified upper aerodigestive tract primary lesion had elevated mean soluble CD44 levels compared with the combined control group (19.2 ng/mL; P = 0.15, t test; P < 0.01, nonparametric test). Whereas none of them had a visible malignant lesion in the upper aerodigestive tract by endoscopy with appropriate biopsies, three had previous Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and the other two had unknown primaries, where the origin of the squamous cell carcinoma was not  identified. The unknown primary Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a well-described entity and occurs in f5% of cases (13). The high levels in all three patients with a history of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and recurrence in the neck raise the possibility that the soluble CD44 test detects Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma malignancy in its earliest stages before invasion occurs. Levels did not correlate significantly with tumor stage, tumor size, presence of lymph nodes, history of previous Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (recurrence or second primary), or history of prior radiation (Table 1). Whereas the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and controls did not vary significantly with respect to race or ability to gargle, by m2 analysis, cancer patients were significantly older, more likely male, less educated, reported less income, had poorer dentition, used more tobacco products, and drank more alcohol (Table 2). Therefore, although the groups were not balanced with respect to some known risk factors, the adjusted analysis provides strong indication that there is indeed higher expression of soluble CD44 in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer patients compared with subjects with benign disease. Patients with Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are at risk of developing a second primary in the upper aerodigestive tract because of the combination of a field effect and clonal outgrowth associated with upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinogenesis (49, 50). Therefore, patients with a history of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are expected to have multiple areas of dysplasia throughout their upper aerodigestive tract, even after the initial primary tumor is treated. Interestingly, the patient has a history of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ, suggesting that this patient's mucosa is laden with many areas of dysplasia. Using results from the complete group of 102 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 69 benign disease controls, the sensitivity and specificity of the soluble CD44 test were calculated at several cutoff points, thereby deriving its receiver-operator characteristic curve. The test also identified 73% of recurrences, 62% of second primaries, and 60% of newly diagnosed Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Reflux is a known risk factor for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and these patients may be at risk for developing malignant change. Interestingly, the subject who converted to severe dysplasia had no other risk factors for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma other than a history of reflux.

On further review, our data showed that protein levels were significantly higher in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (1.08 mg/mL) compared with benign disease patients (0.507 mg/mL; P < 0.0001), thus accounting for this loss of significance. We were concerned that protein levels in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were elevated because the patients were dehydrated because large tumors can cause swallowing difficulties. Results of methylation-specific PCR on subjects with low soluble CD44 levels showed that 9 of 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 0 of 10 normal control subjects had hypermethylated CD44. Characteristics of the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases are given in Table 5. Our data suggest that the soluble CD44 test is very specific for Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. It is elevated in the majority of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and may be useful in the future to identify patients likely to respond to anti-CD44 therapies. In our pilot study, we showed that soluble CD44 levels in oral rinses were >7 times elevated in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma compared with controls. We are not aware of other studies that have evaluated specificity of a Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma marker to this extent. CD44 promoter is hypermethylated in DNA from oral rinses of 9 of 11 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and 0 of 10 benign disease patients with low soluble CD44. For example, all three of the patients with history of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, recurrence in the neck, and no invasive upper aerodigestive tract disease at the time of collection had elevated levels. This, along with the theory of clonal outgrowth, explains why Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with multiple invasive tumors and why patients with a history of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have a significant chance of developing a second invasive primary (49, 50). Thus, the three patients with a history of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and recurrence in the neck at the time of oral rinse collection would be expected to have multiple regions of dysplasia in the upper aerodigestive tract. This study shows that soluble CD44 is elevated in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with benign disease patients and distinguishes cancer from benign disease with 62% sensitivity. Much of this seems to be explained by a few very high soluble CD44 levels occurring mainly in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Although soluble CD44 levels are elevated in the majority of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, many have low levels. A significant proportion of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients had low soluble CD44 levels, which overlapped levels in the benign disease  Table 5. We have previously reported our pilot data on hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase, which are both elevated in saliva of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients compared with controls (25) and are good potential constituents of such a marker panel. We found that >80% of the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with low soluble CD44 levels can be distinguished from benign disease controls based on methylation status of the CD44 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing CD44 promoter hypermethylation in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry findings support that both underexpression and overexpression of CD44 are associated with poor prognosis in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (41, 42). This high specificity and ability to detect most of the Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma missed by the soluble CD44 test suggest that the combination of these markers will result in an early detection test with estimated sensitivity and specificity of f90%. Thus, when protease activity is high in the tissues, CD44 may be released into saliva and serum and no longer visible by immunohistochemistry on the cell membrane. Conclusions  SolCD44 in oral rinses may be a useful marker for early detection of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma when combined with other markers in a panel. Our pilot data using methylation-specific PCR suggest that CD44 hypermethylation may explain the low soluble CD44 levels seen in some Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and, together with the soluble CD44 test, provide a means to detect Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with very high sensitivity and specificity.

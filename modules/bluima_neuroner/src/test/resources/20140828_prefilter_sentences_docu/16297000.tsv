In this review the present author follows the neuronal pathway for histamine-induced itch. Neuropathic itch at different levels of the neuronal pathway is described. The anatomical framework for itch conduction  A neuronal pathway of itch described in this section has been elucidated using histamine as a model for “pure itch.” Cutaneous nerve fibers conducting itch Sensory neurons or primary afferent neurons have a unipolar cell body located in the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves or in the sensory ganglia of cranial nerves. The axons of neurons that conduct itch are unmyelinated C fibers that end in the skin at the dermo-epidermal junction, sometimes penetrating into the epidermis as free endings. The depletion of nerve transmitters in the peripheral afferents will stimulate synthesis of new nerve transmitters in the cell bodies of the spinal ganglia (8). The orthodromic nerve transmission of sensory C fibers will be conducted through the peripheral processes of the spinal nerves to the spinal ganglia and from there through the central processes of the spinal nerves to the dorsal root of the spinal cord (FIG. In experiments on rat, intracutaneous administration of histamine, nicotine, and capsaicin, as well as topical application of mustard oil and noxious heat resulted in activation of most superficial dorsal horn neurons (9). Recently, neurons selectively sensitive to histamine “itch-specific neurons” have been identified in cat (10). Mechano- and heat-insensitive neurons were identified using antidromic stimulation from thalamus and a collision of antidromic and orthodromic impulses. Later these neurons were tested with histamine applied iontophoretically to the skin. These neurons cross over the spinal  FIG. The lamina I spinothalamic tract neurons cross over to the contralateral side and ascend to the thalamus. Neuronal projections from the ventral medial nucleus in the thalamus terminate in the sensorimotor cortex, whereas neurons from the medial dorsal nucleus in the thalamus terminate in the cingulate cortex. These neurons have been shown to lack ongoing discharge (common in pain conduction neurons) and to have slow central conduction velocities (10). Spino-thalamico-cortal transmission of itch Primates seem to have a direct pathway from lamina I spinothalamic tract neurons through midbrain to two sites in the thalamus: the ventral medial nucleus and the medial dorsal nucleus (9). Neuronal projections from the ventral medial nucleus in the thalamus terminate in area 3a in sensorimotor cortex, whereas neurons from the medial dorsal nucleus in the thalamus terminate in the anterior cingulate cortex (9). Like all neuropeptides, most transmitters occur both in the neurons of the peripheral and the central nervous system. Serotonin and histamine occur in cellular structures in the skin but act as nerve transmitters in the neurons of the central nervous system. The depletion of histamine from dermal mast cells by compound 48/80 greatly reduces the flare response to substance P, suggesting flare to be dependent on histamine (18,19). Close contacts between mast cells and nerve fibers have been demonstrated (23 –25). substance P stimulates mast cells to degranulate and the released histamine stimulates blood vessels and new neurons to release nerve transmitters. The reaction is potentiated by other mediators, such as bradykinin, cytokines, and serotonin released from the inflammatory cells. This cascade of events is dependent on the density of nerve fibers, on the occurrence of mast cells, and on the concentration of inflammatory mediators. The erythema does not seem to be mediated by mast cell histamine or by C-fiber tachykinins, as it is not suppressed by pretreatment with either H1 receptor antagonist, mepyramine, mast cell histamine liberator, compound 48/80, or by lidocaine treatment. These findings are in accordance with the finding that calcitoningene-related peptide does not induce activation of mast cells and release of histamine (29). Capsaicin is a highly potent burning substance that selectively stimulates nociceptives and causes release of neuropeptides from afferent temperature-sensitive neurons, both peripherally and within the spinal cord (33). Expression of heatactivated vanilloid receptor, VR1, binding capsaicin, has been found not only in cutaneous sensory nerves but also in mast cells and epithelial cells (FIG. CMR1 and VR1 have been shown to coexist sometimes in the same primary afferent neurons and promote to thermo-sensations in a wide range of temperatures 8 –28 °C and > 50 °C, respectively (38). Pruritogenic mast cell mediators Histamine has been known to be a main itchinducing substance for many years (1). Accumulation of mast cells has been shown in many pruritic, inflammatory skin conditions (46). In the clinical situation, histamine is not released alone but together with other mediators stored or produced after activation of mast cells like chymase and tryptase, platelet-activating factor, leukotrienes, prostaglandin D2, and interleukins 4, 5, 6, and 8. The H3 receptors are mainly expressed in the neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system, whereas H1, H2, and H4 receptors are found on mast cells (48). The itch and flare reactions induced by histamine are also reduced by pretreatment with a local anesthetic, lidocaine, indicating that mast cells and nerve fibers constitute a functioning unit. Mast cell chymase is released together with histamine upon degranulation of mast cells. Rat mast cell chymase was shown to induce flare, weal, and itch in human skin. Mast cell tryptase is also released along with histamine upon degranulation of mast cells and it seems to be an important mediator of itch by its activation of proteinase-activated receptor 2 present on sensory nerve fibers and endothelial cells (50). Activation of mast cells stimulates synthesis of several metabolites of arachidonic acid. Plateletactivating factor is synthesized in activated mast cells. Other pruritogenic mediators of inflammation Mast cell mediators, especially histamine, seem to be very important in the perception of itch. Prostaglandin D is produced by mast cells, being released in urticaria (55). This cascade of events is dependent on the innervation territories of the neurons, on the density of mast cells, and on the concentration of inflammatory mediators. There is often no clinical inflammation in the skin and the symptoms will be elicited by spontaneous firing of neurons without a noxious or pruritogenic stimulus (FIG. Here the neurons can start firing either spontaneously or as a result of pressure on the nerve, which is the case in entrapment syndromes (FIG. (B) Sometimes, the neurons can be activated without the involvement of peripheral nerve endings. Inflammation at this level can enhance neuronal excitability, causing repetitive activation of the C-fibers. Here the neurons can start firing spontaneously as may be the case in brachioradial pruritus.

Spinal neuropathic itch A lesion can also be located in the spinal ganglia like in herpes infection and postherpetic neuralgia (FIG. Here the neurons become activated without the involvement of peripheral nerve endings. Inflammation at this level can enhance neuronal excitability, causing repetitive activation of the C fibers (FIG. Here the neurons can start firing spontaneously as a result of injury induced by the drug. In these cases pruritus is induced by a spontaneous firing of damaged neurons. Jinks SL, Carstens E.

Myers1,4  Abstract  Purpose: We investigated whether vandetanib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and rearranged during transfection, could augment the antitumor activity of radiation with or without cisplatin in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Experimental Design: OSC-19 and HN5 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells that were cisplatin and radioresistant were treated with vandetanib, cisplatin, and radiation alone or in combination in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic nude mouse model. Treatment effects were assessed using clonogenic survival assay, tumor volume, bioluminescence imaging, tumor growth delay, survival, microvessel density, tumor and endothelial cell apoptosis, and epidermal growth factor receptor and Akt phosphorylation data. Results: Vandetanib plus cisplatin radiosensitized head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. It also increased both tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cell apoptosis and decreased microvessel density in vivo. Conclusion: The addition of vandetanib to combination therapy with cisplatin and radiation was able to effectively overcome cisplatin and radioresistance in in vitro and in vivo models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Introduction  Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), which represent approximately 3.2% of cancers in the United States, accounted for approximately 49,260 new cancer diagnoses and 11,480 deaths in 2010 (1). Despite advances in treatment, the 5-year survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has not significantly improved over the past several decades (2). Although surgery and radiation have traditionally been used to treat locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (4), the addition of platinum-based chemotherapy such as cisplatin is playing an increasingly prominent role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treatment (5). Treating patients who have locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with platinum-based chemotherapy and concurrent radiation improves locoregional control, organ preservation, and disease-free and overall survival (6–8). However, because some patients develop chemoand radioresistance, only 50% and 60% of the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with radiation and concurrent platinumbased chemotherapy are cured of their disease. To improve treatment efficacy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, researchers must have a more thorough understanding of the pathways mediating chemo- and radioresistance (9, 10). Identifying the factors that cause tumor cells' radioresistance is essential to improving therapy outcomes in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (11). One potential mechanism by which tumor cells become radioresistant is epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, which can be activated by radiation (12). 1815  Translational Relevance  Although chemoradiotherapy with platinum compounds is one of the standard treatment regimens for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, some HNSCCs are resistant and persist/recur after this type of treatment. In this study, we showed vandetanib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor and rearranged during transfection tyrosine kinases, plus cisplatin radiosensitized both head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Vandetanib in combination with cisplatin and radiation inhibited both tumor growth and the incidence of cervical lymph node metastases, and prolonged survival in an orthotopic nude mouse model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, the blockade of both vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway by the addition of vandetanib to combination therapy with cisplatin and radiation may overcome cisplatin- and radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma effectively and this regimen could represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy that may warrant evaluation for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway is a potential radiosensitization strategy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Another potential strategy for overcoming radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is angiogenesis inhibition. In addition, antiangiogenic agents have been reported to enhance the tumor cell response to platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs (21). Vandetanib (AstraZeneca), an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and rearranged during transfection tyrosine kinases, has the potential to restore chemoand radiosensitivity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells. In a previous study, we found that vandetanib alone and in combination with paclitaxel had beneficial therapeutic effects in an orthotopic mouse model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (22). However, the combination of vandetanib, radiation, and current chemotherapeutic agents used for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treatment has not yet been evaluated preclinically. We investigated whether vandetanib could augment the antitumor activity of cisplatin with or without concurrent  radiation in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cell lines Seventeen human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were used. FaDu cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Luka Milas provided HN5 cells. UM-SCC-1, -4, -11A, -14A, -17A, -17B, -22A, and -47 cells were provided by Dr. TU-138 cells were provided by Dr. SCC-61 cells were provided by Dr. OSC-19 cells were obtained from Dr. SqCC/Y1 cells were obtained from Dr. MDA-1386TU cells were obtained from Dr. TR-146 cells were provided by Dr. PCI-13 cells were provided by Dr. OSC-19 cells were retrovirally infected with the green fluorescent protein and the luciferase gene (OSC-19-luc) as described previously (23). SCC61 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, a 2-fold vitamin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.4 μg/mL hydrocortisone. SqCC/Y1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 low glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and L-glutamine. JHU028 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. All other head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and a 2-fold vitamin solution. Rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD31 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PECAM), the primary antibody for immunohistochemical analysis, was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Cell proliferation assay The antiproliferative activity of cisplatin against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro was determined using an MTT assay as previously described (24). Briefly, 17 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were plated in 96-well plates in medium. After a 24-hour attachment period, the cells were incubated for 72 hours in various concentrations of cisplatin (0.01–90 μM) or with phosphate-buffered saline alone as a control. The cells were then lysed in 100 μL dimethylsulfoxide to release formazan. The concentration of vandetanib giving 50% growth inhibition for each cell line was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad Software). Clonogenic survival assay To determine the sensitivity of the 17 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines to radiation, we performed a clonogenic survival assay. The cells were then assayed for colony-forming ability by trypsinizing and replating specified numbers of cells in 100mm dishes in drug-free medium. After 10 to 12 days of incubation, the cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet  in absolute ethanol, and colonies with more than 50 cells were counted under a dissection microscope. OSC-19 and HN5 cells were used in further studies, because they were both cisplatin and radiation-resistant, according to results from MTT assay and clonogenic survival assay with 17 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. OSC-19 and HN5 cells in culture were exposed to cisplatin (4 and 9 μM, respectively) for 1 hour, exposed to vandetanib (2 and 2.5 μM, respectively) for 6 hours, and then irradiated. After treatments, the cells were assayed for colony-forming ability as described earlier. Plating efficiency was defined as the percentage of cells seeded that grow into colonies under a specific culture condition of a given cell line. The survival fraction, expressed as a function of irradiation, was calculated as the number of colonies counted/(the number of cells seeded  plating efficiency/100). Orthotopic nude mouse model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma We used an orthotopic nude mouse model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma because its host microenvironment is more similar to that of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma than that of subcutaneous xenograft models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (25). OSC-19-luc, OSC-19, and HN5 cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures by trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. An orthotopic nude mouse model of an oral tongue tumor was established by injecting OSC-19-luc (1  105), OSC-19 (1  105), or HN5 (2  105) cells suspended in 30 μL of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium into the tongues of mice as described previously (26). Eight to 10 days after the cells were injected, the mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups (7 or 8 mice per group): (1) control, (2) cisplatin (3) vandetanib (4), vandetanib plus cisplatin (5), radiation (6), cisplatin plus radiation (7), vandetanib plus radiation (8), vandetanib plus cisplatin and radiation. We used an IVIS 200 Imaging System (Xenogen) to image the animals and Living Image software (Xenogen) to quantify the photons emitted from luciferase-expressing cells. Before engineered OSC-19-luc cells were used in vivo, we used the IVIS imaging system to confirm in vitro that the cells homogeneously expressed high levels of luciferase. We euthanized mice by CO2 asphyxiation when they lost more than 20% of their preinjection body weight or at 50 days after cell injection. Quantification of microvessel density and apoptotic endothelial cells To quantify TUNEL expression, we counted the positively stained cells in 12 random 0.04-mm2 fields at 200 magnification. We calculated the number of apoptotic endothelial cells as the average of the ratio of apoptotic endothelial cells to the total number of endothelial cells in 10 random 0.01-mm2 fields at 400 magnification. Western blotting Western blot analyses of tumor and cultured cells were performed. OSC-19 cells (2  105 per well) were plated in 6-well plates (Costar) in 2 mL medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with vandetanib, cisplatin, and irradiation as described earlier. Total cell lysates were then obtained and subjected to Western blot analysis as previously described (24). Results  OSC-19 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and HN5 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells were cisplatin and radiation resistant MTT assays with cisplatin and clonogenic survival assays with radiation revealed cisplatin growth inhibition values ranging from 1.03 to 9.52 μM and surviving fraction after 2 Gy values ranging from 0.22 to 0.80 (Supplementary Table S1). OSC-19 cells and HN5 cells were relatively cisplatin and radiation-resistant: The cisplatin growth inhibition values were 5.19 μM for OSC-19 cells and 9.08 μM for HN5 cells, and the surviving fraction after 2 Gy values were 0.63 for OSC-19 cells and 0.70 for HN5 cells (Supplementary Table S1). Vandetanib plus cisplatin radiosensitized OSC-19 and HN5 cells In clonogenic survival assays, radiation alone resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in HN5 and OSC-19 cell survival. Cell growth inhibition was observed in both cell lines after 1 hour of exposure to cisplatin and 6 hour of exposure to vandetanib. OSC-19 cells treated with 2 μM vandetanib and 4 μM cisplatin exhibited more growth inhibition than control cells (Fig. 1A). Although the radiosensitizing effect of treatment with 2.5 μM vandetanib and 9 μM cisplatin on HN5 cells was milder than the radiosensitizing effect on OSC-19, both cell lines demonstrated enhancement compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). 0246 Dose (Gy)  A 1 Surviviing Fraction 0.1 OSC-19 0.01 0246 Dose (Gy) control B cisplatin 1 vandetanib vandetanib +cisplatin Surviviing Fraction 0.1 HN5 0.01 0246 Dose (Gy)  Figure 1.

The antitumor effects of these treatments were confirmed in a repeat animal experiment with OSC-19 and HN5 cells (data not shown). Vandetanib plus cisplatin enhanced the radiosensitivity of orthotopic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors The antitumor effects of the experimental treatments measured by tumor growth delay in OSC-19-luc tumors are shown in Table 1. Cisplatin only slightly delayed tumor growth by 2.9  0.9 days, and a single dose of 5 Gy radiation delayed tumor growth by 5.1  1.1 days, whereas vandetanib treatment delayed tumor growth by 10.6  0.8 days. Thus, vandetanib plus cisplatin enhanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors' radioresponse more than vandetanib plus radiation. Vandetanib plus cisplatin and radiation prolonged survival in an orthotopic nude mouse model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma All OSC-19-luc control mice in the survival study were euthanized within 25 days following cell inoculation (Fig. 2D).

Compared with the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in the tumors from mice in the control group (0.92%  0.29%), the percentages of TUNEL-positive cells in the tumors from mice in all treatment groups were increased significantly (cisplatin, 3.72%  0.85%; vandetanib, 11.49%  0.67%; vandetanib plus cisplatin, 12.46% 1.22%; radiation, 9.98%  1.09%; cisplatin plus radiation, 16.58%  2.03%; vandetanib plus radiation, 19.03% 2.99%; vandetanib plus cisplatin and radiation, 24.41% 2.50%). In addition, the percentages of TUNELpositive cells in the vandetanib plus cisplatin and radiation  group were also significantly greater than in the vandetanib alone group, cisplatin alone group, radiation alone group, and the vandetanib plus radiation group (P < 0.05). Double immunofluorescence staining for CD31/TUNEL revealed that vandetanib, vandetanib plus cisplatin, and vandetanib plus radiation significantly increased apoptosis for tumor-associated endothelial cells compared with the control group (control, 0%; vandetanib, 5.38  2.51, P = 0.0460; vandetanib plus cisplatin, 5.62  2.40, P = 0.0306; vandetanib plus radiation, 5.94  2.53, P = 0.0304). The apoptosis for tumor-associated endothelial cells was further enhanced when vandetanib was combined with radiation and cisplatin (8.01  2.74, P = 0.0090; Fig. B, cells were treated with 2 μM of vandetanib for 6 hours, 4 μM of cisplatin for 1 hour, and irradiation (3 Gy). Whole-cell lysates were obtained and subjected to Western immunoblotting to resolve proteins. These in vivo results confirmed in vitro findings with Western blot analysis of OSC-19 cells that vandetanib alone or in combination with cisplatin and/or radiation inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Discussion  We found that vandetanib augmented the antitumor activity of cisplatin with concurrent radiation in preclinical models of human cisplatin- and radiation-resistant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Vandetanib plus cisplatin effectively radiosensitized head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with vandetanib, cisplatin, and radiation led to reductions in tumor size and cervical lymph node metastases and prolonged survival in an orthotopic nude mouse model by inducing apoptosis in tumor and endothelial cells. Chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin remains a standard treatment for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, with the aim of improving organ preservation as well as patient survival  (31). Therefore, the addition of more selective agents that target cancer cells may enable the reduction of cisplatin and possibly radiation to less toxic doses. In a phase III randomized trial, Bonner and colleagues found that patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with radiation plus cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor, had better locoregional control, longer disease-free survival, and longer overall survival than patients treated with radiation alone (34). Therefore, we evaluated whether the combination of cisplatin and radiotherapy with vandetanib, a potent inhibitor of both VEGFR and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, may represent a valuable therapeutic approach against experimental head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer in this study. In this study, OSC-19 and HN5 were selected as representative cell lines as relatively cisplatin- and radiationresistant cell lines from a panel of 17 different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. However, in our previous study, we found that the growth inhibition of vandetanib for HN5 cells (2.357) was higher than its growth inhibition for OSC-19 cells (1.981; ref. This inconsistency may have arisen because vandetanib's antitumor effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may be a result of the agent's inhibition of VEGF signaling within the tumor microvasculature rather than its direct antiproliferative effects via epidermal growth factor receptor signaling inhibition. These inconsistent findings might also reflect the biological differences between the 2 cell lines. However, a number of studies have shown that vandetanib enhances radiation effects in preclinical models (28, 39, 40) including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (41). Ansiaux and colleagues reported that the blockade of VEGFR signaling reduces oxygen consumption rate in tumor cells and cause an early increase in tumor oxygenation (44). The presence of cervical lymph node metastasis is a critical event for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (3). These findings are consistent with our previous reports in which the blockade of both epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 pathways decreased the incidence of the neck lymph node metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (22, 30). In this study, immunohistochemical analysis and TUNEL assay revealed that vandetanib significantly decreased tumor microvessel density and induced apoptosis in tumor and endothelial cells. Slight decreases in microvessel density along with enhanced radiationinduced endothelial apoptosis is consistent with a previous report indicating that radiation can kill tumor cells as well as tumor-associated endothelial cells (45). Again, the combined treatment with vandetanib, cisplatin, and radiation showed the most marked induction of apoptosis in tumor and endothelial cells, and suppression of microvessel density compared with the other treatment groups, indicating that vandetanib enhanced the combined effect of cisplatin and radiation. Indeed, vandetanib's primary antitumor effect in tumor endothelial cells is believed to be generated by its inhibition of VEGFR signaling (46). For head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, clinical trials of epidermal growth factor receptor-inhibiting agents combined with cisplatin have shown that these treatments are active and well tolerated meriting additional investigation (47– 49). Papadimitrakopoulou and colleagues reported that 100 mg of vandetanib was the maximum tolerated dose when it was combined with radiation and cisplatin in patients with previously untreated advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (50). In conclusion, we found that vandetanib plus cisplatin enhanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma radioresponsiveness in vitro and in vivo and that vandetanib plus cisplatin, and radiation had significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic mouse model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and inhibited cervical lymph node metastases in vivo. The combination treatment with vandetanib, cisplatin, and radiation induced apoptosis in endothelial and tumor cells, decreased tumor microvessel density, and blocked epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation to help to overcome radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These results suggest that vandetanib sensitizes some head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  15. cells to cisplatin and radiation. This combined treatment could have potential as treatment against advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and may warrant further evaluation in clinical trials.

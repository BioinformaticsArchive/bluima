19529000	The replication of R5 HIV in monocyte-derived macrophages was greatly enhanced when cells were co-cultured with freshly isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (syngeneic to monocyte-derived macrophages). published online 16 June 2009  Keywords: glycyrrhizin; HIV; macrophages; neutrophils; CCL2; interleukin 10  The major targets for HIV infection are cells expressing CD4 molecules and HIV entry co-receptors on the cell surface. The difference in chemokine receptors is important for the cellular tropism of HIV. As primarily isolated monocytes do not express CCR5 on their surface, R5 HIV cannot enter into the cells.10,11 X4 HIV replicates in cultures of T cells.12 Earlier, we have shown that the HIV replication is inhibited by glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice) in CD8+ T cell-depleted HIV patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells co-cultured with healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells.14 CCL4 and CCL5 produced by healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells are identified as effector molecules for the anti-HIV activity of glycyrrhizin.15 RESULTS Effect of glycyrrhizin on R5 HIV replication influenced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils To determine the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin on the PMN-associated R5 HIV replication, monocyte-derived macrophages (5105 cells ml1) exposed to 15.8 TCID 50 per ml of R5 HIV were co-cultured with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5106 cells ml1, syngeneic to monocyte-derived macrophages), in the presence of glycyrrhizin (100 μg ml1). monocyte-derived macrophages (5105 cells ml1) were exposed to 15.8 TCID50 per ml (a) or 1580 TCID50 per ml (b) of R5 HIV for 3 h. After washing excess viruses, these cells were co-cultured with healthy donor polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5106 cells ml1, syngeneic to monocyte-derived macrophages) in the presence (filled triangles) or absence (filled circles) of glycyrrhizin (100 μg ml1). The quantity of p24 antigen in culture fluids of these cells was determined by ELISA. monocyte-derived macrophages (lower chamber) exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV were cultured with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5106 cells ml1, upper chamber) in double chamber transwells supplemented with 100 μg ml1 of glycyrrhizin. Thus, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (2106 cells ml1) stimulated with 1580 TCID per ml 50 of R5 HIV for 3 h, were washed with media, and cultured with glycyrrhizin (100 μg ml1) for an additional 18 h. monocyte-derived macrophages (5105 cells ml1, lower chamber) were exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV for 3 h. After washing, these cells were cultured with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5106 cells ml1, upper chamber) in double chamber transwells supplemented with or without glycyrrhizin (100 μg ml1). At 24 h after cultivation, the upper chamber was removed and cells in the lower chamber were cultured for an additional 14 days. The quantity of p24 antigen in the culture fluids of these cells was determined by ELISA. polymorphonuclear neutrophils (210 cells ml1) were exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of 6 R5 HIV or ultraviolet-inactivated R5 HIV for 3 h. The cells were washed with media and re-cultured with or without 100 μg ml1 of glycyrrhizin for 18 h. DISCUSSION In our earlier studies,14,15 glycyrrhizin was shown to be inhibitory on the replication of R5 HIV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with R5 HIV infection,  p24 (pg/ml)  CCL2/interleukin 10 glycyrrhizin 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000  --  -+  +-  ++  Figure 4 Effect of glycyrrhizin on HIV replication in MDM cultures supplemented with a mixture of CCL2 and interleukin 10. monocyte-derived macrophages (5105 cells ml1) exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV were cultured for 3 days. Then, cells were washed and re-cultured with fresh medium added with a mixture of rCCL2 (2 ng ml1), rIL-10 (0.2 ng ml1) and glycyrrhizin (100 μg ml1) for 12 days. The quantity of p24 antigen in the culture fluids of these cells was determined by ELISA. One of the cellular entry sites of R5 HIV (CCR5) on the surface of target cells is blocked by these chemokines.1–3 The replication of R5 HIV in monocyte-derived macrophages was greatly enhanced when these cells exposed to the virus were co-cultured with polymorphonuclear neutrophils. glycyrrhizin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 μg ml1 is not cytotoxic against various murine and human tissue culture cells. By trypan blue dye-exclusion test, 90% or more of polymorphonuclear neutrophils were shown to be viable, after cultivation of healthy donor peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (1106 cells ml1) for 18 h with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μg ml1 glycyrrhizin. As our PMN preparations utilized in the experiments were not completely pure (93% pure cells), further studies for the clarification of a role of tumor necrosis factor α/IL-6 will be needed in our transwell-cultivation system. It has been described in many papers15,29–33 that CCL2 and interleukin 10 enhance the replication of R5 HIV in tissue culture cells. Thus, the replication of R5 HIV in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells depleted of CD8+ T cells was increased by CCL2,29 and intracellular growth of R5 HIV in monocyte-derived macrophages was enhanced by rCCL2.30 Media and monocyte-derived macrophages The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from heparinized whole blood by Ficoll–Hypaque sedimentation.15 Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using fibronectincoated plates, as previously described.15 Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (1107 cells ml1) were placed into fibronectin-coated 24-well plates. The plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to allow monocytes to attach, and then floating cells were removed by washing with warm medium. R5 HIV R5 HIV (SF162 strain) was propagated in healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with PHA (5 μg ml1) for 3 days. The cell viability was higher than 99%, when it was determined by trypan blue dye-exclusion test. Monocyte-derived macrophages (5105 cells ml1) were exposed to R5 HIV (15.8 or 1580 TCID50 per ml) for 3 h. Afterwards, excess viruses were removed by washing with warm medium, and these cells were cocultured with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5106 cells ml1). Monocyte-derived macrophages (lower chamber) exposed to 15.8 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV were cultured with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5106 cells per ml, upper chamber) in double chamber transwells (0.4 μm pore, Corning Costar, NY, USA). At 24 h after cultivation, the upper chamber was removed and the cells in the lower chamber were re-cultured for 14 days. CCL2 and interleukin 10 production by polymorphonuclear neutrophils exposed to R5 HIV Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (2106 cells ml1) were exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV. At 3 h after cultivation, the cells were washed with media, and re-cultured with 1–100 μg ml1 of glycyrrhizin. 2 Dragic T, Litwin V, Allaway GP, Martin SR, Huang Y, Nagashima KA et al. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 entry into CD4+ cells is mediated by the chemokine receptor CC-CKR-5.

19765000	We analyzed the genomic region spanning wild-type R132 of isocitrate dehydrogenase by direct sequencing in 125 glial tumors. Our data suggest that isocitrate dehydrogenase or IDH2 mutation plays a role in early tumor progression of several types of glioma and might arise from a common glial precursor. The infrequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation in primary glioblastomas revealed that these subtypes are genetically distinct entities from other glial tumors. In summary, mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene were frequently found in several types of grade II and III gliomas, including gangliogliomas, suggesting that isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations are very early events in gliomagenesis and may affect common glial precursors. The infrequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation in primary Glioblastomas revealed that these subtypes are genetically distinct entities from other glial tumors.

Transform 5 ml of ligation into electrocompetent E. coli cells by electroporation. Incubate transformed cells in SOC for 1 h at 37Â°C 9. Plate all cells on SOB agar plates with selectable marker (chloramphenicol if using pMCG161 as a vector). Extract plasmid DNA from E. coli cells using standard protocols.

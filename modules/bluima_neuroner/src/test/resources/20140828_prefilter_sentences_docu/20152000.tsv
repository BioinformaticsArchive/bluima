20152000	Compound 4 (3 mg/kg, unless otherwise mentioned), rosiglitazone (15 mg/kg), GW501516 (10 mg/kg) and dexfenfluramine (30 mg/kg) were suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose and 2% Tween 80. PPARγ and pET23b.PPARδ) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells that were induced with IPTG, harvested and centrifuged. CV-1 cells (# CCL-70, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) in 12-well plates at 60 – 80% confluence were co-transfected with the GAL4 – PPARγ construct along with the luciferase reporter, pFR Luc (Cat. About 6 h after changing to growth medium (DMEM with 10% FCS), selective PPAR agonists (α, γ and δ) or pan agonists (GW7647, GW501516, rosiglitazone, indeglitazar, and compound 4) were added and cells were incubated for 40 h, harvested and assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Cat. In a cell-based reporter gene assay, compound 4 fully activates human PPARα and PPARδ, with EC50s of 0.9 and 0.05 μM respectively (table 1). PGC-1α recruitment and cellular activation of compound 4 for PPAR receptors. Of note, compound 4 has very similar potency against the mouse receptors and also behaves as a partial agonist in cell-based reporter gene assays. In agreement with the partial PPARγ activation observed in cell-based assays, the increase in adiponectin levels in mice treated with compound 4 were approximately 2.5-fold lower than the levels induced by rosiglitazone (table 4). The incidence and severity of hepatocellular necrosis (table 6), mitoses (not shown) and cytoplasmic vacuolation (not shown) were increased in the liver of compound 4-treated wild-type mice as compared to vehicle-treated mice and associated with increased levels of total bilirubin (table 3). Histopathology of mice treated with compound 4.  Findings Vehicle Hepatocellular necrosis Muscle Degeneration/regeneration Compound 4 Hepatocellular necrosis Muscle Degeneration/regeneration  ∗1 = minimal; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = marked. Greater levels of unsaturation have been correlated with greater lipid peroxidation and cell death [39,40]. In wild-type mice, the incidence and severity of hepatocellular necrosis and skeletal muscle degeneration/regeneration were elevated with the agonist as compared to vehicle-treated animals. Interestingly, these histopathological findings were completely absent in PPARα knockout mice suggesting that our pan PPAR agonist compound 4, induced hepatocellular necrosis and skeletal muscle degeneration/regeneration in a PPARα-specific manner.

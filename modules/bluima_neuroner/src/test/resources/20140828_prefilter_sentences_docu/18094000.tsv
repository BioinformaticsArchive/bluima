18094000	The rheumatoid synovium comprises primarily fibroblast and monocyte/macrophage cells, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines of which tumour necrosis factor- and interleukin-1 are thought to be the central cytokines driving synovial inflammation, joint destruction and the development of systemic complications in Rheumatoid arthritis [6]. Identification of an endothelial cell growth-inhibitory activity produced by human monocytes. Tumor necrosis factor blockade reduces synovial cell infiltrate early after initiation of treatment, but apparently not by induction of apoptosis in synovial tissue.

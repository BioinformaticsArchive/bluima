20615000	Detection of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells by optical stretching  Jakob M. We present the application of a microfluidic optical cell stretcher to measure the elasticity of malariainfected red blood cells. The measurements confirm an increase in host cell rigidity during the maturation of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The device combines the selectivity and sensitivity of single-cell elasticity measurements with a throughput that is higher than conventional single-cell techniques. The method has potential to detect early stages of infection with excellent sensitivity and high speed.

The infection is accompanied by profound changes in the mechanical properties of the infected host red blood cells RBCs , contributing to re- 1 duced blood flow in the microcirculation and vasoocclusion. A precise assessment of the mechanical properties of infected red blood cells IRBCs is thus essential for an improved understanding of the disease, for the assessment of potential treatments, and for improved diagnostic purposes. At the single-cell level, micropipette aspiration, optical tweezers, and magnetic traps offer powerful tools for precise measure- 2 ments of cell compliance. Bulk methods such as ektacytometers have fast 2,3 acquisition, but deliver only ensemble measurements liable to deliver false negative results when samples contain small subpopulations of IRBCs among many uninfected cells. The method combines the sensitivity of traditional single-cell measurement techniques with the potential for high throughput analysis. The optical stretcher can determine IRBC elasticity in a noncontact mode by trapping cells directly between two di-4,5 vergent counterpropagating laser beams. 1 a . The trapped cell is stretched along the axis of the laser beams by 4 simply modulating the light intensity. The stretching forces are generated by the momentum transfer that occurs at the interface between the sample cell and the surrounding medium due to a change in refractive index. These surface forces pull the cell apart, analogous to a tug-of-war situation. The resulting stretching force can be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than the net trapping forces, the latter arising from the asymmetric force field for cells positioned slightly off the 4 center in the trap. Spheroidal cell shapes greatly facilitate theoretical modeling, and consequently the only quantitative measurements of erythrocyte mechanical properties with the optical stretcher have been performed in the past on osmoti- 4 cally swollen erythrocytes. An alternative approach, taken here, is to employ a simplified phenomenological model to quantify cell compliance. Here we use the simple Kelvin-Voigt model, assuming only a global viscosity and elasticity constant E for the whole cell. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Cultures and Preparation of Cells  Red cells infected with Pf A4-BC6 clone kindly provided by B. After a cell is positioned in the trap, the capillary flow is halted. The cells stretch and relax according to the light intensity. The image analysis routine automatically locates the cell boundaries and displays corresponding cell edge pixels. d The same cell as in c , elongated due to increased power in the optical stretcher. Stretching Procedure The cell compliance measurements were performed as previ- 5 ously described. When cells were trapped with the major axis of the uninfected, biconcave-disk-shaped cells aligned parallel to the laser fibers , the flow was stopped for the time of the measurement. 1 b . In the malariainfected sample, cohort cells were visually distinguishable from trophozoite-containing IRBCs, as the latter contained 9 dark hemozoin crystals and had irregular shape. Image analysis and edge detection were performed with custom software written in Labview Vision National Instruments, Austin, Texas . The cell elongation was measured by performing an ellipse fit of the digitally recognized cell edge pixels, reporting the axis length parallel to the optical fibers. They show a typical sample of cell edges in trapped Fig. 3 Results/Discussion Optical stretcher measurements of cell compliance were done in three different types of cells: 1. trophozoite-containing IRBCs, 2. uninfected RBCs of the IRBC culture cohorts , and 3. controls. 1 e represent the exponential strain-time relation from the Kelvin-Voigt model Eq. 1 . The parameters for these fits and their standard errors of the mean SEM are shown in Table 1. Optical stretching of infected and uninfected red blood cells confirms results obtained with other single-cell 11 mechanics-measurement techniques. Measurements with optical tweezers had found IRBCs to stiffen significantly during  Table 1 Fitting parameters and their standard errors of the mean describing the cell deformations. The table shows the number of stretch responses n in each experiment, the two fitting parameters a and , the goodness of the fit chi-square , and the average cell diameter in the trap before stretching D. This ratio decreased by a factor of 3 for the infected cells in our experiments. Our study shows that uninfected cohort cells from Pf cultures and control RBCs do not have significantly different mechanical properties in vitro. Dondorp et al. attribute the reduced deformability of red blood cells infected and uninfected from patients with severe malaria also to al- 3 terations in the uninfected RBCs not to be confused with “uncomplicated malaria” in Ref. The extension to uninfected RBCs is made in that study because of the low fraction of parasitized cells present 20% , and the finding that the measured deformability did not correlate with different parasitaemia levels. However, the simplified phenomenological model used for analysis here proved sufficient for detecting the mechanical differences in diseased cells. The characteristic deformation rate is independent of the actual magnitude of stress on the cell. Both parameters a and change significantly during infection with the probability of the null hypothesis that the means are not different p 0.001 , and establish the use of this optofluidic device in applications that involve automatic cell sorting, early stage diagnostics, or screening of drugs that reduce cell stiffening. In summary, optical stretching is a promising novel technique to measure red blood cell mechanical properties and their changes during disease. Its main advantage is that it operates entirely in a noncontact manner and can thus render  results that are free from artifacts induced by adhesion to surfaces or physical contact required in other single-cell mechanical-measurement techniques. In addition, by incorporation into a suitable microfluidic environment and 14 automation, throughput rates approaching one cell per second can in principle be achieved, which compares favorably 5 with other single-cell mechanical-measurement techniques.

When the hull presents a continuous barrier, as was shown in Tonicella lineata, the acrosome may contain more than one granule, and these are used up sequentially during penetration (Buckland-Nicks et al., 1988). Behavior of centrosomes during fertilization and cell division in mouse oocytes and in sea urchin eggs.

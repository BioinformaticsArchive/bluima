Moreover, neurons continue to die for hours after spinal cord injury as a result of several mechanisms, including excitotoxicity, vascular abnormalities, and inflammatory response, that can contribute to evolution of spinal cord secondary injury (Kwon et al., 2004). Post-traumatic inflammation is determined by a number of cellular and molecular events (Carlson et al., 1998). In fact, they infiltrate the marginal zone around the injured area, release inflammatory mediators, and activate endothelial cells, leading to increased vascular permeability, edema for-  through: 1) histological damage and apoptosis, 2) modulation of apoptosis-related transduction factors (Bax and Bcl-2), 3) expression of inflammatory markers [nitrotyrosine, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, interleukin-2, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor- ], and 4) T-lymphocyte infiltration.

Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein) protein originally cloned in a glucocorticoid-treated hybridoma T cell line (Nocentini et al., 1997) is a protein belonging to tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It is expressed in several cells and tissues, including T cells, where it acts as a costimulatory molecule (Tone et al., 2003; Ronchetti et al., 2004, 2007) after activation by its ligand (Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand), mainly expressed on antigen-presenting cells and endothelial cells. Recent evidences suggest that physiological or pharmacological triggering of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein exacerbates acute and chronic inflammatory response due not only to T cell modulation but also to modulation of extravasation and innate immunity (Krausz et al., 2007). In fact, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand can activate cytoplasmic signals upon Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein binding and privilege the development of tolerogenic dendritic cells (Agostini et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2005; Baltz et al., 2007; Grohmann et al., 2007). Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc was purchased from Alexis Corporation (Lausen, Switzerland) and is a dimer of a fusion protein formed by the extracellular domain of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein and the Fc portion of human IgG1; 6) Fc-treated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / group: Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice were subjected to spinal cord injury and received Fc control (6.25 g/mouse) by mini-osmotic pump. TUNEL assay is a technique revealing double strand breaks and used to detect apoptotic cells. Damaged neurons were counted, and the histopathologic changes of the gray matter were scored on a six-point scale (Sirin et al., 2002): 0 no lesion observed, 1 gray matter contained one to five eosinophilic neurons, 2 gray matter contained 5 to 10 eosinophilic neurons, 3 gray matter contained more than 10 eosinophilic neurons, 4 small infarction (less than one third of the gray matter area), 5 moderate infarction (one third to one half of the gray matter area), and 6 large infarction (more than half of the gray matter area). CFSE labeling technique reveals cells undergoing cell doublings during in vitro test. In fact, cells are labeled at time 0, cultured in vitro, and, at the end of the culture period, studied by flow cytometry to evaluate the amount of CFSE present. The more they have proliferated, the lower the amount of CFSE present in the cells. Cells were resuspended at 1 106 cells/ml in prewarmed (37°C) PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Freshly prepared CFSE (Invitrogen SRL, Milan, Italy) was added to a final concentration of 10 M, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Excess CFSE was quenched by adding 5 volumes of ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubating the cells for 5 min on ice. CFSE-labeled cells were then washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured with the indicated stimuli. Cells (0.5 106 cells/ml) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 g/ml), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol. Seventy-two hours later, the percentage of cells that have performed at least one cell cycle was evaluated through flow cytometry, conducted on a flow cytometer (EPICS XLMCL; Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) running FCS Express 3.0 analysis software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA). The positive staining was mainly localized in inflammatory cells as well as in nuclei of Schwann cells of the white (wm) and gray (gm) matter. s1c) were found in inflammatory cells as well as in nuclei of Schwann cells in wm and gm of the  Fig. Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein is a costimulatory molecule in T cells, resulting in increased T-cell activation and proliferation. When T cells are cultured together with other cells of lymphoid organs, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand expressed on antigen-presenting cells may increase proliferation of anti-CD3-activated T cells. So, we hypothesized that if Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc acted by inhibiting Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein stimulation, its addition should in turn inhibit cell proliferation. In fact, when cells from spleen and lymph nodes were CFSE-labeled and -stimulated with low doses of  Fig. anti-CD3, addition of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc inhibited cell proliferation in three of four conditions tested, as shown in Fig. To verify whether the effect of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc was due exclusively to the inhibition of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein triggering (as hypothesized on the basis of in vivo experiments) or also to activation of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand (expressed in T cells also), we performed a similar experiment with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / cells. In these cells, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc did not exert antiproliferative activity (Fig. 8, b and c), further supporting the conclusion that Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc inhibits cell proliferation by inhibition of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein triggering. Virtually no apoptotic cells were detected in the spinal cord from sham-  Fig. The decreased proliferation of anti-CD3 activated T lymphocytes after Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc treatment was observed in cells from Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice and not from Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice. CFSE-labeled cells from lymph nodes of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / (a) and Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / (b) mice were activated with anti-CD3 (1 or 0.5 g/ml, respectively) and cotreated with Fc control protein (left) or Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc fusion protein (right). The percentage of cells undergoing at least one cell cycle is also reported. c shows the increase or decrease in the percentage of cycling T cells from spleen and lymph nodes, activated with the specified anti-CD3 concentrations. Results are the mean of four experiments; in each experiment, the cells derive from a pool of four mice. The significance of the difference of proliferating cells in Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc cotreated versus Fc cotreated cells is also reported ( , p 0.01; , p 0.05; n.s., p 0.05). Tissues from spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice demonstrated dark brown apoptotic cells (approximately five cells per field) and intercellular apoptotic fragments (Fig. 9a and Supplemental Fig. In contrast, tissues obtained from spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice showed a smaller number of apoptotic cells (approximately one per field) (Fig. 9a and Supplemental Fig. Likewise, very few apoptotic cells were observed in the spinal cord tissues collected from spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc fusion protein (Fig. 9a and Supplemental Fig. Neither treatment of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice with control Fc nor treatment of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc reduced or increased the presence of apoptotic cells (Fig. 9a and Supplemental Fig. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the different groups was evaluated and is reported in a. CD4 (Fig. 10c) and CD8 (Fig. 11c) cells were observed in the spinal cord tissues collected from spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice. Spinal cord sections from sham-operated mice did not show CD4 cell infiltration, as expected (a and b). A spinal cord section of spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice including wm and gm shows CD4 T cell infiltration (c). CD4 T cell infiltration was less in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice (d) and in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc (e). T-cell infiltration seen in Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with control Fc was similar to that observed in untreated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice (not shown), and staining seen in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc was similar to that observed in untreated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice (f). To quantify T cell infiltration, the area stained with anti-CD4 antibody was calculated and the mean of all experiments was reported for all groups (g). The levels of T-cell infiltration of spinal cord injury mice were compared with the respective sham-operated mice, and significance is reported ( , p 0.001; , p 0.05). number of cells, including T lymphocytes (Tone et al., 2003; Ronchetti et al., 2004; Cuzzocrea et al., 2005; Nocentini and Riccardi, 2005; Patel et al., 2005; Ramirez-Mon-  Fig. Spinal cord sections from sham-operated mice showed no CD8 cell infiltration (a and b). A spinal cord section of spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice including wm and gm shows CD8 T-cell infiltration (c). CD8 T cell infiltration was less in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice (d) and in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc (e). T-cell infiltration seen in Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with control Fc were similar to those observed in untreated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice (not shown), and staining seen in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice treated with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc was similar to that observed in untreated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice (f). To quantify T cell infiltration, the area stained with antiCD8 antibody was calculatedm, and the mean of all experiments was reported for all groups (g). The levels of T-cell infiltration of spinal cord injury-mice were compared in the respective sham-operated mice, and significance is reported ( , p 0.001; , p 0.05). Moreover, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein participates in the activation of neutrophils and other cells of innate immunity, playing a pro-inflammatory role in acute and chronic inflammation (Cuzzocrea et al., 2006, 2007; Krausz et al., 2007). In fact, evidence in other experimental models suggests that Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand can activate cytoplasmic signals in a number of cells, including dendritic cells, where Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand triggering by Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein inhibits interleukin-12 production and increases tryptophan catabolism, thus favoring a tolerogenic phenotype that could account for a decreased inflammation (Agostini et al., 2005; Grohmann et al., 2007). Moreover, results in other studies indicate that Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand triggering on antigen-presenting cells promotes inflammatory response (Shin et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2006). In the inflammatory response, extravasation of cells plays an important role. During inflammation, both Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein and Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand are expressed on endothelial cells of vessels, and evidence has suggested that Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand/Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein system modulates extravasation (Cuzzocrea et al., 2004, 2006). In the present experimental model, T cells are reduced in the perilesional area of spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / and Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc-treated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice compared with spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / . These results are in agreement with our previous observation indicating a decreased extravasation of neutrophils in Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice that correlates with a decreased expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, P-selectin, and E-selectin (Cuzzocrea et al., 2004, 2006). The lack of differences of cell infiltration in spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / and Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc treated spinal cord injury-Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein / mice, further suggest that a role is played by Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein activation, but not by Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand activation, and that Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc inhibits extravasation by impeding Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein triggering. In our opinion, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein, expressed on endothelial cells, is triggered by Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, and activated T lymphocytes (Krausz et al., 2007) and induces up-regulation of adhesion molecules. Moreover, inhibition of inflammatory cell migration in the perilesional area contributes to a decreased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines that is also a consequence of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein antagonism on pro-inflammatory cells as here demonstrated for tumor necrosis factor- , interleukin-2, and interleukin-12 (Figs. After spinal cord injury, apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes is associated with axonal degeneration (Kwon et al., 2004). These results are in accordance with previous observations showing that spinal cord injury-induced apoptosis is Bax-dependent (Martin and Liu, 2002; Dong et al., 2003) and that overexpression of Bcl-2 protects cells from spinal cord injury (Seki et al., 2003). However, considering that for signaling of Bcl-2 family members, cell localization is critical, the real contribution of these proteins to spinal cord injury-induced apoptosis has to be further investigated. Thus, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein triggering up-regulates Fas ligand in Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein positive cells, including activated T cells that are present in the perilesional area (Figs. Similar conclusions were reached by Muriglan et al. (2004), working on a graft-vs-host experimental model, showing that Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein stimulation increases Fas ligand expression in CD4 effector T cells, and by Ramirez-Montagut et al. (2006), showing that tumor rejection elicited by Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein triggering depends on augmentation of Fas ligand expression. In conclusion, Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein ligand/Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein system plays a role in the inflammatory neuronal lesion secondary to spinal cord injury that can be antagonized by treatment with Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc. Moreover, those results, considering the different role of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein in different steps of inflammatory process, including cell activation, cytokine production, and cell migration, prompt to further studies aimed at better defining the potential use of Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc as anti-inflammatory drug and the mechanisms responsible for Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-Fc therapeutic effect.

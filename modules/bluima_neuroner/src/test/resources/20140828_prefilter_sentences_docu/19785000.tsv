Thus, in metabolic studies of β cell function, insulin secretion should always be interpreted in the context of concomitant insulin sensitivity [2]. Therefore, pharmacological agents known as insulin receptor activators that restore insulin receptor auto-phosphorylation in insulin-resistant cells could be useful for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus [7, 8]. In response to acute insulin stimulation, intracellular vesicles that store glucose transporter 4 translocate to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, as oxidative stress is produced under diabetic conditions and is likely involved in the  progression of pancreatic β cell dysfunction [16], an agent that possesses antioxidant activity would be better for diabetic patients. In this model, hyperglycemia arises because of the irreversible destruction of the β-islet cells of the pancreas by streptozotocin and consequently reduces insulin secretion. DNA strand breaks and poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 over-activation are prime modes of streptozotocin-induced islet cell death [17]. It is also known that the usage of antioxidants, such as metallothionine and poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, prevents β-cell destruction in vitro and in vivo [17, 18]. Apoptotic cells were determined using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells were imaged in at least four randomly selected fields. Protective effect of Anthocyanins against streptozotocin-induced apoptosis in the pancreas  In order to determine the protective effects of Anthocyanins against streptozotocin-induced apoptotic cell death of pancreatic tissues, the  Figure 4. Figure 5 clearly shows that 30 days after streptozotocin treatment, Anthocyanins exert a protective effect against STZinduced apoptosis in pancreatic tissue (including β-islet cells) through the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of Bax protein. Moreover, a transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay also showed that streptozotocin induced a significant induction of apoptotic cell death in pancreatic tissue, which was effectively inhibited by Anthocyanins (Fig. 6). Anthocyanins protect pancreatic tissue (including β-islet cells) from streptozotocin-induced apoptotic cell death, as shown by a transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Anthocyanins exhibited marked protective effects compared with glibenclamide and decreased the positive nuclei (green) in pancreatic tissues (including β-islet cells). The insulin receptor is a tetrameric protein consisting of two identical extracellular α-subunits and two identical transmembrane β-subunits with intracellular tyrosine kinase activity [39, 40]. Blood glucose levels are mainly controlled by insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. streptozotocin destroys pancreatic β cells by different mechanisms, including DNA damage by alkylation, depletion of NAD≠, and generation of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species. Thus, we examined if Anthocyanins might prevent streptozotocin-induced oxidative stress and further apoptotic cell death. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with Anthocyanins prevents streptozotocin-induced apoptotic cell death in pancreatic tissues (including β-islet cells) through the regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax, and anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, and the cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 5). In addition, a transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay shows that Anthocyanins prevent streptozotocin-induced apoptotic cell death. Of course, our data do not directly provide evidence that Anthocyanins protect pancreatic β-islet cells from apoptosis by streptozotocin; however, it is commonly known that detecting apoptotic cell death in β-islet cells is difficult [43]. Therefore, we attempted to demonstrate the protective effect of Anthocyanins on streptozotocin-induced apoptosis using pancreatic tissues consisting of β-islet cells. Apart from the nonenzymatic antioxidants, enzymatic antioxidants, such as Superoxide dismutase and catalase, play an important role in protecting cells from oxidative damage. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that (i) the administration of Anthocyanins demonstrates anti-hyperglycemic effects, which control blood glucose levels and restored body weight in diabetic conditions; hemodynamic parameters are significantly improved by Anthocyanins in both groups (i.e. same-day and post-treatment), thereby suggesting that Anthocyanins may, in a long term, prevent the  development of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, or heart dysfunction; (iii) Anthocyanins increase the concentration of insulin in diabetic rats; (iv) Anthocyanins restore glucose transporter 4 expression in the plasma membranes of skeletal and heart tissues, thereby inducing glucose uptake in diabetic conditions; (v) the administration of Anthocyanins results in the activation of IRβ tyrosine kinases, suggesting that Anthocyanins may be insulin receptor activators in the treatment of diabetes; (vi) Anthocyanins protect pancreatic tissue including β-islet cells against apoptosis induced by streptozotocin through the regulation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, and thus, prevent the loss of islet viability and functionality; and Anthocyanins restore antioxidant-defense mechanisms, thus protecting tissues from oxidative damage in the diabetic state.

21957000	Guest Editors: Markus Sauer, Duncan Graham, Philip Tinnefeld BioImaging is a topic of great interest in medical and biological science because it enables the almost non-invasive imaging of cellular structures in three dimensions. Various superresolution imaging methods have been developed over the last years that are unified by the demand for efficient photostable fluorescent labels and probes that selectively label target molecules in cells or reflect the presence of specific target molecules (e.g. enzymes) by a change in their photophysical characteristics. The special issue covers the development of new biomedical markers and life cell labels and demonstrates their successful use in medical and biological imaging applications. Guest Editors: Dieter Naumann, Max Diem The bi-annual workshop “Vibrational Spectroscopy in Microbiological and Medical Diagnostics” brings together researchers from across the word to discuss the applications of infrared and Raman spectroscopy, micro-spectroscopy and related techniques for the identification and classification of micro-organisms, and for the detection and diagnosis of disease in individual human cells. Applications include the full span from intracellular microsurgical applications to large volume coagulation, from photochemical internalization via antimicrobial photodynamic therapy to interstitial PDT. Edited by: Valery V. Tuchin, Anna N. Yaroslavsky, Steven L. Jacques, Rox Anderson This issue focuses on state-of-the-art research in biophotonics for dermatology and its applications with particular emphasis on novel optical methods, skin disease diagnosis and treatment as well as monitoring disease treatment on the cellular and molecular level. Edited by: Thomas Huser, Dennis Matthews, Brian Wilson Recent advances made in the optical characterization, tracking, and imaging of stem cells are discussed. Stem cells, in particular in their pluripotent form, are an unlimited source of self-renewal for injured tissue and offer significant promise for a cure of a wide range of diseases from cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and even infectious disease. Edited by: Valery V. Tuchin, Attila Tárnok, Vladimir P. Zharov This special topic focuses on state-of-the-art research in novel field, non-invasive in vivo cytometry and its applications with particular emphasis on the novel biophotonic methods, disease diagnosis, and monitoring of disease treatment at single cell level in stationary and flow conditions. General topics include light scattering, fast video microscopy, polarization, laser-scanning, fluorescence, Raman, multi-photon, photothermal, and photoacoustic methods for cellular diagnostics and monitoring of disease treatment in living organisms.

19367000	Our model of Golgi tendon organ activity in reinnervated muscles does not take into account any reorganization of the afferent neurons that innervate them or their central projections, however. However, reinnervation by motor neurons that originate from a different motor pool than that before the injury demonstrate highly abnormal recruitment patterns (Gordon 1988, Gordon and Stein 1982). Recruitment order in the decerebrate cat appears to be less susceptible to alteration (Clark et al 1993, Prather et al 2002) but motoneuron activity patterns during decerebrate locomotion are known to be different than those in intact cats (Hoffer et al 1981). In fact, individual motoneurons exhibit rather complex modulations in their firing during cutaneous reflexes in the intact, walking cat (Loeb et al 1987), so we elected to model the extreme case where the motor units are frequency modulated but their recruitment order is completely reversed. In patients where paralysis results from lesions of upper motor pathways (e.g. stroke and spinal cord injury), the motoneurons, peripheral  nerves and muscles are typically spared, making it feasible to stimulate the large myelinated axons of the motoneurons in order to produce muscle contraction. Depending on where the motoneuron stimulation is applied (e.g. intramuscular, peripheral nerve, motor nuclei), at least some proprioceptive afferents including those innervating the Golgi tendon organs are likely to be recruited as well. Therefore, the researchers concluded that efference copy from the descending command plays a major role in our perception of force, although it should be remembered that the motoneurons themselves have recurrent collaterals signaling their output to the Renshaw spinal interneurons. Additional research is needed in order to determine the relative importance of the various mechanisms that might be involved in force perception (sensory feedback from Golgi tendon organs and efference copy from descending commands and motoneuron activity). Finally, our observations shed light on the utility of microelectrode arrays to record sensory feedback from peripheral nerves or the cell bodies of the primary afferents in the dorsal root ganglion (Branner et al 2004, Stein et al 2004). More promising results were  obtained by implanting the electrode array into the dorsal root ganglia. The recent study showed that recordings from less than ten selected neurons (mostly associated with muscle spindle activity) can accurately predict the limb position while moving the cat's hindlimb passively through a variety of trajectories. 68 1503–15 Henneman E and Olson C B 1965 Relations between structure and function in the design of skeletal muscles J.

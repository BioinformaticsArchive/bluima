17909000	The androgen-independent Rv1 cells express high levels of the truncated androgen receptor, and treatment of these cells with a calpain inhibitor reduces truncated androgen receptor expression. The HIV protease inhibitor amprenavir inhibits calpain activity and is also effective in inducing apoptosis in the Rv1 cell line. The cell culture studies were reproduced in a mouse xenograft model, where, in the absence of androgens, amprenavir significantly reduces tumor growth. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9001–5]  Introduction  Most prostate cancers initially present as androgen-dependent neoplasms and therapy relies on androgen ablation aimed at blocking androgen receptor cell signaling. Calpain activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including calcium modulation, autoproteolysis, phosphorylation, intracellular distribution, and inhibition by calpastatin (8). LNCaP, Rv1, PC3, and MCF-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and propagated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37jC and 5% CO2. LNCaP cells were plated, cultured overnight, pretreated with 40 Amol/L of calpeptin or DMSO for 15 min, and then treated with 10 Amol/L ionomycin (Calbiochem) for 20 min. Rv1 cells (2  105) were plated in 35-mm plates and cultured overnight. For analysis of calpain inhibition in the presence or absence of androgens, cells were plated at 105 in 35-mm plates and propagated in androgen-containing or androgen-depleted media (phenol red–free media/charcoal-stripped  serum) for 48 h before addition of calpeptin, amprenavir (at 15 or 30 Ag/mL), or DMSO. Floating and adherent cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/ PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4jC. LNCaP cells were resuspended in calpain assay buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100]. PC3 cells were propagated in control or androgen-depleted media. Three days after castration, 4-week-old athymic mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were injected with 1.5  106 Rv1 cells in Matrigel (1:1). To test this possibility, LNCaP cell extracts were treated with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 to activate calpain. Our previous study identified a novel androgen receptor mutation in Rv1 cells, a line derived from the relapsed CWR22R-2152 human xenograft. Rv1 cells contain a duplication of the third exon (13) that was not detected in the parental, androgen-dependent CWR22 tumor (14), and express an 80- to 85-kDa truncated form that is missing the ligand binding domain. Treatment of LNCaP cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin activated endogenous calpain resulting in proteolysis of the androgen receptor to an f80-kDa isoform (Fig. 2A). In a complementary experiment, calpeptin treatment of intact Rv1 cells reduced the level of the truncated form (Fig. 2B ). A, treatment of LNCaP cells with ionomycin promotes proteolysis of the androgen receptor to the truncated isoform. B, treatment of CWR22Rv1 cells with 40 Amol/L calpeptin for 24 or 48 h reduces the expression of the truncated form. PC3 cells were plated (1.0  105 cells/35-mm dish), propagated in control or androgen-depleted media, and transfected with prostate tumors. D, a Western blot analysis of cells transfected with the control pCDNA3, truncated form, or FL-androgen receptor plasmid along with the luciferase expression plasmid and CMV-h-galactosidase plasmids shows the expression levels of the truncated form and FL-androgen receptor. Nonmalignant tissue transfected cells shows that the levels of androgen receptor expression is com- (benign prostatic hyperplasia) expressed very low levels of truncated form  Figure 3.

To establish specific antigen expression in Rv1 cells proliferating in AD+ and AD media, in the presence or absence of calpeptin. Does calpain inhibition in the absence of androgens caused reversion of the Rv1 cells to the parental androgen-dependent phenotype? Calpeptin-treated cells survived well in the presence of androgen, although calpeptin retarded proliferation (Fig. 3C). However, calpeptin treatment in the absence of androgens resulted in a decrease of viable cells. A 72-h calpeptin treatment in the absence of androgens induced apoptosis in f40% of the cells, supporting the hypothesis that calpain inhibition causes Rv1 cells to revert to an androgen-dependent phenotype (Fig. 4A ). Calpeptin, while effective in cell culture studies, has limited utility for animal studies. A previous report indicated that HIV protease inhibitors inhibit calpain activity (15); therefore, Rv1 cells were treated with amprenavir. Importantly, treatment of Rv1 cells with amprenavir in the absence of androgens caused the cells to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Calpain cleavage affects various aspects of cell physiology and the consequences of increased calpain activity are determined by cellular context. Treatment of Rv1 cells with calpain inhibitors in the absence of androgens promotes apoptosis. A, Rv1 cells were propagated in the absence or presence of androgens and treated with DMSO or calpeptin (40 Amol/L) for 72 h. After fixation, cells were stained with DAPI and fluorescence microscopy was used to detect chromatin condensation and pyknotic nuclei. B, treatment of Rv1 cells with 30 Ag/mL amprenavir (amprenavir ; 48 h) reduced the expression of truncated form. C, Rv1 cells growing in the presence or absence of androgen were treated with 15 or 30 Ag/mL amprenavir or DMSO for 72 h. DAPI staining was used to detect apoptotic cells. Points, tumor size; bars, SE.  isoform is not a rare event restricted to relapsed cell lines derived from a single tumor (CWR22) but a previously uncharacterized feature of certain prostate tumors. Rv1 cells, but not the parental CWR22 androgen-dependent xenografts, express high levels of a COOH-terminally truncated androgen receptor. During progression of the CWR22 cells to androgen independence, the Rv1 line acquired an additional mutation, resulting in the insertion of sequences near the calpain cleavage site, perhaps sensitizing the molecule to calpain-mediated proteolysis. Treatment of Rv1 cells with calpain inhibitors in the absence of androgens causes the cells to undergo apoptosis possibly by causing reversion to the androgen-dependent phenotype.

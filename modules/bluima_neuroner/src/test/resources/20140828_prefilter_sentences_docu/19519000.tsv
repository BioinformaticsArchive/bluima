First, immobile circular spots of actin form on the cell membrane. Third, wavelike actin structures reminiscent of cell "leading edges" appear and coexist with spots. As waves strike the cell periphery the amoeba recovers its ability to move. Dynamic actin structures in the substrateattached cortex of a Dictyostelium cell, as visualized by TIRF microscopy. The cell was incubated for 15 min under 5 "M latrunculin A to depolymerize F-actin.

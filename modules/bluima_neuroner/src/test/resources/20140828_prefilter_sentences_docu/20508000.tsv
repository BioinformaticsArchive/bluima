20508000	Serological typing methods have a limitation in that newly emerging types may be missed and culturing of clinical isolates is usually required (Eckert et al., 2000), whereas genotyping methods are more sensitive and specific and  could be performed directly with crude cells of clinical specimens without culturing (Lan et al., 1993). A cell culture diagnostic technique showed that 14 (9.3 %) patients were infected with C. trachomatis (Ghanaat et al., 2008).

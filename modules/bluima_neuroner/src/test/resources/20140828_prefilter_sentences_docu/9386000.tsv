9386000	Most neurons in those cortical areas respond to head velocity and receive converging vestibular, visual and somatosensory input. Electrical stimulation of some of these cortical areas in anesthetized cats influences the activity of many vestibular nuclear neurons including those projecting to the spinal cord. Vestibular inputs to the cerebral cortex will be examined first, followed by cortical outputs to the vestibular nuclei and by cortical action on vestibular nuclear neurons. Also examined are signals carried by cortical neurons responding to vestibular inputs and behavioral deficits produced by cortical lesions. This areas 4 and 6 is indicated by localization of vestibular responding cells in the fundus of the lateral sulcus (s. lateralis; Fig. Long-latency (25– 200 ms) responses were observed in visual cortical (areas 4 and 6 17) neurons following d.c. polarization of the labyrinth in paralyzed cats (encØphale-isolØ preparation; Grüsser et al. 1959; Grüsser and Grüsser-Cornehls 1960). 1 A Localization of vestibular (circles), somatosensory (letters), and auditory (triangles) responses found in single neurons in macaque. In cats, three vestibular thalamic projections have been reported (Kotchabakdi et al. 1980): (1) caudal parts of the medial and descending vestibular nuclei and group z project mainly to the contralateral medial part of the posterior nucleus of the thalamus, including the magnocellular part of the medial geniculate body, the ventrobasal complex, and the areas 4 and 6 of the ventral lateral nucleus bordering the ventrobasal complex; (2) the superior nucleus and group y project mainly to the contralateral nucleus centralis lateralis and the adjoining nucleus paracentralis; and (3) the middle part of medial and descending vestibular nuclei and portions of superior nucleus and group y project to the contralateral ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body. Bottom: The percentage distribution of cortical labeled cells after injection of retrograde tracers into different compartments of the brainstem vestibular nuclear complex is displayed as bar diagrams. Effects of cortical stimulation on vestibular nuclear neurons  Although it is still unknown what action direct corticovestibular fibers exert on vestibular nuclear neurons, the activity of single neurons in the lateral, medial, and descending vestibular nuclei in anesthetized guinea pigs, cats, and rats is influenced by electrical stimulation of a variety of cortical areas including the temporal, temporoparietal (Arslan and Molinari 1965; Manni and Giretti 1968), parietal (areas 4 and 6 2pri on the anterior ectosylvian gyri: Gildenberg and Hassler 1971; areas 4 and 6 2: Wilson et al. 1997), somatosensory (areas 4 and 6 3a; Wilson et al. 1997), and motor cortices (areas 4 and 6 4 and 6; Gildenberg and Hassler 1971; Fukushima et al. 1984; Licata et al. 1987, 1990; Troiani et al. 1993), and the frontal eye field (Fukushima et al. 1984). Although the various cortical areas may exert different effects on vestibular nuclear neurons, the results available do not reveal clear, consistent differences and they will be described together. The activity of vestibular nuclear neurons was facilitated (Fig. 3A), inhibited, or facilitated with a later inhibition (Fig. 3B) by stimulation of the frontal eye field (Fig. 3C,D). Early work examined unidentified vestibular nuclear neurons in anesthetized cats and guinea pigs (Arslan and Molinari 1965; Manni and Giretti 1968). 3A–D Responses of vestibular nuclear neurons to stimulation of the frontal eye field in cats anesthetized with chloralose.

C Thresholds currents required to evoke responses of three vestibular neurons with six pulses plotted against location of stimulating electrode tips.

(Reproduced from Fukushima et al. 1984 with permission)  later work classified vestibular neurons as either type I or II (Duensing and Schaefer 1958) on the basis of their response to horizontal rotation (cats: Gildenberg and Hassler 1971), as vestibulospinal or nonspinal projecting neurons by antidromic stimulation of the first cervical segment and/or as second-order vestibular neurons or higher order neurons by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral labyrinth in cats and rats (cats: Fukushima et al. 1984; Licata et al. 1987; Troiani et al. 1993; rats: Licata et al. 1990). Recently, Wilson et al. (1997) have performed detailed studies on the effects of electrical stimulation of areas 2 and 3a (Hassler and Muhs-Clement 1964) on neurons in the medial, lateral, and descending vestibular nuclei in anesthetized cats. They classified vestibular neurons into several groups on the basis of their location, their response to natural vestibular stimulation (cf. Cortical stimulation facilitated or inhibited many vestibular nuclear neurons, and the effects were observed in virtually every group of neurons, although facilitation was most frequently observed particularly from areas 4 and 6 2. Latencies of the evoked responses induced by cortical stimulation have been assessed by both extracellular (more than 3 ms for excitation; Gildenberg and Hassler 1971; Wilson et al. 1997) and intracellular recording  5 (more than 2.3 ms for excitatory postsynaptic potentials, EPSPs; Fukushima et al. 1984). However, it is well known that monosynaptic EPSPs induced in spinal alpha-motoneurons by corticospinal fibers show strong temporal facilitation (Landgren et al. 1962). In order to assess the importance of direct connections between corticovestibular fibers and vestibular nuclear neurons, future experiments require measurement of the conduction time of corticovestibular fibers, of the time interval between cortical volleys and intracellularly recorded PSPs in vestibular nuclear neurons, and of the behaviors of these two latter components during repetitive cortical stimulation. The above results showing that cortical stimulation influences spontaneous activity of vestibular neurons projecting, e.g., to the spinal cord (Fig. 3A,B) suggest that descending cortical input is capable of modifying vestibular reflexes. Indeed, cortical stimulation suppresses or facilitates responses of vestibulospinal neurons induced by electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve (Fukushima et al. 1984 for areas 4 and 6 6 and frontal eye field stimulation in anesthetized cats). Properties of cortical neurons responding to vestibular input  In order to understand the functional role of the corticovestibular interactions, it is necessary to know the nature of signals carried by neurons in cortical vestibular fields, including neurons projecting to the vestibular nuclei. Therefore, properties of cortical neurons that receive vestibular input will be reviewed. About twothirds of neurons studied in the parietoinsular vestibular cortex responded to vestibular stimuli (Fig. 1A, Grüsser et al. 1990a). Cells showing activation during rotation toward the contralateral side (type II response) were  6 more frequently observed than cells showing activation during rotation toward the ipsilateral side (type I response). The phase of the response during sinusoidal rotation corresponded approximately to angular velocity, although responses of some neurons in alert cats corresponded to angular position (Mergner et al. 1985). For vertical rotation, parietoinsular vestibular cortex cells whose activity increased during nose-down pitch were more frequently observed than cells that showed activation by nose-up pitch. A majority of neurons in the anterior suprasylvian sulcus and parietoinsular vestibular cortex responded to more than one rotation plane (pitch, roll, or yaw), suggesting a convergence of horizontal and vertical canal inputs (Mergner 1979). Convergence of inputs from neck afferents as well as forelimb afferents was commonly found in cortical neurons responding to canal inputs in cats and monkeys (Fig. 1A, Kornhuber 1972; see also Mergner 1979; Mergner et al. 1985; Grüsser et al. 1990a,b). In contrast to the rest of areas 4 and 6 2, which received unilateral (contralateral) somatic afferents, many neurons in areas 4 and 6 2v received bilateral, deep somatic afferents mainly from the forelimbs. Areas 7a and medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 contain many visual tracking neurons that are active during smooth pursuit of a target (Kawano et al. 1984). About half of visual tracking neurons showed either a type I or type II response to horizontal rotation in complete darkness. Similar results were obtained for vertically responding, visual tracking neurons in the medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 during pitch rotation (Thier and Erickson 1992), and their responses were not significantly changed by presentation of brief target blanks, suggesting a nonvisual nature of the tracking response (Thier and Erickson 1992; Newsome et al. 1988, however, see Kawano et al. 1994). These results suggest that the signals carried by  some medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 neurons are related to gaze movements (Kawano et al. 1984). Many pursuit cells in areas medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 also receive visual slip velocity inputs, and, together with extraretinal eye velocity inputs, these cells could provide visual target motion information in space (Newsome et al. 1988; Andersen 1989; Thier and Erickson 1992). Some areas 4 and 6 7b neurons also responded to sinusoidal rotation in total darkness (Pause and Schreiter 1980). In the visually induced saccade task, saccade-related activity of many neurons in areas 7a and LIP was significantly influenced by angular body position in space (Snyder et al. 1993), and the modulated activity of these cells was a function of gaze (but not eye in the orbit) direction (Brotchie et al. 1995; Andersen 1996). Thus, the activity of saccade-related neurons and visual tracking neurons in the posterior parietal cortex may be related to visual, vestibular, and motor integration functions, including coordinate transformations for the determination of spatial locations and motion of visual targets (Andersen 1996). Their responses to natural (but not electrical) vestibular stimulation were evoked consistently only when the animals were fully awake and attentive, properties different from vestibular nuclear neurons or cortical neurons responding primarily to other sensory modalities (Mergner et al. 1985). Somatosensory cortex  In cats under barbiturate anesthesia, neurons in the vestibular projection region of areas 4 and 6 3a were identified as corticocortical neurons projecting to the motor cortex (areas 4 and 6 4g) or as pyramidal tract neurons (Zarzecki et al. 1983). Forty-three percent (6/14) of the corticocortical neurons and 63% (24/38) of the pyramidal tract neurons were activated by electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve, and most of these neurons also received convergent inputs originating from group I deep radial and/or ulnar nerves and low-threshold cutaneous afferents of the superficial radial nerve and/or dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. Visual cortex  Responses of visual cortical (areas 4 and 6 17) neurons to light flashes or moving visual stimuli were influenced by d.c. polarization of the labyrinth in paralyzed cats (encØp-hale-isolØ preparation; Grüsser et al. 1959; Grüsser and Grüsser-Cornehls 1960). Using unanesthetized, paralyzed cats, Tomko et al. (1981) examined the effects of 45 whole body tilt on receptive field properties of simple visual cortical neurons (Hubel and Wiesel 1959, 1962). The receptive field orientation of 73% of the cells examined remained unaltered relative to the head axis after tilt; whereas, in the remaining 27% of cells, receptive field orientations either over- or undershot the retinal tilt by more than 15 (Tomko et al. 1981; see, however,  Schwarzkroin 1972, using 30 tilt). Frontal cortex  Forty percent (30/75) of motor cortex (areas 4 and 6 4) neurons, including 20% of pyramidal tract neurons (6/30), were activated by electrical stimulation of the contralateral vestibular nerve in cats anesthetized with chloralose (Boisacq-Schepens and Hanus 1972). Many neurons received convergent, deep somatic afferents (Kornhuber 1972). Motor cortex (areas 4 and 6 4) neurons in alert monkeys also responded to electrical stimulation of the contralateral vestibular nerve either with phasic or sustained responses throughout the stimulation period, and many of them also responded to passive manipulation of the contralateral limbs or axial musculature (White and Brinkman 1988). The vicinity of the frontal eye field in alert monkeys contains cells responding to vestibular stimulation (Fukushima and Fukushima 1997). The cell shown in Fig. 4A responded to horizontal rotation in complete darkness and to optokinetic stimuli (Fukushima and Fukushima 1997), a response similar to that of parietoinsular vestibular cortex neurons (see Parietotemporal cortex). The frontal eye field is known to contain cells responding to smooth pursuit eye movement (MacAvoy et al. 1991; e.g., Fig. The great majority of pursuit cells also responded to whole-body rotation with the similar preferred direction when the monkeys suppressed the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Fig. 4B,b). Some of these cells did not respond to rotation when the monkeys fixated a stationary spot in space (Fig. 4B,c). These results suggest that the signals carried by some frontal pursuit cells are related to gaze movements (Fukushima et al. 1997). Most neurons in those cortical areas respond to head velocity and receive converging vestibular, visual, or somatosensory inputs, suggesting that signals carried by these neurons are not simple vestibular information but are more complex. Indeed, the posterior parietal cortex of alert monkeys contains neurons related to target motion or gaze direction. Some frontal cortical neurons also seem to carry signals related to gaze movements. Receptive field properties of some simple visual cortical neurons are affected by whole-body tilts in unanesthetized, paralyzed cats. 4A, B Response of two neurons recorded near and in the frontal eye field in an alert, head-fixed monkey. Traces are stimulus (table) position, horizontal eye position, vertical eye position, and cell discharge. B Responses of an frontal eye field cell: a horizontal pursuit without vestibular stimulation; b suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex when a laser spot moved horizontally in phase with the monkey; c fixation of an earth-stationary spot during horizontal rotation. Consistent with this observation, humans also showed asymmetry in their vestibulo-ocular reflex during sinusoidal, horizontal whole-body rotation after hemidecortication or hemispherectomy with the basal ganglia and thalamus left intact (Estaæol et al. 1980; Sharpe and Lo 1981): gain (eye velocity/head velocity) of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in complete darkness was lower during rotation toward the side contralateral to the lesioned side (i.e., the slow phase to the lesioned side) than gain during rotation toward the lesioned side; gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex tested with a stationary target also had a similar asymmetry (Estaæol et al. 1980; Sharpe and Lo 1981). Vestibular-related signals in the cerebral cortex  Various signals related to semicircular canal inputs are observed in wide areas of the cerebral cortex (see Properties of cortical neurons responding to vestibular input). Most of these signals seem qualitatively similar to those seen in thalamic neurons in alert monkeys (Blum and Gilman 1979; Büttner and Lang 1979; Schlag and SchlagRey 1986), although quantitative comparison is difficult because of different experimental conditions. Information on detailed properties of signals carried by input and output neurons within individual cortical areas is needed for further interpretation. A gaze direction-related signal was found in the saccade-related activity of posterior parietal neurons in the visually induced saccade task (see Parietotemporal cortex). In order to examine whether a similar signal is found in the saccade-related activity of frontal eye field neurons, it is necessary to use vestibular stimulation. Later studies in alert cats showed that electrical stimulation of the frontal eye field produces neck muscle activation with a threshold lower than 10 Mandl 1978a (Guitton and Mandl 1978a) and that the frontal eye field contains neurons that discharge in association with, and preceding, changes in neck muscle activity (Guitton and Mandl 1978b). To understand the role of the frontal eye field in head movement, further information is needed about the properties of signals carried by frontal eye field neurons in the head-free condition in behaving animals. The parietal vestibular regions in the anterior suprasylvian sulcus, areas 4 and 6 2v, and parietoinsular vestibular cortex, and some medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 and frontal vestibular neurons carry converging vestibular, visual, neck afferent, and eye velocity signals (see Parietotemporal cortex and Frontal cortex). Some pursuit cells in and near the medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 and frontal eye field also respond to suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex during brief target blanks or to the vestibulo-ocular reflex in the dark (see Parietotemporal cortex and Frontal cortex), suggesting that part of the impairment of voluntary modulation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in cortical patients may involve medial superior temporal visual areas 4 and 6 and/or frontal eye field damage. Such frequency-selective adaptive changes in the vestibulo-ocular reflex cannot be explained by brainstem and/or cerebellar mechanisms alone, since neurons in these structures have directionally selective responses but are not frequency-tuned (Wilson and Melvill Jones 1979; Shimazu and Shinoda 1992 for reviews). Indeed, in alert behaving monkeys, identified secondary vestibulospinal neurons including medial vestibulospinal neurons faithfully detect passive head movement, but are not activated by active head movement, as would be predicted from the passive responses (Boyle et al. 1996a,b; Gdowski et al. 1996; McCrea et al. 1996). This behavior is different from that of unidentified vestibular nuclear neurons in alert monkeys; the latter neurons responded in the same manner during active and passive head movements (Khalsa et al. 1987; also Schaefer et al. 1979 in awake rabbits). Apparently, expected neckvestibular interaction in many vestibular nuclear neurons (e.g., Anastasopoulos and Mergner 1982) is missing in the active head movement, suggesting that neck input may differ in the active and passive conditions (Khalsa et al. 1987). Studies that examined signals carried by neurons in the prefrontal cortex in behaving animals have not used vestibular stimulation (Funahashi et al. 1990), and therefore it is still unknown whether “working memory” indeed includes vestibular signals as well (Berthoz 1996). Most neurons in those cortical areas respond to head velocity and receive converging vestibular, visual, and somatosensory input, suggesting that signals carried by these neurons are not simple vestibular information but are more complex. For example, the posterior parietal cortex seems to contain neurons related to target motion or gaze direction. Electrical stimulation of some of these cortical areas in anesthetized cats is capable of facilitating or suppressing the activity of vestibular nuclear neurons including those projecting to the spinal cord, and thus is capable of modifying vestibular reflexes. However, nothing is known at present on the properties of cortical neurons projecting to the vestibular nuclei. The available results on unidentified vestibular-related cortical neurons still do not reveal clearly the nature of those differences. To extend our understanding of the involvement of the vestibular system in higher brain functions, more complex behavioral paradigms that could examine the behavior of identified cortical neurons during different aspects of movement and cognitive processes in alert trained animals may be fruitful. Electrical stimulation of the different projecting areas in the cortex combined with recording of identified vestibular nuclear neurons during active or passive head movement may also reveal a difference in the function of the various projections.

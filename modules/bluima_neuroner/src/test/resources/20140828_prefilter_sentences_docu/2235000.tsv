Key words: Pain; Arthritis; Neural transplants; Opioid peptides; Catecholamines; Chromaffin cells  Introduction  For the past several years, our laboratory has been exploring the potential for transplants into the CNS to provide a local source of neuroactive substances for reducing pain sensitivity. For these studies, adrenal medullary chromaffin cells were chosen as the graft source, since these cells produce and release several agents which can reduce pain sensitivity when injected locally into pain modulatory regions of the CNS. of Illinois at Chicago, 808 S. Wood St., Chicago, IL 60612, U.S.A.  chromaffin cells produce high levels of catecholamines and opioid peptides, as well as several other pharmacologically active neuropeptides [1, 10,15,17,33,36]. An additional advantage of using chromaffin cells as a local source of opioid peptides and catecholamines is the ability to increase the release of these agents by stimulating cell surface nicotinic receptors [9,17,33]. The contribution of opioid peptides and catecholamines released from the transplanted cells to vocalization reduction was assessed by antagonist pretreatment. At the termination of the study, morphologic analysis of the grafts was done to assess viability of the transplanted chromaffin cells. The arrows indicate clusters of chromaffin cells in the grafts. The areas with the largest clusters or chromaffin cells are typically those that have become weli vascularized. 6B is a higher mag~~cation of a cluster of chromaffin cells, revealing a healthy morphology and a rich vascularization. The chromaffin cells are readily identified by their large granules. There are no intervening neural processes in this densely packed cluster of chromaffin cells. This analgesia is probably due, at least in part, to the stimulated release of opioid peptides and catecholamines from the implanted chromaffin cells, since it can be blocked by opiate antagonist naloxone and partially attenuated by alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentola~ne. The arrows in A indicate cfusters of chromaffin cells in the graft. There are no intervening neural processes or connective tissue elements in this densely packed cluster 01 chromaffin cells. It is possible that the basal release of opioid peptides and catecholamines from the transplants are sufficient to attenuate the weight loss in arthritic rats, but that additional release of these agents from transplanted cells is required to reduce acute pain sensitivity. The role of released opioid peptides and catecholamines from the transplanted chromaffin cells was assessed using opiate antagonist naloxone and alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. The ability of naloxone to block and of phentol~ne to attenuate the reduction in vocalizations suggests that both opioid peptides  and catecholamines released from the transplanted chromaffin cells are involved in pain reduction in the arthritic rat. In addition, chromaffin cells produce other pharmacologically active neuropeptides (including neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, neurotensin, and vasoactive intestinal pol~eptide~ which may alter pain sensitivity at the spinal level and may play a role in the reduction of nociception in the transplanted animals. Morphologic studies indicate that the transplanted chromaffin cells survived well in spite of the increased activity in the immune system produced by adjuvant injection.

21322000	The arginine–valine peptides (RV peptides) formed micelles in aqueous solution with a critical micelle concentration of 1.35 mg/ml. In vitro transfection assay into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed that the R1V6 and R2V6 peptides had the highest transfection efficiencies at 1:30 weight ratios (plasmid DNA:RV peptide), while the R3V6 and R4V6 peptides had the highest efficiencies at 1:20 weight ratios. MTT assay showed that the RV peptides did not have any detectable toxicity to cells. KEY WORDS: AMPHIPHILE; ARGININE; MICELLE; PLASMID DNA DELIVERY; TRANSFECTION  INTRODUCTION  Gene delivery, in which DNAs or RNAs are delivered into the cells in order to elicit therapeutic effects, is a promising strategy for treating hard-to-cure diseases. However, Poly-L-lysine is toxic to cells, which limits its clinical application [Choi et al., 1998a]. These peptides formed micelles in aqueous solution. The peptide micelles were evaluated as gene carriers in terms of cytotoxicity and gene delivery efficiency. CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATION The critical micelle concentration of R3V6 peptide (MW 1,080) was measured via spectrofluorometry using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). fluorescence-activated cell sorting ASSAY The complex of R3V6 peptide with fluorescein amiditelabeled oligodeoxynucleotide (0.7 mg, 100 pmol, MW 7,240) was transfected to cultured C6 cells and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The transfected C6 cells were harvested and washed with phosphate buffered saline. The suspended cells were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. The C6 cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (phosphate buffered saline with 0.02% NaN3, 0.2% fetal bovine serum) and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. After supernatant was removed, C6 cells were resuspended in fixing buffer (fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer with 1% formaldehyde). Flow cytometry was performed using the BD fluorescence-activated cell sorting Calibur TM (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). CELL CULTURE AND IN VITRO TRANSFECTION Human embryonic kidney 293 and A7R5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 1% PS and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were seeded in six-well plates at 4  104 cells/well for luciferase assays and were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The complexes were added to the cells in fetal bovine serum-free medium. The cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37°C and harvested for luciferase assays. LUCIFERASE ASSAY After transfection and incubation, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline, and 120 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) was added to each well. The cell extracts were harvested and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min to remove cell debris. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were seeded at density of 1  104 cells/well in 24-well microassay plates and incubated for 24 h before transfection. The complexes were added to the cells in serum-free DMEM and were incubated with the cells for 4 h. The cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37° in a 5% CO2 incubator. The MTT medium was removed, and 750 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals formed by the live cells. The cell survival was evaluated by measuring the  absorbance at 570 nm. RESULTS  DESIGN AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RV PEPTIDES The RV peptides were designed with amphiphilic characteristics in order to form micelles formation in aqueous solution (Fig. 1). In addition, the RV peptides in micelles may behave like larger molecules as micelles and have high transfection efficiency. To confirm that the RV peptides formed micelles in aqueous solution, the critical micelle concentration of RV peptides in 5% glucose was measured using DPH (Fig. 2). Since the R3V6 peptides showed the highest transfection efficiency in the following experiments, its critical micelle concentration was measured as a representative value. The results showed that the critical micelle concentration of R3V6 peptide was 1.35 mg/ml (Fig. 2). Schematic representations of RV peptide micelles. Schematic representations of RV peptide micelles.

IN VITRO TRANSFECTION ASSAY To evaluate the intracellular uptake of DNA/R3V6 complex, FAMlabeled DNA/R3V6 peptide complex was transfected into C6 cell and the transfection efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometry. While lipofectamine showed approximately a cellular uptake efficiency of 51%, R3V6 had a uptake efficiency of 18% (Fig. 6). R3V6 peptide had lower efficiency than lipofectamine in terms of intracellular uptake, which is consistent with the results of luciferase assay. The pCMV-Luc/RV peptide complexes were prepared and transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells at various weight ratios. The complex of R3V6 peptide with fluorescein amidite-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide was transfected to C6 cells and incubated for 24 h at 37°C.

The efficiency of cellular uptake was measured by flow cytometry. The complexes were transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 and A7R5 cells. The R3V6 peptide had higher transfection efficiency than other RV peptides in both Human embryonic kidney 293 (Fig. 8A) and A7R5 cells (Fig. 8B). Although the R3V6 peptide had lower transfection efficiency than lipofectamine, it had higher transfection efficiency than Poly-L-lysine in 293 cells (Fig. 8C) and similar efficiency to Poly-L-lysine in A7R5 cells (Fig. 8D). The pCMV-Luc/RV peptide complexes were prepared at the optimal weight ratios and transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The results of the MTT assay showed that no RV peptides had any detectable toxicity, while viabilities of the Poly-L-lysine and lipofectamine treated cells were approximately 70% and  60%, respectively (Fig. 9). These results confirm that the RV peptides are not toxic to cells. DISCUSSION  In this research, we have shown that the RV peptides composed of hydrophilic arginines and hydrophobic valines formed stable complexes with plasmid DNA and delivered plasmid DNA to cells more efficiently than Poly-L-lysine. In vitro transfection assays showed that the R3V6 peptides are the most efficient RV peptide in Human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Because of the small number of positive charges, RV peptides had negligible cellular toxicity (Fig. 9). In a previous report, it was shown that plasmid DNA/polyethylenimine complexes might aggregate on and rupture the cellular membrane surfaces [Fischer et al., 1999]. The plasmid DNA/RV peptide complexes were prepared at various weight ratios and transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The plasmid DNA/RV peptide complexes were prepared at various weight ratios and transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The plasmid DNA/RV peptide complexes were prepared at various weight ratios and transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The plasmid DNA/RV peptide complexes were prepared at various weight ratios and transfected into Human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This enhanced transfection efficiency may be due to micelle formation. Another possibility is a cell penetrating peptide effect imparted by the arginines. However, most cell penetrating peptide effects have been observed in linear peptides. Recently, a spherical arginine-rich polymer has been reported to have cell penetrating peptide and nuclear targeting effects [Kim et al., 2009b]. Polyamidoamine dendrimers conjugated with arginines (PAMAM-R) had higher transfection efficiency than PAMAM due to cell penetrating peptide and nuclear targeting effects [Kim et al., 2009b]. Peptide micelles as gene carriers have been previously developed using longer peptides, usually composed of lysine or histidine [Kichler et al., 2006; Morris et al., 2007; Wiradharma et al., 2009]. One of the peptide micelles contained hydrophilic segments with 15–30 positive amino acids and hydrophobic segments with 15–30 alanines, tryptophanes, or phenylalanines [Morris et al., 2007]. The peptides voluntarily formed a micelle structure in aqueous solution and complexed with plasmid DNA. The transfection efficiency of the micelles was even higher than that of lipofectamine or polyethylenimine. Furthermore, these peptides micelles were able to load a hydrophobic drug within their hydrophobic cores. The micelles loaded with a hydrophobic anti-cancer drug, doxorubicine, delivered both the drug and DNA to tumors [Wiradharma et al., 2009]. The RV peptides micelles had fewer positive charges than the previously developed peptide micelles and did not have any detectable cytotoxicity. In addition, they are easily degraded in the cells. The R3V6 peptides had higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity than Poly-L-lysine in Human embryonic kidney 293 cells.

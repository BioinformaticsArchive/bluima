18720000	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, for instance Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, play fundamental roles in such physiological processes as lipid metabolism, immunity, and cell differentiation [3, 4]. Activators of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha will induce the formation of hepatocellular carcinomas in rodents [5, 6], whereas ligands for Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma have been shown to induce cellular changes consistent with differentiation and reversal of the neoplastic phenotype in liposarcoma [7], breast [8], and colon carcinoma cells [9, 10]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta has also been shown to be a downstream target of APC/beta-catenin/T-cell factor-4-mediated transcriptional activation, which is a key mediator in the development of colorectal cancer [11]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta-deficient colorectal cancer cells can establish tumors when grown as xenografts in nude mice [16]. Vascular endothelial growth factor and other growth-related factors, secreted by tumor cells, together with other cells, are then directly or indirectly involved in angiogenesis, causing endothelial cells of nearby blood vessels to divide, migrate and form new vessels growing toward the tumor [17]. A recent study showed that activation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta up-regulated Vascular endothelial growth factor in colon carcinoma cells [18]. Rabbit polyclonal antihuman Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta antibody (at a dilution of 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-human Vascular endothelial growth factor-A antibody (1:500; Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclooxygenase-2 (1:500; Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Takasaki, Gunma, Japan), and mouse monoclonal anti-human endothelial cell marker  (CD34) (1:500; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) were used as primary antibodies. For immunohistochemistry analysis of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta, cyclooxygenase-2 or Vascular endothelial growth factor-A, five highpower fields (9400) were selected in each section, and a total of at least 500 cells was evaluated. When the percentage of cells which showed strong staining was more than 10%, the result was defined as positive. Any single endothelial cell or cluster of endothelial cells that were positive for CD34 and that were with or without any lumen were counted as a single microvessel. In 25 (48.1%) of the total 52 colorectal cancer tissues, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta was expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the tumor cells (Fig. 1). The frequency of expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta was dominant in the cytoplasm in comparison with the nuclei of the tumor cells. In matched normal adjacent tissues, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta was detected focally in the nuclei of epithelial cells on the luminal surface of the mucosal glands (Fig. 1). In 26 (50.0%) of the CRCs, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was detected in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Fig. 2). In 19 (36.5%) of the CRCs, Vascular endothelial growth factor-A was localized in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells (Fig. 2). CD34 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells of stroma in both colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues (Fig. 2). (f) One microgram of normal adjacent colonic mucosa, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta was detected in the RNA was used in a standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to amplify mRNA for human nuclei of the epithelial cells on the luminal surface. 2 Immunohistochemistry for cyclooxygenase-2, Vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and CD 34.

Wang et al. [18] showed that the activation of the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta signal pathway induces Vascular endothelial growth factor expression in intestinal epithelial tumor cells, using Apc Min/? mice and some human colorectal carcinoma cells. Piqueras et al. [23] indicated that the activation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta induces human endothelial cell proliferation and morphogenesis in cultures in vitro, endothelial cell outgrowth from murine aortic vessels in vitro, and angiogenesis in a murine matrigel plug assay in vivo through Vascular endothelial growth factor production. Our study showed that the localization of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta was dominant in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. However, our results were consistent with those of the previous study: Takayama et al. [13], using immunohistochemistry, indicated that the expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta is dominant in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in colorectal cancer tissues. In our preliminary evaluation, the location of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in cells was moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. That is, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta was located in the nuclei of normal mucosal cells, predominantly in the nuclei and partially in the cytoplasm of adenomatous cells, and mainly in the cytoplasm and partly in the nuclei of cancer cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that the overproduction of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta protein in the cytoplasm during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis might be one of the mechanisms for the dominant location of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in the cytoplasm of cancer cells, although further examination is needed in order to resolve the mechanisms.

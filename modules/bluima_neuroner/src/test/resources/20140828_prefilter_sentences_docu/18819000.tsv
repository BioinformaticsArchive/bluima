18819000	2008  Abstract cyclin D1, a key cell cycle regulatory protein that governs the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, can promote cell proliferation or induce growth arrest and apoptosis. Keywords cyclin D1  Polymorphism  Breast Cancer Meta-analysis  Introduction  Cyclin D1 (encoded by the cyclin D1 gene), a member of the D-type cyclin family [1], is a key cell-cycle regulatory protein involved in the restriction point early in the G1phase [2–4]. Over-expression of cyclin D1 may disrupt normal cell cycle control, and subsequently promote the development of human cancers [5]. For each study, the odds ratio is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the precision (the reciprocal of the SE)  and we also did not find significant publication bias in this meta-analysis (t = 0.83, P = 0.44 for GA vs. GG; t = 0.71, P = 0.50 for AA vs. GG; t = 0.19, P = 0.86 for AA/GA vs. GG).  Discussion  In the normal cell cycle, Cyclin D1 regulates the G1/S phase progression by phosphorylating and inactivating the RB protein by coupling with cyclin-dependent kinase4, which may induce the release of the transcription factor E2F from RB protein and start the function of DNA synthesis [24]. However, Cyclin D1 over-expression may result in the phosphorylation of RB protein in advance, uncontrolled cell growth, and the succession of cancers [24]. Several studies also reported that transcript-b was a poor catalyst of RB phosphorylation or inactivation and had markedly enhanced cell transformation activity compared to transcript-a [14, 26]. Studies showed that cyclin D1 G870A was associated with altered risk of other types of cancers, such as urinary bladder cancer [27], esophagus and gastric cancer [28], prostate cancer [29], squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [30] and colorectal cancer [31, 32]. A recent study by Onay et al. [22] reported that cyclin D1 G870A and COMT Met108/158Val may jointly contribute to breast cancer risk, because high levels of these two proteins could simultaneously reduce estrogen metabolism and enhance cell proliferation.

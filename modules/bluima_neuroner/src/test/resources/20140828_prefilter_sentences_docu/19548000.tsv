Studies have shown that the endothelial progenitor cell participates in the process of arterial repair. Data have been reported that the number of endothelial progenitor cell increased significantly in the subacute phase of Kawasaki disease. However, until now, there are no data about the functions of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients. The present study was designed to further investigate the number and functions of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease. The circulating CD34/ kinase insert domain-containing receptor double positive cells were evaluated in the two groups using flow cytometry. In vitro assays were used to measure the functions of endothelial progenitor cell, including proliferation, adhesion, and migration activities. The number of endothelial progenitor cell in the Kawasaki disease group was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.021 ± 0.007% vs. 0.014±0.003%, The migratory response of endothelial progenitor cell was significantly decreased in the Kawasaki disease group, compared with that of the control group (5.50±1.78 3.40 ± 1.35 cells/high power field, P < 0.01). Similarly, the proliferative and adhesive activities of endothelial progenitor cell in the Kawasaki disease group were also decreased (0.47±0.08 vs. 0.66±0.07, P< 0.01; 6.5±2.12 vs. 11.2±2.04 cells/high power field, P< 0.01). The number of circulating endothelial progenitor cell positively correlated with the level of nitric oxide (r = 0.92, P < 0.001), and the functions of endothelial progenitor cell negatively correlated with the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and high sensitivity C-reactive protein, respectively. In Kawasaki disease, the number of endothelial progenitor cell was enhanced and the functions of endothelial progenitor cell were attenuated. The two-way regulation of circulating endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients may be associated with the disorders of cytokines or messengers in Kawasaki disease patients. Keywords Kawasaki disease . Endothelial progenitor cell . Nitric oxide  Introduction  Kawasaki disease is a kind of systemic vasculitis characterized by auto-immune features [21, 22, 28]. Emerging data predicated that the endothelial progenitor cell, precursor cell of mature endothelial cell, is  important for maintaining the normal function and structure of arterial endothelial cells [3, 4, 11, 14]. Furthermore, Werner et al. reported that increased levels of endothelial progenitor cell were associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes [36]. Data have shown that the level of circulating endothelial progenitor cell was regulated by numerous mediators, which include nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein [2]. nitric oxide plays a pivotal role in mobilizing and upregulation of circulating endothelial progenitor cell, while tumor necrosis factor-α and high sensitivity C-reactive protein participate in the impairment and downregulation of circulating endothelial progenitor cell [10, 12, 13]. Data have been reported that the number of endothelial progenitor cell increased significantly in the subacute phase of Kawasaki disease [26]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no data about the functions of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients. The present study was designed to further investigate the number and functions of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease. We measured the number of endothelial progenitor cell using flow cytometry and the functions of endothelial progenitor cell including proliferation, adhesion, and migration in the Kawasaki disease group and control group. Cell culture and endothelial progenitor cell characterization  The procedure was performed as described previously [38]. Briefly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of enrolled subjects were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and suspended into 25 cm2 cell culture bottle coated with fibronectin (Hematological Technologies) using endothelial cell basal medium-2 (Clonetics, San Diego, CA, USA) supplemented with EGM-2 MV (Clonetics) and incubated at 37°C in a humidified environment with 5% carbon dioxide. To confirm the endothelial progenitor cell phenotype, the attached EC-like cells were incubated with 1, 10dioctadecyl-3, 3, 30, 30-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine perchlorate-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (DilacLDL; 10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37°C and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Ulex europeus agglutin (FITC-lectin, 10 μg/ml; Sigma) for 4 h at 37°C. Cells demonstrating double positive fluorescence were identified as differentiating endothelial progenitor cell. endothelial progenitor cell incubated with the serum of Kawasaki disease patients  We recruited ten children's fathers as healthy adult volunteers, when they took their child to our hospital. We used the peripheral venous blood to isolate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induced the peripheral blood mononuclear cells into EPCs as described previously [38]. endothelial progenitor cell function assay: proliferation, adhesion, and migration activities  The procedure of endothelial progenitor cell function assay was performed according to a previous study, described as below [38]. Then, the supernatant was discarded by aspiration, and the endothelial progenitor cell preparation was shaken with 200 μl dimethylsulfoxide for 10 min, before the optical density value was measured at 490 nm. 1 The ratio of CD34/kinase insert domain-containing receptor-positive cells in the two groups.

Adhesion activity was evaluated as the mean number of attached cells in 5 high power fields (200×) from each well. endothelial progenitor cell migrations were evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber method. endothelial progenitor cell suspension (2.5 × 104 cells/well) was placed in the upper chamber with endothelial basal medium, and the chamber was placed in a 24-well culture dish containing endothelial basal medium and 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor, Hematological Technologies, Essex Junction, USA). For quantification, cell nuclei were stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After incubation, cells were lysed, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before analysis of 50,000 events after exclusion of debris and platelets. The number of circulating endothelial progenitor cell was evaluated by the ratio of CD34/kinase insert domain-containing receptor double positive cells per 100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Figure 3 shows the functions of endothelial progenitor cell in the two groups. The migratory response of endothelial progenitor cell was significantly decreased in the Kawasaki disease group, compared with that of the control group (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the proliferative and adhesive activities of endothelial progenitor cell in the Kawasaki disease group were also decreased (Fig. 3b, c).

HPF high power field  The endothelial progenitor cell induced from healthy adult volunteers incubated with the serum of Kawasaki disease patients showed impaired migratory, proliferative, and adhesive activity, compared with that incubated with the serum of healthy control subjects (Fig. 4a–c). Association between endothelial progenitor cell and plasma nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels  The number of endothelial progenitor cell positively correlated with the plasma level of nitric oxide (Fig. 6). The migration and proliferation activity of endothelial progenitor cell negatively correlated with the plasma level of tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 7). The adhesion activity of endothelial progenitor cell did not correlate with the plasma level of tumor necrosis factor-α (r = -0.57, P > 0.05) and the functions of endothelial progenitor cell negatively correlated with the plasma level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, respectively (Fig. 8). Discussion  The present study investigated the number of peripheral circulating endothelial progenitor cell and the functions of in vitro cultured endothelial progenitor cell in patients with Kawasaki disease and healthy control subjects. Our major findings were that the number of peripheral circulating endothelial progenitor cell was markedly increased in patients with Kawasaki disease, and the functional capacities of cultured endothelial progenitor cell were significantly reduced in patients with Kawasaki disease. Elevated levels of nitric oxide were found in Kawasaki disease patients and positively correlated with endothelial progenitor cell number. Meanwhile, a close correlation was found between plasma tumor necrosis factor-α and high sensitivity C-reactive protein, related inversely to endothelial progenitor cell function in our study. The present study possibly indicates that Kawasaki disease patients have the ability to mobilize endothelial progenitor cell into the peripheral circulation to participate in the vascular repair process, while the poor functional state of endothelial progenitor cell obliterates its potentiality for repair vascular injury. Data have shown that endothelial progenitor cell plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal endothelial function [3, 4, 11, 14]. Animal experiments have shown that enhanced peripheral circulating endothelial progenitor cell contributed to the improved rate of reendothelialization and inhibition of neointimal formation in arteries denuded by balloon injury [11, 35]. In humans, it has been found that the number and function of endothelial progenitor cell are positively associated with endothelial function [14]. Furthermore, Werner et al. reported that an increased level of endothelial progenitor cell was associated with reduced risk of death from cardiovascular diseases [36]. Therefore, the number and function of endothelial progenitor cell in patients with Kawasaki disease may affect the cardiovascular outcomes of these patients in adulthood. In the present study, we found that the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cell increased significantly in Kawasaki disease patients, compared with that of control subjects. A previous study has shown that the concentration of nitric oxide was associated with the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cell [1]. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between nitric oxide level and endothelial progenitor cell number in Kawasaki disease patients. In order to investigate the functions of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients, we performed in vitro cell function assay, including proliferative activity and migratory activity. We found that the functions of endothelial progenitor cell decreased significantly, compared with that of control subjects. It is well known that the functional state of cells is associated with its efficacy in playing a physiology role. The favorable effects of endothelial progenitor cell on the cardiovascular system may be interrupted in Kawasaki disease patients because of its perishing functional state. Increasing evidence indicates that inflammation has a key role in the injury of cell functions. Data have shown that tumor necrosis factor-α has a negative effect on the function of endothelial progenitor cell [13, 31, 33]. It was also reported that plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein, together with the inflammatory cytokines, was negatively associated with the function of circulating endothelial progenitor cell [10]. Our results also showed that CRP attenuated the mobilization, differentiation, and survival of endothelial progenitor cell. Several cytokines and growth factors are involved in the mobilization and homing of endothelial progenitor cell [2]. vascular endothelial growth factor is a potent stimulus for mobilizing bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell, and enhanced levels may be important in the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cell [4]. Indeed, it may be interesting to investigate whether an imbalance exists between endothelial progenitor cell mobilizers (e.g., nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α and high sensitivity C-reactive protein) in Kawasaki disease patients. We postulated that the internal environment disorder may be responsible for the bidirectional regulation of endothelial progenitor cell kinetics in Kawasaki disease patients. One of the limitations of this study is that we did not investigate the dynamics of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients from the onset of disease to the convalescent period. Secondly, we proposed that increased nitric oxide production contributed to increased endothelial progenitor cell number in Kawasaki disease patients. Thirdly, the data of the present study cannot give us an exact explanation of the bidirectional regulation of endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients. Further studies should be performed to investigate the endothelial progenitor cell kinetics and its mechanisms in Kawasaki disease patients and other patients with vasculitis. Data have shown that the endothelial progenitor cell colony-forming unit (endothelial progenitor cell-CFU) in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis decreased significantly in untreated active phase and even in remission phase [15, 40]. On the other hand, de Groot et al. reported [8] that the number of endothelial progenitor cell in patients with antibody-associated vasculitis evaluated by counting Dil-acLDL and FITC-lectin double positive cells increased significantly after the institution of immunosuppressive therapy and disease remission. Different methods are used in counting EPCCFU or Dil-acLDL and FITC-lectin double positive cells to assess endothelial progenitor cell numbers, which may possibly contribute to the various results. In addition, the number endothelial progenitor cell-CFU represents not only the number of endothelial progenitor cell but also the functions of endothelial progenitor cell. We thought that the number of endothelial progenitor cell-CFU reduced in patients with antibody-associated vasculitis could possibly indicate that the functions of endothelial progenitor cell were impaired in different phases of antibody-associated vasculitis diseases. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of Kawasaki disease, and recent evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell participates in postnatal blood vessel repair. The relative deficiency of circulating endothelial progenitor cell in Kawasaki disease patients may contribute to the coronary dilation or aneurysm, whereas chronic pharmacological augmentation of circulating endothelial progenitor cell could offer a novel therapeutic strategy.

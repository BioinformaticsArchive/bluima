21206000	Syngeneic female A/J mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 106 Neuro-2a murine neuroblastoma wild-type cells and tumors were grown between 5 to 10 mm before the tumors were excised. Murine tumor cell lines  Neuro-2a, a murine neuroblastoma wild-type cell line, was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in vitro in minimal essential medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (10 000 U mL-1), 10 mmol sodium pyruvate, 100 mmol nonessential amino acid (GIBCO), 0.75 g sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and were free of Mycoplasma. Model of minimal residual disease Neuro-2a (1 × 106) wild-type cells were inoculated subcutaneously on day 1.

Tumor growth (a) and survival (b) of mice inoculated with 1 × 106 wild-type tumor cells. Syngeneic female A/J mice (6–8 weeks old; n = 10 per group; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized using halothane and inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 106 Neuro-2a (Neuro-2a, ATCC, Manassas, VA) murine neuroblastoma wild-type cells on day 1. It is possible that remote delivery of the CpG ODN accelerates tumor growth because it delivers a danger signal that acts as a decoy for key immune cells otherwise needed at the site of resection but this theory requires further investigation. The CpG ODN released at the site of resection is believed to prevent tumor recurrence by stimulating activated macrophage and NK cell activity against any minimal residual disease present after resection [3, 4, 12–14].

18186000	It has been found that joint administration of vitamin E and methionine to rabbits is more efficient in protecting cells against disadvantageous influence of oxidative stress than administration of vitamin E only. The enzyme was determined according to the Paglia and Valentine method [18]. That is why it accumulates in lipid structures, susceptible to harmful activity of oxygen, that is, in cell membranes [33]. Similar results have been obtained for endothelium cells [43]. Vitamin E, as antioxidant, protects the cells of endothelium in coronary micro-vessels under the condition of oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia, exercising positive influence upon the activity of antioxidative enzymes [47]. Glutathione conjugates are removed outside the cell, and this is one of the stages of detoxication of xenobiotics.

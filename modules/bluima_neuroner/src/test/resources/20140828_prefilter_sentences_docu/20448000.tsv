20448000	Our cell-based and mouse genetic studies have shown that FSH stimulates bone resorption by osteoclasts directly in a pituitaryâ€“ bone axis, independently of the estrogen effect. Bone is lost when the cells degrading old bone, osteoclasts, outpace the cells re-laying new collagen and mineral, the osteoblasts. Estrogens suppress RANK ligand-induced osteoclast differentiation via a stromal cell independent mechanism involving c-Jun repression. cells by estrogen and phytoestrogens.

Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates TNF production from immune cells to enhance osteoblast and osteoclast formation.

Malignant tumours that demonstrate fluidfluid levels include telangiectatic osteosarcoma [3, 6, 14, 34, 35], conventional osteosarcoma [1, 14], osteosarcoma post-chemotherapy [6], malignant fibrous histocytoma/fibrosarcoma [1, 14, 36], plasmacytoma [37], metastasis (bronchus, breast, undifferentiated, small cell neuroendrocrine tumour of the bladder) [14, 36, 38–41], clear cell chondrosarcoma [42], Ewing sarcoma [43] and other malignant round cell tumours [14], Paget's sarcoma [14] and spindle cell sarcoma [14]. Yates' correction or Fisher exact methods were used if the expected frequency in one or more cell was less than 10 or greater than 5, or less than 5, respectively. 1 A 35-year-old male with a giant cell tumour of the distal tibia.

This is a result of the similar high signal intensity that is seen in the superior layer related to either serum, serous fluid or extracellular methaemoglobin compared with the components of the  Fig. 2 Histological breakdown of bone tumours showing fluidfluid levels on T2-weighted fast spin echo/short tau inversion recovery and with the high/low signal intensity pattern on T1-weighted SE images  inferior layer (cells, cellular necrosis, by-products of haemorrhage, proteinaceous fluid) (Table 4). This may relate to the relatively large numbers of aneurysmal bone cysts (n=61) and secondary aneurysmal bone cysts change  (chondroblastoma, 14; fibrosis dysplasia, 12; simple bone cyst, 13; giant cell tumour, 25; osteosarcoma, 1) compared with malignant lesions (osteosarcoma,54; metastasis, 12). The high/low signal intensity pattern on T1-weighted images can be related to extracellular methaemoglobin [as a result of sub-acute haemorrhage (Table 4)] in the superior layer compared with the inferior layer (cells, cellular necrosis, by-products of haemorrhage, proteinaceous fluid). A number of benign lesions are predisposed to acute haemorrhage (giant cell tumour, simple bone cyst, primary and secondary aneurysmal bone cysts) [1, 44, 23], some can be related to  trauma and healing such as in simple bone cyst [23]. In lesions with low/high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, the superior low signal intensity layer can result from serum, serous fluid or cyst fluid and the inferior layer signal intensity is related to cells/cellular debris (intermediate), proteinaceous fluid (high), intracellular methaemoglobin (high), or clotted blood inferiorly (intermediate) Table 4. Secondary aneurysmal bone cysts formation can occur in simple bone cyst [23], fibrous dysplasia [21], giant cell tumour [1, 18], osteosarcoma, may be relatively frequent in chondroblastoma (4/5 cases [11]),and rarely in clear cell chondrosarcoma [42]. Such lesions are relatively frequent in this group: simple bone cyst, n = 4; chondroblastoma, n=6; giant cell tumour, n=5; osteosarcoma, n=6. As expected giant cell tumour, aneurysmal bone cysts and osteosarcoma feature predominantly in both low/high and high/low T1-weighted groups, consistent with relatively frequent rates of both aneurysmal bone cysts formation and haemorrhage. These lesions have more primary and secondary aneurysmal bone cysts change or change related to cystic spaces and the varying components of these types of fluidfluid levels (blood cell/ intact cell and serum) may be of a more similar and higher density compared with those in malignant lesions (degradation product of haemorrhage and serous fluid), hence taking longer to separate. In order to allow for separation of whole blood, 10–15 min may need to elapse with the patient supine (normal standard erythrocyte sedimentation  Table 4 The pathological causes of fluidfluid levels, the pathological tissue in the superior and inferior layer and the corresponding signal intensity appearances of the superior and inferior layers on T1-weighted and T2-weighted fast spin echo/short tau inversion recovery imaging  Pathological cause of fluid-fluid level Superior layer Inferior layer Signal References (correlation superior/ with) inferior  T1-weighted T2-weighted/ short tau inversion recovery  aneurysmal bone cysts or aneurysmal bone cysts change  Blood/flowing blood separating in a cavernous space Sub-acute haemorrhage  Into cavitya Acute/sub-acute haemorrhage into cavitya, b Clotted blood (implying a more indolent process) Chronic haemorrhage (e.g. in cystic fibrosis dysplasia) Necrosis (tumour, fat)c  Cyst formationc (e.g. simple bone cyst, fibrosis dysplasia)  Serum  Extracellular methaemoglobin and serous fluid  Serous fluid  Serous fluid  Serous fluid  Serous fluid  Fluid  Blood cells low/high high/low  Blood degradation products, blood high/low high/low cellular debris, necrotic cells  Intracellular methaemoglobin low/high high/low  Clotted blood- cells and proteinaceous low/high high/low fluid Intracellular methaemoglobin low/high high/low  Cellular debris low/high high/low  Cellular debris (from shed cell from low/high high/low cystic lining/ cystic degeneration)  Lin [46], Hudson (blood anti-coagulated) [3]. In the group without axial or sagittal T1-weighted images there are a large number of osteosarcomas (n=27) and some giant cell tumour (n=5), which could have contributed to those subjects with the high/low signal intensity pattern. Conclusion  The high/low signal intensity pattern on short tau inversion recovery/T2-weighted images appears to occur in all lesions and is not specific to its nature (benign of malignant disease) or the pathology of the fluidfluid levels (haemorrhage, necrosis, cellular debris, separation of whole blood).

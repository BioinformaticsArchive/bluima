18088000	Neural Progenitor Cells Derived From the Adult Rat Subventricular Zone: Characterization and Transplantation  Kevin Chen, Stephanie M. Hughes, and Bronwen Connor  Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand  In order to fully characterize and determine the therapeutic potential of adult neural progenitor cells, it is important to be able to isolate and study neural progenitor cells from animals such as rats, in which there are existing models of brain injury and disease. The focus of this study was to characterize the cultivation, differentiation, and transplantation of adult rat neural progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. We examined strategies for cell purification using a Percoll density gradient, and cell expansion using a range of maintenance medium and plating densities. Purification by Percoll gradient enriched a population of cells expressing nestin and SOX2, but resulted in a significant reduction in neurosphere generation. Culturing adult rat neural progenitor cells in Neurobasal-A media and plating at 200,000 cell/ml resulted in a higher percentage of cells surviving to generate neurospheres compared to culture in DMEM/F12 or NS-A media. On induction of differentiation, adult rat neural progenitor cells were capable of generating neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in vitro that survived for up to 8 weeks, demonstrating multipotentiality of these cells. In addition, a population of cells continued to proliferate during the initial phase of differentiation, suggesting the presence of two populations of neural progenitor cells during differentiation. Cultured adult rat neural progenitor cells also survived and differentiated into astrocytes 6 weeks after transplantation into the striatum of the normal adult rat brain. In conclusion, we have optimized techniques that allow for the routine isolation, culture, and transplantation of multipotent neural progenitor cells derived from the adult rat subventricular zone. Key words: Subventricular zone; Neural progenitor cells; Cultivation; Differentiation; Transplantation  INTRODUCTION  It has been widely demonstrated that the adult mammalian brain contains neural progenitor cells, which exhibit at least one of the following properties: proliferation, multipotentiality, and self-renewal (34). neural progenitor cells have been found in two principal neurogenic regions of the adult brain—the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (1,2,9,15,16,18,21, 27)—as well as nonneurogenic regions including the cortex, optic nerve, septum, spinal cord, striatum, and substantia nigra (20,25,26,45). While adult neural progenitor cells express a more restricted fate than embryonic stem cells, they retain the potential to give rise to the three major cell lineages found in the CNS and may provide an alternative cell source for cell replacement therapy for the treatment of neurological disease. In order to realize the potential of adult neural progenitor cells, it is important to be able to isolate and study neural progenitor cells from animals such as rats, which  have been commonly used as models for many brain diseases and injuries. However, the limited proliferation of adult rat neural progenitor cells in culture has restricted their use in research, which serves as a significant problem because these cells are, for many researchers, the cell of choice in many experimental paradigms of CNS disease. Studies have demonstrated that neural progenitor cells can be isolated from the adult mouse brain and proliferate in culture in response to basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor as free-floating spherical clusters, termed neurospheres (10–12,31). Each neurosphere consists of a mixed population of neural stem, progenitor, and differentiated cells (23,38). However, unlike the culture of adult mouse neural progenitor cells, the cultivation of neural progenitor cells from the adult rat brain has proven more challenging (8,31,39). Although the knowledge and experience gained through the use of the mouse model can be utilized to expand adult rat neural progenitor cells, studies have shown that neural progenitor cells from different animal species (i.e., rat and mouse) do not respond in the same manner when cul-  Received November 20, 2006; final acceptance April 25, 2007. Svendsen and colleages (39) showed that conditions that favor the exponential growth of embryonic mouse neural progenitor cells result in limited growth of embryonic rat neural progenitor cells, followed by cell death. Furthermore, Ray and Gage (30) demonstrated that adult rat and mouse neural progenitor cells require different growth factors for survival and proliferation. Therefore, the focus of this study was to characterize the cultivation, differentiation, and transplantation of adult rat neural progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone for future in vitro and in vivo studies. The optimization of NPC cultivation involved the examination of strategies for cell purification using a Percoll density gradient, and cell expansion using a range of maintenance medium and plating densities. Following optimization of NPC isolation and culture techniques, we characterized the temporal profile of adult rat NPC differentiation in vitro and confirmed that cultivated adult rat neural progenitor cells could survive transplantation and undergo differentiation in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation and Maintenance of Adult NPC Cultures Neural progenitor cells were isolated from the subventricular zone of adult male Wistar rats (Fig. 1A) and cultured as neurospheres as described by Vazey et al. (43). To purify a progenitor cell population prior to culture, cells were fractionated using a Percoll gradient, as described by Palmer et al. (25) with minor modifications. The cell fraction within the density range, 1.064–1.074 g/ml, was carefully harvested and washed free of Percoll by three rinses in DMEM/F12 medium. neural progenitor cells were cultured in DMEM/F12, Neurobasal-A (Gibco BRL, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), or NS-A (Euroclone, Milan, IT) medium and plated at 103, 104, or 2 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well plates in a volume of 200 μl per well. The cells were fed with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and heparin every 2 days. To label neural progenitor cells in vivo, rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (bromodeoxyuridine; AppliChem, Germany; 200mg/ kg, IP) 2 h prior to euthanasia. In vitro, cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (5 μM) over 4 days (7). The dissociated cells were cultured for another week and processed for SOX2, Pax6, nucleostemin, MAP2, GFAP, and RIP immunoreactivity. Differentiation of subventricular zone-Derived Adult neural progenitor cells Neurospheres from three independent cultures (14 days in vitro) were plated on polyornithine/laminin-coated 96well plates in Neurobasal-A differentiation medium (43). The cells were allowed to differentiate for up to 8 weeks. The cells were fixed weekly from 1 to 8 weeks and processed for immunostaining. Adult NPC Transplantation bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells were washed and resuspended in Leibovitz L15 containing 3 mg/ml glucose. Approximately 2 × 105 cells in 4 μl of Leibovitz L15 medium were transplanted into the adult rat striatum (n = 12) at coordinates: anterior–posterior +0.5 mm; medial–lateral -2.7 mm; depth +5.0 mm from bregma, at 500 nl/min. Quantification To quantify neurosphere formation, cells were fixed after 7 days in vitro and processed for nestin immunoreactivity. To assay cell  phenotypes after differentiation, four nonoverlapping fields were observed per well (192 wells from three independent experiments). MAP2-, GFAP-, RIP-, and DAPI-labeled cells were quantified and reported as number of labeled cells per field using the DiscoveryOne system (Molecular Devices, Berkshire, UK). The number and length of processes of 400 MAP2-labeled cells were quantified for weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 differentiation time points. Poisson and linear regressions were used to assess the effects of culture media and plating density on neurosphere formation and the in vitro differentiation of neural progenitor cells. RESULTS Optimization of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat NPC Culture Conditions Isolation of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat neural progenitor cells. To confirm the location and isolation of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone of the adult rat brain, rats were injected with the mitotic marker, bromodeoxyuridine (200 mg/kg, IP) 2 h prior to euthanasia. bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells were observed in the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle, confirming the presence of proliferating cells in this region (Fig. 1B). Thus, the bromodeoxyuridine-labeled progenitor cells were isolated from the subventricular zone by dissecting this region from the striatal side of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 1A). Following the isolation of cells from the adult rat brain, neural progenitor cells need to be purified because preparations are contaminated with other differentiated cells and tissue debris. Repeated passaging is a commonly used method to purify adult rat neural progenitor cells, but this takes several weeks (8,27,44). Another progenitor enrichment method is to use a density gradient medium such as Percoll, which purifies the cells on the basis of their buoyant densities and has been shown to efficiently purify neural progenitor cells derived from adult rat hippocampus and neocortex for monolayer cultures (25). Therefore, we examined the effect of Percoll on the purification of neural progenitor cells derived from the adult rat subventricular zone. In agreement with Palmer and colleagues (25), a cell population was observed within the 1.064–1.074 density range whereas cell debris and blood cells were observed at the top and bottom of the Percoll solution, respectively. In order to determine whether the Percoll gradient resulted in an enriched population of neural progenitor cells, the Percollpurified or nonpurified cells were cultured at 37°C, fixed after 1 days in vitro, and then examined for the proportion of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled neural progenitor cells. In addition to the use of bromodeoxyuridine labeling, immature neural progenitor cells were also identified using the markers nestin and SOX2. Nestin is an intermediate filament protein expressed by neuroepithelial stem cells (19) and multiple cell types of the adult subventricular zone, including resident neural progenitor cells (5). SOX2 is a transcription factor that is also expressed by actively dividing neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (17). We observed a significantly higher percentage of bromodeoxyuridine (2.2%; p < 0.01), nestin (8.2%; p < 0.01), and SOX2-labeled cells (4.6%; p < 0.01) in the Percoll-purified cell fraction compared with non-Percollpurified cell population (1.3%, 2.5%, and 2.3%, respectively) (Fig. 1D), indicating that the Percoll gradient enriched these cell populations after isolation. The cells were then cultured for 7 days in DMEM/F12 following isolation in order to examine the ability of cells isolated following Percoll purification to form neurospheres compared to non-Percoll-purified cell preparations. Interestingly, after 7 days in vitro we observed significantly fewer nestin-labeled neurospheres following Percoll isolation (0.48 neurosphere per well) compared with non-Percoll isolation (20.7 neurospheres per well; p < 0.01) (Fig. 1E), suggesting that purification using the Percoll gradient might have a detrimental effect on the cells or may have removed substances from the cell preparation essential for cell survival and the formation of neurospheres. Alternatively, purification by Percoll gradient may have resulted in an insufficient number of isolated progenitor cells that were capable of generating neurospheres. The Effect of Culture Media and Plating Density on the Culture of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat neural progenitor cells. A range of cell media has been used for the expansion of adult rat neural progenitor cells. The serum-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor and N2 is commonly used for the monolayer culture of adult rat neural progenitor cells (7,25,30) and when supplemented with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and B27, it has been used for the culture of adult rat neural progenitor cells as neurospheres (35). In addition, Neurobasal-A and NS-A media have been shown to generate efficient proliferation of adult rat neural progenitor cells as neurospheres when supplemented with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and B27 (8,27,44). These culture media are supportive for the growth of neural progenitor cells under different density conditions ranging from low density to 1 × 106 cells/ml.

In order to optimize the in vitro expansion of SVZderived adult rat neural progenitor cells, the effects of three different culture media and plating densities on neurosphere formation were examined. Ninety-six-well plates were employed for the cultivation of neural progenitor cells because they resulted in better survival of neurospheres compared to T25 flasks (data not shown). After isolation, the cells were plated at 103, 104, or 2 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM/F12, Neurobasal-A, or NS-A media and the number of nestin-labeled neurospheres per well was quantified after 7 days in vitro. NPC proliferation was characterized by the number of neurospheres per cultured viable cell, also known as plating efficiency. These results demonstrate that the optimal growth of subventricular zone-derived adult rat neural progenitor cells occurred in Neurobasal-A at 2 × 105 cells/ml plating density. For the remainder of our studies, the neural progenitor cells were cultured in these conditions for no more than 2 weeks to minimize the possibility of loss of progenitor cell characteristics in our culture conditions. When subventricular zone-derived neurospheres were cultured for 14 days without dissociation and then induced to differentiate, we observed cells migrating only from the outer border of the neurosphere, leaving the central part of neuro-  Figure 2. Neurobasal-A showed significantly higher plating efficiency (number of neurospheres formed per cultured cell) than either DMEM/F12 or NS-A at each density after 7 days in vitro. Dissociation of neurospheres using mechanical trituration after 7 days in vitro resulted in the formation of smaller secondary neurospheres from which all cells migrated out during differentiation, sometimes resulting in round hollows surrounded by differentiated cells (data not shown). Adult rat neural progenitor cells were cultured in Neurobasal-A at 2 × 105 cells/ml for 7 days in vitro to form neurospheres, which were then harvested for dissociation. The neurospheres were dissociated either using mechanical trituration by repeatedly pipetting the cells 20 times or by Accutase treatment. While both methods generated secondary neurospheres with comparable cell viability ( 80%), Accutase dissociation resulted in predominantly single cells and small cell clusters with sizes up to 100 μm, whereas mechanical trituration generated cell clusters that ranged in size from 30 to 150 μm (Fig. 3A–C). The Accutase-treated cell clusters appeared to be more loosely packed and were composed of fewer cells (Fig. 3C), whereas the mechanically dissociated cell clusters appeared to be more compacted (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Accutase was more efficient in neurosphere dissociation. The effect of Accutase treatment on the properties of cultured adult rat neural progenitor cells has not previously been examined (44). Therefore, to determine whether treatment with Accutase had altered the properties of adult rat neural progenitor cells in culture, dissociated cells were cultured for a further 7 days in vitro following the Accutase treatment and then examined for the expression of markers for neurons  (MAP2), astrocytes (GFAP), oligodendrocytes (RIP), and immature neural progenitor cells (SOX2). Neurospheres derived from both dissociation methods exhibited SOX2 expression on the majority of cells within the neurospheres (Fig. 3D) and showed a similar pattern of GFAP expression around the outer edge of neurospheres (Fig. 3D). While MAP2 and RIP was not observed in neurospheres dissociated by mechanical trituration, MAP2 expression was detected in most neurospheres treated with Accutase (Fig. 3D), suggesting that treatment with Accutase stimulated cells to undergo neuronal differentiation. This implies that Accutase has altered the properties of cultured adult neural progenitor cells in vitro. Confirmation that cells within proliferating neurospheres predominantly express markers of neural progenitor cells was further demonstrated in mechanically dissociated neurospheres 14 days in vitro by expression of the neural progenitor cell markers, nucleostemin and Pax6 (Fig. 3E). In Vitro Differentiation of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat neural progenitor cells Multipotent adult neural progenitor cells possess the ability to generate astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. To examine this property, adult neural progenitor cells can be induced to differentiate by plating on a coated substrate in the presence of serum in vitro (8,27,44). Based on different differentiation conditions and isolated brain regions, adult rat neural progenitor cells have been shown to generate the three major CNS cell lineages with various proportions after 1–2 weeks' differentiation period (8,27,30,35,41,44). vitro, neural progenitor cells were induced to differentiate for up to 8 weeks by plating neurospheres on polyornithine/laminin-coated wells in differentiation media containing basic fibroblast growth factor (1 ng/ml), B27, and 1% serum. The presence of basic fibroblast growth factor at 1 ng/ml in differentiation media has been shown to enhance cell survival during differentiation (27). We observed optimal survival of differentiated cells when initially plated at a density of six neurospheres per well, suggesting that cell density is not only critical for cell survival during proliferation, but is also important during differentiation. Following plating, the neurospheres rapidly adhered to the substrate and cells migrated out from the neurospheres (Fig. 4A). NPC differentiation was examined weekly using markers for neurons (MAP2), astrocytes (GFAP), or oligodendrocytes (RIP). After 1 week of differentiation, we observed extensive migration of cells from the neurospheres, which had differentiated to yield a mixed population of MAP2-positive neurons, GFAP-positive astroglia, and RIP-positive oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4B, D, E). MAP2-labeled cells exhibited short processes at weeks 1 and 2 (Fig. 4B) but by 4 weeks of differentiation showed multiple long processes (Fig. 4C), demonstrating an increase in neuronal maturation. GFAPlabeled cells displayed a flattened morphology with broad end-feet on their processes (Fig. 4D), and RIPlabeled cells showed tangled branches (Fig. 4E). The morphology of GFAP- and RIP-labeled cells stayed constant over the 8-week differentiation period. To further examine the maturation of neurons derived from adult neural progenitor cells, we quantified the number and length of MAP2 processes after 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks of differentiation (Fig. 4F, G). From weeks 2 to 8, the percentage of MAP2-labeled cells with 1–2 processes decreased gradually from 66% to 26%, while the percentage of MAP2-labeled cells with 3 or more processes increased during this period (34% to 74%), suggesting that MAP2labeled neurons continued to mature and acquired more processes over time (Fig. 4F). These results demonstrate a positive shift in the distribution of MAP2-labeled cells exhibiting multiple processes of increasing length, indicating an increase in the numbers of mature neurons over the 8-week differentiation period. To assay the proportion of cell types generated fol-  Figure 4. Differentiation of adult rat neural progenitor cells. One week after differentiation, cells had migrated out from the neurosphere (A) and differentiated into MAP2-positive neurons (B), GFAP-positive astrocytes (D), or RIP-positive oligodendrocytes (E). By 4 weeks, MAP2-labeled cells exhibited multiple processes (C). lowing differentiation, the numbers of MAP2-, GFAP-, and RIP-labeled cells were quantified. A one-way ANOVA demonstrated that during the 8 weeks of differentiation there was a significant effect of time on MAP2-, RIP-, and GFAP-labeled cells (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 5). Tukey post hoc tests demonstrated that the number of MAP2-labeled cells increased significantly from weeks 2 to 3, declined from weeks 3 to 5, and then increased again from weeks 6 to 8 (Fig. 5A). This indicates that after an initial 3 weeks of differentiation, there was a reduction in the survival of MAP2-positive neurons derived from cultured adult rat neural progenitor cells with a second wave of neuronal differentiation commencing after week 5 of differentiation. Similar to the pattern of neuronal differentiation observed over the 8-week period, the number of RIPlabeled cell increased significantly from weeks 3 to 4, decreased at week 5, and then increased again to week 8 (Fig. 5B), suggesting a relationship between the differentiation of MAP2 and RIP cells. In contrast, the num-  ber of GFAP-labeled cells remained relatively constant over the 8-week differentiation period (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the majority of astrocytes were generated during the first week of differentiation and continued to survive for up to 8 weeks. Furthermore, linear regression analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of cells expressing MAP2, RIP, or GFAP over the 8-week differentiation period, suggesting that there was an overall increased trend of NPC differentiation into the three cell lineages despite the loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes at week 5 (Fig. 5D). In order to quantify total cell number during differentiation, the cells were also stained with the nuclear marker, DAPI (Fig. 5E). A one-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of time on the total cell number ( p < 0.01). Tukey post-hoc tests demonstrated that total cell number increased significantly from weeks 2 to 5 and decreased after week 6 (Fig. 5E). The correlation between DAPI and the three cell lineage markers (MAP2, GFAP, and RIP) indicated that cell proliferation and dif-  Figure 5.

This suggests the presence of two populations of neural progenitor cells during differentiation: one derived from the original culture, which generated neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes at early time points, and the other population derived from cells that continued to proliferate during the initial phase of differentiation, differentiating at later time points possibly in response to a reduction in cell survival at weeks 5–6 following differentiation. However, given that the total cell number was relatively constant between 3 and 5 weeks when loss of MAP2- and RIP-labeled cells was observed, we must also consider that the cell loss observed might be due to a transient loss of phenotypic expression. Transplantation of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat neural progenitor cells Into the Normal Adult Rat Striatum The use of in vitro expanded adult neural progenitor cells for transplantation requires that the cultured neural progenitor cells retain the ability to survive and differentiate in vivo following transplantation. Adult neural progenitor cells have been transplanted into both neurogenic and nonneurogenic regions of the adult brain with various degrees of success. Previous studies have shown that transplantation of adult rat neural progenitor cells into  either homotrophic or heterotrophic neurogenic regions results in site-specific neuronal differentiation (7,13,32, 37). In contrast, transplantation into nonneurogenic regions such as the striatum or cerebellum results in the majority of transplanted cells differentiating into glia (6,13,32,37). In order to confirm that cultivated subventricular zone-derived adult rat neural progenitor cells could survive transplantation and undergo differentiation in vivo, neural progenitor cells were transplanted into the striatum of the normal adult rat brain as neurospheres 2 weeks after isolation. To facilitate identification in vivo, cultured neurospheres were labeled with 5 μM bromodeoxyuridine for 4 days prior to transplantation, resulting in labeling of 75% of the cells in vitro. The use of bromodeoxyuridine to label donor cells has recently been shown to be accompanied by false-positive results due to the fact that bromodeoxyuridine is released from dying cells, and may be incorporated into endogenous host cells (3). In order to address this concern, we transplanted bromodeoxyuridine-labeled neural progenitor cells killed via repeated freeze–thaw prior to transplantation. In agreement with Gage et al. (7), we did not observe bromodeoxyuridine labeling at 6 weeks posttransplantation (data not shown), suggesting no transfer of bromodeoxyuridine from dying transplanted cells to host cells. After live cell transplant, surviving bromodeoxyuridine-labeled, intact nuclei were identified in all animals 6 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 6A). Transplantation of cultured adult rat neural progenitor cells into the normal adult rat striatum. (A) bromodeoxyuridine-labeled neural progenitor cells were observed in the host striatum at week 6 following transplantation. (B) Some bromodeoxyuridine (green)-positive cells coexpressed GFAP (red) in the striatum of adult rat brain. labeled cells had dispersed from the graft and migrated up to 1.6 mm from the center of the graft to the surrounding host striatum. To examine the differentiation of transplanted subventricular zone-derived adult neural progenitor cells within the host striatum, double immunofluorescence staining for bromodeoxyuridine/ NeuN and bromodeoxyuridine/GFAP was performed. We did not find bromodeoxyuridine/NeuN colabeled cells in the host striatum, indicating that transplanted adult rat neural progenitor cells did not differentiate into neurons. However, we observed that these cells predominantly differentiated into astrocytes 6 weeks after transplantation into the normal adult rat striatum as demonstrated by bromodeoxyuridine/GFAP coexpression (Fig. 6B). We  also found some transplanted cells migrating to the olfactory bulb, where they differentiated into neurons (data not shown). This demonstrates that cultured SVZderived adult rat neural progenitor cells were able to survive, migrate, and differentiate in the adult rat striatum following transplantation. DISCUSSION This study has characterized the cultivation, differentiation, and transplantation of neural progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone of the adult rat brain. We examined the efficacy of a Percoll gradient for purification of neural progenitor cells isolated from the adult rat subventricular zone, and cell expansion by neurosphere assay using a range of maintenance medium and plating densities. While we confirmed the use of a Percoll gradient to enrich a population of SOX2- and nestin-positive cells (25), we found these cells failed to survive to form neurospheres. This effect may reflect Percoll-associated toxicity, although it is unlikely given the wide utility of Percoll gradients for cell purification. Alternatively, Percoll purification may have removed essential factors or cell types that are important for progenitor cell survival and proliferation, or resulted in an insufficient number of isolated progenitor cells that were capable of generating neurospheres. In culture, we showed that the growth of neural progenitor cells was optimal in Neurobasal-A medium and was density dependent, indicating that cell to cell contact is essential for the survival of adult neural progenitor cells. We demonstrated that adult rat neural progenitor cells differentiated into the three main neural cell lineages with concurrent cell proliferation, which may account for an overall increased trend of neuronal and glial differentiation over the 8-week differentiation period. Lastly, we demonstrated that our cultivated neural progenitor cells survived transplantation into the adult rat striatum, predominantly differentiating into glia. Cultivation of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat neural progenitor cells Percoll has been used for separation of a variety of cell types (4,25,28,30). In our study, small percentages of SOX2- and nestin-positive cells were successfully purified through the use of a Percoll gradient, but these cells failed to survive to form neurospheres. In contrast, Palmer and colleagues (25) showed continued proliferation of cells following Percoll purification. Previous studies have shown differences in growth, self-renewal, and multipotentiality of neural progenitor cells derived from the adult rat subventricular zone and hippocampus (24,35). Other differences between previous re-  ports (22,25,30) and our study include differences in cell culture supplements and cultivation technique (monolayer vs. neurosphere culture). It is likely that the attachment of cells on coated substrate in the monolayer culture may provide an additional support to the cells, leading to better cell survival and proliferation. In addition, previous studies (22,25,30) used serum during the first 24 h, which may contain factors sufficient to enhance purified NPC cell survival. Therefore, Percoll gradient may be competent for the purification of adult rat neural progenitor cells for monolayer culture, but not for neurosphere culture as described here. In agreement with Wachs and colleagues (44), we observed significantly improved growth of adult rat neural progenitor cells in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with growth factors and B27, when compared to supplemented DMEM/F12 or NS-A media. We also demonstrated that our adult rat neural progenitor cells proliferated in a cell density-dependent manner, suggesting that NPC proliferation may be modulated via cell–cell communication in response to mitogenic signals from growth factors and that high density may be required for sufficient factor(s) to be present to support the cells. This is supported by Taupin and colleagues (42), who demonstrated that the mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor was cell density dependent, with only high-density cultures producing sufficient amounts of a glycosylated form of cystatin C to support basic fibroblast growth factor's mitogenic activity. Therefore, we propose that plating density is critical to allow cell-secreted mitogenic factor(s) to potentiate neurosphere formation in our culture conditions. Accutase has been used for the dissociation of adult rat neural progenitor cells (14,29,33,44), but its effects on NPC differentiation has not been examined to date. In our study, we observed that adult rat neural progenitor cells spontaneously underwent neuronal differentiation following treatment with Accutase, suggesting that enzymatic dissociation of neurospheres could interrupt the receptor signaling of neural progenitor cells, resulting in lack of response of neural progenitor cells to growth factors. Interestingly, the observation that Accutase only induced neuronal formation of neural progenitor cells and showed no obvious effects on the differentiation of other cell lineages suggests an alternative method to manipulate the cell fate of neural progenitor cells in vitro. Alternative dissociation methods that retain receptors and cell–cell contact have been shown previously. These methods are less harmful to the cells compared with mechanical trituration (36), and more importantly have shown no adverse effects on NPC proliferation. The Temporal Profile of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat NPC Differentiation In Vitro  A number of research groups have demonstrated the multipotentiality of adult rat subventricular zone-derived neural progenitor cells (8,44). However, the proportion of each cell type generated is variable, depending on the differentiation conditions (media components and substrates) and the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor in the differentiation media. For example, adult rat neural progenitor cells cultured on polyornithine/laminin in Neurobasal/B27 media without basic fibroblast growth factor resulted in approximately 12% astrocytes (GFAP), 22% neurons (βIII-tubulin), and 1% oligodendrocytes (GalC) after 7 days of differentiation (44). In contrast, neurospheres plated on poly-D-lysine in DMEM/F12/B27 generated approximately 9% astrocytes (GFAP), 3% neurons (βIII-tubulin), and 20% oligodendrocytes (CNPase) (8). Moreover, addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml) during differentiation amplified cellular proliferation and caused a substantial increase in the production of neurons (8). In contrast to these studies, which examined the proportion of cell types generated after short-term differentiation, we characterized the temporal profile of adult rat NPC differentiation for up to 8 weeks. During differentiation of neurospheres on polyornithine/laminin in Neurobasal-A/B27 with 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, we observed predominantly more neurons than glial cells at each time point (19–44% neurons, 5– 40% oligodendrocytes, and 4–8% astrocytes), with an overall increase in cell type over the 8-week differentiation period. The low neuronal production observed by Gobbel and colleagues (8) could be due to differences in substrate (poly-D-lysine vs. polyornithine/laminin) used during differentiation, which has been shown to affect the type of cells generated from adult neural progenitor cells (46). In addition, we observed increased neuronal formation with increased cell density (data not shown), suggesting that cell density is critical for neuronal differentiation or survival of adult neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor in our differentiation media could have enhanced the production of neurons during differentiation as demonstrated previously (8). During differentiation, we also continued to observe cell proliferation as indicated by an increase in total cell number. Based on previous findings that basic fibroblast growth factor at 1 ng/ml can stimulate bromodeoxyuridine incorporation of hippocampus-derived adult rat neural progenitor cells during differentiation (25), we postulated that it could have similar effects on cultured subventricular zone-derived adult rat neural progenitor cells during differentiation, therefore inducing a subpopulation of progenitor cells that continued to proliferate instead of undergoing differentiation. Transplantation of subventricular zone-Derived Adult Rat neural progenitor cells Into the Normal Adult Rat Striatum Previous studies have demonstrated that cultured 2. adult rat neural progenitor cells derived from the hippocampus or subventricular zone can produce neurons when transplanted into neurogenic 3. brain regions, but predominantly generate glial cells when transplanted into nonneurogenic regions such an striatum, cortex, spinal cord, or cerebellum (6,7,13,32, 37). In contrast to these studies, Zhang and colleagues (47) demonstrated neuronal differentiation of subventricular zone-derived adult neural progenitor cells 4 weeks after transplantation into the nonneurogenic striatum of adult rat brain. NPC culture showed extensive labeling of a marker for immature neurons, βIII-tubulin (70%), before transplantation, suggesting these cells had already acquired cues 5. for neuronal differentiation prior to transplantation into the striatum. In agreement with other studies (13,32), we observed that transplantation of subventricular zone-derived neural progenitor cells from adult rat brain into the nonneurogenic striatum re- 6. sulted predominantly in astrocytic differentiation 6 weeks after transplantation, suggesting that our NPC culture retained the ability to survive and differentiate in response to the local cues following transplantation. Our future studies will use neural progenitor cells isolated from the adult rat subventricular zone and cultured as described in this article to optimize techniques to enhance neuronal differentiation and functional integration of transplanted neural progenitor cells in the adult 8. brain. In conclusion, we have optimized techniques that allow for the routine isolation and culture of neural progenitor cells de- 9. rived from the adult rat subventricular zone. We have demonstrated that these cells retain their multipotentiality after 2 weeks in culture with concurrent cell proliferation, 10. which may account for an overall increased trend of neuronal and glial differentiation over the 8-week differentiation period. Furthermore, we showed that after 2 weeks in culture these cells can survive, migrate, and 11. differentiate following transplantation into normal adult rat striatum. These findings will allow us to undertake more extensive in vitro and in vivo studies examining the potential of adult neural progenitor cells for treating brain diseases. C.; Verfaillie, C. M.

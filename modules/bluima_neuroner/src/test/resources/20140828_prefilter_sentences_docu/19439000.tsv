19439000	They obtained good to excellent (> 50% clearance) results in all patients after  2â€“6 treatment sessions. Combined treatment with erbium:YAG and 532 nm  potassium titanyl phosphate (frequency-doubled Nd:YAG) lasers provided excellent  clinical results. Contrary to their suggestion, we achieved excellent results in  the treatment of scrotal angiokeratoma of Fordyce with the use of a  1064 nm, long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser alone and this laser only  targets hemoglobin. We recommend that a long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser is a  safe and effective alternative treatment method and clinicians  should consider this laser for the management of angiokeratomas  to obtain excellent cosmetic results.

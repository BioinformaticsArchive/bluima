This can be achieved by performing the fermentation at high cell loading within the carrier in addition to high carrier loading in the reactor. Factors that affect cell loading within a carrier include the affinity between interfering species and the pore size of the carrier. A biocatalyst carrier with pores of the proper size is critical in maximizing the cell loading, and thus the cell concentration in the reactor. Messing and Opperman] reported that, in order to achieve high accumulation of microbes that reproduce by fission, at least 70% of the pores of an inorganic carrier should have pore diameters in the range of one times the smallest major dimension through five times the largest major dimension of the cell. It is interesting to calculate the theoretical maximum cell loading of biocatalyst carriers with different pore sizes. From such a calculation, the correct range of pore sizes that permit good cell loading can be found. In addition, a comparison between the calculated theoretical maximum cell loading and the actual cell loading achieved in an immobilized cell fermentation can be viewed as an indicator for the density of active sites that are available for cells to adsorb on the carrier. A low ratio of actual cell loading to theoretical maximum cell loading would mean that improvement of carrier surface properties may be required to increase the affinity between the carrier and cells. In this communication, the authors present both the mathematics and the results of the calculation of theoretical maximum cell loading for carriers with different pore sizes. ASSUMPTIONS The estimation of maximum surface coverage of cells on the porous carrier surface is based on the following assumptions: 1. the pore structure of the porous carrier can be described by a parallel pore model; * Present address: ChemGen Corporation, 2501 Research Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland 20850. 2. the cells, being perfect spheres, are adsorbed in a monolayer, and packed in the most efficient arrangement possible on the carrier pore wall. Since the curvature of the pore surface reduces the maximum number of cells that can be packed on the surface, the authors used the parallel pore model to describe the pore structure and take into consideration the curvature effect. Two possible configurations were analyzed for the most efficient arrangement of packed cells on the curved surface of the pore wall. The first configuration is to pack the first row of cells longitudinally, and then pack the subsequent rows along the longitudinal direction in the most efficient arrangement possible. The second configuration is to pack the first row of cells on the curved surface at a fixed axial position, then pack the subsequent rows at other axial positions in the most efficient arrangement possible. MAXIMUM CELL LOADING FOR THE FIRST PACKING CONFIGURATION The curvature effect for the first cell packing configuration is demonstrated schematically in Figure 1 , which shows cross sections of a pore with rows of cells packed on the curved surface longitudinally in the most efficient arrangement possible.

Therefore, the maximum number of rows that can be packed on the curved surface is  Note that for pores with sizes smaller than 1.866 times the cell diameter, this value becomes undefined and no solution exists. It was assumed that cell adsorption in this constraint space is not possible. From the angle occupied by each adsorbed cell, the authors calculated the maximum cell number X,, that can be adsorbed on the curved surface on a unit pore volume basis using the following expression:  x,=  4  The maximum cell loading X , in terms of dry cell weight per unit pore volume is given by:  where pc is the dry weight density of cell in unit of dry cell weight per wet cell volume. (2), the following expression for the maximum cell loading X , is obtained:  (3)  MAXIMUM CELL LOADING FOR THE SECOND PACKING CONFIGURATION The curvature effect for the second packing configuration is demonstrated schematically in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, each cell adsorbed on the curved surface occupies an angle of -- 1 2 x sin-'  L  Therefore, the maximum cell number that can be packed at a given axial position of the pore is 1 r/sin-' "21 - 11. Note that for pores with sizes smaller than twice the cell diameter, this value becomes undefined and no solution exists. It was assumed that cell adsorption in this constraint space is not possible. Next, it was necessary to estimate the minimum distance between two adjacent rows of cells packed in the most efficient arrangement possible but adsorbed at different axial positions on the curved surface. From geometric analysis, the expression for the minimum distance, d b , between two adjacent rows of cells is given by the following equation:*  112  (4)  where:  Pores  Top View Side View  Figure 2.

The optimum pore size to cell size ratio appears to be two and half. Their experimental results indicate that in order to achieve high accumulation of microbes that reproduce by fission, at least 70% of the pores of an inorganic carrier should have pore diameters in the range of one times the smallest major dimension through 5-times the largest major dimension of the cells.

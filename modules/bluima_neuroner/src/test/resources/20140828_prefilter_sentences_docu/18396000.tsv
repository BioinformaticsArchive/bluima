18396000	Furthermore, 3T3 cells were used to determine the inhibitory concentration of the extract according to the method described by Singh and Ariatti (2006). angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are known to decrease the availability of Ang II, which, via the AT1 receptors in the kidneys are known to modulate salt and water excretion, and on vascular smooth muscle cells to cause vasoconstriction. vascular smooth muscle cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles and mesangial cells, proximal tubule cells (brush border and basolateral membranes), thick ascending limb, distal tubules, cortical collecting ducts, glomerular podocytes, and macula densa cells (Miyata et al., 1999). A study conducted by (Schmeisser et al., 2004) using ramiprilat (an ACEI) showed a reduction in AT1 expression in monocytes and endothelial cells. Antitumor activity of some natural flavonoids and synthetic derivatives on various human and murine cancer cell lines. A cationic cytofectin with long spacer mediates favourable transfection in transformed human epithelial cells.

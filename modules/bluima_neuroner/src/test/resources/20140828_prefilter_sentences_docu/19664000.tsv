19664000	Fibulins are a family of five extracellular matrix proteins and are assumed to function as intramolecular bridges, stabilising the organisation of other extracellular matrix structures. Sequence, recombinant expression and tissue localization of two novel extracellular matrix proteins, fibulin-3 and fibulin-4. A p.C217R mutation in fibulin-5 from cutis laxa patients is associated with incomplete extracellular matrix formation in a skin equivalent model.

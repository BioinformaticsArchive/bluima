20677000	TAE Buffer  Frozen XL1-red chemically competent cells are available from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), as 200 ml vials (see Note 1). When aliquoting, the competent cells should always remain on ice and should be transferred into the prechilled tubes. In this random mutagenesis procedure, the gene of interest in which mutations are desired is cloned into plasmid DNA and transformed into XL1-red competent cells. Electroporator, Gene pulsar Xcell microbial system from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) consists of a pulse controller module and a shock pod suitable for electroporation of bacteria and yeast. XL1-Red 1. Thaw a vial of XL1-red competent cells on ice. For each transformation, aliquot 50 ml of the XL1-red competent cells into a prechilled tube. The 200 ml of competent cells, once thawed, should be used immediately for four separate transformations. Add b-mercaptoethanol to each aliquot of competent cells, to the final concentration of 25 mM. Add approximately 40 ng of plasmid DNA to each aliquot of competent cells and mix gently with a pipette. Immediately discard approximately 800 ml of supernatant with a pipette, and resuspend the cells in 200 ml of SOC medium. This is done to concentrate the cells. 2. Put the entire 200 ml of cell suspension on an LB-agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic (see Note 2). Highly efficient electrocompetent cells are required for this. Discard supernatant immediately and finally resuspend the cell pellet in 200 ml of 10% glycerol. Electrocompetent 1. Keep the vial of electrocompetent cells on ice. Add approximately 1 ng of the mutagenized plasmid DNA to the 45 ml of electrocompetent cells (see Note 9). Transfer cells to a 15 ml test tube and incubate with gentle rotation (20 rpm) for 1 h at 37°C. In our experience for the best results, one should use the competent cells directly available from Stratagene. Repeated freeze-thawing of these frozen competent cells greatly reduces the transformation efficiency. Although XL1-red cells contain the tetracycline-resistance gene, due to the rapid mutator phenotype, the cells will frequently give rise to tetracycline-sensitive variants. Steps 5–9, involving washing of the competent cells, should be performed rapidly without any time lag to ensure good transformation efficiency of the cells and also care should be taken while decanting the supernatant after each centrifugation step to avoid losing the cell pellets. The amount of DNA should be determined depending on the size of the plasmid and transformation efficiency of the electrocompetent cells.

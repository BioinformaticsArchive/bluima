A few animal experiments showed that myocyte intracellular-free energy levels were maintained despite increases in myocardial work74 and could not find evidence of cellular hypoxia in septic animal tissues including heart tissues. An early experiment performed on isolated rat heart myocytes showed the existence of a cardiodepressing substance after incubating the cells with serum obtained from septic shock patients that led to lowered amplitude and velocity of myocyte shortening.75 At in vitro experiments TNFand interleukin-1 were responsible for in vitro myocardial cell depression induced by human septic shock serum, yet other ILs and interferon gamma failed to cause significant cardiomyocyte depression.77,78 Preincubation of a cell culture of beating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with tumor necrosis factor- has been shown to block -adrenoceptor–mediated increases in pulsation amplitude79 and mitochondrial oxygen consumption.80 Studies also have indicated that serum obtained from septic shock patients activates transcription factors and induces apoptosis in animal as well as in human fetal myocardial cells.84,85 Yet, the cardiodepressing substance can only partially explain the pathogenesis of cardiodepression during sepsis, whereas a complete explanation should also describe the intracellular mechanisms by which this factor depresses myocardial activity. Besides cellular level inhibition of autonomic system mediators, there is some evidence to show that septic shock is associated with neuronal and glial apoptosis within the autonomic centers of the heart.108,109 Calcium involvement in the research of myodepression arises from the fact that intracellular calcium is crucial in the final common pathway of the cardiac contraction mechanism. Several studies also have investigated the pathologic processes related to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the intracellular storage site of calcium. Also, in the molecular/cellular level, numerous mechanisms have been proposed to lead to myocardial dysfunction; however, no single molecule or mediator has been found to have a central or necessary role in the development of septic myocardial dysfunction.

Septic shock patients with a reduced ejection fraction have a circulating factor that depresses in vitro myocardial cell performance.

21031000	The lead candidate, named NITD609, was optimized in just 3 years from a class of compounds called the spiroindolones that were identified in a whole-cell screen of a library comprising 12,000 natural products and synthetic compounds. Overall, the discovery of NITD609 highlights the potential to rapidly move from whole-cell screening to a lead candidate that so far seems to meet the stringent efficacy and pharmacokinetic criteria needed to become a novel antimalarial drug.

It has been reported that emodin, an active component extracted from rhubarb, can stop the growth of cancer cells; however, it is not known if emodin exerts similar anti-atherogenic effects in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells. In this study, emodin treatment showed potent inhibitory effects in tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation that were associated with induced apoptosis, including the cleavage of poly ADPribose polymerase (Poly ADP-ribose polymerase). Moreover, inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9 (Ac-DEVD-CHO, Z-IETD-FMK and Z-LEHD-FMK) efficiently blocked emodin-induced apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells. Therefore, emodin-induced cell death occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this study showed that emodin inhibits tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation via caspase- and a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. KEY WORDS: EMODIN; APOPTOSIS; CASPASE ACTIVATION; MITOCHONDRIAL PATHWAY; ANTI-ATHEROSCLEROSIS  T he proliferation of vascular smooth-muscle cell(s) (Vascular smooth-muscle cell) plays a vital role in hypertension, atherosclerosis and restenosis [Ross, 1995]. In addition, abnormal Vascular smooth-muscle cell growth contributes to vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty [Ross, 1995]. In a normal artery, the Vascular smooth-muscle cell exist in a non-proliferative quiescent state and show a welldifferentiated contractile phenotype. Vascular lesions form during several pathological processes including the accumulation of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a [Jovinge et al., 1997]. tumor necrosis factor-a is secreted by Vascular smooth-muscle cell in the neointima after a balloon injury as well as by macrophages in  atherosclerotic lesions [Tanaka et al., 1996; Jovinge et al., 1997], and previous studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor-a induces an increase in DNA synthesis and the proliferation of Vascular smooth-muscle cell [Moon et al., 2003; Lee and Moon, 2005; Suh et al., 2006; Zhang and Wang, 2006; Kim et al., 2007]. Apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, is one method of controlling immune responses such as cellular homeostasis as well as a variety of physiological processes. Apoptosis is often linked with carcinogenesis resulting from abrogation of the apoptotic process [Blagosklonny, 2003; Rodriguez-Nieto and Zhivotovsky, 2006] and is characterized by a number of well-defined features, including cellular morphological change, chromatin condensation, oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage, membrane blebbing and activation of a family of cysteine proteases called caspases [Thornberry,  Abbreviations used: tumor necrosis factor-a, tumor necrosis factor-a; Vascular smooth-muscle cell, vascular smooth-muscle cells; human aortic smooth-muscle cells, human aortic smooth-muscle cells; Poly ADP-ribose polymerase, poly ADP-ribose polymerase; phosphate-buffered saline, phosphate-buffered saline; dithiothreitol, dithiothreitol; MTS, [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-(3-carbo-xymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfenyl)-2H-tetrazolium]; BA, bongkrekic acid; PTCA, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.

Bax translocation directly induces the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in apoptotic cells and triggers disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential [Ju ̈ rgensmeier et al., 1998; Antonsson et al., 2001; Park et al., 2003]. Emodin has been reported to stop the growth and induce the death of human Vascular smooth-muscle cell through reactive oxygen species and p53 [Wang et al., 2007], and it has also been reported to inhibit TNF-induced NF-kB activation and IkB degradation in human vascular endothelial cells [Kumar et al., 1998]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that emodin induces cell death during tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cell(s) (human aortic smooth-muscle cells) proliferation. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine if emodin inhibits tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cell proliferation via caspase- and a mitochondrial-dependant apoptotic pathway. CELL CULTURES human aortic smooth-muscle cells, smooth-muscle cell medium and SMC growth supplement were purchased from ScienCell (Carlsbad, CA). human aortic smooth-muscle cells were grown in smooth-muscle cell medium with growth supplement at 37°C in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere. For all experiments, human aortic smooth-muscle cells were grown to 80–90% confluence and made quiescent by starvation for at least 24 h. CELL PROLIFERATION ASSAYS human aortic smooth-muscle cells were incubated with various concentrations of emodin and 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-a or PDFG-BB for 24 h at 37°C. In addition, cell proliferation was measured by a BrdU-(5′bromo-2-deoxyuridine) ELISA assay (Cell proliferation ELISA BrdU, Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the BrdU assay, cells were fixed and their DNA was then denatured and blocked, after which the samples were incubated with an anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody coupled to peroxidase and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). In some experiments, human aortic smooth-muscle cells were preincubated with cultured anti-human TNFR1 monoclonal antibody and anti-human TNFR2 monoclonal antibody (1 mg/ml, respectively) for 30 min at 37°C prior to treatment with tumor necrosis factor-a. After 24 h, the cells were measured by a BrdU-(5′bromo-2-deoxyuridine) ELISA assay. Cationic lipophilic fluorochrome DiOC6(3) is a cell-permeable marker that specifically accumulates into mitochondrion depending on the DCm [Lin et al., 2003]. human aortic smooth-muscle cells (3  105/ml) were treated with various concentrations of emodin for 24 h. The cells were then washed once in 0.2% bovine serum albumin–phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10 mM DiOC6(3) for 30 min at 37°C. As many as 1  104 cells were then analyzed at FL1 with a Becton Dickinson FACS calibur flow cytometer and CELL-Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). DETERMINATION OF APOPTOSIS BY FLOW CYTOMETRY To detect externalized phosphatidylserine as an early indication of apoptosis, human aortic smooth-muscle cells (3  105/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of emodin and 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-a for 24 h at 37°C. The cells were then harvested, washed two times with FACS buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin–phosphate-buffered saline), stained with Annexin V–FITC according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), and then analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACS calibur flow cytometer and CELL-Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Bongkrekic acid (50 mM) was added to human aortic smooth-muscle cells for 2 h before the emodin and/or tumor necrosis factor-a treatment to inhibit disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. After 24 h, the cells were stained with Annexin V–FITC for FACS analysis [Hur et al., 2004]. In some experiments, 10 mM of Ac-DEVD-CHO, Z-IETD-FMK and Z-LEHDFMK were added to the human aortic smooth-muscle cells for 30 min before the emodin and/or tumor necrosis factor-a treatment. After 24 h, the cells were stained with Annexin V– FITC for FACS analysis. PREPARATION OF CYTOSOLIC EXTRACTIONS FOR CYTOCHROME C ANALYSIS The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in a cold lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were homogenized with 15 strokes, and the homogenates were then centrifuged at 1,200g for 15 min at 4°C. In some experiments, bongkrekic acid (50 mM) was added to human aortic smooth-muscle cells for 2 h before the emodin and/or tumor necrosis factor-a treatment. After 24 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in a cold lysis buffer for analysis by immunoblotting using an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody. PREPARATION OF TOTAL CELL EXTRACTS AND WESTERN BLOTTING human aortic smooth-muscle cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested. The cells were then sonicated in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4 and various protease inhibitors). Hereafter, the supernatants are referred to as the cell extract. The total cell lysates from the human aortic smooth-muscle cells were then separated by 10–12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after which the proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 mm, Schleicher and Schuell). RESULTS  EMODIN INHIBITS human aortic smooth-muscle cells PROLIFERATION Our group investigated the proliferation of human aortic smooth-muscle cells in response to 0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor-a. tumor necrosis factor-a stimulated the proliferation of human aortic smooth-muscle cells, as determined by a Cell Titer 96 Cell Proliferation Assay; with 10 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor-a being maximally effective at promoting proliferation (Fig. 1A, left panel). We also performed a BrdU-(5′bromo-2-deoxyuridine) ELISA assay of the human aortic smooth-muscle cells using neutralizing antibodies, anti-human TNFR1 monoclonal antibody and anti-human TNFR2 monoclonal antibody to show that tumor necrosis factor-a-induced proliferation occurred via TNFR1 and 2 (Fig. 1A, right panel). In addition, inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor-a-induced proliferation in human aortic smooth-muscle cells that had been treated with emodin was 59.9  4.5%, 66.8  4.1% and 79.5  2.5% of that of human aortic smooth-muscle cells that were treated with tumor necrosis factor-a alone (10 ng/ml; 100%) at final concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 mM, respectively. Emodin significantly and dose-dependently decreased the proliferation of human aortic smooth-muscle cells (34%, 36% and 48% of tumor necrosis factor-a alone at final concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 mM emodin, respectively; Fig. 1B, lower panel), whereas emodin alone (10 mM) had no effect on the proliferation and cytotoxicity of human aortic smooth-muscle cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, it is well known that PDGF is a strong inducer of Vascular smooth-muscle cell proliferation. Emodin also significantly inhibited the PDGF-induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with the inhibition of the PDGFinduced proliferation in human aortic smooth-muscle cells by emodin being 22%, 30% and 57% of that of PDGF alone (10 ng/ml) at final concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mM, respectively (Fig. 1C, right panel). As shown in Figure 2, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-a; alone increased the phosphorylation of IkBa in human aortic smooth-muscle cells that were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-a, however, emodin dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of IkBa, which may result in a reduction of the degradation of IkBa. This finding indicates that emodin may inhibit potential NF-kB activation via IkBa degradation in human aortic smooth-muscle cells that are stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-a. EMODIN-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN human aortic smooth-muscle cells IS DEPENDENT ON CASPASE ACTIVATION Cells undergoing apoptosis showed characteristic changes such as nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflets of the plasma membrane [Wyllie, 1980; Hur et al., 2004]. 1.

Arrested human aortic smooth-muscle cells were stimulated with 0.1, 1 or 10 mM emodin for 30 min prior to treatment without (A) or with (B and C) 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-a for 24 h. human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation was assayed by a CellTiter 96 Cell Proliferation Assay (B) and by a BrdU-(5′bromo-2-deoxyuridine) ELISA assay (C). 1.

Emodin was found to markedly induce apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells at a concentration of 10 mM (Fig. 3A; 0 mM, 2.8  0.6%; 0.1 mM, 17  3.1%; 1 mM; 28.1  9.6%; 10 mM, 60.5  8.7%). To further confirm that apoptosis was induced by emodin in tumor necrosis factor-a-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Poly ADP-ribose polymerase), which responds to DNA strand breaks and is  used as another hallmark of apoptosis, was evaluated. As shown in Figure 3B, the cleavage of Poly ADP-ribose polymerase was detected after 24 h of exposure to 1 mM emodin, however; the most prominent Poly ADP-ribose polymerase activity of emodin in tumor necrosis factor-a-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells was attained in response to treatment with 10 mM emodin (relative band density; 10 mM emodin, 580-fold of control groups, Fig. The effects of emodin on tumor necrosis factor-a-induced NF-kB activation in human aortic smooth-muscle cells.

The cells were preincubated with a caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, or a caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK, prior to stimulation with emodin and tumor necrosis factor-a to determine which cells were apoptotic. Inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9 efficiently blocked emodin-induced apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells (percent of apoptotic cells: 10 mM emodin alone, 60.5  8.7%; with 10 mM Ac-DEVD-CHO, 17.03  5.6%; with 10 mM Z-IETDFMK, 10.3  2.2%; with 10 mM Z-LEHD-FMK, 8.9  1%). In addition, the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, inhibited emodin-induced apoptosis by up to 72  7.7% in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells, and the caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, and the caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK, also inhibited emodin-induced apoptosis by up to 82  4.5% and 85  2.9%, respectively, in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells. These results indicate that emodin-induced cell death occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 4). A remarkable loss of DCm was observed at 24 h in response to treatment with 10 mM of emodin in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells (Fig. 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, a dose-dependent accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol was detected in emodin/TNFa-treated cells, and an efflux in mitochondrion was observed simultaneously. To inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, bongkrekic acid (BA, 50 mM) was added to human aortic smooth-muscle cells for 2 h prior to emodin and/or tumor necrosis factor-a treatment. After 24 h, the cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody. The BA efficiently blocked the emodin-induced cytochrome c release in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells (relative band density: with 10 mM emodin, 100%; with 50 mM BA, 15.7%). In addition, the BA efficiently inhibited emodin-induced apoptotic cells by up to  80.4 13.3% in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells (Fig. 5C). As shown in Figure 6, the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, increased as the concentration of emodin increased in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells (relative band density: 10 mM emodin and tumor necrosis factor-a, 5-fold of control groups and tumor necrosis factor-a alone treated group). DISCUSSION  In addition to playing an important role in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty [Ross, 1995], the abnormal growth of Vascular smooth-muscle cell also induces inflammation in blood vessels and/or arteries [Jovinge et al., 1997]. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a are secreted by Vascular smooth-muscle cell in the neointima following a balloon injury as well as by macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions [Tipping et al., 1993]. Additionally, it is well known that tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation contributes greatly to the development of atherosclerosis [Lee and Moon, 2005; Suh et al., 2006; Zhang and Wang, 2006]. Furthermore, many studies have shown that various materials, such as quercetin, resveratrol, gensenoside, ochnaflvone, and magnolol, inhibit tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation by regulating cell cycle-related proteins and the suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activity [Moon et al., 2003; Lee and Moon, 2005; Suh et al., 2006; Zhang and Wang, 2006; Kim et al., 2007]. However, it is not known if the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation occurs via caspase- and a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. Emodin inhibits tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation (Fig. 1), and it is well known that tumor necrosis factor-a functions as a survival signal, induces proliferation (via DNA synthesis), and acts as a death signal [Aggarwal, 2003]. However, in this study we attempted to confirm tumor necrosis factor-a-induced proliferation, not tumor necrosis factor-a-induced cell death. Cell proliferation was measured by a BrdU-(5′bromo-2-deoxyuridine) ELISA assay (Cell proliferation ELISA BrdU, Roche Diagnostics) and the results obtained were very similar to those of the cell viability  Fig. Emodin induces apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells. human aortic smooth-muscle cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of emodin for 24 h.

Whole-cell lysate was obtained and used for Western blotting analysis with anti-cleaved Poly ADP-ribose polymerase monoclonal antibody, as described in Materials and Methods Section. Moreover, the results of previous studies that used thymidine incorporation assays to evaluate tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation have shown that tumor necrosis factor-a induces an increase in DNA synthesis, and induces the proliferation of human aortic smooth-muscle cells [Moon et al., 2003; Lee and Moon, 2005; Suh et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007]. As shown in Figure 2, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-a alone increased the phosphorylation of IkBa and completely  degraded IkBa in tumor necrosis factor-a-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells, which indicates that tumor necrosis factor-a-induced proliferation via NF-kB activation. This finding indicates that emodin inhibits a potential NF-kB activation by IkBa degradation in tumor necrosis factor-a-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells. Emodin induces apoptotic cells (Fig. 3, upper panel), Poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage (Fig. 3, lower panel) and caspase activation (data not shown, it was shown using caspase inhibitors in Fig. human aortic smooth-muscle cells were preincubated with a caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (10 mM); caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK (10 mM); or caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK (10 mM) for 1 h, and then stimulated with emodin (10 mM) and tumor necrosis factor-a (10 ng/ml) for 24 h and harvested.

This study also presents evidence that caspase-3, in tumor necrosis factor-a treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells and the caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, -8 and -9 as well as mitochondria contribute directly to emodin- and the caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK, also inhibited emodinmediated apoptosis (Figs.

Furthermore, BA (bongkrekic emodin-induced cell death occurred via caspase- and mitochondriaacid, inhibitor of mitochondrial membrane potential disruption) efficiently inhibited emodin- dependent apoptosis. induced apoptotic cells by up to 80.4  13.3% in tumor necrosis factor-a treated It has been suggested that emodin-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells were killed by human aortic smooth-muscle cells (Fig. 5B and C). tumor necrosis factor-a-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells were incubated with emodin for the indicated dosages and times at 37°C. The supernatants of cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blot for the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. tumor necrosis factor-a-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells were incubated with emodin for the indicated dosages and times at 37°C.

Taken together, these results indicate that emodin induces cell death in inflammatory sites only. This study may have important pathological and therapeutic implications because overgrowth of Vascular smooth-muscle cell is a pivotal etiologic factor in the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty. To date, inhibition of Vascular smooth-muscle cell proliferation is among the most effective strategies for preventing their overgrowth and controlling neointimal thickening [Chien and Hoshijima, 2004; Guo et al., 2007]. Although Vascular smooth-muscle cell apoptosis plays a critical role in the control of Vascular smooth-muscle cell overgrowth and neointimal thickening, it can interrupt neointimal formation at defined time points and is inversely correlated with restenosis [Bochaton-Piallat et al., 1995;  Durand et al., 2002]. In addition, it is well known that the consequence of Vascular smooth-muscle cell apoptosis depends on the stage and location in the plaque [Rakesh and Agrawal, 2005]. Furthermore, the consequences of Vascular smooth-muscle cell apoptosis can also be detrimental to the overall stability of the plaque, thereby causing thrombosis and rupture [Bauriedel et al., 1999]. In addition, the effect that emodin-mediated Vascular smooth-muscle cell apoptosis has on thrombosis and plague rupture is not yet known and will be evaluated in a future study using animal models to better understand how they occur. However, it is obvious that emodin inhibits tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cell proliferation via caspase- and mitochondrialdependant apoptosis. Moreover, emodin prevents overgrowth of Vascular smooth-muscle cell and the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, emodin can be used to prevent atherosclerosis via induction of apoptosis in Vascular smooth-muscle cell. It was recently reported that emodin stopped the growth and induced the death of human Vascular smooth-muscle cell through reactive oxygen species and p53 [Wang et al., 2007]. Emodin has also been shown to inhibit rabbit iliac artery smooth-muscle cell proliferation following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) [Guo et al., 1996]. However, little is known about emodin's anti-atherogenic effects or its signal pathway (and mechanism) in human aortic smooth-muscle cells. In spite of this, other anthraquinone components of rhubarb, such as aloe-emodin, have been reported to have an anti-proliferative effect in Vascular smooth-muscle cell after arterial injury [Yin and Xu, 1998]. Therefore, further investigation regarding the effect of rhein should be conducted to determine if it has antiatherosclerosis activity that leads to cytotoxicity or its signal in TNFa-treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells. In conclusion, emodin inhibits tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation via caspase- and a mitochondrial-dependant apoptotic pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-a-induced human aortic smooth-muscle cells proliferation is directly involved in caspase- and mitochondrial-dependant apoptosis.

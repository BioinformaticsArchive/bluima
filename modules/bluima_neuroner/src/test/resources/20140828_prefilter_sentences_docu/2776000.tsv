2776000	In all species examined, the saccharides which cause thirst are those which do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and do not readily enter cells (e.g. sucrose), while thirst is not stimulated by those saccharides which do readily cross the blood-brain barrier or readily enter cells (e.g. D-glucose). (Biomedical Division)  sue, away from the ventricular space, depends mainly upon the rate of transfer across cell membranes (into brain cells or capillaries) and binding characteristics6. Saccharides that do not readily diffuse across cell membranes, and are not actively transported should penetrate further than those saccharides which do readily transfer across cell membranes. In this context it is clearly established that i.c.v, infusion of 0.7 M solutions of mannitol, L-glucoseorsucroseinartificialCSF29'31causesa large Na appetite in sheep, whereas similar infusions of hypertonic o-glucose, 2-deoxyglucose or 3-0-methylglucose have no effect, indicating that the neurons sensitive to change of \[Na\]are situated deep within the neuropil. intake gtimulated by infusion of hypertonic saccharides which do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier or readily enter cells cause as much water intake as equiosmotic NaCl, and hypertonic glucose or urea cause little, if any drinking (sheep13'3Â°,dog26, goat25, rat5, pigeon23). That is, although i.c.v, infusion of different hypertonic saccharide solutions decreased cerebrospinal fluid \[Na\],Na appetite was enhanced only by those saccharides which do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier or readily enter brain cells (e.g. sucrose, L-glucose, mannitol or L-fucose) 29'31. Finally, the data from these behavioral studies, indicative of a spatial separation of neuronal populations subserving thirst and those subserving Na appetite, though both sensitive to change of \[Na\], are strongly supported by studies involving lesions in the brain. 6 Fenstermacher, J., Rail, P., Patlak, C. and Levin, V., Ventroculocisternal perfusion as a technique for analysis of brain capillary permeability and extracellular transport.

18228000	Furthermore, piperonyl butoxide induced ATF-2 phosphorylation in TLR-3, a mouse immortalized hepatocyte cell line. Piperonyl butoxide was reported to act as a hepatocarcinogen in F344 rats that were fed a diet containing 1.2% Piperonyl butoxide for 2 years (Takahashi et al. 1994), and histopathological changes such as hepatocyte enlargement, anisonucleosis, and single-cell necrosis were induced in the liver of ICR mice administered 0.9% Piperonyl butoxide for 20 days (Fujitani et al. 1993). Okamiya et al. (1998) reported that both Piperonyl butoxide and phenobarbital induced cytochrome P450 isozymes such as cytochrome P4502B1 and inhibited gap junctional intercellular communication by downregulating connexin 32 in the liver; these Wndings strongly indicate that the tumorpromoting mechanism of Piperonyl butoxide is closely similar to that of phenobarbital in terms of hepatocarcinogenesis. These results suggested the possibility that Piperonyl butoxide potentially generates  reactive oxygen species via the metabolic pathway and induces oxidative stress, thereby resulting in the induction of hepatocellular tumors in mice. It is well known that cells enter the cell cycle via the action of G1 cyclin-dependent kinase, a complex of D-type cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase4/6 (Jordan et al. 2000), and that cyclin D1 expression is regulated by several transcription factors including c-Junrelated alkaline phosphatase-1 complexes such as c-Jun/ATF-2 (Beier et al. 1999) and c-Jun/c-Fos (Soh and Weinstein 2003). Further, our previous study on the possible mechanism of Piperonyl butoxide hepatocarcinogenesis in mice demonstrated the existence of a close relationship between cyclin D1 overexpression and hepatocarcinogenesis (Muguruma et al. 2006), and a similar relationship has been reported with regard to hepatocellular carcinomas (Tannapfel et al. 2003). These results suggested that cell proliferation during Piperonyl butoxide-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis is also involved in the activation of alkaline phosphatase-1, followed by the expression of D-type cyclins. In the present study, to examine whether alkaline phosphatase-1 is activated by Piperonyl butoxide, we attempted to identify alkaline phosphatase-1-related transcription factors by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemical analysis, and we examined the possible molecular mechanism underlying Piperonyl butoxide-induced cell proliferation. Cell culture and total protein extraction  The mouse immortalized hepatocyte cell line TLR-3 (provided by Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan) was cultured on collagen-coated culture plates (Becton Dickinson Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in Dulbecco's ModiWed Eagle Media (Dulbecco's ModiWed Eagle Media; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) supplemented with insulin–transferrin–selenium (ITS-X; Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 5% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum; Gibco Invitrogen), 10 g/mL epidermal growth factor (epidermal growth factor; Gibco Invitrogen), and antibiotics (penicillin–streptomycin–neomycin; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). Once the cell layers had reached 90% conXuence, the cells were preincubated for 6 h in Dulbecco's ModiWed Eagle Media containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and then treated with 25 g/mL Piperonyl butoxide dissolved in DMSO,  as reported previously (Ruch et al. 1990). After 24 h, the cells were lysed with CelLyticTM MT, a mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent, containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Western blot analysis  Forty micrograms of total cellular protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Next, to conWrm whether Piperonyl butoxide induces ATF-2 phosphorylation in hepatocytes, the level of the p-ATF-2 protein in Piperonyl butoxide-treated TLR-3 cells was evaluated by Western blotting. When TLR-3 cells were treated with Piperonyl butoxide for 24 h at a concentration of 25 g/mL increased level of p-ATF-2 was apparently detected (Fig. 3). 3 Western blot analysis of p-ATF-2 in TLR-3 cells exposed to 25 g/mL Piperonyl butoxide for 24 h. Piperonyl butoxide induced ATF-2 phosphorylation in these cells. As expected, Piperonyl butoxide increased the level of phosphorylated ATF-2 in TLR-3 cells within 24 h. ATF-2 is known to regulate the transcription of c-Jun and several cell cycle-related genes such as those encoding cyclin A, cyclin D1, and ATF-3 (Watanabe et al.1996; Shimizu et al. 1998; Baldin et al. 1993); it is also involved in the carcinogenesis of human melanoma (Ronai et al. 1998), breast cancer (Lewis et al. 2005; Song et al. 2006), and mouse skin tumors (Papassava et al. 2004). Thus, Piperonyl butoxide could induce the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 and then activate G1-cell cycle to promote cell proliferation during the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis in the mouse liver.

This activation might differ for cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells. Granulosa cell subtype cultures were established from the follicle harvests of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization therapy. In response to oxLDL treatment, the fibroblast-like cytokeratin- cells upregulated LOX-1 and exhibited reparative autophagy, which could be blocked with anti-LOX-1 antibody. The epithelioid-like cytokeratin-positive cells did not regulate LOX-1 expression upon oxLDL application, but the expression of tolllike receptor 4 and CD14 increased between 0 and 36 h of oxLDL/nDL treatment. This upregulation was associated with nonapoptotic cell death based on the absence of cleaved caspase-3. In cytokeratin- cells, the inhibition of tolllike receptor 4 downregulated  *Correspondence to: Katharina Spanel-Borowski; Institute of Anatomy; University of Leipzig; Liebigstraße 13; Leipzig 04103 Germany; Tel.: +49.341.9722000; We concluded that cytokeratin- granulosa cells are protected against oxLDL-dependent apoptosis by tolllike receptor 4, whereas, in cytokeratin-positive cells, oxLDL-induced tolllike receptor 4 activation triggers nonapoptotic cell death. The cytokeratin-positive cells might represent immunelike granulosa cells involved in ovarian remodeling processes. Introduction Early in development, all follicle cells in the primordial follicles produce cytokeratin.1,2 The follicle cells transform into granulosa cells in the preantral and antral follicles, gradually losing the expression of cytokeratin 7, 8, 18 and 19. The maintenance of fully differentiated granulosa cells expressing cytokeratin requires LH supplementation.3 A subpopulation of cytokeratin-positive cells has been reported in follicles harvested from in vitro fertilization patients.2 The cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells undergo caspase-independent apoptosis via an unknown signaling pathway.4 Nonapoptotic cell death has also been described for granulosa cells in bovine antral follicles.5 Cell-death associated autophagy in human granulosa cell cultures was reported to be induced by oxLDL-dependent activation of lectin-like oxidized low density receptor 1 (LOX-1),6 but the study omitted a comparison between the oxLDL-dependent response of cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells. It is timely to get insight into the function of the two granulosa cell phenotypes. Granulosa cells of the preovulatory follicles experience extreme oxidative stress and high reactive oxygen species production.7 Intracellular feedback by oxLDL-dependent LOX-1 activation increases intracellular reactive oxygen species, which reciprocally upregulates LOX-1 to bind more oxLDL.11,12 Capillary tubes form under low oxLDL conditions,12 but high concentrations of oxLDL cause LOX-1-dependent apoptosis in endothelial cells.13,14 In addition to concentration, the degree of oxidation might exert different effects on LOX-1 responsive cells.13 Cultures of human cytokeratin-positive (cytokeratin-positive) and cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) granulosa cells were grown to confluence in serum-containing medium and characterized by phase contrast microscopy (a and b), immunofluorescence staining with the pancytokeratin antibody Lu5 (c and d), and western blot analysis for cytokeratin 8 (e) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (steroidogenic acute regulatory) (f). (a and c) The epithelioid cell form of cytokeratin-positive cells relates to the presence of cytokeratin filaments. (b and d) The fibroblast-like cytokeratin- cells lack cytokeratin filaments. (e) The cytokeratin 8 protein is found in the cytokeratin-positive but not the cytokeratin- granulosa cell lysates. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 and the 3T3-L1 fibroblast cell line were used as positive (+) and negative (-) controls, respectively. (f) The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein was present in both cell types. The ovulatory process, which is considered an inflammatory-like process, is broadened by the view that granulosa cells develop innate immune responses for the effective differentiation of “self ” from “nonself.”20,21 The presence of the toll-like receptor pathway in preovulatory granulosa cells was demonstrated and its function attributed to the phagocytosis of bacterial fragments. Granulosa cell damage might also be induced by innate immune responses after the oxLDL-dependent activation of tolllike receptor 4. Our first objective in the current study was to examine the expression of LOX-1 in cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cell cultures derived from the follicle harvests of women undergoing in vitro fertilization therapy. The second objective was to treat the cultures with commercially available oxLDL to observe either autophagy or  apoptosis in the granulosa cell subtypes. Third, because the oxLDL-induced cell death of cytokeratin-positive cells was not blocked by antiLOX-1 antibody, the expression of tolllike receptor 4 and CD14, another pattern recognition receptor, was studied in both granulosa cell types. The last objective was to determine whether tolllike receptor 4 is involved in cytokeratin-positive cell death by blocking tolllike receptor 4 with specific antiTLR4 antibody. Results oxLDL causes different morphological responses in cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- cells. Pure cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cell cultures were examined by phase contrast microscopy and cytokeratin filament immunostaining (Fig. 1a–d). The epithelioid cell form of granulosa cells was associated with the presence of cytokeratin filaments, whereas the fibroblast-like cells lacked cytokeratin, which was confirmed by western  Figure 2. OxLDL treatment induces cell death in cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells and has no effect on cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) cells. Actin filaments were stained with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (a–e and h–-l) and dead cells were detected by the uptake of propidium iodine (12.5 μg/ml) in (f and m). (a–e, left) cytokeratin-positive cells with disappearing actin filaments (c) and cell loss (d) under oxLDL treatment; apoptotic bodies are unapparent (c and d) and nLDL had no effect (e). (h–l, right) cytokeratin- cells with an intact actin cytoskeleton with 36 h of oxLDL and nLDL treatment (k and l). (f) Approximately 50% of the dead cells appear as pink (overlay of blue nuclear DAPI stain with red propidium iodine) in the cytokeratin-positive cultures and apoptotic bodies are absent. (m) cytokeratin- cultures consist of intact cells. (g) cytokeratin-positive cells show heavy vacuolization and numerous membrane-like fragments (arrow head) and a nucleus under chromatolysis. (n) cytokeratin- cells contain double-membrane autophagosomes (arrows); mitochondria are intact. The steroidogenic ability of both cell types was validated by the presence of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in both granulosa cell subtypes (Fig. 1f ). The fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin staining revealed that oxLDL treatment caused actin cytoskeleton reorganization and subsequent depolymerization in cytokeratin- cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2a–e). In contrast, cytokeratin-positive cells treated with nLDL for 36 h possessed an intact peripheral actin ring. In cytokeratin- cells, oxLDL treatment had no effect (Fig. 2h–l). To verify oxLDL-dependent cell death in both subtype cultures, propidium iodine uptake was assessed. With 36 h of oxLDL treatment, 25–50% of cytokeratin-positive cells were propidium iodine-positive without nuclei fragmentation, whereas cytokeratin- cultures had negligible signs of cell death (Fig. 2f and m). At the ultrastructural level, neither DNA condensation nor apoptotic bodies were detected in cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells with 36 h of oxLDL treatment, but vacuolization, membrane-like remnants, and chromatolysis were observed in cytokeratin-positive cells (Fig. 2g). In cytokeratin- cells, early autophagosomes with the characteristic double membrane, autophagolysosomes, and intact mitochondria were observed (Fig. 2n). oxLDL regulates LOX-1 expression in cytokeratin- cells. The room temperature-PCR analysis showed that cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- cells expressed LOX-1 mRNA (Fig. 3A). The basal level at 0 h of mature (52 kDa) LOX-1 protein was lower in cytokeratin-positive cells than cytokeratin- cells (Fig. 3B). In cytokeratin- cells, but not cytokeratin-positive cells, LOX-1 was significantly upregulated after oxLDL treatment for 12 to 36 h compared to the serum-free and nLDL controls (Fig. 3C). The cell-type-specific difference in LOX-1 expression was also detected by immunostaining. The cytokeratin- granulosa cells had increased LOX-1-positive dot-like forms with 36 h of oxLDL treatment compared to controls (0 h, nLDL, serum-free) and to cytokeratin-positive cells (Fig. 3D). oxLDL induces reparative autophagy in cytokeratin- cells and cleaved caspase-3 independent cell death in cytokeratin-positive cells. The presence of LOX-1 in cytokeratin-positive and negative (cytokeratin-) granulosa cells is shown. (A) LOX-1 mRNA was expressed in untreated cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells, 3 and 4 samples, respectively. (B and C) Higher LOX-1 protein expression was seen in cytokeratin- cells compared to cytokeratin-positive cells, as shown in the representative western blot (B). The semiquantitative evaluation displays a significant increase in the LOX-1 expression of cytokeratin- cells compared to serum-free controls. No LOX-1 regulation was noted for cytokeratin-positive cells. (D) Using immunofluorescence staining, more LOX-1 proteins were detected as dot-like forms in cytokeratin- cells with 36 h of oxLDL treatment than with similarly stimulated cytokeratin-positive cells. A significant increase in the light chain 3 ratio (p < 0.001) occurred in cytokeratin- granulosa cells between 24 and 36 h of oxLDL compared to 0 and 12 h oxLDL, to 36 h nLDL treatment, and to serum-free controls. In cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells, no changes in the light chain 3 ratio were noted (Fig. 4A and B). The striking occurrence of autophagosomes in cytokeratin- granulosa cells with 36 h of oxLDL treatment was substantiated by immunostaining for light chain 3. As expected, cytokeratin- cells were found to have more light chain 3-positive ring-like structures compared to the 12 h treatment (Fig. 4C). The increase in autophagosomes in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin- cells was determined to be reparative autophagy. Cleaved caspase-3, a well  accepted apoptotic marker, was absent from either culture type, but mature caspase-3 was present in cytokeratin-positive cells (western blot not shown). Thus, the caspase-3 dependent pathway was excluded for oxLDLtreated cytokeratin-positive cells. To confirm whether cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells were able to undergo autophagy or apoptosis, the cells were treated with rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, or staurosporine, an inducer of apoptosis. In cytokeratin- cells, the light chain 3-II protein reached its maximum with 36 h of rapamycin (22 μg/ml), whereas, in cytokeratin-positive cells, maximum was observed at 24 h (Suppl. Between 12–36 h of staurosporine treatment (1 μM/ml) resulted in high values of cleaved caspase-3 protein in cytokeratin-positive cells compared to CKcells (Suppl. LOX-1 inhibition abrogates autophagy in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin- cells. The oxLDL-dependent effects on cell death in cytokeratin-positive cells and reparative autophagy in cytokeratin- granulosa cells was verified  Figure 4. Signs of autophagy are observed in cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) but not in cytokeratin-positive granulosa cell cultures (A–C). (A and B) The western blot displays a strong shift from the light chain 3-1 to light chain 3-II in cytokeratin- cells with oxLDL treatment for 24 and 36 h compared to the controls (0 h, nLDL and serum-free). Lysates from the N2A neuroblastoma cell line and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were used as positive controls (+). *p < 0.05 (C) Immunofluorescence staining for light chain 3 protein demonstrated more autophagosomes (ring-like forms indicated by arrows) in cytokeratin- cells with 36 h of oxLDL treatment compared to 12 h treatment. In cytokeratin- granulosa cells, the oxLDL-dependent upregulation of LOX-1 was blocked in the 36-h-presence of the polyclonal anti-LOX-1 antibody; the LOX-1 expression corresponded to basal levels under serum-free conditions (Fig. 5A and B). No changes in LOX-1 production were noted for cytokeratin-positive cells (Fig. 5A and B). The propidium iodine uptake assay showed that receptor inhibition had no effect on the presence of dead cytokeratin-positive cells (Fig. 5C). In cytokeratin-positive cultures treated with oxLDL or under LOX-1 antibody-dependent inhibition, cell mortality was 48% and 55%, respectively, compared to 0% under serum-free conditions. This result suggests that oxLDL causes LOX-1-independent cell death in cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells. oxLDL regulates tolllike receptor 4 and CD14 expression in cytokeratin-positive cells. The tolllike receptor 4 is another receptor that might be activated via oxLDL,15,16,23,24 and involved in the oxLDL-dependent cell death of cytokeratin-positive cells. The  room temperature-PCR analysis showed that cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- cells express tolllike receptor 4 mRNA (Fig. 6A). In cytokeratin-positive cells, TRL4 protein expression significantly increased with 36 h of oxLDL treatment compared to time 0. A similar increase was also observed after nLDL application and serum-deprivation for 36 h. In cytokeratin- granulosa cells, no regulation was seen (Fig. 6B and C). By immunostaining, the cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells displayed a stronger tolllike receptor 4-positive dot-like response with 36 h of oxLDL and nLDL treatment compared to controls (0 h and 36 h serum free) and cytokeratin- cells (Fig. 6D). Similar to tolllike receptor 4, CD14 expression increased during 0–36 h of oxLDL treatment in cytokeratin-positive cells, but maximum levels were seen with 36 h nLDL treatment and serum-free maintenance (Fig. 6E and F). No CD14 regulation was noted in cytokeratin- granulosa cells. tolllike receptor 4 inhibition upregulates cleaved caspase-3 in cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- cells. It was evident from the above results that reparative autophagy in cytokeratin- cells depends on LOX-1 activation, whereas  Figure 5. Inhibition of LOX-1 expression and autophagosome formation occurs after treatment with the anti-LOX-1 antibody in cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) but not cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells. (A) Representative western blot depicting LOX-1 expression in both cell types. (B) The semiquantitative evaluation of LOX-1 protein expression found a significant increase in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin- cells compared to the serum-free control; co-treatment with specific anti-LOX-1 abrogates the upregulation of LOX-1. cytokeratin-positive cells lacked the oxLDL-dependent regulation of LOX-1. (C) In cytokeratin- cells, light chain 3-II protein expression was increased after 36 h of oxLDL treatment compared to the serum-free control. (D) The percentage of dead cells was determined by propidium iodine positive nuclei in cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells treated with oxLDL for 36 h. Receptor inhibition with the LOX-1 antibody had no effect on the presence of dead cells. Scale bars represent 50 μm.  nonapoptotic cell death in cytokeratin-positive cells might be related to the protein compared to oxLDL-treated cells and serum-free controls activation of tolllike receptor 4. Culture subtypes, which were treated simul- (Fig. 7A and B). In cytokeratin- cells, tolllike receptor 4 inhibition was also associtaneously with oxLDL and polyclonal anti-tolllike receptor 4 antibody for 36 ated with downregulated LOX-1; in cytokeratin-positive cells, tolllike receptor 4 blockade h, surprisingly developed a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 lacked changes in LOX-1 expression (Fig. 7C and D). Toll-like receptor 4 (tolllike receptor 4) is found in cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) granulosa cells (A–D). Similarly, the CD14 antigen is regulated in cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells but not cytokeratin- cells (E and F). (A) tolllike receptor 4 mRNA is expressed in different samples of untreated cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells. (B) Representative western blot for tolllike receptor 4. (C) The semiquantitative evaluation revealed a significant increase in tolllike receptor 4 expression in cytokeratin-positive cells with 36 h of oxLDL/nLDL treatment, but no regulation was seen in cytokeratin- cells. (D) Using immunofluorescence staining, more tolllike receptor 4 proteins were detected as dot-like forms in cytokeratin-positive cells with 0 and 36 h of oxLDL/nLDL treatment compared to controls (36 h serum-free) and similarly stimulated cytokeratin- cells. (E) Representative western blot for CD14 in both cell types. (F) The semiquantitative evaluation revealed high CD14 expression in cytokeratin-positive cells maintained under serum-free conditions for 36 h or treated with nLDL. No CD14 regulation was noted for cytokeratin- cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001.  inhibition led to cell death in both cell subtypes after oxLDL treatment was confirmed by the propidium iodine uptake assay, with 40–54% propidium iodine-positive nuclei compared to 0% under serum-free conditions (Fig. 7E). These results suggest that tolllike receptor 4 is protective against cytokeratin- cell death after oxLDL application, whereas, in cytokeratin-positive cells, tolllike receptor 4 mediated the nonapoptotic pathway. First experiments with the siRNA gene silencing strategy to inhibit tolllike receptor 4 expression in oxLDL-treated cultures revealed a decrease in the LOX-1 protein in the cytokeratin- cell culture and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 for both culture types (Suppl. 3A and B). cytokeratin-positive cells regulate reactive oxygen species under oxLDL, cytokeratin- cells produce STAR. The cytokeratin-positive cells were found to have increased reactive oxygen species levels with 12 h of oxLDL treatment, which decreased with 36 h. No changes in reactive oxygen species levels were noted in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin- cells compared to the serum-free controls, apart from a decrease in reactive oxygen species after nLDL application (Fig. 8A). The cytokeratin-positive cells generated more reactive oxygen species than the cytokeratin- cells, as shown by higher reactive oxygen species levels in cytokeratin-positive cells after antimycin-A treatment. Because an increase in reactive oxygen species was observed in cytokeratin-positive cells after oxLDL treatment, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression might be disrupted.25 The immunobands corresponding to steroidogenic acute regulatory proteins were difficult to visualize in cytokeratin-positive cells at time 0, which was in contrast to cells cultured in serum-containing medium under less strict endotoxin conditions (compare Figs. Furthermore, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression was absent in cytokeratin-positive cells, but it was significantly increased in cytokeratin- granulosa cells between 0 and 36 h after oxLDL treatment. Discussion  Granulosa cell subtypes are treated with mildly oxidized lipoprotein. Cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells are identifiable by morphology but not yet by function.1-3 To our knowledge, cytokeratin-positive cells have not been studied in long-term culture. Notably, the cytokeratin-positive cell morphology persisted without LH supplementation. Our cells must be different from mature granulosa cells, which require the presence of LH for cytokeratin expression.3 Working concentrations for oxLDL treatment of monocytes and endothelial cells vary widely in previous studies, between 5–250 μg/ml.13,15,26 We compared the granulosa cell responses initiated by oxLDL preparations from two independent providers. The oxLDL preparation obtained from Borlak’s group28,29 caused cell death in granulosa cell cultures (not yet classified into subtypes) at 100 μg/ml.6 The current oxLDL preparation from Biomedical Technology resulted in the survival of cytokeratin- granulosa cells by reparative autophagy and cell death in cytokeratin-positive cells at 150 μg/ml. The diverse cell response indicates that 150 μg/ml oxLDL represents a physiological dose for in vitro experiments. Another reason for mild treatment is that the expression of the CD36 receptor, which is a class B scavenger receptor for profoundly oxidized lipoprotein,9,27 remained unchanged in treated cytokeratin-positive and cytokeratin- granulosa cells (Suppl. OxLDL-treated cytokeratin- cells survive by LOX-1 dependent reparative autophagy. The application of oxLDL causes receptor-dependent finetuning towards reparative autophagy in cytokeratin- cells or cell death in cytokeratin-positive cells. In cytokeratin- cells, we demonstrated a time-dependent increase in LOX-1 protein expression associated with a strong light chain 3-II/I ratio after 36 h oxLDL treatment. Autophagy induced by oxLDL in cytokeratin- cells is supported by additional findings: (a) the oxLDL-treated cells maintained intact actin filaments; (b) the typical double membrane autophagosomes were observed at the ultrastructural level after oxLDL treatment but not after serum-free and nLDL treatment, which shows that serum depravation, the classic autophagy inducer,32 is less effective than additional oxLDL treatment; (c) immunostaining depicted many light chain 3-positive ring-like structures after oxLDL but not nLDL treatment; and (d) most importantly, specific LOX-1 inhibition interrupted the light chain 3-II shift. OxLDL-treated cytokeratin-positive cells undergo tolllike receptor 4 dependent nonapoptotic cell death. Unlike cytokeratin- cells, LOX-1 receptor protein was not regulated by oxLDL treatment in cytokeratin-positive cells, though the cells died by nonapoptotic cell death. Non-LOX-1-regulated cell death in cytokeratin-positive cells led to the determination of tolllike receptor 4 and CD14 regulation after oxLDL application. In the current study, a similar observation was made of the specific inhibition of tolllike receptor 4 either by antibody blockade or by tolllike receptor 4 gene silencing: apoptosis occurred in cytokeratin- cells after oxLDL treatment based on  Figure 7 (See previous page). tolllike receptor 4 inhibition leads to apoptosis in cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) and cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells. (B) The semiquantitative evaluation of cleaved caspase-3 protein expression revealed a significant increase in cells co-treated with specific anti-tolllike receptor 4 versus serum-free control and oxLDL treatment. (D) According to the semiquantitative evaluation the inhibition of the tolllike receptor 4 receptor abrogates the upregulation of LOX-1 in cytokeratin- cells. cytokeratin-positive cells lack the oxLDL-dependent regulation of LOX-1 in the presence of anti-tolllike receptor 4. Values represent mean ± scanning electron microscopy of four independent experiments expressed as percent of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. (E) The percentage of dead cells was determined by propidium iodine positive nuclei after treatment with oxLDL with and without anti-tolllike receptor 4 antibody. Figure 8. reactive oxygen species increased in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells but not in cytokeratin-negative (cytokeratin-) cells (A). Similarly, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (steroidogenic acute regulatory) is regulated in cytokeratin- but not in cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells (B and C). (A) The flow cytometric evaluation revealed an increase in the reactive oxygen species with 12 h of oxLDL treatment in cytokeratin-positive cells. No changes in the reactive oxygen species level was noted in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin- cells compared to the serum-free control. (C) The semiquantitative evaluation revealed a significant increase in the steroidogenic acute regulatory expression in cytokeratin- cells with 0–36 h of oxLDL treatment; nLDL supplementation leads to similar upregulation. cytokeratin-positive cells display negligible steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. This mechanistic explanation of higher oxLDL concentrations under tolllike receptor 4 inhibition could explain the switch from nonapoptotic to apoptotic cell death in oxLDL-treated cytokeratin-positive cells kept under tolllike receptor 4 inhibition. The molecular cross-talk between tolllike receptor 4 and LOX-1 requires further investigation, in particular, the strong upregulation of tolllike receptor 4 and CD14 in cytokeratin-positive cells treated for 36 h with nLDL or kept serum-free. steroidogenic acute regulatory production by cytokeratin- cells is associated with minor reactive oxygen species generation. Low concentrations of reactive oxygen species in follicular fluid are considered to be positive signals for successful in vitro fertilization,34 whereas high concentrations are catastrophic for cells by impairing oocyte and embryo quality.35 These two faces of reactive oxygen species seem reflected by the two granulosa cell subtypes. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which regulates steroid hormone biosynthesis by translocating cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, was strikingly augmented in cytokeratin- cells. Because minor reactive oxygen species production was associated with cytokeratin- cells compared to cytokeratin-positive cells with 12 h oxLDL, small amounts of reactive oxygen species might activate steroidogenesis in cytokeratin- cells. Otherwise, in cytokeratin-positive cells, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein production seems to be halted by high reactive oxygen species levels, similar to the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein decrease for the Leydig MA-10 tumor cell line exposed to hydrogen peroxide.25 The decrease in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which defines a perturbed processing of cholesterol in mitochondria, was associated with an oxLDL/nLDL-dependent tolllike receptor 4 pathway, supporting the finding that lipopolysaccharides increase tolllike receptor 4 transcripts in bovine granulosa cells and suppress estradiol production.36 Why cytokeratin- cells are more robust against oxidative stress than cytokeratin-positive cells, is explained by a more efficient antioxidant system in cytokeratin- cells. The origin and function of granulosa cell subtypes is discussed. All granulosa cells have a common origin, the cytokeratin-positive epithelial ridges on the surface epithelium. In the fetus, remnants of the epithelial ridges transform into cytokeratin-positive follicle cells of the primordial  follicles.1,2 The scarcity of cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells in preantral and antral follicles might indicate special roles. We speculate that the cytokeratin-positive follicle cells represent immune-like granulosa cells, which exert particular surveillance functions during tissue remodeling related to folliculogenesis, atresia, and ovulation.20,21 Our cultured cytokeratin-positive cells, which regulate tolllike receptor 4 expression after oxLDL/nLDL treatment, are promising candidates for the postulated immunelike granulosa cells. Taken together, the results indicate that oxLDL-dependent LOX-1 activation induces reparative autophagy in cytokeratin- granulosa cells. In cytokeratin-positive cells, oxLDL-initiated cell death seems to be independent of LOX-1 activation but involves tolllike receptor 4 signaling. OxLDL treatment is associated with minor reactive oxygen species production in cytokeratin- cells. The cytokeratin-positive cells might have an exceptional position in the immune surveillance of ovarian remodeling processes. Materials and Methods Primary granulosa cell cultures and oxLDL treatment. Granulosa cells were obtained from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization therapy. The cell suspension was centrifuged, the resus- 3 pended pellet plated into 24-well cluster plates, and cells cultured at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO . 2 The granulosa cell culture medium was a mixture of 10% Endothelial Cell Growth Medium MV (Promo Cell, C-22020) and DMEM-F12 (1 + 1) medium (Invitrogen, 42400-010) containing 15 mM HEPES, 22 mM NaHCO , 10% fetal bovine 3 serum (Biochrom AG, S 0613/5), and antibiotics. Cultures were classified as epithelioid (i.e., cytokeratin-positive granulosa cells) or fibroblast-like (i.e., cytokeratin- granulosa cells). Cell types were mechanically selected by colony transfer as described previously for endothelial cell types.37 Granulosa cell cultures were grown to confluence in serum-containing medium in either 6-well cluster plates for FACS analysis, 12-well cluster plates for western blot analysis, or 24-well cluster plates for morphological studies. Mehta and Li,26 who identified LOX-1 in human coronary endothelial cells, related similar TBARS content as a parameter for nLDL oxidation to oxLDL per 100 mg protein. Confluent cells were incubated with the antibody (5 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 30 min. Thereafter, cells were co-treated with 150 μg oxLDL/ml and 5 μg/ ml of the antibody for 36 h. Actin filament staining and immunofluorescence localization of cytokeratin, light chain 3, LOX-1 and tolllike receptor 4. Confluent granulosa cell cultures were grown on round glass cover slips, fixed with 4% PBS-buffered formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 (Roth, 3051.2s) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 min). For light chain 3 immunofluorescence staining, granulosa cells were fixed with ice cold methanol (5 min); for LOX-1 and tolllike receptor 4 staining, cells were fixed with 2% buffered formaldehyde plus 0.1% Triton-X100 (room temperature, 10 min). After saturating nonspecific binding sites with 10% normal goat serum, cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-light chain 3 5F10 antibody (Nano Tools, 0231-100/light chain 3-5F10), mouse monoclonal anti-human LOX-1 or rabbit polyclonal antiTLR4, all diluted 1:1,000 in PBS containing 0.25% BSA, at 4°C overnight. room temperature-PCR analysis for LOX-1 and tolllike receptor 4. Total RNA was isolated from treated and untreated primary granulosa cell cultures using Trizol (Invitrogen 15596-026) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Lysate protein (10 μg) was mixed 1:1 with loading buffer [250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 400 mM dithiothreitol, 140 mM SDS, 60% glycerin and 0.02% bromophenol blue], separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. To monitor signs of cell death at the ultrastructural level, cultures were grown to confluence on Thermanox coverslips (Nunc, Inc., 174969) in 24-well culture plates, fixed in 2.5% PBS-buffered glutaraldehyde at 4°C  for 1 h, and post-fixed in 1% OsO for another hour. Polymerized Epon casts were rapidly frozen to remove coverslips with adherent cells. Detection of cell death by propidium iodine uptake. OxLDL-treated and untreated granulosa cell cultures were incubated with propidium iodine (12.5 μg/ ml, Fluka-Biochemica, 81845) at room temperature for 5 min. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% PBS-buffered formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min; the coverslips were mounted upside down in Glycergel® with DAPI as described above. Digitized pictures were taken from 10 independent areas at 10x magnification, and dead cells with propidium iodine-positive nuclei were counted. The percentage of dead cells was calculated and averaged from four experiments. For positive controls, cells were pre-incubated with 20 μM antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A 8674; 20 min), a partial inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which increased mitochondrial superoxides. Unstained cells served as negative controls and indicated auto-fluorescence. The resuspended cell pellets were incubated with 5 μM MitoSOXTM Red in 1 ml PBS for 30 min at 37°C, washed with PBS and centrifuged (1,200 rpm, 5 min), transferred to 0.5 ml PBS in a sterile tube to be transported on ice to the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research.

18680000	For attempted virus isolation tissues were ground with sterile sand in antibiotic broth and inoculated into chick embryo liver cell cultures. Histological features were acute tenosynovitis, haemorrhage and tendon fibre degeneration followed later by chronic lymphocyte/plasma cell reaction and tendinous and peritendinous fibrosis (Figures 6 to 8). In addition to the above there were four birds (two sampled at 3 weeks and two at 6 weeks) whose joint tissues were positive for M. iowae after culture in chick embryo liver cells. Although these cultures were undertaken for virus isolation they were screened for mycoplasmas because the cells developed an abnormal appearance on third passage of the joint material. There was no evidence of virus infection in the cell cultures and only one hock swab  Table 2. 'Indicates that M. iowae was isolated from pooled joint material in cell culture (only 2 birds per group were examined in this way). There were four instances where the Mycoplasma was recovered from joint tissue that had been inoculated into cell culture for virus isolation, and three of these had not been positive by conventional culture methods. This may reflect the greater sensitivity of the cell culture system but it may have been due to the nature of the samples. For conventional cultures swabs of the joint and tendon surfaces were taken whereas a much larger sample of pooled articular cartilage and tendon tissue was ground up for inoculation into cell culture. In this experiment M. iowae grew in the cell cultures despite the presence of 1000 /zg/ml streptomycin sulphate in the diluent used for grinding the joint tissues and despite the presence of 100 ^ug/ml of this antibiotic in the culture medium.

21280000	The frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells in the spleen was reduced in galectin 3–/– mice as compared with Wild-type mice mice. Our findings show that galectin 3 plays a pathogenic role in the development and progression of antigen-induced arthritis and that the disease severity is accompanied by alterations of antigen-specific IgG levels, systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, and frequency of interleukin-17– producing T cells. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a massive infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells into the joints and the development of inflammation that results in destruction of articular cartilage and adjacent bone (1). Activated T helper cells comprise a large proportion of the inflammatory cells that invade the synovial tissue and may therefore be a cell type of pathogenic importance (2,3). The galectins share a  high degree of amino acid sequence similarity in the C-terminal, carbohydrate-recognition domain, are synthesized as cytosolic proteins in a number of different cell types (e.g., myeloid cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial and epithelial cells [8]), and are externalized by a nonclassic secretion pathway (6). The galectins are thought to crosslink -galactoside–containing cell surface glycoconjugates, a process that has been correlated with altered cellular adhesion, differentiation, and survival (9,10). The interaction of galectin 3 with T cells induces antiapoptotic activity, a phenomenon often correlated with a prolonged inflammatory response (15). Recently, it was shown that galectin 3 selectively promoted the secretion of mononuclear cell–specific chemokines from synovial, but not skin, fibroblasts in Rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that galectin 3 can amplify joint inflammation (16). Reduced arthritis in galectin 3–/– mice was accompanied by a significant decrease in circulating methylated bovine serum albumin-specific antibodies, the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, and interleukin-17–producing T cells. Taken together, we provide evidence that galectin 3 plays a pathogenic role in development and progression of antigen-induced arthritis and that disease severity was accompanied by alterations in the levels of antigen-specific IgG, the systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, and the frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells. On day 28, mice were killed for joint histologic examination and analysis of cellular as well as humoral responses. The extent of synovitis was graded on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 3, where 0 no signs of inflammation; 1 mild synovial hypertrophy in up to 5 cell layers; 2 moderate inflammation characterized by hyperplasia of synovial membrane in up to 10 cell layers and influx of inflammatory cells throughout the synovial tissue; and 3 marked synovial hypertrophy in 10 cell layers, with synovial tissue infiltrated by inflammatory cells. Spleen and lymph nodes (popliteal, inguinal, axillary) were pressed through 70- m cell strainers, incubated with ACK lysis buffer (0.15M NH Cl, 10 mM 4 KHCO , 0.1 mM Na EDTA) for 5 minutes to lyse red blood 32 cells, washed, and suspended in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 g/ml gentamicin. Cells were seeded onto duplicate 96-well tissue culture plates at 2 106 cells/ml and incubated in the presence and absence of 50 g/ml methylated bovine serum albumin or 1.25 g/ml concanavalin A for 48 hours. From 1 plate, cell-free supernatants were collected after 48 hours and stored at –20°C for cytokine determinations. On the duplicate plate, cells were pulsed with 0.5 Ci 3H-thymidine (Amersham-Buchler) for the last 6 hours of culture. Thereafter, cells were harvested onto 96-well glass fiber filters (Packard Bioscience), and 3Hthymidine incorporation was measured with a scintillation counter (Top-Count; Packard Bioscience). Intracellular staining of FoxP3 was performed using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse/rat FoxP3 (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Treg cells were defined as cells positive for CD4, CD25, and FoxP3. The frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells in the spleen was analyzed with a mouse interleukin-17 Enzyme-linked immunospot kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to relate the number of interleukin-17 spots to the frequency of CD3 cells in the spleen, the Enzyme-linked immunospot data were combined with the flow cytometry data from the CD3 spleen cells, and the data are presented as the number of interleukin-17 spots per 105 CD3 cells. interleukin-17 and interferon- in supernatants from cultured lymph node cells were measured by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As expected, by day 28, all Wild-type mice mice had developed severe arthritis in the immunized knee joint, as revealed by massive cellular infiltration of the synovial membrane and joint erosion (Figures 2A and B). To determine whether galectin 3 deficiency modulates the production of interferon- and interleukin-17 locally, lymph node cells obtained from Wild-type mice or galectin 3–deficient mice were stimulated with methylated bovine serum albumin, and the proliferative response and culture supernatants were analyzed. We found no differences between galectin 3–/– and Wild-type mice mice in the levels of interferon- from lymph node cell culture supernatants (Figure 4A), indicating that the Th1 response is of minor importance in the galectin 3–mediated proinflammatory effects in antigen-induced arthritis. However, although no statistically significant differences in the levels of secreted interleukin-17 from cultured lymph node cells could be detected, there was a clear tendency toward lower levels of interleukin-17 in the cultured lymph node cell supernatants from vehicle-treated galectin 3–/– mice than in those from Wild-type mice mice (Figure 4B). We further investigated whether galectin 3 modulates interleukin-17–producing cells systemically in antigen-induced arthritis by measuring the functionally active interleukin-17–producing splenocytes using the Enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Cells were stimulated antigen specifically (with methylated bovine serum albumin) or polyclonally (with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin) for 42 hours, and the number of interleukin-17– producing cells was determined by counting the spots. In order to relate the number of interleukin-17 spots to the frequency of CD3 cells in the spleen, the Enzyme-linked immunospot data were combined with the flow cytometry data for the CD3 spleen cells, and the data are presented as the number of interleukin-17 spots per 105 CD3 cells. On the day of termination, flow cytometry data for the CD3 spleen cells from Wild-type mice mice, vehicletreated galectin 3–/– mice, and galectin 3–/– mice treated with exogenous galectin 3 showed no significant differences in either frequency or absolute number (data not shown). Antigen-specific stimulation resulted in a significantly lower frequency of interleukin-17–producing T cells in galectin 3–/– mice than in Wild-type mice mice (Figure 5A). Supernatants of lymph node cells from wild-type (Wild-type mice) mice treated with vehicle, galectin 3–/– (galectin 3–/–) mice treated with vehicle, and galectin 3–/– mice treated with exogenous galectin 3 were collected after in vitro stimulation with methylated bovine serum albumin for 48 hours. In B, lymph node cells from 5 Wild-type mice mice were used due to the limited number of lymph node cells obtained from other mice in that group. toward an increased frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells; however, the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 5A). Polyclonal stimulation of splenocytes with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin also resulted in  significantly lower frequencies of interleukin-17–producing T cells in vehicle-treated galectin 3–/– mice than in both Wild-type mice mice and galectin 3–/– mice treated with exogenous galectin 3 (Figure 5B). In contrast to interleukin-17–producing cells, the total number of Treg cells in Wild-type mice mouse spleen did not differ significantly from that in galectin 3–/– mouse spleen (Figure 6). Reduced frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells in galectin 3–/– (galectin 3–/–) mice. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay was used to quantify the number of interleukin-17–producing cells among the population of CD3 cells in the spleen from wild-type (Wild-type mice) mice treated with vehicle, galectin 3–/– mice treated with vehicle, and galectin 3–/– mice treated with exogenous galectin 3.

Spleen cells derived from wild-type (Wild-type mice) mice treated with vehicle, galectin 3–/– mice treated with vehicle, and galectin 3–/– mice treated with exogenous galectin 3 were stained with peridinin chlorophyll A protein–conjugated anti-CD4 and fluorescein isothiocyanate– conjugated anti-CD25, followed by fixation, permeabilization, and intracellular staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse/rat FoxP3. Data are presented as the number of Treg cells positive for CD4, CD25, and FoxP3. mice is accompanied by lower frequencies of functionally active interleukin-17–producing T cells in the spleen. DISCUSSION Galectins have been shown to affect the function of immune cells and to regulate the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases (7,10). Since addition of exogenous galectin 3 will restore galectin 3 only temporarily to local environments and particularly to the extracellular, but not the intracellular, environment, the observation that galectin 3 could enhance disease severity suggests that functions exerted by galectin 3 in the extracellular environment promote disease. The inability of galectin 3 to fully restore disease to levels in Wild-type mice mice may be due to a number of factors, such as the involvement of intracellular galectin 3 in addition to extracellular galectin 3 or insufficient concentrations in the joint or other sites of importance for driving the inflammation. Our study clearly demonstrates that galectin 3 plays a crucial role in arthritis development by aggravating the severity of antigen-induced arthritis, and the data on proinflamma-  tory cytokines, the frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells, and the antigen-specific antibody response support the notion of a proinflammatory effect of galectin 3 in this context. However, it is currently not possible to do more than speculate about the underlying mechanisms leading to the effects of galectin 3; multiple pathways are probably involved, since galectin 3 has the ability to interact with and modulate the functions of a number of targets, immune and nonimmune cells, both extracellularly and intracellularly. Galectin 3 may thus directly induce one or several of the humoral and cellular responses we measured that may be the direct driving forces in the inflammatory process, but the altered proinflammatory responses we observed upon galectin 3 deficiency could also be mere consequences of a reduced arthritis initiated and regulated by other mechanisms. With this in mind, we speculate that one possible mechanism in the galectin 3–mediated arthritispromoting effect is the ability of galectin 3 to upregulate the frequency of interleukin-17–producing cells during inflammation. Recent discovery of the novel pathogenic interleukin-17–producing T cell population (Th17 cells) strongly suggests that these cells are far more efficient at inducing autoimmune inflammation in mice than are classic interferon- -producing Th1 cells (29,30). Activation of these cells can drive an inflammatory process that is distinct from the classic Th1 and Th2 responses (29). In addition to Th17 cells, interleukin-17 is also produced by / T cells (31). We also found a tendency toward decreased secretion of interleukin-17, but not interferon- , in supernatants from cultured lymph node cells of galectin 3–/– mice compared with Wild-type mice mice. An elevated level of interleukin-17–producing cells (and subsequently of interleukin-17), as seen in the Wild-type mice mice, may lead to increased production of proinflammatory mediators from cells present in the joint, including synovial fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, and chondrocytes, which results in cartilage damage and bone erosion, as described earlier (21,38). Another hypothetical mechanism for mediating the proinflammatory activity of galectin 3 is the direct targeting by galectin 3 of synovial fibroblasts and neutrophils locally in the joints; these are important cells involved in amplifying the local inflammation and joint damage. It has been shown that upon galectin 3 stimulation, isolated synovial fibroblasts from Rheumatoid arthritis patients could secrete proinflammatory and mononuclear cell– recruiting chemokines, suggesting an important role for galectin 3 in promoting mononuclear cell infiltration in the joints (16). This might partly explain the significantly lower cell infiltration in joints that was observed in galectin 3–/– mice in our study. Decreased infiltration of cells in the joints may also be a consequence of reduced interleukin-17 production, since interleukin-17 plays an essential role in mediating neutrophil migration during inflammation through chemokine release, in addition to a direct role in joint destruction (39). Hence, we conclude that galectin 3 plays a pathogenic role in the development and progression of antigen-induced arthritis and that disease severity is accompanied by alterations in the levels of antigen-specific IgG, the systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, and the frequency of interleukin-17–producing T cells.

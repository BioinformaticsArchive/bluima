18300000	2008  Abstract The myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system of lower vertebrate species, in particular those of fish, profoundly differ from their mammalian counterparts in their biochemical phenotype in that they express Po-like glycoproteins as major myelin protein constituents instead of proteolipid protein, while in their overall cellular structure and their cell lineage relationships, they closely resemble mammalian oligodendrocytes. While molecular biology in the past has allowed to appropriately classify the major myelin proteins synthesized by fish oligodendrocytes, heterologous expression studies are expected to give a deeper insight into the particular features and the conserved functions of these proteins required for myelin formation and maintenance in fish. It is hoped that this approach will also help to improve our understanding of the molecular processes underlying the unique capacity of fish oligodendrocytes for remyelination after injury in the central nervous system. It is formed by two highly specialized types of glial cells: oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, G. which send out multiple cell processes to ensheath a multitude of axons in their vicinity, and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system that each individually enwrap only a single myelin segment (Raine 1977; Sherman and Brophy 2005). The highly specialized cellular function of oligodendrocytes is reflected on a molecular level by a unique set of adhesive proteins, which are specific to these cells and their myelin membrane extensions and not found elsewhere. myelin basic proteins are synthesized on free polyribosomes, and their mRNAs are transported out into the cell processes for subsequent translation (Colman et al. 1982; Ainger et al. 1993; Gould et al. 2000). These are thought to effect membrane fusion at the extracellular side (Boison et al. 1995), although the underlying molecular mechanism still is not well understood. More recently, proteolipid protein was proposed to be involved in signal transduction in oligodendrocytes via interaction with integrin receptors (Gudz et al. 2002). CNPase is a lipid-anchored membrane-surface component that is confined to oligodendrocytes and to noncompact cytoplasm-containing regions of the myelin sheath (Braun et al. 1988). It has a high binding affinity for cytoskeleton proteins and was recently shown to influence branching and process formation of oligodendrocytes (Lee et al. 2005), probably by mediating microtubule membrane interactions (Bifulco et al. 2002).The two known isoforms of mammalian CNPases, CNP1 and CNP2, differ only in the amino terminus and arise by alternative splicing and promoter usage. Although the splitting of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides is commonly used to monitor CNPase activity in oligodendrocytes and brain tissue, the natural substrate has not yet been identified (Sprinkle 1989). Myelin-associated glycoprotein possesses five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains linked to a single transmembrane segment and is restricted to the periaxonal membrane spaces of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system myelin fibers (for review, see Quarles 2007). It is expressed as two developmentally regulated isoforms with different cytoplasmic domains that may activate different signal transduction pathways in myelin-forming cells (Umemori et al. 1994). Sequence homology towards mammalian Po is greatest in the extracellular domain which contains a single immunoglobulin-like domain stabilized by a single disulfide bond (Lemke and Axel 1985; Saavedra et al. 1989; Stratmann and Jeserich 1995). A computer-generated structural model of the extracellular domain of trout IP1/IP2 reveals a typical antiparallel β-fold structure consisting of ten β-strands arranged as two β-sheets, closely resembling the structure determined for rat Po by X-ray crystallography (Shapiro et al. 1996). From the crystallographic data, it was deduced that the extracellular domains of rat Po form tetrameric complexes that interact with those of the opposing membrane in a zipper-like fashion. Thereby the larger isoform (IP2) occurs during early steps of oligodendroglial differentiation, while the shorter appears significantly later, probably coinciding with compaction of the myelin sheath (Jeserich 1983, see also below). The expression of Po-like proteins by glial cells in the central nervous system has prompted investigations on the promoter region of the trout IP gene. It is interesting to note in this context that the mouse proteolipid protein promoter is able to drive green fluorescent protein expression in zebrafish oligodendrocytes (Yoshida and Macklin 2005). The proteolipid protein–Po shift resulted in reduced myelin internode length, degeneration of myelinated axons, and severe neurological disability, suggesting a neuroprotective function of proteolipid protein to myelin-forming glia. In the 3′-untranslated sequence of zebrafish MBP, a consensus sequence for mRNA transportation into cellular processes was detected (Brösamle and Halpern 2002). However, the secondary structures required to localize the mRNA to cellular processes was missing (Ainger et al. 1997). For shark, it was demonstrated that MBP mRNA is not transported out into the cell processes (Smith et al. 2001), indicating that this way of MBP targeting may have evolved later. Hydrophobicity analysis did not identify a transmembrane segment, being consistent with earlier immunohistochemical studies that had suggested a cytoplasmic localization of the protein in freshly isolated oligodendrocytes (Jeserich et al. 1990). By in situ hybridization, it was shown that the human 36K homologue is expressed in oligodendrocytes as well as in neurons in the adult human cortex (Morris et al. 2004). In the mature fish, brain tissue expression of the 36K transcript is restricted to oligodendrocyte cell bodies in myelinated fiber tracts, closely matching the pattern of distribution found by immunocytochemical staining of the corresponding protein, while Schwann cells of peripheral nerves are negative. The Case of Myelin-associated glycoprotein  The myelin-associated glycoprotein has attracted particular interest in recent years, since it is not found in compact myelin but resides in periaxonal Schwann cell and oligodendroglial membranes and hence was believed to be critically involved in early axo–glial interactions preceding myelin formation. It appears to function both as a ligand for an axonal receptor that is needed for the maintenance of myelinated axons and as a receptor for an axonal signal that promotes the differentiation, maintenance, and survival of oligodendrocytes (for review, see Quarles 2007). Since fish myelin, in contrast to mammalian myelin, does not inhibit neuronal growth, and this difference has been addressed to myelin composition (Schweitzer et al. 2003), the occurrence of a Myelin-associated glycoprotein homologue in the central nervous system of fish has long been doubted. Localization of these proteins to oligodendrocytes and/or myelin membranes in the fish central nervous system, however, has not yet been confirmed. Expression of this protein was upregulated in regenerating retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve injury, and hence, it was called regeneration-induced CNPase homolog (for regeneration-induced CNPase homolog). Properties of Fish Oligodendrocytes  Despite their close biochemical similarity with mammalian Schwann cells, myelin-forming glia in the central nervous system of fish exhibit all structural characteristics of oligodendrocytes, in that they send out multiple processes to ensheath axons in their vicinity (Jeserich and Waehneldt 1986). Furthermore, their cell lineage relationship closely resembles those of their mammalian counterpart in that they are generated from a population of A2B5+ precursor cells of typical bipolar morphology as shown for trout and goldfish (Sivron et al. 1990; Jeserich and Stratmann 1992), while in the immature shark brain, oligodendroglial progenitor cells could be visualized with the O4 antibody (Gould et al. 1995). Furthermore, in the zebrafish brain developing  oligodendrocytes express the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor olig2 that is known to regulate transcription of the major myelin-specific genes in the mammalian brain (Zhou et al. 2000). Loss of olig2 function prevents oligodendrocyte development, whereas olig2 overexpression promotes formation of excess oligodendrocytes in the zebrafish brain (Park et al. 2002). In fish similar as in mammals, oligodendroglial progenitor cells express voltage-gated sodium currents, which are continuously down-regulated as cell differentiation proceeds (Sontheimer et al. 1989; Glassmeier and Jeserich 1995). Adult oligodendrocytes, by contrast, exhibit voltagegated potassium outward currents alone (Soliven et al. 1988; Glassmeier et al. 1992). Recently, a Shaker-related potassium channel was identified by single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in trout oligodendrocytes (Nguyen and Jeserich 1998) that is homologous to mammalian Kv1.2. According to studies on mammalian oligodendrocytes, voltage-gated potassium channels are functionally involved in the regulation of cell proliferation (Vautier et al. 2004). Studies on the biochemical differentiation of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system of trout revealed a highly coordinated and sequential expression of myelin proteins during brain development (Jeserich et al. 1990): as shown by a series of double-labeling experiments, it was documented that glycoprotein IP2 together with galactocerebroside are the earliest myelin markers to appear during oligodendroglial differentiation being followed by the occurrence of 36K and finally glycoprotein IP1 shortly after hatching from the egg. Under cell culture conditions, mature oligodendrocytes of fish, unlike their mammalian counterparts, undergo partial dedifferentiation, in that expression of differentiation markers such as galactocerebroside, IP1, and 36K are down-regulated during the first week in vitro (Jeserich and Rauen 1990), closely resembling the in vitro behavior of mammalian Schwann cells. A most notable feature of fish oligodendrocytes is their high capacity for remyelination after nerve injury. Thereby, it was shown that the expression Po mRNA is significantly upregulated by glial cells in the visual pathway and in spinal white matter tracts after a lesion, suggesting a role for this protein in promoting axonal regrowth and remyelination in the fish central nervous system (Schweitzer et al. 2003). Heterologous Expression Studies and Intracellular Trafficking  For studying the functional properties, the intracellular sorting, and trafficking of myelin proteins, heterologous expression studies provide a powerful instrument that allows to analyze the dynamics and regulation of protein transport in the living cell. By the application of fusion proteins carrying different fluorophores, the expression patterns and intracellular pathways of various myelin compounds can be simultaneously monitored within the same cell and comparatively analyzed under various experimental conditions. A variety of eucaryotic cell lines has been used for this purpose including HEK-cells, HeLacells, insect oocytes (e.g. Sf21), as well as oligodendroglial cell lines at various stages of cellular differentiation (OLN-93, Oli-neu). Sorting and Trafficking of proteolipid protein  Although the biochemical differentiation of oligodendrocytes in principle can occur in the entire absence of neurons, balancing of suitable expression levels and proper membrane targeting of myelin proteins clearly require appropriate neuronal signals. In particular, in the case of proteolipid protein, membrane surface expression seems to be highly dependent on the presence of neuronal signals such as axonal contact. If cells are cultured in the absence of neurons, proteolipid protein is internalized and stored in late endosomes/lysosomes via a cholesterol-dependent endocytosis pathway. In the Oli-neu cell line, which normally expresses only minimal amounts of proteolipid protein, cell surface expression of this myelin protein is increased in the presence of neurons in neuron-conditioned medium. In OLN-93 cells, the rate of proteolipid protein endocytosis is reduced, and transport from late endosomes/lysosomes to the plasma membrane is triggered after receiving signals from neurons (Simons and Trajkovic 2006; Trajkovic et al. 2006), emphasizing that recycling endosomes play a central role in protein sorting and trafficking in oligodendrocytes. Adhesive Properties of Po  Using stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as an experimental paradigm, Po was initially shown to act as a homophilic adhesion molecule (D'Urso et al. 1990; Filbin et al. 1990). In the extracellular domain, the two cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond that stabilizes the antiparallel β-fold structure and the sequence surrounding the glycosylation site thereby proved as indispensable for Po-mediated cell adhesion. Corresponding studies using constructs with progressive truncations of the cytosplasmic  domain implied a pivotal role of this region for cell adhesion as well (Wong and Filbin 1994, 1996). The intracellular domain of Po contains a high proportion of positive charges and hence may interact with acidic head groups of membrane lipids as well as with cytoskeletal structures which could induce clustering of Po at focal points of adhesion. By a similar approach, using trout IP1 and an IP1/ Po chimeric protein combining the extracellular domain of trout IP1 with the cytoplasmic portion of rat Po, the adhesive properties of the fish Po-like protein was studied (Lanwert and Jeserich 2001). As revealed by immunocytochemistry, transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in both cases showed a characteristic membrane-surface labeling. By an in vitro cell aggregation assay, IP1 transfected cells were only weakly adhesive, while the IP1/Po construct induced a much higher degree of cell aggregation, being well compatible with the short cytoplasmic tail of trout IP1, lacking the protein kinase C phosphorylation site. In a subsequent study using stably transfected HeLa cells, Xu et al. (2001) noted that a truncation of the C-terminal 13 amino acids of mammalian P0 was uncritical, while after removal of 28 amino acids, the adhesive properties are lost, allowing to delineate more closely a functionally critical subregion that contains a conserved proteinkinase Cα phosphorylation site. The observation that cell adhesion was abolished after treatment with the PKCα inhibitor calphostin C further emphasizes the functional relevance of this site (Xu et al. 2001). Studies performed with an immortalized rat Schwann cell line transfected with a Po-EGFP fusion protein revealed that the cytoplasmic domain was critically involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking of Po (Konde and Eichberg 2006), linking the failure of cell adhesion with an impaired transport to the plasma membrane. While wild-type Po was rapidly translocated to the cell surface, a point mutation of serine 204 residing close to the protein kinase C phosphorylation site to alanine led to retention of the fusion protein in the cytoplasm, suggesting that phosphorylation could be essential for proper cytoskeletal interactions during trafficking. Subcellular Localization and Targeting of MBP  Heterologous expression studies with various isoforms of mammalian MBP revealed that, in Shiverer-mouse oligo-  dendrocytes lacking endogenous MBP (Allinquant et al. 1991) as well as in HeLa cells (Staugaitis et al. 1990), only splice variants without exon II were localized to the plasma membrane, while the minor isoforms of 21.5 17 kDa molecular weight which both contain exon II are transported to the cell nucleus instead, suggesting that this exon contains a nuclear localization sequence. Since the minor isoforms have been observed in the nuclei of oligodendrocytes in the developing mouse brain (Allinquant et al. 1991; Hardy et al. 1996; Staugaitis et al. 1996), too, and are highly expressed only during early stages of oligodendroglial maturation (Barbarese et al. 1978; Jordan et al. 1989), a functional role in the transcriptional regulation was suggested for these proteins (Pedraza et al. 1997). Furthermore, myelin basic proteins seem to have a morphogenetic function during later stage of glial maturation that is probably mediated via an interaction with the cytoskeleton, in particular with microtubules (Galiano et al. 2006). Co-expression of Fish Myelin Proteins  To study potential mutual interactions between myelin proteins of fish during intracellular trafficking, we initiated a series of co-localization experiments by applying Sf21  Figure 1 Sf21 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses containing C-terminal DsRed or EGFP fusion constructs of trout myelin proteins examined by confocal microscopy 48 h post infection. d Co-expression of MBPl-DsRed combined with IP1-EGFP  insect oocytes as host cells that were doubly infected with recombinant baculoviruses containing different myelin proteins. In the case of myelin basic proteins/MBPl co-expression, an overlapping intracellular distribution pattern was revealed: during early phases (10 h post infection), both proteins were largely confined to the cell nucleus, with a most prominent labeling in the nucleolus (Fig. 1). After 48 h, both MBP isoforms were additionally found in the cell periphery close to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1a). In control cells infected with EGFP or DsRed alone, a homogenous labeling throughout the cells was encountered instead. Subsequently, cells were harvested, and subcellular fractions were subjected to Western blot analyses using antibodies recognizing trout MBP (Fig. 2). After double infection with 36K and MBP containing baculoviruses, 36K showed a lumpy distribution in the cytoplasm with no obvious accumulation in the plasma membrane, while the pattern of MBP was largely unaltered, except that in some cases the membrane labeling appeared  Figure 2 Subcellular fractions of Sf21 cells infected with trout myelin basic proteins-EGFP (lanes 2–5) and non-infected control cells (lanes 6–9) examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses using rabbit anti-trout MBP antibodies [diluted 1:1,000 in dry milk powder dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline] in combination with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (diluted 1:2,000).

In Sf21 cells co-expressing IP1 and 36K, membrane labeling of IP1 was abolished. Under these  Figure 3 Confocal images of HEK-293 cells transfected for 48 h with either a myelin basic proteins-DsRed monomer fusion construct (a), a 36K-AcGFP fusion construct (b), or a IP1-AcGFP fusion construct (c). In each case, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and subsequently stained with either wheat germ agglutinin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (a) or WGATRITC (b, c) for visualizing the plasma membrane  conditions, the myelin glycoprotein was accumulated in large ovoid particles scattered throughout the cytoplasm, while 36K still exhibited a lumpy cytoplasmic labeling that did not overlap with the fluorescence pattern of IP1 within the same cell. For comparison, heterologous expression of trout myelin proteins was performed in HEK-293 cells that were transfected with various AcGFP or DsRed monomer fusion constructs and subsequently stained with wheat germ agglutinin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate or wheat germ agglutinin-fluorescein isothiocyanate to visualize the plasma membrane. In these cells, nuclear labeling by MBP-DsRed monomer was not observed, the fluorescence being homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm instead (Fig. 3a). In 36K-AcGFP-transfected HEK-293 cells, a lumpy staining of the cytoplasm was observed resembling those found in Sf21 cells (Fig. 3b). In regions where neighboring cells were in close contact, 36K exhibited a most prominent membrane labeling that was obviously co-localizing with wheat germ agglutinin. In the case of IP1-AcGFP, a granular intracellular labeling pattern was observed that did not extend into the cell surface (Fig. 3c), suggesting retention of the protein in the endomembrane compartment. As a whole, characteristic distribution patterns for each of the trout myelin proteins were revealed in both cell types under study. In some cases, the intracellular trafficking was significantly modified by the co-expressed protein component. The striking divergence of MBP localization in Sf21  cells versus HEK-293 cells on the other hand points to intrinsic mechanisms of the host cell that may affect intracellular targeting of myelin proteins. To focus on regulatory mechanisms operating in myelin-forming cells, experiments are presently underway to characterize heterologous expression of trout myelin proteins in an oligodendroglial cell line (OLN-93) which is expected to provide a more natural cellular environment (Richter-Landsberg and Heinrich 1996).

19626000	The GABAB receptor and relevance to schizophrenia GABAB receptor–mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are coupled through G proteins to postsynaptic neuronal potassium channels to induce slow synaptic inhibition by increasing potassium permeability in the postsynaptic neuron.12 Neuroanatomical evidence for GABA deficits Benes et al.13 first demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have morphologic changes in cortical and hippocampal GABA interneurons. They demonstrated a decreased density of nonpyramidal cells (i.e., GABAergic interneurons) in anterior cingulate layers II–VI and in the prefrontal cortex layer II in patients with schizophrenia. It was estimated that patients with schizoaffective disorder show a 30% reduction in nonpyramidal cells, whereas in patients with schizophrenia the reduction is 16%. Freedman et al.16 concluded that P50 suppression occurs through cholinergic activation by the conditioning stimulus, potentiating GABAB receptor–mediated inhibitory neurotransmission to attenuate pyramidal neuron firing. Transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation capitalizes on the ability of time-varying magnetic fields to produce neuronal activity in accordance with the principle of electromagnetic induction. If the interval between these pulses is 1–5 ms, inhibitory interneurons are  Glutamate  NMDA+ nAChR + +A  D  B F Choline B GABA Pyramidal neuron  C E 500 μV  00.23 00.24 00.25 00.26 00.27 00.28 00.29 00.30 00.31 00.32 00.33  Figure 3 Proposed neurophysiological effects of nicotine, electroconvulsive therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on pyramidal and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cortex. Smoking may potentiate the GABA receptor to suppress pyramidal neuron firing B by stimulating nAChR (A). Electrical stimulation of the cortex (e.g., through electroconvulsive therapy) activates pyramidal neurons at the cell body (B). electroconvulsive therapy may result in repetitive stimulation of the pyramidal neurons to produce seizure generalization with the concomitant spike-and-wave complex recorded by electroencephalography (C). Whereas the spike discharge is related to synchronized pyramidal discharge in the cortex, the wave that follows is related to activation of recurrent collateral neurons that, in turn, activate GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (D) that may terminate the seizure and are followed by postictal electroencephalography suppression (E). repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been previously shown to activate pyramidal neurons transsynaptically (F) and may potentiate inhibition in the cortex by activating GABAergic interneurons directly (F) or indirectly (D). Smoking is posited to stimulate nicotinic cholinergic receptors, resulting in an excitatory cascade that leads to activation of postsynaptic GABAB receptor–mediated pathways and, finally, suppression of pyramidal neuron firing (Figure 3a). Electrical stimulation of the cortex has previously been shown to activate pyramidal neurons at the cell body (Figure 3b).30 electroconvulsive therapy results in repetitive stimulation of the pyramidal neurons, with generalization of seizure spread and the characteristic spike-and-wave complex recorded by electroencephalography (Figure 3c). Whereas the spike discharge is characteristic of synchronized pyramidal discharge in the cortex, the wave that follows was shown to be related to activation of recurrent collateral neurons and GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (Figure 3d), culminating in eventual seizure termination and postictal electroencephalography suppression (Figure 3e). By contrast, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has previously been shown to activate pyramidal neurons transsynaptically (Figure 3f),30 with direct activation of GABAergic interneurons, translating into potentiation of GABAB receptor–mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. Clozapine inhibits synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses established by ventral tegmental area neurones in culture.

Videotape provides an alternative method of patient instruction and can be used to visually reinforce information provided to patients and to assist them in performing self-help concepts (Krouse et al. 2001; Krouse 2001; Gagliano 1998). 24/27 88.9 28/31 90.3 What are symptoms of a low red cell count? The video group demonstrated trends towards higher recall in mouth problems to report straight away to the treatment centre (87% vs. 78%, P = 0.45), symptoms of a low red cell count (80.6% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.29), prevention of constipation (74.2% vs. 51.7% P = 0.07); however, there was no statistical difference between the groups.

Better recall was observed concerning mouth problems to report straight away to the treatment centre, symptoms of a low red cell count and prevention of constipation, all commonly experienced side effects and areas of concern. Reporting of medical problems is supportive of the desired communication between the patient and the treatment centre demonstrated in the video and supportive of the use of the video in influencing patient behaviour (Gagliano 1998; Krouse 2001).

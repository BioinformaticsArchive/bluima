21330000	Microbes in 50 ml of groundwater were collected by a polycarbonate filter with a 0.22-μm pore size, and DNA was extracted from the cells using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (Q-BIO gene, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. aquifer (50 ml) were filtered with a 0.2 μm filter to collect microbial cells, from which DNA was extracted with a FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (Q-BIO gene, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The pore sizes in the clay were very small, and most of the pores had sizes of less than 1 μm, which is in the same range as the size of a bacterial cell. Molecular and cellular fundamentals of aerobic cometabolism of trichloroethylene.

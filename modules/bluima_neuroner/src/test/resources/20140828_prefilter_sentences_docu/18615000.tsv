This association is due to a unique peripheral blood CD28 ) T cell population which lack CD28 (CD28 ) CD28 T cells). Here we found that this patient population has a significant age-dependent increase of CD28 ) CD28 T cells that comprise over half of the circulating CD28 T cells in some. Patients over 50 years of age have a 50-fold higher percentage of CD28 ) CD28 T cells compared to seronegative patients and a 5-fold higher percentage when compared to seropositive healthy controls. Stimulation by cytomegalovirus-antigen or by polyclonal stimulation using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin showed that CD28 ) CD28 cells in patients with end stage renal disease degranulated and secreted interferon c thus indicating that they are cytolytic. published online 9 July 2008 KEYWORDS: cytomegalovirus; end-stage renal disease; CD28 ) T cell; CD28; atherosclerosis  Correspondence: Michiel G.H. In addition, analysis of the T-cell subsets in patients with chronic kidney disease indicated that numbers of cytomegalovirus-specific T cells increased as the stage of renal failure progressed.5 cytomegalovirus infection is unique as it leaves a clear footprint in the T-cell repertoire. It has been estimated that on average, as high as 10% of the circulating CD28-positive T cells (CD4-positive T cells) are cytomegalovirus-specific in the latent situation.6 The phenotype of CD28-positive cytomegalovirus-specific T cells is interesting with respect to atherosclerosis, as cytomegalovirus infection increases the frequency of circulating CD28-positive CD28negative (CD4posCD28null) T cells.7–9 The circulating CD4posCD28null T-cell subset is enriched in the blood of patients with acute coronary syndromes and typically produces high levels of interferon-γ.10 Plaque-infiltrating CD28 T cells, which are associated with plaque vulnerability for rupture, are likely recruited from this circulating CD4posCD28null T-cell subset.11 Apoptotic death of smooth muscle cells may be a mechanism of plaque destabilization, transforming stable plaques into ruptureprone lesions. Recently, it has been shown that CD4pos CD28null plaque-infiltrating T cells can indeed directly kill endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells by a T-cell receptor-independent mechanism.12 These findings have given experimental support for the pathogenetic role of this specific T-cell subset in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization. We hypothesized that the CD4posCD28null T-cell population is increased in patients with end-stage renal disease compared with healthy controls, thereby imposing a risk for plaque rupture. Therefore, we quantified the circulating CD4posCD28null T cells and analyzed their phenotype, expression of cytolytic molecules, and degranulation capacity. The results show that the presence of circulating CD4posCD28null T cells is unique for cytomegalovirus-seropositive healthy individuals and end-stage renal disease patients. However, elderly patients with end-stage renal disease have a massively expanded population of circulating cytolytic CD4posCD28null T cells. RESULTS CD4posCD28null T cells are greatly expanded in cytomegalovirus-seropositive end-stage renal disease patients In accordance with previous studies,5 the end-stage renal disease patients showed a lower number of CD28-positive T cells compared with healthy individuals (381  106/l versus 691  106/l, P<0.01). The frequency of the CD4posCD28null T cells was evidently associated with cytomegalovirus infection. These cells were rarely observed (median frequency of 0.2% of the total CD4-positive T cells) in cytomegalovirus-seronegative individuals (Figure 1). The frequency and absolute number of CD4posCD28null T cells increased with age in cytomegalovirus-seropositive individuals (Figure 2a and b). However, these cells were greatly expanded in cytomegalovirus-seropositive end-stage renal disease patients, and comprised in some individuals up to 65% of the total CD4pos T-cell population. The expansion of the CD4posCD28null T-cell population was most evident in cytomegalovirus-seropositive end-stage renal disease patients over 50 years of age. Compared to age-matched seronegative end-stage renal disease patients, they had on average a 50 times increased percentage of CD4posCD28null T cells. Compared to elderly CMVseropositive healthy controls, these patients had on average a five times increased percentage (3 versus 15% of total CD4-positive T cells) and an almost fourfold increased absolute number of CD4posCD28null T cells (61  106/l versus 16  106/l, P<0.05). The expansion of CD4posCD28null T cells differed substantially among end-stage renal disease patients. However, except for age, no other demographic characteristics or clinical characteristics (listed in Table 1), for example type of renal replacement therapy or diabetes, were associated with the number of CD4posCD28null T cells.

CD4posCD28null T cells are CCR7-negative and effector memory cells The expression of the CD28 molecule on the cell surface of CD4-positive T cells yields a clear distinction between a CD28pos and CD28null population (Figure 4a). The circulating T cells can be subdivided into naive T cells and memory T cells by differential expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and CD285RO.

More than 97% of the CD4posCD28null T cells were CCR7 negative, with the majority of the cells (on average 75%) expressing CD285RO, and thus classified as classical effector memory T cells (Figure 4c and d). CD4posCD28null T cells without expression of CD285RO were observed only in cytomegalovirus-seropositive individuals, similar to the previously reported CD285RO-negative, cytomegalovirus-specific, CD8-positive effector T cells.13 Granzyme B- and perforin-positive CD4posCD28null T cells are significantly increased in end-stage renal disease patients Expression of the cytotoxic molecules granzyme B and perforin was limited to the CD4posCD28null T cells (Table 2). Specifically, the percentage of granzyme B-positive cells within the CD4posCD28null T-cell population was higher for end-stage renal disease patients compared with healthy individuals (65 versus 52%, P<0.01). Next, we calculated the total number of granzyme B- and perforin-positive CD4posCD28null T cells and the percentage of these cells in the total CD4pos T-cell population. A significantly increased percentage and total number of granzyme B- and percentage of perforinpositive CD4posCD28null T cells was observed in end-stage renal disease patients 50 years and older (Figure 5). CD4posCD28null T cells are functional as they degranulate and produce IFN-c after cytomegalovirus-antigen and polyclonal stimulation Upon stimulation with cytomegalovirus-antigen, the CD4posCD28null T cells degranulated, as shown by expression of membranebound CD107a, and produced interferon-γ. This was observed at a  Table 2 | Percentages of T cells with cytotoxic potential and effector function in the CD28+CD28null and the CD28+CD28+ subsets  CD28+CD28null T cells CD28+CD28+ T cells  end-stage renal disease patients Healthy controls P-value1 end-stage renal disease patients Healthy controls P-value2  Number 60 60 60 60 Granzyme Ba 65.1±3.8b 51.6±4.3 0.009 4.8±1.3 1.7±0.3 0.000 Perforina 7.8±1.3 P-value1 and P-value2 for the differences between data of CD28null T cells and CD28positive cells, respectively, comparing end-stage renal disease patients with healthy controls. aExpression determined using unstimulated Peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 90  CD285RO  + d CD28 CD28null distribution  70  0.001  50  CD28null (%)  30  CD28+  10 10 5 0  Tnaive Tcm Tem Open symbols: cytomegalovirus-seropositive healthy controls Closed symbols: cytomegalovirus-seropositive end-stage renal disease patients Figure 4 | CD28 expression within the different CD4pos T-cell subsets of a cytomegalovirus-seropositive individual. A representative example of the flow cytometric analysis of CD4-positive T cells for a cytomegalovirus-seropositive individual is shown in (a–c). Panel a shows a typical example of CD28 expression within CD28-positive peripheral blood T cells. The CD28pos (b) and CD28null (c) CD4pos T-cell subsets are further characterized by their expression of CD285RO and CCR7. Using these markers, the following T-cell subsets can be discriminated: naive T cells (Tnaive, CCR7 positive and CD285RO negative), central memory T cells (Tcm, CCR7 positive and CD285RO positive), and effector memory T cells (Tem, CCR7 negative and CD285RO positive). The overall distribution of CD4posCD28null T cells of end-stage renal disease patients (n = 70) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 66) is displayed in (d). significantly lower level in the CD4posCD28pos T cells (Table 2). After a strong polyclonal stimulus such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin, interferon-γ production was predominantly observed within the subset of CD4posCD28null T cells (Table 2). The percentages and number of CD4posCD28null T cells expressing CD107 and interferon-γ after cytomegalovirus (Figure 6) or polyclonal stimulation were significantly higher in elderly end-stage renal disease patients, compared with the age-matched healthy controls. It can be  used as a sensitive and specific method for identifying antigen-specific T cells.14 However, the percentage of CD4posCD28null T cells expressing CD154 after stimulation was always significantly lower (on average 50%) than the percentage of interferon-γ-positive cells (Table 2). This observation indicates that CD4posCD28null T cells have become largely independent of the CD280-CD280L co-stimulation pathway. DISCUSSION The CD4posCD28null circulating T-cell population has been associated with both atherosclerotic disease and cytomegalovirus infection.6–11,15 The results of this study show that CD4posCD28null T cells are rarely observed in CMVseronegative individuals, but may expand to as much as 65% of the total CD4pos T-cell population in elderly CMVseropositive end-stage renal disease patients. This expansion of CD4posCD28null T cells is in sharp contrast with the well-documented uremia and age-related lymphopenia of the CD4pos T-cell compartment.5,9 An age-related increased number of CMVspecific T cells has previously been reported in healthy adults, but only in the very elderly.9,16 The published clinical and experimental data suggest a role for CD4posCD28null T cells in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization,10–12 and in a previous study we found that cytomegalovirus infection was significantly and strongly associated with atherosclerotic disease in end-stage renal disease patients.4 Therefore, the data of the previous clinical study are not in contradiction with the current results, but further research is needed before it can be established that the expansion of CD28 ) CD28 T cells in cytomegalovirus-seropositive end-stage renal disease patients is truly associated with plaque rupture. The strong association between cytomegalovirus infection and the presence of CD4posCD28null T cells is in accordance with several previous reports.7–9 Most likely the large majority of CD4posCD28null T cells are cytomegalovirus-specific, as they emerge only after cytomegalovirus infection and proliferate in response to cytomegalovirus but not to other common antigens.7 However, it cannot be fully excluded that CD28 loss is induced on some T cells, which are not specific for cytomegalovirus peptides, due to cytokinemediated effects.17 Paradoxically, after cytomegalovirus-specific stimulation in vitro, only a minority of CD4posCD28null T cells respond by expression of interferon-γ, CD154, or CD107.

The cytotoxic potential of CD4posCD28null T cells was determined by intracellular staining of unstimulated Peripheral blood mononuclear cells with antibodies directed against granzyme B (and absolute numbers of CD4posCD28null T cells expressing CD107a) or perforin (b and d). many of these antigens, and by analysis of all open reading frames it has become evident that on average as high as 10% of all circulating CD4-positive T cells are in fact cytomegalovirus-specific.6 After a-specific polyclonal stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin, a much larger part of the CD4posCD28null T cells responded with interferon-γ production and degranulation, indicative of their high cytolytic capacity. Virtually all CD4posCD28null T cells lacked the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7. These phenotypical and functional properties make CD4posCD28null T cells very well suited for tissue invasion and subsequent destruction of target cells. In addition, similar to cytomegalovirus-specific CD8pos T cells, they may lose CD285RO expression.13 Therefore, the CD4posCD28null T cells have a striking similarity to classical cytolytic CD8 T cells, a situation that seems unique for cytomegalovirus infection. end-stage renal disease patients showed a significantly higher percentage of granzyme positivity and activation-induced degranulation within the CD4posCD28null T-cell population. As the  expression of granzyme in CD4pos cytomegalovirus-specific T cells increases with maturation,18 this finding indicates the emergence of more terminally differentiated cytolytic CD4posCD28null T cells in end-stage renal disease patients, which are fully functional. An important issue that arises from our data is the question of why the CD4posCD28null T-cell population is so expanded in elderly end-stage renal disease patients. Second, T cells specific for herpesviruses such as cytomegalovirus are partly interleukin-7 receptor negative21 and probably depend on frequent virus reactivation as one of the mechanisms to sustain the cytomegalovirus-specific T-cell population.

Flow cytometric analysis of CD28 expression within the different T-cell subsets To determine the percentages and amount of various T lymphocytes, we performed a whole-blood staining as described previously but with some minor adjustments.5 In addition, for each of these subsets, the percentage (and amount) of cells negative and positive for CD28 was determined. Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 35 ml of heparinized venous blood samples.25 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated pooled human serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) and stored at –80°C until further use. Before use, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quickly thawed in RPMI-1640 (GibcoBRL, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 20% heat-inactivated AB ) pooled human serum (standard culture medium) with DNase (0.1 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Finally, the cells were resuspended in standard culture medium at 4  106/ml. Following an overnight recovery, the percentage of viable cells was determined (always >80%) and the Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for the different assays. Cytotoxic potential Unstimulated Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2  106/ml) were analyzed for cytotoxic potential by staining the cell surface with peridinin chlorophyll protein-labelled anti-CD28 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-CD28. Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were subjected to intracellular staining with one of the following phycoerythrin-labelled antibodies directed against perforin (BD) or granzyme B (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Percentages of granzyme B- or perforin-positive cells were determined by analyzing the samples using the FACSCanto II (BD), selecting cells that have a typical lymphocyte scatter pattern, are CD28 positive, and either lack or express CD28. For this purpose, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with cytomegalovirus lysate (30 μg/ml; Microbix Biosystems Inc., Toronto, Canada) for 6 h, with the last 5 h in the presence of monensin (Golgistop, BD). As a control, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in standard culture medium alone or using a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml) (both from Sigma-Aldrich). Subsequently, CD107a surface expression was determined by staining the cells with peridinin chlorophyll protein-labelled anti-CD28, phycoerythrinlabelled anti-CD28, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled antiCD107a (BD Pharmingen, Erembodegem, Belgium) and analyzing the samples using the FACSCanto II in a similar way as described  before. Net antigen-specific frequencies of CD107a-expressing CD28 ) T cells were determined by correcting the signal induced by cytomegalovirus-antigen or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin for the background induced by standard culture medium alone. Intracellular cytokine staining The intracellular cytokine assay was performed as described recently in detail.27 Briefly, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2  106/ml) were stimulated with either cytomegalovirus lysate for 6 h, with the last 5 h in the presence of brefeldin A (Golgiplug, BD Pharmingen; 1 μl/106 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells). As a control, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with standard culture medium or with a mixture of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml). To analyze IFN-γproducing cells, the cell surface of Peripheral blood mononuclear cells was stained with peridinin chlorophyll protein-labelled anti-CD28 and phycoerythrin-labelled anti-CD28. Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-interferon-γ and allophycocyanin-labelled anti-CD154. Percentages of cytokine-positive cells were determined by analyzing the samples using the FACSCanto II (BD) as described above. To determine the net antigen-specific frequencies of interferon-γ-producing CD28 ) T cells, the signal induced by the antigen was corrected by subtracting the background induced by standard culture medium alone. The relation between clinical parameters and T-cell characteristics was analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. cytomegalovirus-specific CD28+ and CD8+ T cells dominate the memory compartments of exposed subjects. associated with the expansion of CD28+CD28 and CD8+CD28 T cells in rheumatoid arthritis.

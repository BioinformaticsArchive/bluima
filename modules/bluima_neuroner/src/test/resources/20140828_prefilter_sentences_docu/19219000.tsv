19219000	In a recent issue of Nature, Weavers et al. described a podocyte-like cell type in Drosophila, the nephrocyte, that closely resembles mammalian podocytes, including the nephrin-based slit diaphragm. e ltration slit is bridged by the slit diaphragm, a specialized cell junction that represents the only cell–cell contact of mature podocytes. Among these slit diaphragm proteins, Neph1, nephrin, podocin, and CD2AP have been shown to be indispensable for the maintenance of the architecture of podocytes—all these proteins participate in intracellular signaling networks to support cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and cell polarity.1 ey discovered that the fruit y Drosophila melanogaster possesses podocyte-like cells with remarkably conserved slit diaphragms. Given the long tradition of Drosophila research, these cells have, of course, not remained unnoticed before. Fly researchers have referred to them as Garland cells or `nephrocytes' because of their functional connection with the y's excretory system. erefore, nephrocytes have been used as a cellular model for endocytosis. In some of these publications, ultrastructural imaging reveals the existence of autocellular junctions that seal a labyrinth system of lacunae and tunnels within the nephrocytes.4 However, Duf or stones mutants fail to endocytose large dextrans, which was explained by the thickened basement membrane (Figure 1f ).2 Whereas the mammalian glomerular basement membrane is synthesized by podocytes and endothelial cells, nephrocytes seem to be the only source of basement membrane components. Blood is filtered into the urinary space (c), and hemolymph is filtered into extracellular lacunae (d). Skeletal muscle development in the y embryo involves the speci cation of 30 founder cells together with a population of fusion-competent cells. Each founder  456  cell seeds a distinct muscle.6 The nephrin counterparts Hibris and stones, on fusion-competent myoblasts, interact with the Neph1 orthologue Duf on founder cells to direct the cell-junction formation required for myoblast fusion.7,8 In addition, in the compound y eye, interactions between the Neph/nephrin proteins were shown to be required for establishing the correct number and spacing of secondary and tertiary pigment cells during the final steps of ommatidial patterning.9 Whereas in the eye and muscle, stones and Duf mediate  interactions between cells of different types through complementary expression patterns, nephrocytes express both molecules. In fact, the y nephrocyte and the vertebrate podocyte are the only cell types known so far to express both nephrin and Neph1 molecules, which highlights the importance of the nephrocyte as a model for podocyte biology. ese di erences mainly include issues with cell architecture and the connection with the excretory system. First, the slit diaphragms of the nephrocytes connect cell protrusions within the same cell and do not form junctions between cells. Finally, the hemolymph ltration barrier lacks an endothelial layer and therefore does not allow study of the important cross-talk of podocytes and endothelial cells. The remarkable extent of similarity between ies and vertebrates that has been revealed over the years, not only between proteins but between entire cellular and developmental pathways, underlines the signi cant role of Drosophila biology to directly impact our understanding of human health. Decades of genetic screening have provided y researchers with an enormous amount of genetic and genomic resources, including a large collection of mutant alleles and excellent annotation of the genome. Combined with innovative technology for spatial and temporal manipulation of gene expression, the Drosophila system allows the study of cell and developmental biological questions at high resolution—even in a highthroughput manner. The insect nephrocyte is a podocyte-like cell with a filtration slit diaphragm. Tang1 and Kar Neng Lai1  Proteasomal degradation of intracellular proteins facilitates the recognition of foreign proteins through interactions with major histocompatibility complex molecules presented to T cells. With the discovery of the lysosome, Greek for `digestive body,' more than half a century ago, it had been assumed that cellular proteins were degraded within this organelle until lysosomal inhibitors were found to be ine ective in preventing basal protein breakdown. In the past two decades, the focus in this eld has shi ed to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a tightly regulated system that degrades intracellular proteins to facilitate cellular adaptations to new physiologic conditions.

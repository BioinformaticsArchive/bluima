Autologous matrixinduced chondrogenesis (Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis) combines the microfracture method with matrix-based techniques that utilizes a collagen membrane to serve as a scaffold for new bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, allowing effective reconstruction of even large fragments of a damaged cartilage surface. Its major tools include both isolated cells and specially designed biomaterials. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were introduced into clinical practice [3, 5, 7] due to their ability to differentiate into many types of cells [1, 5, 7]. In fact, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are considered to be an attractive source of cells for the regeneration of tissues and organs, including articular surface cartilage [1, 3, 5, 7]. The simplest method for utilizing stem cells in the regeneration of a damaged cartilage layer is the microfracture technique [1, 9]. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis combines the microfracture method with matrix-based techniques that utilizes a collagen membrane to serve as a scaffold for new cells, allowing effective reconstruction of even large fragments of a damaged cartilage surface [2, 10–13].

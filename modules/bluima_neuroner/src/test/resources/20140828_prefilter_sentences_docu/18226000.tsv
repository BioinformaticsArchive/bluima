18226000	8-methoxypsoralen is an intercalating agent that makes cells more sensitive to the apoptotic effect of UV-A light. The exact mechanism of immunomodulation is unclear but likely involves cell-mediated immunity. Photopheresed cells induce an antigen-specific immune response against pathogenic T-cells without affecting the entire T-cell population. In scleroderma, abnormally activated T-cells are present in both peripheral blood and sites of abnormal collagen production. One could postulate that T-cells are indirectly involved in collagen synthesis and deposition, and extracorporeal photopheresis may decrease T-cellmediated collagen synthesis and deposition in Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

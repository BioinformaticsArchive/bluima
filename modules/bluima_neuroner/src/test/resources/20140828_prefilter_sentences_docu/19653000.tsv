In the meanwhile, evidence accumulated that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are also generated upon non-infectious stimuli in various clinical settings. This review summarizes current knowledge about the relation of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in a broad spectrum of clinical settings. SpeciWcally, we focus on the importance of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps as a predictive marker in severely ill patients and further, we speculate about the potential pathophysiology of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Keywords Neutrophils · Innate immunity · Pathophysiology · Neutrophil extracellular traps  Introduction  Many facets of the pathophysiology of neutrophil hyperactivation and its role in severe immune disorders are largely unknown. The formation of these neutrophil extracellular traps (neutrophil extracellular DNA traps) is an active process and is distinct from neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis involving post mortem antimicrobial and proinXammatory immune responses [2]. neutrophil extracellular DNA traps rapidly trap and kill microbial pathogens in blood and tissues as an emergency Wrst line defense mechanism. For example, neutrophil extracellular DNA traps prevented bacterial dissemination in an infection model with Streptococcus pneumoniae which is accompanied by redundant neutrophil pulmonary inXammation [3]. On the other hand, high amounts of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps seem to be associated with pathophysiological conditions implicating that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps contribute to collateral damage within inXamed tissues [2, 4–7]. neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are large DNA-associated molecule complexes carrying nucleic and cytoplasmic proteins such as histones, elastase, myeloperoxidase, pentraxin, lactoferrin, and bactericidal/ permeability-increasing (Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein) protein, each with strong antimicrobial and/or immunomodulating properties [8–10]. Aberrant NET formation and the patient's lack of DNases to degrade neutrophil extracellular DNA traps might contribute to prolonged persistence of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, tissue damage and autoimmune diseases. As the antimicrobial activity of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps has been reviewed thoroughly elsewhere [11], this review summarizes recent work on the detection of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in patient blood in diVerent clinical settings, thus underlining its diagnostic value. Moreover, we speculate about the potential pathophysiology of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in acute and chronic immune disorders. The physiological role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in innate immunity  Until recently, neutrophils have been regarded as purely unspeciWc eVector cells in innate immunity lacking the  capability to distinctively steer complex immune responses. Rather, the fate of terminally diVerentiated neutrophils that derive from hematopoietic progenitor cells within the bone marrow was believed to solely render apoptosis following phagocytosis of pathogens or to render necrosis, e.g., mediated by bacterial toxins [12]. Upon microbial or cytokine activation neutrophil apoptosis is suppressed resulting in prolonged survival and activity, often associated with unspeciWc damage to bystander tissue cells and attraction of further inXammatory cells [14]. Brinkmann et al. [1] have reported that neutrophils cast out their chromatin to form neutrophil extracellular DNA traps with chromatin and neutrophil-derived granular proteins and antimicrobial molecules for the previously unknown sequestration and killing [15] of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria as well as fungi. Indeed, neutrophils from patients suVering from chronic granulomatous disease and “catastrophic” infections fail to make neutrophil extracellular DNA traps upon ex vivo stimulation [11]. Recently, also Mast cells have been shown to secrete similar extracellular DNA structures [18]. A variety of pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella Xexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans has been shown to be trapped and killed by neutrophil extracellular DNA traps [15]. However, some resistant strains protect themselves from trapping by degrading the neutrophil extracellular DNA traps via endogenous DNase [19]. DNases are expressed by many Gram-positive bacterial pathogens [20] but their role in virulence has been unclear until the discovery of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Beiter et al. [3] showed that the surface endonuclease A of Streptococcus pneumoniae (strain TIGR4; serotype 4) enabled the bacteria to escape the immune system by degrading the DNA scaVolds of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Catalases were shown to decompose hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, and inhibit neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Conversely, inhibition of catalases increased NET formation: thus it is conceivable that microbes use catalases to escape from trapping by neutrophil extracellular DNA traps [2]. Furthermore, some bacteria have developed mechanisms to hide within bioWlms underneath neutrophil extracellular DNA traps [23]. Neutrophil extracellular traps may have further important functions such as regulation of immune responses,  protease-mediated eVector functions, and probably even intercellular signal transduction. For example, along with neutrophil speciWc elastase and myeloperoxidase [24], the antimicrobial pattern recognition receptor pentraxin 3 is co-localized to neutrophil extracellular DNA traps [8]. The formation of the C1 complex and of antigen-immune complexes entails increased phagocytic activity of monocytes and macrophages, secretion of immunoglobulins by B lymphocytes, stimulation of oxidative metabolism in neutrophils, adhesion of immune complexes to endothelial cells, and increased clearance of apoptotic cells [25]. Like histones, pentraxin co-localized to neutrophil extracellular DNA traps seems to be a central molecule in promoting local antimicrobial immune responses [8]. In addition, lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein, is also co-localized to neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, bridges innate and adaptive immune functions, is enhanced in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, and directly assists in the development of T helper cell polarization [9, 12]. The antimicrobial and anti-angiogenic Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein protein has been found in neutrophil extracellular DNA traps [26] which probably helps to constrain local tissue infection and inXammation functions and thus to prevent systemic infection and inXammation [27]. Certainly, many other potent inXammatory eVector molecules that might be localized in neutrophil extracellular DNA traps remain to be studied. The eVects of these proteins when released from neutrophil extracellular DNA traps after degradation by natural or therapeutic DNase [28] are unclear. Overall, the concept that neutrophil-derived extracellular chromatin may function as a carrier on one hand of molecules with antimicrobial function, and on the other hand of molecules with autodestructive immune eVector functions, may provide intriguing novel insights in the nature of innate immunity and immunogenicity. neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are thus reminiscent of a double-edge sword which functions not only as an eVective antimicrobial Wrst line defense machinery but may also lead to organ failure and death in the absence of counter regulation mechanisms. A summary of NET-associated molecules with antimicrobial, proinXammatory, and potentially pathogenic features is provided in Table 1.  NET formation, a novel type of neutrophil suicide  To better understand the speciWc role of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in innate immunity and inXammation, knowledge about the diVerences between neutrophil extracellular DNA traps and nucleic acids released during apoptosis or necrosis is important (Fig. 1). NET formation has been described as a novel cell death program [2] which is dependent on reactive oxygen species and occurs in approximately one-third  Table 1 Pathogenic implications of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps and co-localized eVector molecules  EVector molecules Anti microbial function Possible pathogenic implications known to be present and mechanism of action in neutrophil extracellular DNA traps  Elastase  Cathepsin G  Myeloperoxidase  Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein  Lactoferrin  Gelatinase B (matrix metalloproteinase-9, MMP-9)  Peptidoglycan recognition proteins  Pentraxin 3  Histones  Proteolytic digestion of bacterial proteins  Activation of antimicrobial peptides, like Cathelicidins Attachment and disruption of bacterial cell walls independent of protease activity  Augmentation of the bactericidal impact of the myeloperoxidase–reactive oxygen species system 10- to 100-fold Disruption of intrabacterial proteoglycan synthesis  Produces hypochlorous acid from hydrogen peroxide and chloride anion during the neutrophil's respiratory burst  Strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria and potent endotoxin-neutralizing activity  Iron-dependent bacteriostatic property and non-iron-dependent bactericidal action on LPS-bearing Gram-negative bacteria  Sequestration of iron by lactoferrin reduces insult-induced oxidative stress, thus altering the magnitude and speciWc production of cytokines Promotes maturation of T helper cells and diVerentiation of B cells Degradation of extracellular matrix molecules as a prerequisite for transmigration of neutrophils from circulation into the tissue MMP9-mediated N-terminal cleavage of IL8 potentiates IL8 activation of neutrophils PGRP-S binds to and inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (containing lysine-type PGN) and Escherichia coli  Opsonization, being a soluble pattern recognition receptor, binding the complement component C1q, the extracellular matrix TNF-inducible protein 6, and selected microorganisms Direct bactericidal action, prevention of microbial invasion in the small intestine and cleavage into antimicrobial peptides like buforin I  Destruction of connective tissue especially in the lung, resulting in emphysema/chonic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome Plaque disruption  Disintegration of the endothelial barrier resulting in capillary leakage, proteinuria and severe postinfection tissue injury  Digestion of connective tissue and cell surface proteins resulting in lung injury In concert with elastase: degradation of endothelial cell matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan resulting in capillary leakage and proteinuria Postinfection tissue injury Human carcinogenesis Most common target of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in microscopic polyangiitis, idiopathic necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and Churg–Strauss syndrome myeloperoxidase-deWcient individuals showed failure to kill C. albicans and subnormal activity against Staphylococcus aureus Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies directed against Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein have been detected in up to 91% in patients with cystic Wbrosis Maintenance of homeostasis in oxidative status and iron metabolism during inXammation; acute respiratory distress syndrome  Myocardial infarction  PGRP-S-deWcient mice show a defect in neutrophil killing and increased susceptibility to infection with nonpathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Immune complexes; psoriasis; lung injury  conWrmed by the inhibitory eVects of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium [2, 31] and in NADPH deWcient mice [32]. neutrophil extracellular DNA traps and the putative pathophysiological role in immune disorders  Fig. 1 To understand the importance of the novel paradigm of netosis, it is crucial to distinguish between intracellular mechanisms that result in the diVerent death types, apoptosis, necrosis, and netosis [2]. Fuchs et al. [2] recently compared the morphological changes of NET forming death with changes in cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptotic cells that show the classical morphology, including condensation of chromatin and fragmentation of nuclei without rupture of the nuclear envelope, and cytoplasmic vacuolization expose only insigniWcant amounts of nucleic acid on the cell membrane (blebbing). Although nucleic acids from necrotic cells may be found in injured tissues or even reach the circulation, the characteristics of nucleic acid from necrotic cells totally diVers from those in netosis. In necrotic cells, the nuclear membranes remain intact and clearly separate nucleoplasma from cytoplasma [2], whereas during netosis nucleic acids are mixed with cytoplasmic proteins before extrusion of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps occurs. Thus, only DNA from neutrophils, undergoing netosis, contains cytoplasmic eVector molecules and exerts immune functions after the cell has already died. However, Fuchs et al. [2] suggest that the majority of neutrophils in circulation is capable of making neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Moreover, passive cell death (necrosis), e.g., induced by toxins or complement is not related to NET formation [2]. Consequently, Steinberg and Grinstein designated this novel cell death mechanism “NETosis” [30]. Neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients with mutations in NADPH oxidase do not produce reactive oxygen species and are not able to elicit neutrophil extracellular DNA traps and therefore, this might explain their inability to develop suYcient antimicrobial killing activity. The role of reactive oxygen species in NET formation has been  Before the discovery of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, it has been previously reported that increased levels of circulating free DNA can be detected in various human diseases [33]. However, cf-DNA has been regarded as passively released nucleic acids from dying cells in conjunction with tissue destruction and necrosis. Currently, the measurement of cf-DNA has only been regarded as a possible tool for the diagnosis of dying tissues or cells in analogy to creatine kinase or transaminases. Based on Brinkmann et al. [1] work that showed that DNA is actively released by stimulated neutrophils as part of the neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, it is likely that many of the previously published Wndings on cf-DNA in patients may be related to the formation of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps and should be revisited. Therefore, three paradigms ought to be taken into account for the role of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in pathophysiology. High amounts of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are released by neutrophils under severe pathological conditions thus indicating or even predicting inXammation and inXammationmediated tissue damage. Aberrant amounts of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are not suYciently degraded by DNAses within the blood and thus may occlude capillaries, impair microcirculation, enzymatically damage tissues, and strongly promote inXammation. Excessively accumulated neutrophil extracellular DNA traps within tissues or capillaries release NET-associated eVector molecules upon degradation by extracellular DNases which may entail severe tissue damage. From these paradigms it seems obvious that patients with aberrantly elevated NET levels in conjunction with impaired DNase production may suVer from putative neutrophil extracellular DNA traps-associated tissue damage. There is growing evidence that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps kinetics follow the inXammatory course rather than the tissue damage, e.g., after severe trauma [34]. In an animal systemic inXammatory response syndrome model with large white pigs undergoing sham cardiac surgery with heart-lung machine cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps kinetics followed the systemic inXammatory response syndrome like syndrome kinetics rather than mechanical trauma such as sternotomy. In patients with systemic inXammatory response syndrome, for example after multiple trauma, burn injury or severe surgery, neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are increased by up to 20-fold. Furthermore, neutrophil extracellular DNA traps increase in plasma may predict multi organ failure and sepsis on intensive care unit in patients after multiple trauma [34]. In this study with multiple trauma patients a novel Xuorescence based detection method was used that may lay the ground for an easy point of care quantiWcation of cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. High cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps values in trauma patients would contraindicate secondary fracture stabilization due to increased risk of secondary inXammation and sepsis. In addition, in case of secondary infection, a severe problem after implantation of osteosynthesis material or arthroplasties, an increase of cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps may be an important indicator for surgery. Similarly, cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps has been shown to be an important marker for the early diagnosis of septic arthritis or periprosthetic infections in knee joints [35]. High cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps values have been reported to be a marker for intra-articular infections with a detection time faster than microbiological diagnostics. Early diagnosis of septic arthritis by cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps measurement could help the physician to rescue the joint by immediately sending the patient to the operation room [35]. QuantiWcation of cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps probably might indicate the severity of disease progression and thus may inXuence the timing of revision surgery in the future. Clinically, a clear correlation between activated circulating neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular DNA traps has been found in preeclampsia along with impaired oxygen uptake in the placenta [6]. Beside the mechanical impact of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps on tissue oxygenation, neutrophil-derived eVector molecules, co-localized to the DNA scaVold retain their functional properties extracellularly after NETosis has occurred. It has recently been shown that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps released from leukocytes [21, 36] were associated with myeloperoxidase activity indicating that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps indeed function as immune eVector molecules. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase localized within neutrophil extracellular DNA traps may impair the function of tissue inhibitors of metallo-proteases and thus indirectly enhances the local pathogenic activity (e.g., disruption of extracellular matrix) of metalloproteases [38]. Similarly, Beiter et al. [3] showed that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps when challenged with DNases, release antimicrobial neutrophil elastase. Elastase is an important serine protease enzyme that degrades constituents of bacterial cell membranes but, however, is involved in the disruption of epithelial barriers by digesting, e.g., interendothelial homophilic cadherin–cadherin anchorage as well as extracellular matrix proteins. That aberrant levels of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps may indeed lead to tissue damage has been conWrmed for the liver and lung [3, 4]. In this regard, it is well known that upon thoracic trauma or infection, neutrophils rapidly invade the pulmonary tissue which is followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome or chonic obstructive pulmonary disease [41–44] probably supported by proteases localized to neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Currently, it is unclear whether severe pulmonary dysfunction or other diseases in conjunction with viral infections may be partly due to cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps as a consequence of overwhelming inXammatory responses [46–49]. The hallmark of cystic Wbrosis is tenacious and purulent sputum, whose components include a complex of DNA, probably derived from neutrophil extracellular DNA traps as well as elastase [50]. Therapy with inhaled DNase reduces the symptoms of cystic Wbrosis and improves pulmonary function [51] indicating that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps contribute to the pathology probably not only by preventing ciliary motion and thus mechanical clearance of the airways [12, 52] but also by occlusion of pulmonary capillaries (Fig. 2). In addition to neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, actin and DNA released by necrotic neutrophils may also play a role in the pathology of cystic Wbrosis [53]. However, in contrast to neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, these structures were not antimicrobial but rather enhanced P. aeruginosa (a common pathogen in these patients) bioWlm formation and survival. However, the pathophysiological role of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in this setting and innovative less immunogenic coatings of the surface of ventilation devices ought to be studied in the future. Overall, it seems to be of high importance to deWne whether cf-DNA/neutrophil extracellular DNA traps is a valid marker for disease progression in patients with  Fig. 2 Schematic depiction of putative pathophysiological mechanisms that involve neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. c This hyperstimulation (but probably not phagocytosis alone) [4] triggers the extrusion of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps into the intercellular space but also into the lumen of the blood vessel where bacteria but also blood cells are randomly trapped (3). The increasing number of blood cells within the neutrophil extracellular DNA traps leads to successive occlusion of the blood vessel and thus to impairment of microcirculation within the tissue. Moreover, competent immune cells such as professional antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells), T cells, B cells along with platelets and red blood cells are tightly entangled by self antigens with self neutrophil-derived proteins (e.g., myeloperoxidase, elastase etc.) that are co-localized to self DNA. Taken together, this scenario might function as an immune incubator that may prime, e.g., B cells to be stimulated against pathogen antigens, however, cross-reacting with self antigens against nucleic or cytoplasmic self molecules. Stimulated B cells may extravasate into the vas lymphaticum aVerens (4) to reach the local lymph node. e Plasma cells reenter the blood circulation via the vas lymphaticum eVerens and secrete antinuclear antibodies and/or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies autoimmune antibodies involved in the elimination of neutrophils (5) and other tissue cells  values, for example in septic patients [58, 59] at high risk for organ failure or in patients with autoimmune disease. Speculation about neutrophil extracellular DNA traps and autoimmune diseases  lung failure. Given that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps play a role in the pathogenesis of diverse immune disorders, the formation and activity of DNases are prerequisites for natural counter regulation. It would be of interest, therefore, to analyze the DNase gene polymorphism [57], e.g., in patients with blood stream infections and chronically high amounts of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in blood  The paradigm of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps oVers a plausible explanation for the development of antibodies directed against self nucleic acids and cytoplasmic proteins due to the exposure of neutrophil DNA to immune cells. The transient or chronic presence of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps may lead to stimulation of the production of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies or antinuclear antibodies and vice versa as outlined in Fig. Recently, Kessenbrock et al. [60] showed that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps are released by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-stimulate neutrophils and that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps in turn contain the targeted autoantigens proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase. Activated platelets stimulate the primed neutrophils via Toll-like receptor molecules [61] such as TLR-4 to cast out their neutrophil extracellular DNA traps [4] which results in trapping and accumulation of lymphocytes and probably professional antigen presenting  cells. The exposure of neutrophil DNA in conjunction with cytoplasmic proteins and the presence of pathogenic antigens might provoke the stimulation of B cells (e.g., primed against myeloperoxidase). The antinuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (e.g., myeloperoxidase–anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) that arise from this scenario in turn may stimulate primed neutrophils to adhere to the endothelium, to transmigrate through the endothelial barrier, and to induce endothelial cell death. Assuming, this vicious circle is largely driven by neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, a causal relationship between the lack of DNases and autoimmune diseases should be observed. Moreover, Parseghian and Luhrs [64] provided evidence for the strong association between histones, neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, and autoimmune diseases. A summary of possible pathophysiological conditions and autoimmune diseases that might be tightly associated with neutrophil extracellular DNA traps is provided in Table 1.  Interaction of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps with platelets: a trigger for impaired clotting? Since neutrophil extracellular DNA traps have been shown to be stable under Xow conditions in the vasculature, it is possible that neutrophil extracellular DNA traps at the injured endothelium (exposed hyaluronic acid and Wbronectin; activation of platelets; microbial load) may successively lead to the trapping of blood cells, clotting, and thus to occlusion of the capillaries analogous to the development of atherosclerotic plaques (Fig. 2). From this point of view, neutrophil extracellular DNA traps may play a role in major cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiac  infarction, and stroke. Conclusions and outlook  The novel concept of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps as a novel central mechanism in innate immunity is intriguing. However, aberrant amounts of neutrophil extracellular DNA traps may cause severe sequelae in patients with acute and chronic immune dysregulation. In this review, we focused on the importance of standardized diagnostic procedures and on putative pathophysiological mechanisms mediated by neutrophil extracellular DNA traps. Further, we expect that with increasing knowledge about neutrophil extracellular DNA traps, eVorts will be strengthened to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and tools in inXammatory and autoimmune disorders.

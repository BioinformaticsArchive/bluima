19619000	Oral Gene Therapy for Hypoparathyroidism: A Rat Model  Fong-Fu Chou,1 Shun-Chen Huang,2 Shwu-Fen Chang,3 Jiahorng Liaw,4 and Pei-Hua Hung1  Abstract The use of nonionic polymeric micelles orally to protect and deliver plasmid DNA in vivo was investigated. Parathyroid hormone(1–34) gene (179 bp) was inserted into a human cytomegalovirus promoter (plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter) and E. coli competent cells were used to amplify the cDNA. Polymeric micelle formations (100 μl) formed from plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA (7.2 μg/μl) and 6% (w/v) polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide was administered at 8-hr intervals for 48 hr and then at 8-hr intervals for 24 hr weekly for 3 weeks. Gene therapy for hypoparathyroidism through gene transfer to skeleton cells or stem cells has been reported previously (Zhou et al., 2005; Wen et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2006). The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using nonionic polymeric micelles orally to protect and deliver plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) in vivo. Materials and Methods Nonionic polymeric micelles of polyethylene oxidepolypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide) copolymer with an average molecular mass of 8400 Da, was obtained from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Five groups were designed as follows: parathyroidectomy treated with oral plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA in polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelle formations plus EDTA as the study group (n = 9); parathyroidectomy treated with oral drinking water (n = 9); parathyroidectomy treated with oral EDTA (n = 9); parathyroidectomy treated with oral plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA; and parathyroidectomy treated with oral PCMVPTH(1–34) cDNA plus EDTA. The Parathyroid hormone(1–34) gene (179 bp) was inserted into plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter (4219 bp) via the EcoRI and BamHI cloning sites, and competent Escherichia coli cells were used to amplify the cDNA. The stability of plasmid DNA in cDNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelle formulation was determined by electrophoresis immediately after preparation, after 2 days of storage at room temperature, and after three freeze-thaw cycles (Liaw et al., 2001). Preparation of DNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelles  All DNA [plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34)]/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelles were freshly prepared in collaboration with J. Polymeric micelles were formed with 6% (w/w) PEO-PPOPEO in water. Top: Immunohistochemical staining with Parathyroid hormone(1–34) antibody reveals Parathyroid hormone(1–34)-positive cells in the duodenal mucosa in the oral plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide plus EDTA (study group), at (A) 14 days and (B) 28 days. No Parathyroid hormone(1–34)-positive cells were found in the duodenal mucosa in the (C) drinking water, (D) EDTA, (E) Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA, and (F) plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA and EDTA groups. Middle: Immunohistochemical staining with Parathyroid hormone(1–34) antibody reveals Parathyroid hormone(1–34)-positive cells and nuclei in pericentral veins of the liver in the oral plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide plus EDTA (study group), at (A) 14 days and (B) 28 days. No Parathyroid hormone(1–34)-positive cells in pericentral veins of the liver were found in the (C) drinking water, (D) EDTA, (E) Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA, and (F) Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA plus EDTA groups. Bottom: Immunohistochemical staining with Parathyroid hormone(1–34) antibody reveals Parathyroid hormone(1–34)-positive cells in spleen of the oral plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide plus EDTA (study group) at (A) 14 days and (B) 28 days. No Parathyroid hormone(1–34)-positive cells in spleen were found in the (C) drinking water, (D) EDTA, (E) Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA, and (F) Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA plus EDTA groups. determine the formation of micelles (Chang et al., 2004). PCMVPTH(1–34) cDNA (7.2 μg/μl) was gently mixed with PEO-PPOPEO polymeric micelles in a vial for 2 hr at 25°C. Polymeric micelle formations (100 μl) formed from plasmid DNA containing human cytomegalovirus promoter-Parathyroid hormone(1–34) cDNA (7.2 μg/μl) and 6% (w/v) polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide were administered at 8-hr intervals (6 a.m., 2 p.m., and 10 p.m.) for 48 hr as the first course and for 24 hr on days 7, 14, and 21. Rats receiving 150 μl of EDTA (10 mM) 10 min before and concurrent with administration of PCMVPTH(1–34) cDNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelles served as the study group. Detection of Parathyroid hormone(1–34) mRNA in tissues by RT-polymerase chain reaction Two and 4 weeks after the first oral dosing of PCMVPTH(1–34) cDNA/polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelles, total RNA was extracted from duodenum, liver, spleen, heart, lung, and kidney with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymeric micelles have been evaluated in multiple pharmaceutical applications as drug and gene delivery systems as well as for diagnostic imaging as carriers of various contrasting agents (Yokoyama, 1992; Kwon et al., 1994; Kwon and Katota, 1995; Stolnik et al., 1995; Alakhov and Kabanov, 1998; Kwon and Okano, 1999; Forchillin, 2001; Huang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2009). Gene transfer by polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelles through the gastrointestinal tract is currently under investigation. Improved transfection efficiency was achieved by the use of EDTA, which is known to open tight junctions of the duodenum and increase paracellular transport for the further distribution of cDNA to remote organs such as liver, spleen, lung, heart, and kidney (Chang et al., 2004; Tong et al., 2007). A previous study (Chang et al., 2004) found that 10 mM EDTA and mixtures containing plasmid DNA (0.26 μg/μl) with 6% polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide polymeric micelles yielded a significant increase in the reporter vector for 2 days, compared with a DNA concentration of 0.26 μg/μl alone.

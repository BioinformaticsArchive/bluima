21525000	At the onset of myogenic differentiation of L6 cells induced by the phospholipase D agonist vasopressin in the absence of serum, mTORC1 complex was rapidly activated, as reflected by phosphorylation of S6 kinase1. The mammalian target of rapamycin2 is a serine/ threonine protein kinase that integrates signals provided by growth factors, nutrient availability, energy levels, or redox status to adapt protein synthesis and major cell functions such as growth, proliferation, and survival to the physiological conditions (1). Knocking out the mammalian target of rapamycin effector S6 kinase1 produces mice with smaller myofibers, suggesting that mammalian target of rapamycin, via S6 kinase1 activation, is required for muscle cell growth (16). A phospholipase D agonist, the neurohypophysial hormone arginine-vasopressin, efficiently stimulates in vitro differentiation of myogenic L6 cells and primary human myoblasts in the presence of reduced serum concentration (22, 23). Besides, phospholipase D1-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin activation has been proposed to support C2C12 cell differentiation through a kinase-independent enhancement of IGF-2 expression (27). In the present work we took advantage of the model of AVPinduced L6 cell differentiation, which avoids the use of serum and thus allows close control of the stimuli supplied to the cells, to investigate the role of regulation by phospholipase D of both mammalian target of rapamycin complexes. Cell Culture and Transfection—L6 myoblasts of the C5 subclone (22) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO . To induce differentiation, 2 cells were grown to 100% confluence and switched to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin without serum). L6 cells grown on 6-well plates to 40 –50% confluence were transfected with 2 g of plasmidic DNA per well using Exgene transfection reagent (from Euromedex) for 48 h. Butan-1-ol (1% final concentration) was added 15 min before cell treatment by 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 10 min. The cells were fixed by 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton for 10 min at room temperature, and aspecific labeling was blocked in 1% BSA for 20 min. The cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy with an Axiovert 200 microscope, an objective LD A-plan, 20 /0.30 Reverse Transcriptase and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from L6 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Right panel, L6 myoblasts were serum-starved overnight and treated with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for the indicated times, and cell lysates were analyzed as above. B, shown is a Western blot of cells transfected with 50 nM control Short Interfering RNA, Raptor-Short Interfering RNA, or Rictor-Short Interfering RNA and stimulated for 40 min with 10 –7 M arginine-vasopressin. C and D, cells were serum-starved overnight and pretreated or not with 0.5% 1-butanol (BuOH1) or 2-butanol (BuOH2) for 30 min before 40 min of stimulation by 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin or 100 M dioctanoyl-phosphatidic acid (phosphatidic acid-diC8) or 100 M propranolol. E, cells were transfected with 50 nM control Short Interfering RNA or phospholipase D1-Short Interfering RNA or phospholipase D2-Short Interfering RNA for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated by arginine-vasopressin for 40 min. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot (right panel). F, cells were infected with GFP-adenovirus or phospholipase D1-adenovirus or phospholipase D2-adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated by arginine-vasopressin for 40 min. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot (right panel). The efficiency of phospholipase D overexpression was assessed in control Western blots of cells infected at various multiplicities of infection and probed with either anti-phospholipase D1 antibody or anti-HA tag antibody for recombinant phospholipase D2 detection (left panel). G, cells were shifted to serum-free medium and pretreated for 40 min with 100 nM rapamycin before 40 min of treatment with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin or 100 M propranolol.

After 12 h of incubation in the presence of viral particles, the medium was changed, and cells were cultured for 24 –72 h. Under these conditions, 75% of the cells expressed GFP. RESULTS In Differentiating Conditions, mTORC1 and S6 kinase1 Are Activated in a Phospholipase D-dependent Way—We first investigated the effects of arginine-vasopressin, a phospholipase D agonist that strongly enhances  FIGURE 1—continued  the differentiation of L6 cells in low serum culture conditions, on the phosphorylation status of protein substrates of the mTORC1 complex. To determine whether the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by arginine-vasopressin involved phospholipase D, 1-butanol, which specifically prevents the formation of phosphatidic acid, the normal product of phospholipase D, was added to the cells. The addition to the cells of either exogenous phosphatidic acid or propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphatase that induces an accumulation of endogenous phosphatidic acid, induced S6 kinase1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). These results strongly suggest that phospholipase D, and especially the phospholipase D1 isoform, regulates S6 kinase1 phosphorylation on critical positions, and as a consequence, S6 kinase1 activity in L6 cells induced to differentiate. To this end, the cells were submitted to a short treatment by rapamycin (40 min) in conditions known to suppress only mTORC1 activity (Fig. 1G). This Akt activation also involved the participation of phospholipase D, as it was reproduced by treatment of the cells by exogenous phosphatidic acid or propranolol (Fig. 2A). Besides Short Interfering RNA silencing, another means to deplete cells in mTORC2 complex is the use of longer term treatment by rapamycin (3). A, cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated for the indicated times with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin or 100 M dioctanoyl-phosphatidic acid (phosphatidic acid-diC8) or 100 M propranolol. B, cells were infected with GFP, phospholipase D1, or phospholipase D2 adenovirus for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, treated with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 7 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. C and D, cells were transfected with 50 nM control Short Interfering RNA or phospholipase D1-Short Interfering RNA or phospholipase D2-Short Interfering RNA or Raptor-Short Interfering RNA or Rictor-Short Interfering RNA for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, treated with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 7 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. E, cells treated with 100 nM rapamycin for 24 h were stimulated with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin or 100 M propranolol for 7 and 30 min, respectively, and subjected to Western blotting analysis. The diagrams show the quantification of phospho-Ser-473-Akt in the Western blot above after normalization by Akt protein amount (means S.E. of three determinations; *, significantly different from control cells, p 0.05). The observation that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the phospholipase D1 isoform increased the percentage of myogenin-positive nuclei in cells after 48 h in differentiation  medium, further supported the positive involvement of phospholipase D1 in the myogenic response (Fig. 3D). In agreement with what was observed by numerous groups with different myogenic cell types, we observed a complete blockade of myogenic differentiation of L6 cells in the presence of rapamycin. However, at variance with what was observed by others in C2C12 cells (4), we observed a total inhibition of myogenic response at the very early steps of myogenin expression (mRNA, protein) and nuclear accumulation, i.e. before the cell fusion step (Fig. 4A). Because mTORC2 had a positive role in L6 cell differentiation stimulated by arginine-vasopressin, the involvement of the mTORC2 substrate Akt in this response could be expected. The phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 observed in these conditions is known to induce, together with PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-308, a maximal activation of Akt that might participate in the differentiating response of L6 cells in the presence of arginine-vasopressin. These observations suggested that Akt activation is not required for the cells to differentiate. To further evaluate the Akt role in differentiation, we overexpressed the wild-type Akt1 isoform in L6 cells submitted to differentiating conditions (Fig. 5B). Because it has been reported that rapamycin suppresses the production of IGF-2 by C2C12 cells, thereby preventing an autocrine loop required for differentiation to take place, we examined the ability of IGF-2 and insulin to raise the blockade of L6 myoblast differentiation induced by rapamycin. Besides, in L6 cells stimulated to differentiate in the presence of arginine-vasopressin, we evaluated the expression of IGF-2 by Western blotting and RT-PCR and observed that rapamycin had no marked influence on IGF-2 protein or mRNA levels (Fig. 5D). PKC phosphorylation was also triggered by phosphatidic acid or propranolol cell stimulation (not shown). We observed a strong inhibition of differentiation, as evaluated by myogenin protein content, showing that PKC is required for L6 cells to differentiate (Fig. 6D). A, [3H]palmitic acid-labeled cells were pretreated for 15 min by 1% 1-butanol and various phospholipase D inhibitors: non isoform-specific fluoro-2-indolyldeschlorohalopemide, phospholipase D1-specific I-phospholipase D1, and phospholipase D2-specific I-phospholipase D2. phospholipase D activity is expressed as the percentage of radioactivity in phosphatidylbutanol relative to radioactivity in total phospholipids (*, different from arginine-vasopressin-stimulated cells, p 0.05). B, L6 cells were cultured in the presence of 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 48 h with varying concentrations of phospholipase D inhibitor fluoro-2-indolyldeschlorohalopemide. C, L6 cells were cultured in the presence of 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 48 h, with varying concentrations of phospholipase D1-specific inhibitor (left panel) or phospholipase D2-specific inhibitor (right panel). Cells were lysed, and proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis of myogenin expression (mean S.E. of three determinations; *, significantly different from cells arginine-vasopressin, p 0.05). D, shown is immunofluorescence microscopy of nuclear myogenin in non-infected L6 cells and cells infected with adenovirus coding for GFP, hPLD1 (phospholipase D1), or hPLD2 (phospholipase D2) and cultured in the presence of arginine-vasopressin for 48 h. *, significantly different from control cells, p 0.001. When the cells were treated by rapamycin for 48 h to down-regulate mTORC2, the overexpression of phospholipase D1, but not phospholipase D2, enhanced the expression of myogenin (Fig. 7), support-  FIGURE 5. The IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway is not involved in the first steps of arginine-vasopressin-induced L6 cell differentiation. The effect of the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 on myogenin protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting in L6 cells stimulated for 48 h by arginine-vasopressin. *, significantly different from control cells, p 0.05. B, cells were transfected with Akt or empty vector for 48 h and stimulated with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 48 h, and nuclear myogenin immunostaining was performed and quantified relative to DAPI-stained total nuclei. As a control of Akt overexpression, Western blotting analysis of Akt protein was performed on cell lysates. C, cells were transfected with empty vector or kinase-dead PI3K (PI3K-KD) or constitutively active PI3K (PI3K-CA) for 48 h and stimulated with 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin for 48 h, and nuclear myogenin immunostaining was performed and quantified relative to DAPI stained total nuclei. Cell lysates were analyzed for IGF-2 content by Western blotting (upper blot, representative result of IGF2 cell content at day 2). A, cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 10 7 M arginine-vasopressin with or without 100 nM rapamycin; myogenin mRNA level was measured by quantitative RT-PCR, myogenin protein content was evaluated by Western blotting analysis, and myogenin nuclear accumulation was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy.

The involvement of phospholipase D in the activation of both mammalian target of rapamycin complexes has been reported to occur in cancer cell lines by Foster and co-workers (9). Based on the report that localization of mTORC2 complex into the raft fraction of endothelial cell plasma membrane is required for its activity, an intriguing possibility is that phosphatidic acid drives the targeting of mTORC2 to lipid rafts (45). Concerning the involvement of phospholipase D in the regulation of the mTORC1 substrate S6 kinase1 in differentiating L6 cells, additional levels of complexity are emerging. *, significantly different from control cells, p 0.05.  forms that are produced by translation of a single mRNA with usage of two different translational start sites (47). In line with a differential regulation of the two forms, their subcellular localization has been reported to be different, the p70 isoform being predominantly cytosolic, whereas the p85 isoform carrying a nuclear localization signal sequence might be mainly present in the nucleus, where it ensures a specific role in the control of mitogenesis (51–53). Besides, Chen and Erbay (20) reported that initial C2C12 myogenic cell differentiation is controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin in a kinaseindependent way through regulation of IGF-2 expression, rapamycin blocking the differentiation process by preventing the autocrine stimulatory effect of IGF-2. We observed by using selective Short Interfering RNA silencing that only mTORC2 complex is positively involved in differentiation, in agreement with what was described by others in C2C12 cells (4) and human primary myoblasts (56), and that, in the opposite, mTORC1 complex has a negative effect on differentiation. In further support to this model, we verified that arginine-vasopressin stimulation of L6 cells induced a rapid phosphorylation of Rictor on Thr-1135, the residue targeted by S6 kinase1, and that this effect was reproduced by S6 kinase1 overexpression. In C2C12 cells, Akt seems to be the candidate, because ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt rescues differentiation of cells depleted in Rictor and, although with much delay and incompletely, of cells treated by rapamycin (4). In arginine-vasopressin-stimulated L6 cells we did not observe such a major role for Akt, as shown by the limited effects of PI3K inhibitors on differentiation, by an absence of correlation between Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation status and the extent of myogenic response in the presence of wortmannin or rapamycin plus insulin, and by the modest effects of Akt or PI3K overexpression on early myogenesis steps. Proposed model for the implication of phospholipase D-mediated modulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin system in myogenic differentiation of L6 cells. that overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt mutant in primary mouse myoblasts had no noticeable effect on the levels and timing of expression of differentiation markers and cell fusion (58). Thus, there seem to exist a number of differences between L6 and C2C12 myogenic cell models regarding the signaling set in motion at the onset of differentiation. As for the mTORC2 effector(s) involved in L6 cell differentiation, other proteins identified as targets of mTORC2 (57) could be considered, especially PKC , because of the importance of PKCs in myogenic response (24). Because phospholipase D activity in mammalian cells is ensured by two different isoforms, phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2, which exhibit different regulations and subcellular locations, the question of the respective role of the two isoforms in mammalian target of rapamycin regulation and  myogenic differentiation can be raised. On the whole it appears that phospholipase D and, more specifically the phospholipase D1 isoform, is involved in an intricate regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin system in differentiating L6 myogenic cells (Fig. 8).

17933000	Retrorectal tumours may be classified as congenital, neurogenic, osseous or miscellaneous2â€“4. Neurogenic (including anterior sacral meningoceles), osseous and miscellaneous tumours each account for approximately 10 per cent of retrorectal tumours4,7.

The perineal approach also gives excellent access to low tumours, but an abdominal procedure is necessary when the tumour is high (inability to access the superior pole of the tumour), the sidewall is involved (risk of uncontrolled bleeding) or there is invasion of pelvic viscera (potentially requiring an en bloc resection).

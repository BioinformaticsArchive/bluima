19306000	The white blood cell count gave 12,100/ l with 79.8% granulocytes. Laboratory examination performed in our institute showed a white blood cell count of 11,800/ l with 74.3% neutrophils, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dl, platelet count 25.1 + 103/ l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 111 mm/h, C-reactive protein 13.6 mg/dl, ferritin 418 ng/ml (17 < normal < 292),  1516 Rheumatol Int (2009) 29:1515â€“1518  Fig. Laboratory Wndings were white blood cell count of 8,200/ l, platelet count 175 + 103/ l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 14 mm/h (9 mm/h 1 month before), C-reactive protein 0.2 mg/dl, ferritin 173 ng/ml, prothrombin time-INR 0.88, partial thrombin time 120 s, GOT 50 U/l, glutamate pyruvate transaminase 96 U/l, lactic dehydrogenase 313 U/l. Laboratory Wndings included; white blood cell count of 8,600/ l, platelet count 175 + 103/ l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 51 mm/h, C-reactive protein 0.2 mg/dl, ferritin 233 ng/ml, INR-prothrombin time 1.19, GOT 50 U/l, glutamate pyruvate transaminase 96 U/l, lactic dehydrogenase 170 U/l. Mizoribine selectively inhibits the synthesis of guanosine monophosphate from inosine 5 -monophosphate in the purine metabolism pathway in immune cells [23]. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis, inXammatory cells from small vessels are inWltrated into the synovial tissue and produce cytokines including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-18 [26]. Mizoribine decreased intracellular production and extracellular release of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 from peripheral monocytes of RA patients [29].

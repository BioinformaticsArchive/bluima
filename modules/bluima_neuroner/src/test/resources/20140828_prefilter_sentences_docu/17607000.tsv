17607000	Introduction Transforming growth factor (Transforming growth factor-beta ) and related proteins are ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor in metazoans ranging from Drosophila and C. elegans to mammals, and they activate a signaling pathway that affects numerous cell fate decisions. Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor activation or expression is involved in cell transformation, tumor progression and metastasis of cells from neuroectodermal origin and has been implicated in the initiation and progression of human cancer (Derynck, 1992; Lee et al., 1995; Schlessinger, 2002). Transforming growth factor-beta family proteins, including Spitz and Gurken in Drosophila, are made as type I transmembrane proteins with an extracellular six-cysteine containing EGF core domain. In mammalian cells, Transforming growth factor-beta undergoes processing and maturation during its transport through the secretory pathway. Human CNIH and Drosophila Cornichon are primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and  Cornichon regulates transport and secretion of Transforming growth factor-beta -related proteins in metazoan cells  Carolina Perez Castro, Denise Piscopo, Takatoshi Nakagawa and Rik Derynck* Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, Program in Cell Biology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-0512, USA *Author for correspondence (e-mail: rik.derynck@ucsf.edu) Ectodomain shedding is generally upregulated in tumor cells (Derynck, 1992), probably as a consequence of enhanced MAP kinase signaling (Fan and Derynck, 1999). In addition to its role in cell proliferation, ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptor signaling is involved in cell differentiation and development (Shilo, 2005). A Cornichon homolog in yeast, called Erv14, is required for axial budding of daughter cells and has been proposed to serve as a cargo receptor, based on its requirement for transport of Axl2 to the site of bud selection (Powers and Barlowe, 1998). We now provide evidence that cornichon proteins have similar functions in mammalian and Drosophila cells, consistent with their structural conservation. Our findings indicate that cornichon proteins are functionally conserved in yeast, Drosophila and mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that in metazoans cornichon proteins have a similar subcellular localization and regulate transport of Transforming growth factor-beta family ligands.

Our findings indicate that cornichon proteins are functionally conserved in yeast, Drosophila and mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that in metazoans cornichon proteins have a similar subcellular localization and regulate transport of Transforming growth factor-beta family ligands. Subcellular localization of cornichon proteins The sequence conservation of mammalian CNIH and Drosophila Cornichon, in comparison with yeast Erv14, raises the question of whether all three proteins have a similar subcellular localization. We determined the subcellular localization of tagged CNIH and Cornichon in human HeLa and Drosophila S2 cells, respectively (Fig. 2). In HeLa cells, CNIH was shown by immunofluorescence to localize to the perinuclear region in a diffuse reticular pattern, characteristic of the endoplasmic reticulum and coincident with staining for calnexin, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2A). The staining for both calnexin and GM130 was similar in non-transfected cells and cells expressing CNIH. CNIH also colocalized partially with endogenous SEC23, a component of the COPII vesicle coat complex that localizes to endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, in HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). We also determined the subcellular localization of endogenous CNIH in HeLa cells. We raised an antiserum to the conserved peptide from amino acid 32-46 of CNIH (Fig. 1) and used it to detect CNIH in HeLa cells, which express CNIH as determined by RT-PCR (data not shown). The staining for endogenous CNIH (Fig. 2C) was similar to that of HA-tagged CNIH in transfected cells, albeit with lower intensity (Fig. 2A). In S2 cells, tagged Cornichon showed a similar perinuclear and reticular cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2F) as in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A-E). No CNIH or Cornichon staining was detected at the cell surface in either HeLa or S2 cells (Fig. 2, data not shown). To more precisely define the subcellular localization of Cornichon, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on Cornichon-Mycexpressing S2 cells. CNIH expression rescues the budding phenotype of yeast lacking Erv14 To evaluate a functional conservation of cornichon among diverse organisms, we examined whether CNIH, which is  Subcellular localization of cornichon proteins The sequence conservation of mammalian CNIH and Drosophila Cornichon, in comparison with yeast Erv14, raises the question of whether all three proteins have a similar subcellular localization.

No CNIH or Cornichon staining was detected at the cell surface in either HeLa or S2 cells (Fig. 2, data not shown). To more precisely define the subcellular localization of Cornichon, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on Cornichon-Mycexpressing S2 cells. In contrast to the typical axial budding pattern of an isogenic wild-type strain, haploid erv14 yeast cells showed non-axial budding, as reported (Powers and Barlowe, 1998). Transformation of erv14 cells with Erv14 or HAtagged Erv14 rescued the axial budding phenotype with high efficiency, as expected (Powers and Barlowe, 1998). Quantifications are derived from S2 cells (n=20). Immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of Transforming growth factor-beta with CNIH in transfected HeLa cells at sites where CNIH is normally present, i.e. in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (Fig. 2D). Similarly, we observed colocalization of Gurken with Cornichon in S2 cells (Fig. 2H), suggesting that both proteins interact during ligand transport and processing. The colocalization of cornichon proteins with Transforming growth factor-beta family proteins prompted us to examine their physical association by coimmunoprecipitation from HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 3). No interaction was detected when extracts of cells expressing Transforming growth factor-beta were mixed with those of CNIH-Myc-expressing cells and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A, lane 5). CNIH complements Erv14 function in yeast in a budding assay of haploid cells  able to load Axl2 into COPII vesicles at the exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and, thus, functions as a cargo receptor similar to Erv14.

Effect of CNIH on Transforming growth factor-beta processing and transport Since CNIH and Transforming growth factor-beta interact and are localized to similar subcellular compartments, we evaluated the effect of increased CNIH expression on Transforming growth factor-beta processing, transport and secretion (Fig. 5). Increased CNIH expression also enhanced the level of immature endogenous Transforming growth factor-beta in HCA-7 epithelial cells (Fig. 5B). Further, in CHO cells stably expressing Transforming growth factor-beta , ectopic CNIH expression increased the amount of Transforming growth factor-beta at sites were CNIH is localized, indicative of an accumulation of immature Transforming growth factor-beta in the endoplasmic reticulum. Costaining with GM130 shows Transforming growth factor-beta primarily localized to the Golgi in cells that do not ectopically express CNIH, but enhanced retention of Transforming growth factor-beta in the endoplasmic reticulum in cells with ectopic CNIH expression (Fig. 5C). Semi-quantitative image analysis of the immunostaining indicated a threefold increase in intracellular accumulation of Transforming growth factor-beta in CNIH cotransfected cells (Fig. 5D). Ectopic expression of Cornichon also increased the relative level of immature Transforming growth factor-beta in mammalian cells (data not shown), suggesting that CNIH and Cornichon function similarly in Transforming growth factor-beta processing and transport. Effect of CNIH on cell surface expression and secretion of Transforming growth factor-beta The retention of immature Transforming growth factor-beta in the endoplasmic reticulum with increased CNIH expression would be expected to result in a decrease in the level of mature Transforming growth factor-beta that reaches the cell surface.

(B) HeLa cells, press Flag-tagged GRASP55, with or without Transforming growth factor-beta or Myc-tagged jected to anti-Flag immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting for NIH. When CNIH was ectopically expressed, the level of Transforming growth factor-beta labeled by cell surface biotinylation was decreased with a concomitant increase in the relative level of immature Transforming growth factor-beta in the cell lysate (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1 and 2). CNIH did not affect the cell surface expression of gp130, a transmembrane protein that does not associate with CNIH (Fig. 6B; data not shown). Consistent with the retention of Transforming growth factor-beta in its immature form and the decrease in cell surface presentation of Transforming growth factor-beta , increased CNIH expression decreased the secretion of soluble Transforming growth factor-beta . Transforming growth factor-beta release occurs as a result of ectodomain shedding from transmembrane Transforming growth factor-beta following cleavage by membrane-bound metalloproteases. Transforming growth factor-beta release was quantified by expressing transmembrane Transforming growth factor-beta that is extracellularly fused to alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase-Transforming growth factor-beta ), thus allowing the use of an enzymatic assay to measure soluble APTGF (Sahin et al., 2004). These results indicate that the interaction of CNIH with transmembrane Transforming growth factor-beta family proteins decreases maturation, cell surface presentation and secretion through ectodomain shedding of these epidermal growth factor receptor ligands.

Effect of overexpressed Cornichon on Gurken processing Similar to our experiments in mammalian cells to examine the effect of CNIH on Transforming growth factor-beta processing, we assessed the effect of Cornichon on transport, processing and secretion of Gurken in Drosophila S2 cells.

S2 cells express endogenous Cornichon, B-Rho and Star, as assessed by RT-PCR (data not shown). These results indicate that, similar to the effect of CNIH on Transforming growth factor-beta processing in mammalian cells, ectopic Cornichon causes an accumulation of transmembrane Gurken in its non-  reated with N-glycosidase F, and after treatment indicates N- (form 1) without affecting its N-(A).

Effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of Cornichon expression on Gurken processing To complement the CNIH overexpression experiments, we also examined the effect of CNIH-specific siRNAs on the processing of transmembrane Transforming growth factor-beta in mammalian cells. Although we observed a decrease of CNIH mRNA in cells transfected with CNIH siRNA (data not shown), we were unable to verify whether the corresponding CNIH protein level was decreased because of the limited antibody quality.

However, we were successful in evaluating the effect of silencing Cornichon expression in S2 cells, which have only one Cornichon gene. In S2 cells, as in mammalian cells, Cornichon and CNIH behaved similarly in retaining epidermal growth factor receptor ligands in their immature  forms (see above). Silencing of Cornichon expression in the presence of B-Rho and Star resulted in increased levels of processed Gurken (processed Grk), and a reduction of the immature Gurken form in the cell lysate (Fig. 7C, lanes 4-6, upper panel). This intracellular accumulation of processed Grk is consistent with the increased levels of processed Gurken in Drosophila oocytes lacking Cornichon (Bokel et al., 2006) and of Axl2 in Erv14-deficient yeast (Powers and Barlowe, 1998). These effects were evaluated in cells ectopically expressing B-Rho and Star, since they are required for Gurken processing (Fig. 7A,B) (Ghiglione et al., 2002). The absence of Cornichon does not appear to affect the stability of Gurken or processed Gurken, as there was no difference in the levels of either form when S2 cells were treated with a lysosome inhibitor (Fig. 7C, compare lane 4 with 5 and 6). As shown using S2 cells (Fig. 7D), both B-Rho and Star are required for processing of Gurken and secretion of soluble Gurken.

Our results characterize a role for cornichon proteins in transport and maturation of Transforming growth factor-beta family proteins and reveal functional conservation from yeast to mammalian cells. We examined the subcellular localization of Cornichon and CNIH. Consistent with the localization of Erv14 in yeast, Drosophila Cornichon was recently proposed to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum of follicular cells (Bokel et al., 2006). We now show by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy that Cornichon and CNIH are both localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi, in S2 and HeLa cells, respectively. Cornichon colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum markers KDEL-GFP in S2 cells and CNIH with calnexin in HeLa cells. Additionally, from immunofluorescence studies Cornichon was found to colocalized with p120 in S2 cells and CNIH with GM130 in HeLa cells, both markers of Golgi. In HeLa cells, CNIH also partially colocalized with SEC23, a component of the COPII vesicle coat complex that localizes to endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. The similar localization of Erv14, Cornichon and CNIH to the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast, Drosophila and human cells, respectively, suggests an analogous role for cornichon in these organisms. Further evidence for a conservation of cornichon function from yeast to mammalian cells was provided by functional rescue experiments in yeast. We found that CNIH expression rescued the bud site selection phenotype in Erv14-deficient cells with similar efficiency as Erv14 itself. Thus, Cornichon interacted with Gurken in S2 cells, whereas CNIH interacted with Transforming growth factor-beta and amphiregulin in HeLa cells. Our results extend this observation through mutation and coimmunoprecipitation analyses using lysates from mammalian and Drosophila cells.

Our results extend this observation through mutation and coimmunoprecipitation analyses using lysates from mammalian and Drosophila cells. Accordingly, increased CNIH levels enhance the levels of immature Transforming growth factor-beta and decrease Transforming growth factor-beta processing and cell surface presentation. Expression of CNIH in HeLa cells also increased the retention of Transforming growth factor-beta , illustrating the conservation of cornichon function between Drosophila and mammalian cells. However, the regulation of transport by cornichon proteins is likely to involve interaction of cornichon with the COPII complex, as suggested by our electron immunolocalization studies in S2 cells. We hypothesize that the C-terminal cornichon segment plays a key role in the ability of cornichon to regulate transport by interacting with the COPII complex in yeast, Drosophila and mammalian cells.

20220000	We compared oscillatory activity in the primary sensorimotor cortex [Electroencephalography of sensorimotor cortex (sensorimotor cortex-Electroencephalography)] and a motor neuronal pool [surface electromyogram of opponens pollicis (OP-electromyography)], and their coherence in children (4 –12 years of age), young adults (20 –35 years of age), and elderly adults ( 55 years of age). Introduction Detailed studies of task-related changes in the firing of corticospinal neurons provide clear evidence of their individual participation in movement control and reveal the central role of the corticomotoneuronal projection in fractionated movements of intrinsic hand muscles (Matsunami and Hamada, 1983; Lemon et al., 1986; Lemon and Mantel, 1989; Crutcher and Alexander, 1990; Porter and Lemon, 1993; Bennett and Lemon, 1996; Lemon, 1997). The sensorimotor cortex and spinal motor neuronal pools have oscillating networks that display taskdependent phase locking in beta frequencies (Rossignol and Dubuc, 1994; Baker et al., 1997; Brown et al., 1998; Hari and Salenius, 1999; Kilner et al., 1999; Mima and Hallett, 1999b; Nistri et al., 2006; Szurhaj and Derambure, 2006). Corticomuscular coherence (coherence with muscular activity) is mediated via fast-conducting corticomotoneuronal projections (Baker et al., 2003) and is related to performance, the degree of  Received Nov. Giovanni Assenza and P. Matilde Ercolani for their excellent clinical and technical support. These studies provide evidence that synchronization of the oscillations in the beta frequency band between corticospinal neurons and spinal alpha motor neurons provides a mechanism for efficient corticomuscular coupling. At these ages, major changes occur in the cortex, spinal motoneuronal pools, and corticospinal tract. The morphological properties of alpha-motoneurons and their excitatory and inhibitory control mature during development and are altered in the elderly (O'Sullivan et al., 1991; Erim et al., 1999; Mc Donough et al., 2001; Mentis et al., 2002; Furlan et al., 2007; Carlin et al., 2008; Sibilla and Ballerini, 2009). This task was chosen because: visual feedback would have introduced a confounding factor for com-(1) it is known to involve the corticomotoneuronal system (Kuypers, parisons across age groups. Electromyography electromyography indirectly assesses the oscillatory activity of the spinal motor neuronal groups, since a spinal motoneuron and the corresponding muscle fibers form a motor unit with 1:1 correspondence of their action potentials (McAuley et al., 1997). electromyography was recorded using surface-mounted electrodes from right opponens pollicis (right opponens pollicis-electromyography) and left OP (LOP-electromyography) to control for possible mirroring of the contraction. The PSD depends on the number of synchronously oscillating neurons and their degree of synchrony at a defined frequency. Relative right opponens pollicis-electromyography: As absolute electromyography power decreases during life, which may reflect contributions of non-neuronal factors, the relative powers of electromyography recorded over right opponens pollicis were reported; the black arrowheads indicate the projections on the x-axis of the maximal peak of the right opponens pollicis-electromyography PSD: the shift with age is evident. ber of cortical synapses decreases substantially (Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997); with no large-scale neuronal loss, reduced connectivity between neurons must occur. The higher power of the sensorimotor cortex-Electroencephalography in childhood is likely therefore to reflect greater, nonspecific neuronal connectivity, leading to a high degree of synchrony in neural oscillations.

However, the capacity for spinal modifferent performance from the subjects without ipsilateral coherence with muscular activity toneuronal pools to oscillate at higher frequencies is also depen-[p 0.704, ANOVA with between-subject factor: ipsilateral dent upon fast synaptic inhibition and developmental changes in coherence with muscular activity (present/not present)]. Changes in power and frequency of oscillations in the elderly Although there is no overt loss of neurons during normal aging (Haug and Eggers, 1991), the complexity of dendrite arborization becomes reduced (Anderson and Rutledge, 1996) and there is a significant reduction in synaptic density (Huttenlocher, 1979). This finding implies that loss of synapses is counterbalanced by increased numbers of neurons synchronously oscillating, increasing the power observed at the scalp. Beta frequency oscillation has recently attracted attention as the coordinating frequency for large-scale or widely separated networks because its periodicity is sufficiently long to coordinate neuronal activity separated in time by appre-  ciable axonal conduction delays (Kopell et al., 2000). Studies in monkeys highlight the importance of beta frequency activity to the corticospinal system; during the steady-hold phase of a precision grip, increased synchrony in the beta frequency occurs across the motor cortex (Murthy and Fetz, 1992; Baker et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2006), the modal interspike intervals of corticospinal axons lie in the beta frequency (Lemon and Mantel, 1989), and there is preferential facilitation of spinal motoneurons by corticospinal input within the beta frequency band (Lemon and Mantel, 1989). Oscillations synchronized with those in electromyography appear in peripheral afferents (Baker et al., 2006), spinal cord interneurons (Takei and Seki, 2008), and sensory and motor cortices (Porcaro et al., 2008), and coherence between oscillations in the primary motor and sensory cortices has been confirmed in man using magnetoencephalography (Porcaro et al., 2008) and epicortical recordings using subdural grid electrodes (Ohara et al., 2000).

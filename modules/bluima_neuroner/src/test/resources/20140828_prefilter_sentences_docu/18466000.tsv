18466000	These papillae have two types of elongated cells: many peripheral cells and few larger central cells with microvilli and bundles of microtubules oriented along the major axis of the cells. Only the central cells of the papillae were stained and the axons appeared to arise from the proximal ends of these cells. Branches of the same nerve appear to connect to the basal ends of the peripheral cells. The reported observations raise the hypothesis that the central cells of the adhesive papillae might be primary sensory neurons and that they may have chemosensory function. In the genera Molgula and Eugyra tadpoles are apapillate, but larvae of Molgula occidentalis have primary sensory cells at the ante-  * Corresponding author: Tel. rior end of the trunk and glandular epidermal cells secrete adhesives at the onset of metamorphosis (Torrence and Cloney, 1983; Burighel and Cloney, 1997). Adhesive papillae are formed by the anterior epidermal cells and are induced together with the nervous system by the A4.1 cells and by their progeny (Ortolani, 1954). Usually three ectodermal areas at the anterior end of the trunk thicken as their cells elongate. In solitary ascidians papillae are anterior, disposed in a triangular field, but the number and the spatial disposition can vary among different ascidian species, and the cellular organization of the papillae is also very different, as shown by light and electron microscopy studies of many authors. In most compound ascidians are present complex everting papillae, they are formed of many kinds of cells with different functions, as demonstrated by  the ultrastructure of Polysyncraton lacazei, Diplosoma spongiforme and Ecteinascidia turbinata (Turon, 1991), Diplosoma macdonaldi (Torrence and Cloney, 1983) and Distaplia occidentalis (Cloney, 1978). Several kinds of different cells have been described: glandular cells with the cytoplasm filled with rough endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles containing electrondense granules, sensory cells bearing cilia and microvilli with bulbous apical terminals and other cells recognized as primary sensory neurons, the basal processes of which are axons that join together to form a papillary nerve. The mechanism of eversion may be different, but myoepithelial cells with myofilaments in their cytoplasm play an important role. In Clavelina lepadiformis (Turon, 1991), there is a single kind of secretory cell. In many other solitary ascidians the papillae are conic and are formed of two kinds of cells: elongated peripheral cells, probably secretory, and a few tall central cells thought to be sensory. TEM studies of Ascidia malaca (Gianguzza and Dolcemascolo, 1994, 1997) showed some differences in the papillae between the peripheral and the central cells which are thought to be sensory cells. The connection between the cells and the papillary nerve was found in the sections examined, but without serial sections the authors could not follow the course of the nerve. Larvae at the same stage, observed by interference contrast microscopy reveal papillae with slightly elongated cells (Fig. 2A). The cells of the papillae show only a diffuse fluorescence, probably from the few microtubles scattered in the cytoplasm and not yet organized into bundles (Fig. 2B,C), whereas the epidermal cells around the papillae are not fluorescent. The papillary cells are elongated, more than twice as high as the ectodermal ones (Fig. 3A). In sections it is possible to recognize two kinds of cells: many elongated peripheral cells surrounding a few larger and elongated ones in the center of the papilla (Fig. 3C). Peripheral cells form a columnar simple epithelium continuous with the epidermis of the trunk. Between the peripheral and the central cells there is a lumen that is an extension, inside the papilla, of the hemocoel (Fig. 3C).

(B, C) FITC-conjugated anti-β-tubulin antibody immunofluorescence showing diffuse fluorescence in the cells of the papillae and bright fluorescence in the papillary nerves. Two optical sections of the papillae at different levels, obtained by laser scan confocal microscopy show the same intensity of fluorescence in the peripheral and the central cells (Fig. 3D,E), but with the antibody 2-28-33, which specifically reacts with neuronal β-tubulin, fluorescence was positive in the nerves (Fig. 3F) and was also present in a prismatic area of the papilla corresponding to that of the central cells. The peripheral cells were not stained. Each papilla is connected with two thin branches to the papillary nerve, one branch connected to the central cells, the second to the peripheral cells (Fig. 3B,D,E).

(C) High magnification of the top of the papillae showing the bright fluorescence in central cells. After anti-β-tubulin antibody staining, optical sections reveal fluorescence in both the peripheral and the central cells, but the last are more brightly fluorescent, with an evident nerve connection to the brain (Fig. 4B). The anti-β-tubulin fluorescence is evident in the central cells but there is none in the peripheral cells and in the microvilli (Fig. 4C,D). At this stage too, the nerve connecting the central cells of the papillae to the brain is present, as already clearly shown by specific anti-neuronal β-tubulin antibody and by confocal microscopy (Figs. The anti-β-tubulin immunofluorescence observations provide evidence that in the cytoplasm of the cells of the papillae there are many microtubules organized in bundles and aligned in parallel with the long axis of the cells. After hatching and during the period in which the larvae are actively swimming, the papillary cells change their shape becoming fully elongated. It is well known that microtubules oriented and organized into bundles are responsible for change of the cell shape. In the papillae, as soon as the cells begin to elongate, there is an evident increase of bundles of microtubules, as demonstrated by the intensity of the anti-β-tubulin immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of both peripheral and central cells. The papillae of the swimming larvae are not yet sticky and are covered by a double layer of tunic, but we think that the secretory activity occurs during this period in the peripheral cells which are rich in bundles of microtubules. The antibody 2-28-33 has been used by Crowther and Whittaker (1990) to stain neurons in Ciona larvae. In our experiments, the central cells of the papillae were already stained in younger larvae (newly-hatched larvae), but the axons coming from these cells, and the papillary nerves showed intense fluorescence only in older larvae (Fig. 3F,G). We never observed bright fluorescence with this antibody in the peripheral cells. This observation suggests to us that the central cells are primary sensory neurons. The presence of a nerve arising from the central cells of the papillae of the Ascidia malaca, a species closely related to Phallusia mamillata, has been demonstrated by TEM (Gianguzza et al., 1996). In addition, the presence of primary sensory neurons in the papillae of many ascidian species representative of the three suborders: Phlebobranchiata, Aplousobranchiata and Stolidobranchiata has been demonstrated (Torrence and Cloney, 1983). At the beginning of tail retraction, the number of microtubules in the peripheral cells starts to decrease, in larvae with a fully retracted tail anti-β-tubulin immunofluorescence is faint (Fig. 4B). The main function of the microtubule bundles in the peripheral cells seems to be linked to glandular activity, because the microtubules were never stained by anti-neuronal β-tubulin specific antibody, which excludes any correlation with sensory activity. In Ascidia malaca, TEM studies showed a mass of finely granular material, probably adhesives, secreted by peripheral cells and accumulated in the hyaline cap, which is an expansion of the larval tunic above the papilla (Gianguzza and Dolcemascolo, 1994, 1997). In swimming larvae of Phallusia mamillata, the periph-  eral cells of the papillae have a nerve connection to the brain by means of a branch of the papillary nerve, we may hypothesize that this branch of the papillary nerve may act as regulator of the secretory activity at the onset of metamorphosis. In this species, the papillae have cells recognized as primary sensory neurons that bear microvilli. These cells are assumed to be chemoreceptors that are stimulated by contact with the substrate (Cloney and Torrence, 1984). With anti-α-actin immunofluorescence we were able to recognize the microvilli at the apex of the central cells of the swimming larva, long before the moment of settlement, when they were still covered by the double layer of the tunic.

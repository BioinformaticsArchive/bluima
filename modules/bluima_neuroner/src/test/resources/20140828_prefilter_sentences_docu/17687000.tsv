First published August 8, 2007; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00115.2007.—- Treatment of ALA increased the intracellular Ca2 concentration measured by fura-2 fluorescent microscopy (P 0.05), showing that ALA may activate AMP-activated protein kinase through enhancing Ca2 /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase) signaling. Indeed, chelation of intracellular free Ca2 by loading cells with 25 M BAPTA-AM for 30 min abolished the ALA-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and, in turn, phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase at Ser79. Recently, it has been reported that ALA increases insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase in skeletal muscle (28) and also in -cells (43). endothelial cells (27). It is well established that the key function of AMP-activated protein kinase is to regulate the energy balance within the cell. LKB1 is constantly active within cells (30, 35). Phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by LKB1 requires an increase in AMP or AMP mimetic agents in both cultured cells (16) and skeletal muscle (36). calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase phosphorylates and activates AMP-activated protein kinase in an AMPindependent manner, which is triggered instead by a rise in the intracellular Ca2 concentration (17, 19, 49). The discovery that calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase acts as an AMPactivated protein kinase kinase indicates that in addition to an increase of the AMP-to-ATP ratio, AMP-activated protein kinase may also be activated by a rise in the intracellular Ca2 concentration in response to nutrients, drugs, or physiological stimulation. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanism leading to AMP-activated protein kinase activation by ALA in muscle cells. The results we obtained reveal that ALA increased the intracellular Ca2 concentration in C2C12 myotubes. After cells reached confluence, the medium was changed by replacing 10% FBS with 2% horse serum to induce differentiation. To decrease nonspecific immunoprecipitation, cell lysates obtained were preincubated with 40 l of a 50% dilution of protein A-Sepharose in PBS for 2 h at 4°C. AMP-activated protein kinase, calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase, or LKB1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (200 g protein) by the addition of 3 g of respective antibodies and an incubation for 6 h at 4°C followed by the addition of 30 l of a 50% dilution of protein A-Sepharose in PBS. Briefly, cell lysates (50 l) were added into an assay buffer (200 l) containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM DTT, and 60 mM MgCl2. Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used to inhibit calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase expression in C2C12 cells. As a control, a nonspecific siRNA with a scrambled sequence was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-37007) and used to transfect cells at the same time. Briefly, C2C12 cells were plated in 12-well plates the night before the experiment. Transfection was initiated when cell confluence was 50 – 60%. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h and then treated with or without ALA as described above. Briefly, after a separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked, and immunoblotted with primary antibodies overnight. Intracellular Ca2 measurement. Intracellular Ca2 concentrations were measured using the fura-2 technique. The intracellular Ca2 fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature using a spectrofluorometer (Spex, Edison, NJ). Intracellular Ca2 concentrations (in nM) were calculated using the following equation: intracellular Ca2 concentration Kd[(R Rmin)/(Rmax R)] (12). To prepare solution A, the proper amount of BSA needed to prepare a 2% solution, unlabeled palmitic acid to achieve a final concentration 0.5 mM, and [14C]palmitic acid to make a 1 Ci/ml solution were weighed, incubated in a water bath to melt the palmitic acid, and then used for cell treatments. Effects of ALA on the intracellular Ca2 concentration of C2C12 myotubes. Intracellular Ca2 was measured using the fura-2 technique as detailed in MATERIALS AND METHODS. ALA does not change intracellular energy status. Since AMP-activated protein kinase is the intracellular sensor and an increase in the AMP-to-ATP ratio can lead to AMP-activated protein kinase activation, we measured the intracellular ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations along with AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with ALA for 6 h did not change intracellular ATP, ADP, and AMP levels or the calculated AMP-to-ATP ratio (Table 1). Chelation of intracellular free Ca2 abolished ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. Intracellular Ca2 is the trigger for ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase activation. Incubation of C2C12 myotubes with ALA for 6 h increased the intracellular free Ca2 concentration in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3), consistent with AMP-activated protein kinase activation and acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser79 induced by ALA. The intracellular Ca2 concentration increased from 104 nM within C2C12 myotubes without ALA (control) to 281 nM when myotubes were incubated with 500 M ALA for 6 h (Fig. 3). To further confirm the role of intracellular Ca2 in the ALAinduced AMP-activated protein kinase activation, we used a cell membrane-permeable Ca2 chelator, BAPTA-AM, to eliminate intracellular free Ca2 . Incubation of C2C12 myotubes with 25 M BAPTA-AM for 30 min before treatment of cells with ALA completely abolished the ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase activation and acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser79 (Fig. 4, A and B), which was correlated with the absence of a Ca2 surge in myotubes receiving both ALA and BAPTA-AM (Fig. 4C). These data show that intracellular Ca2 is necessary for AMP-activated protein kinase activation stimulated by ALA. ALA stimulation did not change the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio within C2C12 myotubes, indicating that LKB1 was unlikely involved in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by ALA. On the other hand, ALA incubation increased the intracellular Ca2 con-  Fig. Next, we used siRNA transfection to silence CaMKKexpression in C2C12 cells. Compared with the control without siRNA and the control with siRNA of the scrambled sequence, incubation of C2C12 cells with specific CaMKKsiRNA decreased calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- content within cells by 85%. Protein expression of calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- within cells transfected with the specific siRNA became almost undetectable (Fig. 7A). Consistent with the downregulation of calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- , preincubation of C2C12 cells with calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- siRNA inhibited ALAstimulated AMP-activated protein kinase activation (Fig. 8). Incubation of cells with 200 M ALA for 6 h significantly (P 0.05) increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in cells preincubated with transfection reagent only or siRNA with a scrambled sequence compared with untreated cells. For cells preincubated with calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- siRNA, incubation of cells with 200 M ALA for 6 h did not increase AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Correlating with AMP-activated protein kinase activity, preincubation of C2C12 cells with calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- siRNA also abolished ALA-stimulated acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation (Fig. 8). All these results show that calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- is the upstream AMPactivated protein kinase kinase that mediates ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase activation in C2C12 cells. In addition, this phosphorylation was inhibited by BAPTA-AM, which removed intercellular Ca2 , and STO-609, which inhibited calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase activity (Fig. 9), showing that calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase is the AMPactivated protein kinase kinase leading to AMP-activated protein kinase activation induced by ALA. 7. Effect of calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- silence on calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase expression and AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation of C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were incubated with transfection reagent only (control) or in the presence of non-specific short interferingRNA (control siRNA) or synthetic RNA duplexes targeted against mouse calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- . After transfection, cells were grown in DMEM for 48 h. Recently, it has been demonstrated that ALA activates AMP-activated protein kinase, a kinase that has a key role in mediating energy metabolism in cells (10, 14, 25, 26, 51). C2C12 cells were first preincubated with transfection reagent only (control) or in the presence of nonspecific siRNA (control siRNA) or synthetic RNA duplexes targeted against mouse calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- . After transfection, cells were grown in DMEM for 48 h and then treated with or without ALA for 6 h. ALA activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells mitigated vascular dysfunction by normalizing lipid metabolism (27). The possible reason may be due  to the competitive inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by ALA in cultured cells, because ALA has a very similar structure with palmitic acid, which may inhibit palmitate oxidation at high levels. In agreement with the above reports, the present in vitro study shows that ALA activates AMP-activated protein kinase and increases acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser79 in skeletal muscle cells. This result is in agreement with a previous report (32) on ALA and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells, where ALA stimulated glucose uptake before 6 h and then declined. transforming growth factor- -activated kinase 1 directly phosphorylates AMP-activated protein kinase in HeLa cells (33). Our data showed that ALA modulates intracellular Ca2 mobilization and increases the intracellular Ca2 concentration. Our results showed that ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited by chelation of intracellular free Ca2 , selective inhibition of calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase by STO-609, and silence of calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase- expression by siRNA. It has been demonstrated that hyperosmotic stress and the antidiabetic drug metformin activate AMP-activated protein kinase independent of AMP within muscle cells (11). It has also been reported that metformin could modulate intracellular Ca2 mobilization (3, 37). So, it is likely that metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase in muscle cells by the regulation of the intracellular Ca2 concentration. More recently, two groups of researchers from different laboratories (9, 45) have reported that other fatty acids, palmitate and linoleate, activated AMP-activated protein kinase, increased acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation with no change in the AMP-toATP ratio in skeletal cells. This notion is fortified by a recent report (41) showing that thrombin activated AMP-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells via a calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase-dependent pathway. These results 15. suggest that calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase activation may play an 16. important role in cell responses to nutrients, hormones, and certain drugs in skeletal muscle. AMP-activated protein kinase in C2C12 myotubes by the increasing intracellular Ca2 concentration, which then binds to and activates calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase, leading to AMP-activated protein kinase activation without a change of the 18. As a function of AMP-activated protein kinase activation, ALA stimulates fatty acid oxidation in C2C12 cells.

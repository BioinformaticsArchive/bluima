Bertoncello Australian Stem Cell Centre, Melbourne, Australia  T. Vaccination was performed targeting a highly aggressive, weakly immunogenic, subcutaneous, syngeneic, colon adenocarcinoma cell line MC38 which highly expresses c-Myb. Vaccination generated anti-tumor immunity mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased inWltration of immune eVector cells at the tumor site. c-Myb is a transcription factor and nuclear proto-oncogene which functions as a key regulator of cell growth, diVerentiation and survival [38]. Regulated expression is essential for expansion of stem and progenitor cells and the survival of diVerentiated cells in both the haematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems [37, 38] with partial loss of c-Myb expression leading to defects in these tissue compartments [29]. Additionally, mice lacking c-Myb expression die in uterus by day 15 [30] and the forced diVerentiation of colorectal cancer cell lines results in decreased c-Myb expression, cessation of proliferation and an increase in apoptosis [47]. The promiscuous CD4+ Th help provided by these peptides operates via three mechanisms: (i) by enhancing both CD8+ CTL [1, 9] and CD4+ Th [18] responses to self antigens; (ii) providing the capacity for CD8+ T cell memory [23]; and (iii) by breaking tolerance to self antigens [18]. These peptides have been successfully used to provide T cell help to humoral immune responses targeting cell-surface tumor antigens [27, 39] or foreign pathogens [14, 16]. To this end, we chose a DNA vaccination strategy to utilise active immunity with the potential for lasting T cell-mediated memory rather than repeated passive transfer of engineered immune cells and antibodies. Here, we describe a DNA fusion vaccine comprising the proto-oncogene c-Myb and two tetanus toxin peptides, which provides CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated protection against subcutaneous colorectal cancer-growth in the absence of autoimmune pathology. Materials and methods  Mice and cell lines  All mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal experimental ethics committee guidelines of Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (East Melbourne, Australia). The MC38 [12] adenocarcinoma cell line (kindly provided by Dr. JeV Schlom, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and LIM1215 colon cancer cell line [52] were maintained in RPMI, supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin and L-glutamine (Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO . 2  Western blotting  Protein transfer, antibody protocols and anti-Myb antibodies Mab1.1 and 6.2 have been described previously [35]. Expression of protein vaccines  Protein expression in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was demonstrated by transient transfection of HEK293 cells and preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by hypotonic lysis [35]. MC38 cells for injection were harvested from culture plates, washed once and resuspended at 5 + 106 ml-1 or 5 + 107 ml-1 in serum-free RPMI to observe survival and tumor growth  kinetics, respectively. Mice had their lower abdomen shaved the day prior to subcutaneous challenge with 5 + 105 or 5 + 106 MC38 cells in 100 l of serum-free media, to observe survival and tumor growth kinetics, respectively. In vivo depletion of immune cells  Six groups of mice (n = 8–10) were vaccinated twice with P2-Myb-P30 and challenged with MC38 by the standard protocol. Individual groups were then administered with antibodies by intraperitoneal injection to deplete CD4 (100 g GK1.5, rat IgG2b) and/or CD8 (100 g 53–6.7, rat IgG2a, Sigma) T cells or NK cells (20 g anti-asialoGM1 antibody, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) on days 0, 1 and 7 relative to tumor challenge. Detection of speciWc P2-Myb-P30 vaccine-induced cytotoxic T cells  The cytolytic capacity of T cells from vaccinated mice was determined by 4-h 51Cr release assay, as described previously [13]. Prior to assay, splenic T cells were restimulated in co-culture with irradiated MC38 in media supplemented with 50 U/ml IL-2 for 4 days. Absolute white blood cell, platelet and hematocrit counts were performed on an Advia 120 Analyser (Bayer). DiVerential white blood cell counts were performed by counting 100 consecutive cells for each blood smear. Bone marrow stem cell colony assay  High and low proliferative potential colony-forming cells from femoral bone marrow of mice vaccinated three times were assayed in a double layer nutrient agar culture system as previously described [6]. Flow cytometric analysis of T cell inWltrates, T cell activation status and MHC-I expression  Tumors from day 14 mice (n = 5–9) were digested with collagenase 4 (Worthington, NJ) in DMEM (Gibco) at 37°C for 30 min and passed through a sterile Wlter (40 m) to remove cellular debris. Resultant suspensions were washed with FACS buVer (PBS, 2% FCS) and 106 cells stained in the presence of Fc receptor blocker 24G.2 for four-color staining analysis. Samples were analysed using a cytometer (FACS-LSR; Becton Dickinson) with viable cells gated by Xuorogold exclusion (Invitrogen). 1 DNA fusion vaccine structure and expression in HEK293 cells. Expression of P2-Myb-P30, P2enhanced GFP-P30 and MybFLAG vaccines was analysed by transfection into HEK293 cells and Western Blot with all expressed proteins of anticipated molecular weight calculated from the constituent proteins and peptides; P2-MybP30 80 kDa, P2-enhanced GFP-P30 37.5 kDa and MybFLAG 75 kDa (Fig. 1b). Colon adenocarcinoma cell line MC38 highly expresses c-Myb  The murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line MC38 has highly elevated c-Myb expression compared to the human HNPCC cell line LIM1215, as determined by Western Blot analysis (Fig. 1c), and both cell lines express substantially more c-Myb than normal colon mucosa [36]. Expression of c-Myb and target genes GRP-78 and Cox-2 in MC38 and LIM1215 cells is shown with pan-actin serving as a loading control (c)  expression was measured using two diVerent anti-Myb monoclonal antibodies; Mab 1.1 and Mab 6.2 and was restricted to the nuclear fraction (N) compared to the cytosol (C) as expected. Given the high level expression of c-Myb in MC38 cells they were employed with the expectation that they would serve as a good immunotherapeutic target to use in this study. For these experiments we chose the mouse colon carcinoma cell line MC38 which grows aggressively in syngeneic mice as a subcutaneous tumor and expresses high levels of c-Myb as shown in Fig. Mice were vaccinated once (a, d), twice (b) or three times (c) prior to challenge with MC38 cells. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are essential for mediating P2-Myb-P30 induced immunity  To identify the speciWc immune T cell subsets involved in the anti-tumor immune response we performed in vivo depletion experiments. Groups of P2-Myb-P30 vaccinated mice were treated with MAC-4 control antibody (rat IgG) or antibodies to deplete CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells or NK cells and then challenged subcutaneously with 5 + 106 MC38 tumor cells. By contrast, depletion of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells completely removed protection resulting in tumor growth similar to the P2-enhanced GFP-P30 control group (Fig. 3a). 3 P2-Myb-P30 induced anti-tumor immunity is c-Myb speciWc and mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Mice (n = 8–10) were vaccinated twice with P2-Myb-P30 and selectively depleted of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells or NK cells as indicated. MC38 target cells were used at a range of E:T ratios and mean percent speciWc lysis was calculated (b). Error bars are SEM  Depletion of NK cells or MAC-4 depleted control mice showed a similar anti-tumor response to P2-Myb-P30 treated mice. Taken together, these data indicate essential roles for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but not for NK cells, in the eVector phase of the anti-tumor immune response elicited by P2-Myb-P30 immunisation. Vaccination generates MC38 speciWc cytotoxic T lymphocytes in a P2-Myb-P30 dependent manner  To conWrm the generation of T cell-mediated immunity targeting MC38 cells, restimulated splenocytes from P2Myb-P30 vaccinated mice were used to perform a 4-h 51Cr release assay with MC38 target cells. Number and activation state of immune eVector cell inWltrates are increased by P2-Myb-P30 vaccination  The number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and APC tumor inWltrates and T cell activation status were determined by Xow cytometry. CD8+ T cell tumor inWltrates from P2-Myb-P30 vaccinated mice demonstrated increased activation (Fig. 4b) at d7 and a signiWcant increase in numbers at d14 (Fig. 4a). Additionally, a general increase in CD8+ T cell activation status (CD44+, CD62Llow) was observed from d7 to d14 irrespective of treatment (Fig. 4b). P2Myb-P30 vaccination also led to an increase in macrophage (CD11b+, CD11c-) inWltrate in d7 tumors although dendritic cells (CD11b+, CD11c-) were unaVected (Fig. 4c). Surprisingly, given the impact of immunity observed in our depletion studies, CD4+ T cell inWltrate numbers and activation status were unchanged (data not shown). 4 P2-Myb-P30 vaccination increases both CD8+ T cell tumor inWltration and activation and macrophage tumor inWltration. Mice (n = 6–9) were vaccinated twice with P2-Myb-P30 and tumors analysed by FACS for T cell (a) and macrophage (c) inWltration and T cell  tumors was determined by Xow cytometry. This comprised of analysis of (1) cell numbers in peripheral blood, (2) stem and progenitor cell proliferative capacity in bone marrow and (3) c-Myb expression and length of gastrointestinal crypts. Analysis of peripheral blood showed no signiWcant diVerence between P2-Myb-P30 and all control cohorts in platelet count (Fig. 6a), percentage hematocrit (data not shown) or white blood cell counts (Fig. 6b) indicating an absence of any detectable autoimmunity in this compartment. Evidence for immune targeting of c-Myb expressing stem cells in gastrointestinal crypts was analysed by immunohistochemical staining for c-Myb and analysis of crypt length. Comparison of P2-Myb-P30 vaccinated mice to the P2-enhanced GFP-P30 control group indicated no reduction in either the number or intensity of cells stained with c-Myb in crypts of all three lower GI sections analysed (Fig. 6c). Finally, to assess potential autoimmune targeting of c-Myb expressing stem and progenitor cells in the femoral bone marrow, we employed a surrogate assay to observe the status of high proliferation potential-colony forming cells and low proliferation potential colony forming cell, respectively [1]. In a result analogous to diVerentiated hemopoietic cells in peripheral blood, P2-Myb-P30 vaccination had no signiWcant eVect on either incidence or total content of both high (high proliferative potential) and low (low proliferative potential) proliferative capacity cells in bone marrow (Fig. 6d i, ii). Peripheral blood from mice vaccinated twice or three times with P2Myb-P30 as indicated was analysed for platelets (a) and white blood cells (b). Discussion  In this study, we demonstrated eYcacy of a P2-Myb-P30 vaccine design in breaking peripheral tolerance and generating eVective T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Unlike cell-surface antigens [39], adaptive immune responses are limited to cellular immunity when targeting intracellular antigens such as c-Myb, which are not available to the humoral arm of the immune system. This model system used a challenge dosage of MC38 cells considerably higher than published models [21, 46] to ensure complete  lin to observe c-Myb expression (c). Bone marrow from mice (n = 5) vaccinated three times with P2-Myb-P30 were plated under conditions that allow colony formation of cells with low proliferative potential and high proliferative potential per 25,000 plated cells (i) or per femur (ii) (d). In Addition, circumstantial  evidence for c-Myb speciWcity was provided by an in vitro 51Cr release assay in which speciWc lysis of MC38 tumor target cells increased with eVector CTL derived from P2Myb-P30 vaccinated mice, compared to control cohorts. In vivo depletion of T cells identiWed both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as essential mediators of immunity following P2-Myb-P30 vaccination. These results indicate the success of the vaccine design in generating cell-mediated, antitumor immunity targeting the c-Myb overexpressing colorectal cancer cell line MC38, through the activation of both CTL and Th responses. Analysis of immune inWltrates at the tumor site identiWed a signiWcant increase in both the activation (d7) and number (d14) of CD8+ T cells and macrophages (d7) in P2-Myb-P30 vaccinated mice. This increased inWltration of immune eVector cells correlated with the anti-tumor activity of the P2-Myb-P30 vaccine. Nevertheless our depletion studies conWrmed an important role for these cells. The importance of immune cell inWltration in colorectal cancer prognosis was highlighted by two recent clinical studies; in humans, T cell tumor inWltration was a superior prognostic indicator compared to Duke's histopathological staging [17] and, increased macrophage inWltration in colorectal cancer correlates with improved prognosis [15]. Mechanisms by which tumors may escape immune surveillance are many and operate by the selection of resistant tumor cells, termed immunoediting [45]. Expression of c-Myb can be detected in the stem and progenitor cells of a number of endogenous tissues and disruption of this expression has severe deleterious eVects on tissue integrity [29]. Consequently, potential immune targeting of these cells poses a signiWcant risk to patient welfare. Progenitor cells in gastrointestinal crypts of the  proximal and distal small intestine and colon showed normal c-Myb expression with both cell numbers and morphology identical to controls. In peripheral blood, platelet numbers and diVerential white blood cell counts showed no signiWcant diVerence between vaccinated and control mice. To further extend the analysis, we studied the proliferative capacity of stem and progenitor cells in femoral bone marrow. This compartment comprises a population of c-Myb expressing cells, which represent the most stringent analysis of autoimmunity due to the high sensitivity of these cells to stress. Neither CFC incidence nor content of stem and progenitor cells was signiWcantly aVected by P2-Myb-P30 vaccination. The results of this study demonstrated that a c-Myb DNA vaccine could break peripheral tolerance and generate eVective, cell-mediated, anti-tumor immunity targeting a model of colorectal cancer which over-expresses c-Myb.

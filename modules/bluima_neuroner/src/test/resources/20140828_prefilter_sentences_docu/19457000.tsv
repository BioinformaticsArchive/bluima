19457000	We collected data in 2006 from 310 Registered Nurses to investigate the factors that influence their willingness to embrace the changes necessary for the high levels of excellence accompanying Magnet status. Keywords: change, context, individual differences, Magnet status, nurses, process, readiness  excellence in nursing care, and it is meaningful to hospitals because evidence has shown an increase in quality of patient care associated with this status (Havens 2001). Given that radical changes inevitably upset the status quo for nurses and will therefore tend to be avoided, (Hicks 1996), the setting for this study afforded an excellent opportunity to understand further both individual and organizational factors that influence employees' (e.g. nurses) responses to a change where inertia for the status quo is high. Although reflecting a complex composite of influences, by parcelling individual and group influences on change readiness, our findings provide nurse managers with a stronger basis for facilitating change.

19307000	These radio-probes, because of their short half-lives, must be produced as needed in a lead-shielded hot cell with remotely controlled and automated equipment that is capable of synthesizing the radio-probe, purification and formulation of the radiopharmaceutical preparation for intravenous injection, all within only two to three half-lives of the radioisotope. The hydrophilic interaction chromatography procedure utilizing a semi-preparative silica column and high volatile organic mobile phase led to excellent separation of the target Positron emission tomography probe from chemical/radiochemical impurities within a very short run time of purification and formulation for intravenous injection.

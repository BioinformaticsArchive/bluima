17975000	LCL2 cells were selected for the in vivo study among six B-lymphoma cell lines for their high susceptibility to rituximab-dependent complement-mediated killing enhanced by MB55 and MB59. The cells injected i.p. primarily colonized the liver and spleen, leading to the death of the animals within 30 to 40 days. Thirty percent of mice receiving biotin-labeled rituximab (25 Mg) i.p. on days 4 and 11 after cell injection survived to 120 days. Surprisingly, 40% of mice survived after the sole injection of avidin and biotinlabeled MB55–MB59, an observation consistent with the in vitro data showing that the miniantibodies induced killing of f25% cells through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. In conclusion, MB55 and MB59 targeted to tumor cells represent a valuable tool to enhance the therapeutic effect of rituximab and other complement-fixing antitumor antibodies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10556–63]  Introduction  Several chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies against different antigens expressed by neoplastic cells have been developed to obtain more specific and less toxic agents for cancer treatment. Satisfactory results in the immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies have been obtained using two monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD20 (rituximab; refs. 6), expressed on the surface of tumor cells and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non–Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively (7). 8, 9), antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity; ref. Xenograft models of lymphoma in mice lacking FcR-g chain (12), or treated with neutralizing antibodies against mouse FcgR (13, 14), have provided evidence for the contribution of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity to the therapeutic activity of rituximab. Data from several groups are also available indicating that B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and fresh B-lymphoma cells expressing CD20 can be killed by complement activated by rituximab (9, 15–17). The susceptibility of these cells to complement-dependent cytotoxicity is partly related to the expression level of CD20 on the cell surface, but it is also dependent on the ability of rituximab to induce the translocation of CD20 into lipid rafts (18), which favors the clustering of antibodies and, in turn, promotes C1q binding. The complement system has a definite advantage over cytotoxic cells as an in vivo defense system against cancer because it is made of soluble molecules that can easily reach the tumor site and diffuse inside the tumor mass. Moreover, complement components are readily available as a first line of defense against cancer cells because they are locally synthesized by many cell types, including macrophages (20), fibroblasts (21), and endothelial cells (22, 23). However, a major limitation of complement as an effector system against tumor cells is represented by the complement-regulatory proteins expressed on the cell surface (membrane complement regulatory proteins; refs. It has been previously shown that CD55 and CD59 mainly contribute to the protection of complement-mediated killing of CD20+ cells induced by rituximab (8). This observation led us to hypothesize that neutralizing these two CRPs would greatly improve the beneficial effect of rituximab on B lymphoma cells. In vitro studies have shown that complement-dependent cytotoxicity of a lymphoma cell line induced by rituximab is significantly enhanced in the presence of MB55 and MB59 (26). Evidence will be presented indicating that MB55 and MB59 targeted to tumor cells increase the ability of rituximab to eradicate established EBV+ B-lymphoma xenografts enhancing both complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. MB55 and MB59 were purified from the supernatant of transfected HEK293T cells as previously described (26). Three in vitro –derived EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines and three EBV+ cell lines obtained ex vivo from severe combined immunodeficiency mice injected with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from EBV+ donors (Hu-severe combined immunodeficiency1– 3; ref. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats obtained from blood donors or from murine blood by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia Biotech) gradient centrifugation, and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS, 2 mmol/L of glutamine and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL). Blood as a source of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum was obtained from female BALB/c mice kept as a colony at the Animal House of the University of Trieste. Lymphoma cells (5  105) were first incubated with the primary antibodies to CD20, CD55 or CD59, or isotype-matched control IgG (5 Ag/mL) in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37jC and then with the appropriate FITCconjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37jC. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). The complement-dependent cytotoxicity procedure described by Ziller et al. (26) to evaluate the effect of the neutralizing miniantibodies on the complement susceptibility of B-lymphoma cells was followed in detail. Briefly, 2  105/50 AL cells were incubated with rituximab (2 Ag/mL) with or without MB55 and MB59 (10 Ag/mL each) to a final volume of 100 AL for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of PNHS (25%). After further incubation at 37jC for 1 h, the number of residual viable cells was estimated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (28) and the percentage of dead cells was calculated. Briefly, EBV+ lymphoblastoid cells were expanded in vitro prior to i.p. injection (2  106) into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. To investigate the ability of MB55 and MB59 to induce apoptosis of lymphoma cells, 2  105/50 AL LCL2 cells were incubated with biotin-labeled rituximab (2 Ag/mL) and/or biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59 (10 Ag/mL) for 48 h and apoptosis was assessed by terminal nucleotidyl transferase– mediated nick end labeling assay (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. The procedure described by Spiridon et al. (32) to investigate the ability of MB55 and MB59 to induce cell cytotoxicity was followed with some modifications. Briefly, lymphoma cells were stained with the green fluorescence cytoplasmic dye 5- and (6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidylester (CSFE;Molecular Probes, Inc.), using 25 AL of a 10 Amol/L solution/106 cells for 7 min at 37jC. After washing, the labeledLCL2 cells (2  105) were incubated first with biotin-labeled rituximab (2 Ag/mL) for 30 min at 4jC and, when required, with the mixture of biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59 (10 Ag/mL each) for an additional 30 min at the same temperature. peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effector (E) cells were mixed with target (T) cells at 50:1 E/T cell ratio and incubated for 4 h at 37jC in 5% CO2. The cells were then centrifuged and assayed for dye release with Infinite F200 (Tecan). Dead cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed on a FACScalibur instrument to control the data obtained by measuring dye release. Results complement-dependent cytotoxicity of lymphoblastoid cells induced by rituximab is enhanced by MB55 and MB59. To evaluate the contribution of complement-mediated killing of lymphoma cells sensitized by anti-CD20 and the enhancing effect of neutralizing antibodies to CD55 and CD59 in an in vivo model, we first screened human  EBV-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL1-3 and Hu-severe combined immunodeficiency1–3) established by Piovan and coworkers (27) for their susceptibility to complement-dependent cytotoxicity. These cell lines were shown to induce lymphoma in severe combined immunodeficiency mice (29), and were therefore considered suitable to test the in vivo therapeutic effect of rituximab, MB55, and MB59. The cells were incubated with murine monoclonal antibodies to CD20, CD55, and CD59 and analyzed by flow cytometry using appropriate FITClabeled secondary antibodies. The results obtained (data not shown) indicate that CD20 was variably expressed on the cell lines examined, with the highest value observed on LCL1 and the lowest on LCL3, whereas CD55 and CD59 were uniformly distributed on the surface of these cells. Next, we assessed the effect of rituximab (2 Ag/mL) on complement-dependent killing of EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines and the ability of MB55 and MB59 (10 Ag/mL each), neutralizing CD55 and CD59, respectively, to enhance the cytolytic activity of complement. To this end, the cells were exposed to the chimeric mAb and PNHS (25%) as a source of complement, and the number of cells killed was counted after 1 h of incubation at 37jC. Such low levels of cytotoxicity suggested that surface-expressed complement regulators might account for the resistance of these cells to complement attack. Because CD55 and CD59 were previously found to be mainly responsible for cell protection from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (8), the cells were incubated with rituximab and PNHS in the presence of MB55 and MB59. The results presented in Table 1 show that the percentage of cells killed under these experimental conditions increased 2- to 6-fold as compared with the values observed in the absence of the two miniantibodies. MB55 and MB59 were not able to induce complement-dependent lysis when incubated with cells and PNHS. For further experiments, we selected LCL2 because these cells were found to be the most resistant to rituximab-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity in the absence of MB55–MB59 (13%) and the most susceptible to killing after neutralization of CD55 and CD59 (84%). As expected, mouse complement was less efficient than human complement causing only 6% of cell killing induced by rituximab, but this value increased to 36% in the presence of MB55 and MB59. To ascertain if the mixture of MB55 and MB59 and rituximab had a synergistic therapeutic effect, a lymphoma model was developed in  severe combined immunodeficiency mice by injecting i.p. LCL2 cells (2  106). This resulted in the formation of a tumor leading to the death of the animals within 30 to 40 days after cell inoculation (Fig. 1A). At histologic examination, the masses appeared as small-to-medium sized aggregates of irregularlyshaped lymphoid cells (Fig. 1B ) positive for the human B-cell antigens CD20 and CD79a (Fig. 1C and D). Foci of lymphoid cells were seen in the spleen and liver of mice which died as a result of tumor growth, but we failed to detect lymphoma cells infiltrating lungs, kidneys, and skeletal muscles (data not shown). To this end, the animals received LCL2 cells on day 0, followed 4 days later by a single injection of rituximab at doses of 5, 10, 50, or 150 Ag. One group of mice received 25 Ag of rituximab twice on days 4 and 11 after injection of the cells on day 0. As shown in Fig. Targeting of MB55–MB59 to lymphoma cells via the avidinbiotin system. Because CD55 and CD59 are widely expressed on the surface of circulating and tissue cells, we devised a strategy to target MB55 and MB59 to rituximab-coated tumor cells, thus avoiding the risk that these antibodies might bind to host cells and cause undesired complement attack following neutralization of the two CRPs. A three-step biotin-avidin system, currently employed in patients to target radionuclides to cancer cells, was used (33–35). First, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we checked if biotin-labeled rituximab, MB55 (biotin-labeled MB55), and MB59 (biotin-labeled MB59) were still able to recognize CD20, CD55, and CD59 using FITC-streptavidin (data not shown). Next, biorituximab was tested for its ability to cause complement-dependent cytotoxicity of lymphoma cells in the presence or in the absence of biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59.

Effect of increasing doses of rituximab on survival of severe combined immunodeficiency mice challenged with LCL2 cells. Mice were injected i.p. with 2  106 LCL2 cells and treated on day 4 with saline or rituximab at the indicated doses (5–150 Ag). To this end, LCL2 cells (2  105) were incubated with biotin-labeled rituximab (2 Ag/mL) for 10 min at 37jC, followed by 30 min incubation first with avidin (5 Ag/mL) and then with biotin-labeled MB55–MB59 (10 Ag/mL each) at 37jC to a final volume of 150 AL with washes between each step. NHS (50 AL) obtained from a single donor was added as a source of complement and the number of residual viable cells was evaluated after 1 h of incubation at 37jC. 2 indicate that the complement-dependent cytotoxicity of lymphoma cells observed under these experimental conditions was not significantly different from that obtained with unlabeled rituximab, MB55, and MB59. To confirm the efficacy of the three-step biotin-avidin system in targeting MB55 and MB59 to EBV+ lymphoblastoid cells, LCL2 cells were incubated with biotin-labeled antibodies, avidin, and serum  Figure 2. Complement-mediated killing of lymphoblastoid cell lines using the three-step avidin-biotin system. NHS was added and residual viable cells were measured. Despite the high number of red cells, the complement-dependent killing of LCL2 exceeded 60%, a value not significantly different from that obtained in the absence of erythrocytes (Fig. 2). Conversely, only 9% of LCL2 cells were killed in the absence of avidin, suggesting that bystander erythrocytes bound most of the biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59, preventing their targeting to LCL2 which was coated by biotin-labeled rituximab (Fig. 2). However, binding of biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59 to red cells did not result in cell lysis (data not shown), confirming our previous finding that the two miniantibodies are unable to activate complement (26). The in vitro data showed that LCL2 could efficiently be killed even in the presence of erythrocytes provided that the antibodies are targeted to tumor cells. MB55 and MB59 control tumor growth via antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. To explore the possibility that the two anti-CRP antibodies might cause cell killing via apoptosis, LCL2 cells were incubated with the miniantibodies for 48 h and  analyzed by terminal nucleotidyl transferase– mediated nick end labeling assay. Next, we evaluated the contribution of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity to MB55 and MB59-mediated killing of lymphoblastoid cells because antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity is believed to be an important mechanism of cell killing induced by the monoclonal antibodies used in cancer therapy (19). The results obtained with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effector cells show that MB55 and MB59 are able to cause cell cytotoxicity only when used together (Fig. 5B). Mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells proved as effective as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in inducing cell cytotoxicity mediated by the two miniantibodies (data not shown). These antibodies were found to increase rituximab-dependent antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity of LCL2 from 20% to 35%. Neither apoptosis nor antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity induced by biotin-labeled rituximab were enhanced by the addition of avidin and either biotin-labeled MB55 or biotin-labeled MB59 (data not shown). Unfortunately, overexpression of CRPs by tumor cells restricts the destructive effect of complement activated by rituximab, limiting its therapeutic efficacy (8, 40). We now provide data indicating that administration of neutralizing antibodies to CD55 and CD59, in combination with rituximab, enhances the therapeutic effect of the chimeric anti-CD20 mAb in an in vivo model of B-cell lymphoma. The present finding that B-lymphoma cells are protected from complement-dependent cytotoxicity mainly by CD55 and CD59 with a negligible contribution from CD46, despite the good expression of this CRP on the cell surface, extends previous observations published by Golay et al. (8) These data clearly indicate that the expression level of the CRPs does not necessarily correlate with their functional activity and that the in vivo neutralization of the CRPs should be tailored according to their protective role. severe combined immunodeficiency mice (n = 10 per group) received 2  106 LCL2 cells i.p. and one of the following treatments on days 4 and 11 after challenge: saline, biotin-labeled rituximab (25 Ag), biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59 (30 Ag each), or biotin-labeled rituximab (25 Ag), avidin (11 mg), and the mixture of biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59 (biotin-labeled MB55–MB59). Apoptosis and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity of lymphoblastoid cell lines induced by the mixture of MB55–MB59. B, for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, CSFE-labeled LCL2 were coated with biotin-labeled rituximab (2 Ag/mL), with biotin-labeled MB55 (10 Ag/mL) or biotin-labeled MB59 (10 Ag/mL), or the mixture of biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59 (each at 10 Ag/mL) and mixed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a 50:1 cell ratio for 4 h. The neutralizing MB55 and MB59 were effective in increasing the complement-mediated killing of lymphoblastoid cell lines induced by rituximab to a value of 80%. It should be pointed out, however, that the susceptibility of the cell lines to complement-dependent cytotoxicity depends not only on the expression of membrane complement regulatory proteins, which restrict complement activation, but also on the cell surface level of CD20 and on the ability of the anti-CD20 mAb to induce antigen translocation into the lipid raft (18). The combined effect of rituximab, MB55, and MB59 was tested in a xenograft model of B-lymphoma established in severe combined immunodeficiency mice using EBV+ CD20+ lymphoblastoid cell lines (29), and was shown by Mosier et al. (43) to induce the formation of multiple masses made of lymphoblastoid and plasmacytoid human B-lymphocytes in the peritoneum, liver, and lymph nodes. The cells used to test the therapeutic activity of MB55 and MB59 in the in vivo experiments were selected for their susceptibility to killing by human complement following neutralization of CD55 and CD59. Our major concern was that the contribution of complement to the in vivo control of tumor growth in mice could not be properly evaluated because murine complement is not as efficient as human complement in lysing tumor cells. The results of the in vitro cytotoxic assay show that severe combined immunodeficiency mouse serum could kill f40% of LCL2 cells sensitized by rituximab in the presence of MB55 and MB59. The selected dose was administered twice with an interval of 1 week based on the observation made by Di Gaetano et al. (9) that cancer cells were still detected in the spleen and bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice 2 to 3 weeks after i.p. injection of rituximab. The complement system is an ideal effector system to eradicate surviving tumor cells in the animal model and, likewise, to control minimal residual disease in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy that impairs antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity by reducing the number of effector cells (44). A problem to be solved for the therapeutic use of MB55 and MB59 in cancer patients was to devise a strategy to target the two antibodies to rituximab-coated tumor cells. The widespread distribution of membrane complement regulatory proteins on circulating and tissue cells would prevent the binding of the two monoclonal antibodies to tumor cells in a sufficient amount to be clinically effective and may also cause undesired side effects. In addition, biotin-labeled rituximab retained the ability to activate the complement system and to induce antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and both biotin-labeled MB55 and bioMB59 kept their neutralizing activity for CD55 and CD59, respectively. The target specificity of the labeled miniantibodies for lymphoma cells was supported by the finding that >60% of LCL2 cells coated by biotin-labeled rituximab were killed in the presence of human erythrocytes used as bystander cells. The presence of avidin in this system was critical because the percentage of killing of lymphoma cells dropped to 9% in the absence of this protein, suggesting that bystander red cells bound most of the blocking antibodies. The finding that 40% of mice treated with MB55 and MB59 in the absence of rituximab survived 4 months after the inoculum of tumor cells was unexpected. Failure of MB55 and MB59 to activate complement or to cause DNA fragmentation of lymphoblastoid cells revealed in this study by the negative terminal nucleotidyl transferase– mediated nick end labeling staining rules out the possibility that complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis are responsible for their antitumor activity, although their in vivo contribution cannot be excluded. Conversely, the miniantibody-mediated killing of f20% of lymphoblastoid cells induced by human or mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells acting as effector cells rather suggests that antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity contributes, at least in part, to the increased survival of mice treated with biotin-labeled MB55 and biotin-labeled MB59. The definition of the relative contribution of complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity to tumor cell destruction in vivo was outside the scope of the present investigation because it would require the use of animals that selectively lack either effector cells or complement. However, the finding that >80% of lymphoblastoid cells were killed via complement-dependent cytotoxicity when exposed to rituximab, MB55, and MB59, as opposed to 35% of cells killed through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, is in favor of a major role played by complement in the control of tumor growth under this experimental condition, although the in vivo contribution of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity should not be underscored. In conclusion, we have shown that the neutralizing miniantibodies, MB55 and MB59, could be targeted to tumor cells providing a novel therapeutic approach to improve the antitumor activity of rituximab. There are now ways to modify hinge or Fc protein sequences to improve the ability of these antibodies to activate complement or to induce antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (47). Efforts are also being made in our laboratory to produce a bispecific antibody (51) carrying the specificity of the anti-CD20 mAb and of one of the miniantibodies, MB55 and MB59, as a more suitable and efficient treatment for malignant B cells.

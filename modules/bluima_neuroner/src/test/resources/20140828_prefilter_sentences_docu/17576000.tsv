17576000	Maturation of oocytes is initiated by decreases in intracellular cAMP [2,3] and by subsequent activation of the M-phase promoting factor and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [4]. The cumulus–oocyte complexes were denuded of cumulus cells by pipetting in M2 medium (Sigma, M7167), containing 0.1% hyaluronidase (Sigma, H-3506) and the oocytes counted. At the end of maturation culture, well-expanded cumulus–oocyte complexes were selected and denuded of cumulus cells by pipetting in M2 containing 0.1% hyaluronidase. Six hours after the onset of activation treatment, oocytes were observed under a microscope; oocytes with one (1PN) or two pronuclei, or two cells each having a nucleus (2-cell) were considered activated. Oocyte maturation is initiated by decrease in intracellular cAMP [2,3] and by subsequent activation of the M-phase promoting factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways [4].

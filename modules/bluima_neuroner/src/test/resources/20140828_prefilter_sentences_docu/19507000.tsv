19507000	Since that time we have come to acknowledge that nociceptors are primary sensory neurones that are activated by a wide variety of noxious  stimuli (heat, cold, pressure, chemicals, irritants, etc.) but not by innocuous stimuli (Woolf and Salter 2000; Julius and Basbaum 2001). The action potentials so generated travel up the primary sensory neurone to the dorsal root ganglion and on into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. influx permits extremely rapid neurochemical transmission to occur at this synapse as a consequence of the Ca2?-dependent release of glutamate from it stores in the presynaptic terminal, rapid diffusion across the synaptic cleft and activation of AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors on the postsynaptic cell body with consequent opening of sodium (Na?) channels (Fig. 1). Depolarization of the cell body of the second-order sensory neurone then permits the wave of depolarization to rapidly ascend the spinal interneurones en  route to the thalamus from where the excitatory signals are dispersed to the relevant regions of the cerebral cortex. Removal of this plug allows glutamate to depolarize the post-synaptic cell via admittance of Ca2? through the NMDA receptor complex (Fig. 1). Additionally, in certain circumstances, neuropeptides such as substance P are released from the presynaptic terminal of the primary sensory neurone and activate neurokinin type 1 G-protein-coupled receptors on the post-synaptic cell. The primary sensory neurone contains, amongst other substances, the neurotransmitters glutamate and substance P. Glutamate executes very rapid neurotransmission via activation of the post-synaptic AMPA receptors that admit sodium ions, so eliciting depolarization of the cell body of the  second-order sensory neurones. Glutamate elicits a second, slower depolarization of the post-synaptic cell via activation of the NMDA receptors and inward movement of calcium ions. Substance P depolarises the post-synaptic cell via activation of neurokinin type 1 receptors, initiation of the phosphoinositide/protein kinase C pathway and subsequent phosphorylation of the NMDA receptors to admit further calcium ions  Fig. The primary sensory neurone contains, amongst other substances, the neurotransmitters glutamate and substance P.

Critical components in regulating the pain pathway at the level of the spinal cord are the inhibitory neurotransmitters that are released from the terminals of the descending neurones that arise in the cerebral cortical and limbic regions within the brain. These descending fibres are capable of releasing a variety of neurotransmitters that can act both pre-synaptically, to inhibit the release of glutamate for example, and/or post-synaptically to suppress the excitation of the second-order sensory neurones. For both glycine and GABA this is achieved via their release from the terminals of the descending interneurones, diffusion across the synaptic cleft followed by activation of their respective receptor complexes on the cell body of the second-order sensory neurone. The inrush of chloride ions causes hyperpolarization of the cell membrane thereby damping down its excitability. Thus, the net effect of this action of glycine and GABA is to reduce the sensitivity of the postsynaptic cell to the excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, etc. (for references see Woolf and Salter 2000; Woolf 2004). One of the explanations for the development of neuropathic pain, after peripheral nerve injury, is the apparent selective death/loss of the descending interneurones (Moore et al. 2002; Coull et al. 2005; Knabl et al. 2008). This is particularly marked in the case of the GABA-ergic and glycinergic interneurones. Indeed, it has been shown that within 1 week of peripheral nerve injury these inhibitory interneurones undergo apoptotic death within the dorsal horn. 2 that are known to modulate the nociceptors in an excitatory manner are tyrosine kinase A the receptor for nerve growth factor, the transient receptor potential channel V1 (known earlier as the vanilloid or capsaicin receptor), bradykinin receptor(s), the tetrodotoxin-resistant, sensory neuronespecific Na? channel(s) (principally Nav1.8), the adenosine P2X3 receptor and prostaglandin E2 receptors. Once activated tyrosine kinase A turns on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-src kinase signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of intracellular TRPV1 stores which ultimately leads to their enhanced insertion into the nociceptor membrane (Fig. 2) (Wang and Woolf 2005; Patapoutian et al. 2009). 2 Diagrammatic representation of the nociceptor (adapted from tetrodotoxin-resistant, sensory neurone-specific Na? channel(s) (prinJulius and Basbaum 2001). 2 Diagrammatic representation of the nociceptor (adapted from tetrodotoxin-resistant, sensory neurone-specific Na? channel(s) (prinJulius and Basbaum 2001). The first focuses upon development of TRPV1 agonists since it is well known that both capsaicin and resiniferotoxin cause desensitization or reversible sensory neurone degeneration due to prolonged cation influx into the nerve coupled with osmotic damage and metabolic instability (Szallasi et al. 2007). In normal circumstances the B2 receptor is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including nociceptive neurons, whereas the B1 receptor is dormant. When the bradykinin receptor on the surface membrane of nociceptors is stimulated it activates Gq to cause the phospholipase C-catalysed activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, the release of Ca2? from intracellular stores and the activation of protein kinase Ce (Fig. 2). The transmission of pain signals after injury or inflammation of peripheral nociceptors depends on increased excitability of the peripheral neurones. The nociceptors transduce the initial stimuli by creating action potentials which are largely a consequence of the entry of Na? into the neurone (Fig. 2). It has also been established that Nav1.8 is the sensory neurone sodium channel that is essential for detection of pain induced by noxious cold (Zimmermann et al. 2007). A-803467 is[100-fold selective for the human Nav1.8 expressed in recombinant cell lines compared with other Nav channels (1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7) (Jarvis et al. 2007). Some support for this notion comes from experiments where filling and stretching of the urinary bladder is known to cause the release ATP from the stratified columnar epithelial cells. However, there are some reports that antagonists of this receptor sub-type reduce spontaneous discharges and evoked responses of primary sensory neurons and attenuate mechanical hyperalgesia after nerve injury (McGaraughty and Jarvis 2005; Sharp et al. 2006). At the peripheral nociceptor it is now well accepted that PGE2 binds to its cell surface G-protein-coupled receptor (either EP1 or EP2â€”the specific identity is not yet known) which in turn activates Gs (Fig. 2). The cannabinoid type 1 receptors receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are also found in peripheral sensory neurones. Additionally, P2X4 receptors on microglia, involved in the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, are also attractive possible targets. entry into the presynaptic terminal of the primary sensory neurone is essential for the release of the neurotransmitters necessary for conveying the wave of excitation upwards to the central nervous system. A key consideration in  targeting Cav2.2 is to design a molecule that would inhibit Ca2? entry during conditions in which the primary sensory neurone is firing rapidly, as is the case in pathophysiological conditions, as opposed to the lower frequency discharge that occurs under normal, physiological conditions. The significance of glycine's action in hyperpolarising the post-synaptic cell body of the secondorder sensory neurone and rendering it less excitable to the action of glutamate cannot be understated. After the generation of PGE2 from cyclooxygenase-2 the prostanoid binds to EP2 receptors on the cell surface of the second-order sensory neurone in close proximity to the glycine receptor/ion channel complex (Ahmadi et al. 2002; Reinold et al. 2005). In this phosphorylated state the receptor is no longer responsive to the agonist effect of glycine so the inward movement of chloride ions is arrested and the hyperpolarization of the cell is cancelled. The second-order sensory neurone cell body is now sensitized. P2X4 receptors  Microglia possess specific homeostatic scavenging functions within the central nervous system. For example, nerve injury activates microglia in the spinal cord and these cells are implicated in the induction of neuropathic pain (Tsuda et al. 2003; Scholz and Woolf 2007). Until relatively recently, however, it was not known whether activated microglia were a cause or a consequence of the altered pain states. In injured, and certain inflammatory, states microglia are stimulated by the local release of ATP in the spinal cord that acts upon the purinoceptor, P2X4 (Tsuda et al. 2003; Coull et al. 2005). This action induces the formation, and release, of a small neuronal modulating protein termed brain-derived neurotrophic factor from the microglia (Coull et al. 2005). brain-derived neurotrophic factor then diffuses from the microglia to latch onto its receptors that are located on the cell body of the second-order sensory neurone within the spinal cord. The outward movement of chloride ions creates a depolarized membrane and sensitizes the cell. Thus, brain-derived neurotrophic factor from the activated microglia is capable of disrupting the very necessary inhibitory actions of both GABA and glycine, released from the descending interneurones (Coull et al. 2005; Torsney and MacDermott 2005). However, the realization that microglia, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in particular, have an important role to play in the development of chronic and neuropathic pain states makes them a very logical target for novel analgesic agents.

Studying basic sensory/motor decision-making, investigators have demonstrated that choice valuation and decision execution are processed nonlinearly by distinct neuron populations for each available option (4). In addition, until neuroscience exactly characterizes the neuronal circuitry governing decision-making, software programmers and processor designers will remain unable to effectively approximate human thinking.

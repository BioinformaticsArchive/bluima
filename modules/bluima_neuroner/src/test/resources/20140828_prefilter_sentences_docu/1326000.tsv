(Bottom) 630 magnification of the circled portion of upper panel shows the presence of bacteria (arrows) without inflammatorv cells in the subarachnoid space. However, as shown in the present study, bacterial entry into the subarachnoid space was documented without concomitant presence of inflammatory cells. Thus, this process does not appear to require host inflammatory cells (e.g., PMN, macrophages). Structure and biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall.

Mediators involved in inflammation, e.g. histamine, increase capillary permeability so that white blood cells can escape and the blood vessels leak more fluid. COMPOSITION OF EXUDATE Exudate contains a variety of substances including water, electrolytes, nutrients, inflammatory mediators, white cells, protein-digesting enzymes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases – MMPs), growth factors and waste products. In the healing wound, exudate appears to promote healing in a number of ways, including stimulating cell proliferation. MMPs, which break down the cell-supporting extracellular matrix, are present mainly in an inactive form. Table 1 Colour, consistency and odour of exudates  Characteristic  Possible cause  Significance of exudate colour* Clear, amber   Serous exudate, often considered `normal', but may be associated with infection by fibrinolysin-producing bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus; may also be  due to fluid from a urinary or lymphatic fistula  Cloudy, milky or creamy   May indicate the presence of fibrin strands (fibrinous exudates – a response to inflammation) or infection (purulent exudates containing white blood cells and  bacteria)  Pink or red Green Yellow or brown Grey or blue   Due to the presence of red blood cells and indicating capillary damage (sanguineous or haemorrhagic exudate)   May be indicative of bacterial infection, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa   May be due to the presence of wound slough or material from an enteric or urinary fistula   May be related to the use of silver-containing dressings  Significance of exudate consistency High viscosity (thick, sometimes sticky)  Low viscosity (thin, `runny')   High protein content due to: – infection – inflammatory process  Necrotic material  Enteric fistula  Residue from some types of dressings or topical preparations  Low protein content due to: – venous or congestive cardiac disease – malnutrition  Urinary, lymphatic or joint space fistula  Significance of exudate odour** Unpleasant   Bacterial growth or infection  Necrotic tissue  Sinus/enteric or urinary fistula  *NB: Some medications are known to discolour urine and consideration could be given to drugs as a cause of exudates discolouration when all other causes have been excluded.  Fluid retention – Interactive dressings, e.g. hydrocolloids, alginates and carboxymethylcellulose fibres (Hydrofiber dressings), take up liquid to form a gel.  Sequestration of exudate components – In vitro studies have demonstrated that some dressings, e.g. carboxymethylcellulose fibres and some alginates, trap bacteria and exudate components such as enzymes in a process termed sequestration (8). Materials such as carboxymethylcellulose fibres that produce a uniform coherent gel appear to have enhanced sequestration (8). Dressings containing collagen/oxidized-regenerated cellulose reduce proteolytic enzyme activity.

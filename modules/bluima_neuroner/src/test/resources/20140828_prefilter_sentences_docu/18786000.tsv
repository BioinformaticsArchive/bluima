18786000	Supplementation of roots with the flavonol kaempferol (an inhibitor of auxin transport), in combination with the use of flavone pre-treated S. meliloti cells, completely restored nodulation in flavonoid-deficient roots. In addition, S. meliloti cells constitutively producing Nod factors were able to nodulate flavone-deficient roots, but not flavonoid-deficient roots. (i) The root hairs curl up to entrap the bacteria, and produce an invagination of the cell wall (infection thread), through which the bacteria penetrate into the deeper cell layers of the root. (ii) Nod factor recognition induces a transient accumulation of flavonoids, an inhibition of auxin transport and cell divisions in the root cortex, leading to nodule primordia formation. Flavonoids might play a role in three distinct stages of the nodulation process: (i) they might act as nodulation gene inducers in the rhizosphere (Cooper and Rao, 1995); (ii) they apparently induce Nod-factor biosynthesis in the infection thread (Sharma and Signer, 1990); (iii) they might also act to regulate auxin transport and initiate nodule primordia cell division (Boot et al., 1999; Hirsch et al., 1989; Mathesius et al., 1998). Determinate-type nodules, commonly produced by tropical legumes (e.g. soybean), are spherical in shape, arise from outer cortical cells, lack a persistent nodule meristem and grow primarily by cell expansion. The indeterminate-type nodules, commonly produced by temperate legumes (e.g. Medicago sp.), are oblong in shape, arise from inner cortical cells, have a persistent nodule meristem and grow primarily by cell division. To investigate this possibility, we treated S. meliloti cells with a known nodulation gene inducer, luteolin (3 lM), for 24 h prior to inoculation. Root hair curling and pseudo-nodule formation was observed when the Nod factor preparation from this culture medium was applied to the roots of M. truncatula (Figure S1), indicating that the added luteolin successfully induced Nod-factor biosynthesis in S. meliloti cells. The use of luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells did not have any significant effect on the number of nodules on vector control roots, compared with the use of untreated S. meliloti cells [P = 0.25; Figure 5a, VC-Sm(luteolin) versus VCSm]. In contrast, the use of luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells significantly increased the number of nodules in CHSi hairy roots [P < 0.05; Figure 5a, CHSi-Sm(luteolin) versus CHSiSm]. If the loss of nodulation in flavone synthase II RNAi roots is caused by the loss of  (b)  (c)  nodulation-gene-induction by Dhf in the rhizosphere, the use of luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells (where Nod-factor biosynthesis is already induced) should restore nodulation in  Figure 5. (a) Effect of pre-treatment of Sinorhizobium meliloti cells with luteolin on nodulation of vector control, chalcone synthase RNAi (CHSi) and flavone synthase II RNAi roots. (b) Effect of supplementation of roots with 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone (Dhf), either with or without pre-treatment of S. meliloti cells with luteolin, on nodulation in vector control, flavone synthase II RNAi or CHSi roots. (c) Effect of supplementation of roots with kaempferol, either with or without pre-treatment of S. meliloti cells with luteolin, on nodulation in CHSi roots. VCSm, CHSi-Sm or flavone synthase II RNAi-Sm represents vector control, and CHSi and flavone synthase II RNAi hairy roots inoculated with untreated S. meliloti, respectively; (luteolin), pre-treatment of S. meliloti cells with luteolin; Dhf, roots were inoculated with S. meliloti and were supplemented with 3 lM Dhf; kaempferol, roots were inoculated with S. meliloti and were supplemented with 3 lM kaempferol. However, the use of luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells did not restore the nodule numbers in flavone synthase II RNAi roots [P = 0.68; Figure 5a, flavone synthase II RNAi-Sm(luteolin) versus flavone synthase II RNAi-Sm] or chalcone reductase RNAi roots (Figure S2), compared with vector control roots. These plants were flood-inoculated with S. meliloti cells that were not pre-treated with luteolin. As expected, luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells also restored nodulation in Dhf-supplemented flavone synthase II RNAi roots [Figure 5b, flavone synthase II RNAi-Sm(luteolin)-Dhf]. Neither did supplementation of CHSi roots with Dhf combined with the use of luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells, suggesting that flavonoids other than Dhf (possibly 5-hydroxyflavonoids) also play essential roles during nodulation. Pre-treatment of S. meliloti cells with Dhf and supplementation of roots with kaempferol completely restores nodulation in CHSi roots  The flavonols kaempferol and quercetin and the isoflavone genistein have been shown to competitively inhibit the binding of the synthetic auxin transport inhibitor, NPA, to zucchini plasma membranes (Jacobs and Rubery, 1988). Supplementation of CHSi roots with kaempferol did not completely restore nodulation in these roots when inoculated with S. meliloti cells that were untreated with any nodulation gene inducer (Figure 5c, CHSi-Sm-kaempferol). Next, we tested the ability of luteolin pre-treated S. meliloti cells to nodulate CHSi roots supplemented with kaempferol. We confirmed this independently by assaying the production of Nod factors in these cells (data not shown). We inoculated vector control, CHSi and flavone synthase II RNAi roots with A2102 cells expressing NodD3, and A2102 cells containing the empty vector (pTE3), as a negative control. A2102 pE65 cells restored nodulation in flavone synthase II RNAi roots that lacked the nodulation-gene-inducing flavonoid Dhf (P = 0.65; Figure 6a). In contrast, these cells did not restore nodulation in CHSi roots that lacked both the nodulation-geneinducting flavonoid Dhf and the auxin-transport-inhibiting flavonoid kaempferol (P = 0.035; Figure 6a). (b) When supplemented with kaempferol, A2102 pE65 cells completely restored the nodule number in CHSi roots. The nodule distribution in these roots is presented in Table S3.  cells completely restored the number of nodules in CHSi roots to wild-type levels (Figure 6b). Thus, constitutive Nodfactor production in these S. meliloti cells complemented the loss of nodulation-gene-inducing flavonoids (flavones), but not the loss of auxin-transport-regulating flavonoids (flavonols). The use of S. meliloti cells induced for Nodfactor biosynthesis did not restore nodulation in CHSi, flavone synthase II RNAi and chalcone reductase RNAi roots. This conclusion was further strengthened by the fact that supplementation of CHSi roots with kaempferol, and the use of S. meliloti cells that constitutively express the nodulation genes, also restored complete nodulation. The results of this latter experiment appear inconsistent with the observation that pre-treating S. meliloti cells with luteolin, a nodulation-gene-inducing flavone, did not restore nodulation in flavone synthase II RNAi or chalcone reductase RNAi roots, which were not deficient in kaempferol biosynthesis. The ability of S. meliloti cells, which constitutively produce Nod factors, to restore nodulation in Dhf-deficient roots indicates that Dhf plays a critical role in the induction of bacterial Nod-factor biosynthesis. Additionally, it is also possible that accumulation of kaempferol in a few cells in the vascular tissue might have a more significant impact on auxin transport than the accumulation of Dhf throughout the root. However, normal nodulation of Dhf-deficient roots by S. meliloti cells that constitutively produce Nod factors strongly suggests that the critical role that Dhf plays during nodulation is perhaps to induce nodulation genes, and not to promote auxin homeostasis. Accumulation of kaempferol subsequently leads to the localized inhibition of auxin transport, resulting in cell division and initiation of nodule primordia (events 5 to 7 in Figure 7). For pre-treatment, S. meliloti cells were grown until achieving an OD600 of 0.2, and luteolin (in DMSO) was added to a final concentration of 3 lM. The cells were incubated at 28 C for 16â€“24 h with shaking. Before inoculation onto the root system, S. meliloti cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to an OD600 of 0.08 using a nitrogen-free plant nutrient solution, and  10 ml of the suspension was applied to the root system of each composite plant.

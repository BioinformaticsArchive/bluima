18483000	Conclusion Ventricular arrhythmia bursts temporally associated with Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow restoration and stable ST-segment recovery (reperfusion VA bursts) can be precisely defined in subjects with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and may constitute a unique electric biosignal of myocellular response to reperfusion. suggested that the presence of reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias following primary percutaneous coronary intervention reflects an adverse cellular response to epicardial recanalization,6 although this is controversial.7,8 We should emphasize that our goal in defining reperfusion VA bursts is not to discriminate between successful and failed reperfusion; rather, in an era in which primary percutaneous coronary intervention produces Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow in more than 80% of the patients treated, our objective is to extend understanding of the electromechanical events that constitute the cellular response to Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 reperfusion. Populations with Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow can be meaningfully stratified by both microvascular `blush' and ST-segment recovery, reflecting microvascular distribution of contrast and physiological cellular response to reperfusion, respectively.39â€“41 Well-defined reperfusion VA bursts may provide an additional `electric biomarker' reflecting cellular signals that can be used to characterize quality of reperfusion. Worsening of ST-segment elevation following angiographic reperfusion has been previously reported as a marker of adverse cellular response to reperfusion.24,25,42 anterior wall acute myocardial infarction as a marker of cellular injury leading to poor recovery of left ventricular function.

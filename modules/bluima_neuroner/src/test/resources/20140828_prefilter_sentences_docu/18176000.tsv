18176000	The main cause of hyperammonemia is liver cirrhosis or fulminant hepatitis, where problems arise due to a combination of decreased capacity following liver cell damage and porto-systemic shunt. Hyperammonemia is associated with hyperexcitability, convulsions, brain edema and increased extracellular brain glutamate (8). The mechanisms responsible for increased glutamate content in the extracellular space of the brain include decreased uptake by perineuronal astrocytes and/or increased release from neurons and/or astrocytes. Exposure of  astrocytes to millimolar concentrations of ammonia results in cell swelling, loss of expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter and EAAT-2 glutamate transporters and increased release of glutamate (8).

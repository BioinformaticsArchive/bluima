18503000	The authors asked whether RhoA is present in photoreceptor axon terminals and whether activity in the RhoAROCK pathway contributes to the structural plasticity observed in rod and cone cells. Antibodies against RhoA were used to immunolabel Western blots sections and isolated neurons from salamander retina. When treated with Y27632, rod cells significantly increased the number of varicosities, whereas cone cells increased process growth. Treatment with Y27632 also dramatically reduced retraction of the existing axon, which occurs spontaneously in rod cells during the first 24 hours of culture. The results suggest that RhoA activation contributes to axon retraction by rod cells after retinal detachment, whereas inhibition of RhoA contributes to the neuritic sprouting seen in reattached and degenerating retina. T he synaptic terminals of photoreceptor cells respond to disease and trauma with structural plasticity. Rod and cone photoreceptors produce neurites with synaptic varicosities in degenerative diseases of the outer retina, such as retinitis pigmentosa,1,2 whereas in retinal detachment rod photoreceptor cells retract their axonal fibers and synaptic terminals from the outer synaptic layer.3 Rod cells have also been observed to  From the 1Program of Integrative Neuroscience, UMDNJ-Graduate School in Biomedical Sciences and Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey; and the 2Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, UMDNJNew Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey. For instance, blockage of calcium channels and increases in cAMP prevent axon retraction in salamander and porcine rod cells, respectively.7–9 On the other hand, increases in cyclic nucleotides stimulate rod and cone cell neuritic growth and synaptic development (Townes-Anderson E, et al. IOVS 2003; 44:ARVO E-Abstract 2847).8 Little is known about the signaling pathways these molecules activate in photoreceptor cells. Cultured neurons that were prevented from producing new growth by Nogo, MAG, and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoproteins38,39 were disinhibited when the RhoA pathway was blocked.39 4177  METHODS  Animals Retinal tissue and cells were obtained from adult, aquatic-phase tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum, 18 –23 cm in length) maintained at 5°C on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. After rinsing and trituration, the cell suspension was plated onto glass coverslips coated with Sal-1 antibody (provided by Peter MacLeish, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA).47 The cell lysate was clarified with centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C (16,000g; Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were incubated with a mouse monoclonal (26C4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal (119; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit monoclonal (3L74; Upstate, Charlottesville, NC) RhoA antibody (1:500), followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:500; Sigma). Immunocytochemistry For immunostaining using the avidin-biotin complex, cells and retinal sections were washed with PBS (450 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) three times at room temperature and then with 0.5% H2O2 in PBS for 10 minutes to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by three rinses with PBS. Then cells and retinal sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 0.1% Triton X-100 goat serum dilution buffer (goat serum dilution buffer; 16% normal goat serum, 450 mM NaCl, 20 mM phosphate buffer) to block nonspecific binding and permeabilize the plasma membrane; primary RhoA antibodies (1:100) were applied overnight at 4°C, followed by three rinses in PBS and one rinse in Triton-free goat serum dilution buffer for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200) in Triton-free goat serum dilution buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Labeled sections were dried in 100% ethanol and cleared in Hemo-De (Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ), and coverslips were affixed with mounting medium (Permount; Fisher Scientific); labeled cells were stored in PBS. Sections and cells were imaged with brightfield microscopy using an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 40 objective with a 0.75 numerical aperture. Cells were examined with an average of 6 to 10 z-sections per cell. Twelve to 15 rod cells per dish with axon terminals were selected in the first hour after plating. At 24 hours, one last image of each cell was obtained, and dishes were fixed. Analysis of Growth Photoreceptors were identified by morphology (cell shape, growth pattern, and presence of an ellipsoid), and rod cell identification was confirmed with rod opsin staining. Every isolated photoreceptor encountered was digitally captured using Nomarski optics until 25 rod and 25 cone cells per dish were imaged. Neurites 5 m or larger, originating from the cell body, were counted as main processes. RESULTS  Given that no systematic study has been conducted of the localization of RhoA in amphibian retina, we examined intact retinal sections and isolated retinal cells from salamander with three commonly used antibodies to RhoA. In chick retina, RhoB is downregulated during development and is primarily restricted to Mu ̈ller cell processes in the inner retina postnatally.52 RhoA was present in the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, outer plexiform layer, photoreceptor layers, and Mu ̈ller cells. In photoreceptors, RhoA was present throughout the inner segment, cell body, and axon terminal. Neurons of the inner nuclear layer showed lighter labeling of RhoA compared with the other retinal cells. Mu ̈ller cell labeling was particularly obvious in the inner nuclear layer because of the light staining of the inner neuronal cell bodies. RhoA labeling of the inner plexiform layer and ganglion cells was more intense. Isolated Retinal Cells Immunocytochemistry was next applied to isolated salamander retinal cells. Although some rod cells are intact after isolation, most rod cells have lost their outer segments, axon terminals, or both. Rod photoreceptors that retain their axon terminals (also called pedicles) after retinal dissociation normally retract them toward their cell bodies within 24 hours after plating.46 In our cultures, all cone cells lost their outer segments after isolation. Salamander cone cells do not have axons; their synaptic terminals sit on top of the nucleus. Thus, all cone cells retained axon terminals after retinal dissociation. Using the avidin-biotin complex-labeling technique and polyclonal 119 primary antibody, RhoA was found in all retinal cell types (rod and cone photoreceptors and horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, ganglion, and Mu ̈ller cells). Two hours after dissociation, rod cells contained RhoA labeling throughout the entire cell (Figs. Labeling was also present in rod pedicles in the process of retracting toward the cell body (Fig. 2A). With isolated rod cells, it was clear that RhoA labeling was present in the outer segments. Cone cells were also diffusely immunolabeled. The highest intensity of RhoA label for rod and cone cells occurred in the inner segments. RhoA is present in the inner segment, outer nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, ganglion cell layer, and Mu ̈ller cells (arrowheads). RhoA, immunolabeled with the avidin-biotin complex technique, is found in rod (A, C, E, G) and cone (B, C, F, H) cells 2 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after isolation. (A, C) Rod cells exhibit RhoA throughout the cell, including the outer segment and axon terminal (arrows). (B, C) Cone cells show RhoA labeling throughout the cell, including the synaptic pedicle (B, arrow). Darker labeling appears in the inner segments of rod and cone cells (A–C, double arrowheads). RhoA is dispersed throughout the cell body and its processes and varicosities (arrowheads). After 7 days in culture, rod (G) and cone (H) cells show RhoA labeling throughout the cell body, in all new growth and in the varicosities (arrowheads). (D) Control rod and cone cells, produced by omitting the primary antibody, have no labeling. To determine whether RhoA was present at the plasma membrane of the photoreceptors and what the relative abundance of label was in subcellular regions, fluorescence-labeled photoreceptors were examined in 1- m optical sections. RhoA immunoreactivity was present throughout the cytosol of the cell body, inner segment, ellipsoid, and axon terminal 2 hours after dissociation (Figs. In the inner segments, rod and cone cells had intense accumulations of label. Three days in culture did not appear to affect the levels of RhoA in retinal cells. RhoA was observed in the thick processes and varicosities of rod and cone cells (Figs. A clustering of RhoA signal was also found in the inner segment of rod and cone photoreceptor cells (Figs. RhoA plays a role in maintaining the normal structure of the Golgi apparatus in hippocampal neurons.22 In rod cells, some RhoA immunolabel is likely to be in the Golgi apparatus because opsin occurs at high levels in the Golgi of cultured photoreceptor cells46 and because RhoA immunolabeling partially colocalized with opsin label at the location of the putative Golgi apparatus (Figs. Staining in the ellipsoid, which is an accumulation of mitochondria, was observed in rod and cone cells with both the avidin-biotin complex and the fluorescence immunolabeling techniques (Figs. Both techniques demonstrated that RhoA protein is present in retinal cells throughout the time in culture. RhoA was found in photoreceptor cells as they engaged in structural remodeling, and it was present in axon terminals during retraction and in neuritic processes during growth. To examine the effects of RhoA activation on established growth, retinal cells were allowed to grow for 2 days. By comparing average growth in 2- and 3-day control rod and cone cells, it appeared that rod photoreceptors increased processes and varicosities until day 3 (Figs. 5A, 5B, 5D), whereas cone cells grew more rapidly, achieving maximal process growth by day 2, though varicosities continued to form (Figs. Rod photoreceptor cells reduced the number of processes and varicosities in response to lysophosphatidic acid compared with control growth at 3 days; reductions in growth increased with higher lysophosphatidic acid concentrations (Figs. With 20 and 200 M lysophosphatidic acid, varicosities were also significantly reduced in rod cells compared with the 2-day controls. Although the reduction in processes and varicosities for rod cells indicated an inhibition of growth with lysophosphatidic acid, reduction in growth compared with 2-day controls indicated some retraction of established growth at the higher lysophosphatidic acid concentrations as well. Cone photoreceptor cells did not significantly reduce the number of processes with 2 and 20 M lysophosphatidic acid treatment compared with 2- and 3-day controls. However, with 200 M lysophosphatidic acid, cone cell processes were significantly reduced compared with 2- and 3-day controls (Fig. 5E). Cone cell varicosities responded  FIGURE 3.

(B, b) In cone cells, RhoA is present throughout the cytoplasm, with areas of increased intensity in the inner segment (double arrowheads).

(D, d) RhoA is also present in the varicosity (arrowhead) of a 3-day rod cell. Scale bar, 10 m.  in a manner similar to that of rod cell varicosities. Cone cell varicosities were significantly reduced in a linear fashion as the lysophosphatidic acid concentration increased compared to 2- and 3-day cultures (Figs. Thus, cone cell processes retracted in response to the highest lysophosphatidic acid concentration, whereas varicosities were affected, and presumably retracted, at all levels of lysophosphatidic acid treatment. Both concentrations of lysophosphatidic acid resulted in a significant decrease of processes and varicosities in rod and cone cells (Figs. In contrast to the shorter 24-hour treatment, longer exposure to lower concentrations (2 and 20 M) of lysophosphatidic acid was able to reduce process outgrowth in cone cells. Examination of rod cells showed no significant increase in the growth of processes; however, there was a small but significant increase in the number of varicosities (Fig. 6C). In contrast, for cone cells, there was a significant increase in processes and varicosities (Fig. 6D). A 1- m confocal section of a 3-day cultured rod cell double labeled for RhoA and opsin. The green channel (a ) shows RhoA label throughout the soma of the cell, with the highest intensity of labeling in the inner segment. To verify that lysophosphatidic acid reduces growth through the activation of the RhoA pathway in photoreceptors, we blocked the downstream effector ROCK with Y27632 before stimulating cells with lysophosphatidic acid. When 200 M lysophosphatidic acid was applied to cultures pretreated for 2 hours with 100 M Y27632, there was no significant decrease (or increase) of main processes and varicosities in rod and cone cells after 3 days in culture, whereas lysophosphatidic acid treatment alone, as expected, significantly decreased the number of processes and varicosities (data not shown). Isolated retinal cells were plated into culture dishes containing salamander medium either alone or with 100 M Y27632 or 200 M lysophosphatidic acid. Rod cells without outer segments but with their axon terminals were selected within the first hour after plating and were examined over a 24-hour period. Growth is reduced and retracted in rod and cone cells by 24 hours of lysophosphatidic acid treatment after 2 days of growth. (A–C) Representative rod cells from 2- and 3-day control cultures and after 20 M lysophosphatidic acid treatment. Rod cells produce growth over 3 days (varicosity, arrowhead), which is reduced by 20 M lysophosphatidic acid treatment. (D) Rod cell processes and varicosities increased from 2 to 3 days in control cultures. n 4 animals, 20 culture dishes, 500 rod cells; *P 0.001. (F–H) Representative cone cells from 2- and 3-day control cultures and after 20 M lysophosphatidic acid treatment. (E) The 2- and 3-day control cone cells showed no difference in number of processes. n 4 animals, 20 culture dishes, 500 cone cells; *P 0.001.  in culture, retraction of axons was obvious (Fig. 7C); by 24 hours, most axons were fully retracted into the cell body (Fig. 7D). However, this process was different in rod cells treated with Y27632. In control and lysophosphatidic acid-treated cultures, 81% and 85% of the selected rod cells, respectively, retracted their terminals by 24 hours (Fig. 7M). With the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, only 49.5% of the selected and treated rod cells retracted their axon terminals. The mean rod axon length in control rod cells was reduced by half by 12 hours, and by 24 hours it was significantly shorter than it was at 1 hour. Growth is reduced in rod and cone cells by prolonged 3-day lysophosphatidic acid treatment, whereas Y27632 treatment (a ROCK inhibitor) results in increased growth. Rod (A) and cone (B) cells treated with 2 or 20 M lysophosphatidic acid over 3 days in culture reduced the number of processes and varicosities compared with 3-day control cells. n 4 animals, 12 culture dishes, 300 rod cells, 300 cone cells; *P 0.001. (C) Rod cells treated with 100 M Y27632 significantly increased the number of varicosities. n 6 animals, 12 culture dishes, 300 rod cells; *P 0.001. (D) Cone cells treated with 100 M Y27632 increased the number of processes and varicosities. n 3 animals, 6 culture dishes, 150 cone cells; *P 0.001. (A–D) Rod cell in a control culture shows axon terminal retraction into the cell soma within 24 hours and no growth from the site of the axon terminal. (E–H) Rod cell treated with Y27632 retains its axon terminal throughout the 24-hour period and produces additional axonal growth. (I–L) Rod cell treated with lysophosphatidic acid retracts its axon terminal within 24 hours, similar to control. (M) Inhibiting ROCK, RhoA effector, with Y27632 reduced the number of rod cells that retracted their axons. Control and lysophosphatidic acid-treated rod cells reduced their axon length by 24 hours. No decrease in the mean length of axons over time in Y27632treated rod cells was observed. n 4 animals, 24 culture dishes, 242 rod cells; *P 0.001. Growth during the first 24 hours of culture is affected by ROCK inhibition in cone but not in rod cells. (A) For rod cells, growth in the form of filopodia was not significantly affected by Y27632 treatment but was significantly reduced with lysophosphatidic acid treatment. n 4 animals, 24 culture dishes, 242 rod cells; *P 0.001. (B) For cone cells, the number of processes and of varicosities in the first 24 hours of culture increased with Y27632 treatment, whereas lysophosphatidic acid treatment decreased processes and varicosities. n 4 animals, 32 dishes, 480 cone cells; *P 0.001. Interestingly, the amount of retraction was not different between control and lysophosphatidic acid groups, suggesting that components of the RhoA pathway involved in retraction in rod cells were either maximally activated or refractory to further stimulation during the 24 hours immediately after plating. For rod cells, lysophosphatidic acid significantly reduced the number of filopodia, but Y27632 did not significantly increase filopodia. This was consistent with the effects of lysophosphatidic acid and Y27632 on rod cell growth over 3 days. For cone cells, lysophosphatidic acid reduced the numbers of processes and varicosities during the first 24 hours of culture, whereas Y27632 increased growth significantly (Fig. 8B). These results were also consistent with the effects of these treatments on cone cells over 3 days. Therefore, during early and extended times in culture, rod and cone cells responded differently to inhibition of ROCK activity. Blocking ROCK in rod cells affected retraction but not process growth. In cone cells, which do not retract their pedicles, the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 stimulated growth. DISCUSSION RhoA is a multifunctional protein35,36 that plays a role in nerve cell process retraction and growth. Retinal detachment leads to axon terminal retraction from the outer plexiform layer by rod cells.3 In the mouse rd1 model of retinal degeneration, cone cells sprout neurites.60 Isolated salamander rod and cone photoreceptor cells maintained in culture produce similar structural plasticity: isolated rod photoreceptors retract axon terminals, and rod and cone cells grow varicositybearing neuritic processes over time in culture. In rod cells, lysophosphatidic acid reduced the number of neuritic processes and  caused retraction of varicosities at high concentrations, whereas ROCK inhibition had little effect on growth but did block axon retraction. In cone cells, lysophosphatidic acid reduced the numbers of processes and varicosities causing retraction of existing growth; conversely, ROCK inhibition increased the number of processes and varicosities compared with control. The data also suggest that rod and cone cells have differences in RhoA signaling because inhibition of the downstream effector ROCK had different outcomes in rod and cone cells. It appears that ROCK activity stimulates axon retraction in rod cells but inhibits the growth of neuritic processes in cone cells. When neurons in the spinal cord, optic nerve (retinal ganglion cells), or brain undergo trauma, RhoA activity is rapidly increased.16,75,78 Mechanical stress has been 7. shown to increase RhoA activity in smooth muscle cells.80 In the intact retina, it is also possible that microglia activate 8. Fisher et al.82 and others83,84 have shown that retinal microglia are activated after detachment. Activated microglia release tumor necrosis factor, which increases RhoA 9. activity, reducing neuritic length and branching in cultured hippocampal neurons.81 Once activated, the RhoA-ROCK pathway may work differently in rod and cone cells. For rod cells in culture, activity in the RhoA-ROCK pathway was vital for axon terminal retraction but appeared subsequently to be suppressed. Cone cells, on the other hand, did not seem to downregulate the RhoA-ROCK pathway, and manipulation with Y27632 to reduce ROCK activity led to an increase in growth at all times in culture. It is 14. possible that the levels of active RhoA or the levels of ROCK and its activation are different in the two cell types. Alternatively, levels of cyclic nucleotides may vary after injury in a cell-type specific manner. Differences in the mechanisms for structural plasticity in rod and cone cells are not surprising because it has already been re- 18. ported that the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway has different effects on neuritic sprouting by rod and cone cells.89 In a salamander cell culture system, modulating RhoA contributes to rod axon retraction and to rod 20. and cone neuritic sprouting, structural changes that are also seen in retinal detachment and retinal degeneration.

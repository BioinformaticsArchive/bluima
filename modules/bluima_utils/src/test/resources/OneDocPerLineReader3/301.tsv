Sirett DepartmentofPhysiologyandCentreforNeuroscience,UniversityofOtagoMedicalSchool,Dunedin(NewZealand) (Accepted 19 April 1988)  Keywords: Rat; Osmosensitive neuron; Subfornical organ; In vitro; Synaptic blockade  Extracellular recordings were made in vitro from 212 single units in the rat subfornical organ and 54 single units in the rat medial preoptic area. Our results suggest that while an ability to change their firinR rate in resoonse to small chanzes of osmotic pressure may be a general property of neurons, the neurons of the subfornical organ are specialised for the detection of changes in the extracellular osmotic pressure. These findings are all c o n s i s t e n t w i t h t h e h y p o t h e s i s 2°'21 t h a t o s m o r e c e p -tors in subfornical organ relay information for the initiation of  drinking and so it was surprising that a previous in vitrostudy2inthislaboratoryfailedtofindanyosmosensitive neurons in the subfornical organ. However, it has since been found that in the presence of the calcium concentration used in that study (2 mM) many neurons in the hypothalamus 14 and in other circumventricular organs 15in vitro are silenced, or have their firing rate greatly reduced. We have therefore reinvestigated the responses of subfornical organ neurons in vitro to changes in osmolarity using a calcium concentration of 0.75 mM in the bathing solution. Electrophysiological method~ Extracellular action potentials (units) were detected with glass micropipettes filled with 150 mM NaC1 (impedance 5-10 Mr2). RESULTS  From the very first attempt to record spontaneous neuronal activity in the subfornical organ in vitro in this study it was apparent that there were many more spontaneously active neurons than appeared to be the case in the previous investigation in our laboratory2. Frequency histograms of 4 different osmosensitive neurons in the subfornical organ illustrating the different patterns of response to changes of osmolality. TABLE I ResponsesofosmosensitiveneuronsintheSFOtochangesinosmolality over the range 1.4-11% in both the hypo- and hyperosmotic directions All changes were made by manipulation of the NaCI content of the solutions. From this data we conclude that subfornical organ neurons respond to changes in tonicity rather than specifically to either NaCI or mannitol. 4) and the failure of any units to respond to a solution made hyper-osmotic by the addition of urea (Table II), indicate that tonicity is the stimulus to which neurons in the subfornical organ respond2°.To apply the term 'osmosensitive' to such neurons may then be regarded as a misnomer but is we believe still valid since the neurons may be regarded as responding to the 'apparent osmolarity' of the bathing medium, i.e. they are responding to the extracellular concentration of impermeant solutes. If units in the subfornical organ and medial preoptic area are responding to changes in tonicity the question then arises as to how this stimulus is transduced into neuronal activity. A definitive answer to this question is beyond the scope of this study but recent reports of experiments using the patch clamp technique 6have shown that there are stretch-activated ion channels present in cell membranes and it is suggested that similar stretch-activated ion channels may be operative here. The changes in tonicity would bring about small changes in cell volume and through these changes ion channels may be opened and closed to bring about the increases and decreases in neuronal firing rate. Slight differences in neuron diameter and thus volume may well explain our finding of differences in threshold between neurons. W e suggest that supraoptic neurons rely on the synaptic input from the subfornical organ9'12for their ability to respond. When the responses from the group of units exposed to both hyper- and hypo-osmotic solutions were compared however, differences emerged which were significant  REFERENCES  1 Bourque, C.W. and Renaud, L.P., Activity patterns and osmosensitivity of rat supraoptic neurones in perfused hypothalamic explants, J.

The finding of responses to osmotic pressure changes in the medial preoptic area in vitro was not unexpected as it has been reported TMthat 40% of neurons in the medial preoptic area in vitro responded to a 3% osmotic change. It may well be that responses by units in the medial preoptic area in vitro indicate that many brain neurons possess the ability to respond to small osmotic changes by changing their firing rate. The observed differences between subfornical organ and medial preoptic area neurons may then either reflect differences in neurone volume and thus sensitivity to volume changes, or a real specialization of the subfornical organ neurones. 11 Mason, W.T., Supraoptic neurones of rat hypothalamus are osmosensitive, Nature (Lond.), 287 (1980) 154-157. 16 Sibbald, J.R., Sirett, N.E. and Hubbard, J.I., Osmosensitive neurons in the rat subfornical organ, Proc. 18 Silva, N.L. and Boulant, J.A., Effects of osmotic pressure, glucose and temperature on neurons in preoptic tissue slices, Am.

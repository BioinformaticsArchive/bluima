1	Regulation of voltagedependent K+ channel localization and function has long been recognized as a major mechanism to achieve dynamic regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability in a number of mammalian and non-mammalian neurons.
2	Our recent evidence, together with compelling data from other laboratories, suggests that in mammalian neurons the Kv2.1 channel may play an especially prominent role in determining intrinsic neuronal excitability.
3	Kv2.1 is widely expressed in brain and composes the majority of delayed rectifier K+ current in pyramidal neurons in cortex and hippocampus, and is also widely expressed in interneurons.
4	Dynamic modulation of Kv2.1 localization and function by a mechanism involving activity-dependent Kv2.1 dephosphorylation dramatically impacts intrinsic excitability of neurons.
5	Here we review previous studies of Kv2.1 localization and function in neurons, and summarize recent work regarding dynamic regulation of these characteristics.
6	We also discuss possible roles of the Kv2.1 channel in neuronal and network excitability.

8	Voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels are especially diverse components of the channel repertoire that determine a neuron's intrinsic electrical excitability (Pongs, 1999).
9	Neurons express a wide variety of Kv channels that can contribute to diverse aspects of neuronal signaling, depending on the functional characteristics, abundance and distribution of the channel subtypes (Song, 2002).
10	Delayed rectifier Kv currents (IK) are important in regulating somatodendritic excitability in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons (Bekkers, 2000; Du et al., 2000; Korngreen and Sakmann, 2000).
11	In cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, channels composed of Kv2.1 a subunits are a major component of somatodendritic IK (Du et al., 2000; Malin and Nerbonne, 2002; Martina et al., 1998; Murakoshi and Trimmer, 1999; Pal et al., 2003).
12	Interestingly, many studies of somatodendritic IK and of Kv2.1 in pyramidal neurons suggest a function in regulating excitability and Ca2+ influx during periods of repetitive high frequency firing (Bekkers, 2000; Colbert and Pan, 1999; Du et al., 2000; Kang et al., 2000; Korngreen and Sakmann, 2000) rather than in a more classical role in action potential repolarization (Du et al., 2000).
13	We have recently shown that phosphorylation, localization and function of Kv2.1 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons are dynamically regulated by neuronal activity (Misonou et al., 2004).
14	Such dynamic activity-dependent modulations of Kv2.1 channels could dramatically impact on intrinsic neuronal excitability and plasticity.
15	This review focuses on recent findings of molecular and functional characteristics of Kv2.1 in neurons to discuss the possible roles of Kv2.1 in a neuron and a neuronal circuit.
16	Amino- and carboxyl-termini are cytoplasmic, such that all extracellular domains are found within the core domain (Fig. 1).
17	Moreover, these domains mediate reversible interactions with cellular enzymes (e.g. kinases, phosphatases) that covalently modify the channel and affect localization and function (Levitan, 1999).
18	Kv2.1 a subunits apparently do not form heteromultimeric channels with the other Kv2 family member, Kv2.2, in mammalian brain, as these two Kv2 a subunits exhibit contrasting patterns of subcellular distribution in co-expressing cells (Hwang et al., 1993; Lim et al., 2000).
19	Although Kv2.1 a subunits carry a single consensus N-linked glycosylation site on the extracellular S3–S4 linker domain, native brain Kv2.1 channels, and recombinant Kv2.1 channels expressed in heterologous systems, are not N-glycosylated (Shi and Trimmer, 1999).
20	Interestingly, the level of Kv2.1 phosphorylation is different in different cellular backgrounds (Misonou and Trimmer, in press; Shi et al., 1994).
21	In mammalian cell lines, exogenously expressed Kv2.1 shows substantially higher Mr (110 kDa in COS-1 and 115 kDa in MDCK cells) due to higher level of phosphorylation.
22	However, in brain neurons, and in cultured neurons, endogenous Kv2.1 has a rather higher Mr (125 kDa), suggesting neuronal-specific phosphorylation of Kv2.1 (Fig. 2A).
23	Pulse-chase experiments in COS-1 cells showed that within several minutes the majority of newly synthesized Kv2.1 was converted from the nascent Mr = 95 kDa form to the Mr = 110 kDa form that is  Fig.
24	Phosphorylation and clustered localization of Kv2.1 in neurons.
25	(A) Phosphorylation state of Kv2.1 in neurons in vivo and in vitro.
26	Proteins were extracted from rat brain membrane fractions or cultured neurons and separated on SDS-PAGE.
27	Cultured neurons were incubated without (control) or with 10 mM glutamate for 10 min (glutamate) before protein extraction.
28	(B) Clustered localization of Kv2.1 in pyramidal neurons in rat cerebral cortex.
29	The illustration on the right indicates the shape of the pyramidal neuron in the center.
30	(C) Kv2.1 localization in COS-1, MDCK, and hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
31	COS-1 and MDCK cells were transfected with Kv2.1 cDNA. the predominant steady-state form in COS-1 cells (Shi et al., 1994).
32	This is consistent with the fact that the major pool of Kv2.1 in neurons is also constitutively and highly phosphorylated.
33	Importantly, we have found that this constitutively high level of Kv2.1 phosphorylation is dynamically reduced by neuronal activity-dependent dephosphorylation, which affects the localization and function of Kv2.1 (Misonou et al., 2004), as discussed below.
34	The contribution of a particular Kv channel to governing neuronal excitability also depends on its abundance in the neuronal plasma membrane, as controlled by intracellular trafficking machinery (Misonou and Trimmer, 2004).
35	However, all evidence indicates that in all cells examined Kv2.1 channels are efficiently trafficked through the endomembrane system and expressed on the cell surface, presumably via a default anterograde trafficking pathway, with none of the steady-state intracellular accumulation, indicative of regulated trafficking, seen for other Kv channels (Manganas and Trimmer, 2000; Manganas et al., 2001; Shibata et al., 2003).
36	Kv2.1 is localized in the somatodendritic domain of neurons (Trimmer, 1991).
37	Within individual neurons the staining for Kv2.1 is highly restricted and is present on only the somatic and proximal dendritic membrane and is absent from distal dendritic membrane, axons, and nerve terminals (Fig. 2B), as unambiguously confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy (Du et al., 1998).
38	The unique subcellular distribution is accentuated by the fact that within these domains Kv2.1 is present in large clusters (Hwang et al., 1993; Lim et al., 2000; Maletic-Savatic et al., 1995; Scannevin et al., 1996; Trimmer, 1991), which are present on the cell surface membrane immediately facing astrocytic processes, and over subsurface cisterns underlying the plasma membrane facing astrocytes (Du et al., 1998).
39	Based on our electrophysiological analyses in COS-1 cells (Shi et al., 1994) and in cultured hippocampal neurons, a single neuron is likely to have Kv2.1 at a density of approximately 10–15 channels/mm2, if uniformly expressed, on the somatic membrane (calculated for a cell with 15 mm diameter).
40	In polarized epithelial MDCK cells (Fig. 2C), Kv2.1 localizes in the basolateral membrane in clusters (Scannevin et al., 1996), analogous to the clustered somatodendritic localization of Kv2.1 in  neurons (Hwang et al., 1993; Lim et al., 2000; Maletic-Savatic et al., 1995; Scannevin et al., 1996; Trimmer, 1991).
41	C-terminus revealed that an %130 amino acid approximately midway through the 440 amino acid C-terminus of Kv2.1 was necessary for both polarized expression and clustering in MDCK cells (Scannevin et al., 1996).
42	Expression of epitope-tagged wild-type Kv2.1 and the aforementioned mutants in cultured hippocampal neurons clearly showed the same %130 segment was critical to the restricted somatodendritic localization and clustering in neurons.
43	Electron microscopic analyses have shown that plasma membrane Kv2.1 clusters on the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons lie over subsurface cisternae (Du et al., 1998), intracellular endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes rich in inositol triphosphate and ryanodine receptors.
44	These specialized sites, where intracellular Ca2+ stores come into close apposition with the plasma membrane, represent a specialized neuronal signaling domain that may also contain elevated levels of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Westenbroek et al., 1990).
45	A functional relationship between Kv2.1 and dendritic [Ca2+]i; transients were revealed by antisense knock down of Kv2.1 in rat hippocampal neurons (Du et al., 2000), where Kv2.1 knock-down induces apparent prolongation of [Ca2+]i; transients after action potentials.
46	Moreover, ryanodine receptor intracellular Ca2+ release channels (Fig. 3) and the luminal Ca2+ binding protein calsequestrin colocalize with Kv2.1 clusters in cultured hippocampal neurons (Antonucci et al., 2001).
47	Interestingly K+ efflux through Kv channels has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis (Yu et al., 1997).
48	In neurons, apoptosis is accompanied by an  Fig.
49	Cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated without (upper panels) or with (lower panels) 10 mM glutamate for 10 min.
50	The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained for Kv2.1 shown in red and ryanodine receptors shown in green in the overlap images.
51	A large-scale, high-throughput screening in a yeast system very recently identified a novel blocker for Kv2.1, and this compound was found to block neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (Zaks-Makhina et al., 2004).
52	However, it is still unclear how activation of Kv2.1 channels is achieved, and how this is involved in the neuronal apoptosis cascade.
53	DYNAMIC MODULATION OF KV2.1 IN NEURONAL ACTIVITY AND ITS ROLE IN NEURONAL SIGNALING  Persistent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability in the face of sustained changes in synaptic input have been reported in different type of neurons.
54	This phenomenon, a form of homeostatic plasticity (also as cellular or intrinsic plasticity), alters overall input– output function of a neuron and thus stabilize neuronal circuits by setting the optimal output level of each elements of the circuitry (Cantrell and Catterall, 2001;  Daoudal and Debanne, 2003; Desai et al., 1999; Marder and Prinz, 2003; Nelson et al., 2003; Spitzer et al., 2002; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004).
55	Without these self-tuning mechanisms, feed-forward synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) could drive the neuronal activity towards extreme excitation or quiescence.
56	Whereas synaptic scaling scales the strength of the cell's entire synaptic repertoire up and down in response to chronic changes in neuronal activity, E–S plasticity changes the intrinsic excitability of a neuron (i.e. the probability in a neuron to generate an action potential in response to a given input in the form of an excitatory post-synaptic current or current injection).
57	Our recent studies have shown that increased neuronal excitatory activity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons rapidly ($5 min) and profoundly changes the phosphorylation state of Kv2.1 (Misonou et al., 2004).
58	Increased neuronal activity induced by glutamate-treatment of cultured rat hippo-  Fig.
59	Glutamate-induced increased excitatory activity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons leads to altered voltage-dependent biophysical properties of IK.
60	(A) Representative whole-cell voltage-clamp traces of IK currents recorded from a cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neuron before and after extracellular superfusion of 10 mM glutamate for 10 min.
61	The membrane was depolarized to 10 mV for 200 ms from a holding potential of 65 mV. (B) Steady-state voltage-dependent activation (square) and inactivation (circle) curves for IK from cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons before (filled square/circle) and after (unfilled square/circle) extracellular superfusion of 10 mM glutamate for 10 min.
62	The average half-maximal conductance (V1/2) and half-maximal steadystate inactivation potentials (Vi 1/2) for control and glutamate-treated neurons are given in the inset.
63	campal neurons results in a large $30 mV hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation properties (Fig. 4) as well as a significant delay in the recovery from inactivation of IK currents (Misonou et al., 2004; Mohapatra et al., unpublished data).
64	Intracellular dialysis of hippocampal neurons with alkaline phosphatase also leads to similar hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage-dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation properties of Kv2.1-based
65	In cultured hippocampal neurons the IK currents typically get activated at $25 to 20 mV, which upon dephosphorylation stimuli shifts to 55 to 50 mV (Fig. 4).
66	The consequences of such functional modifications in the IK currents during enhanced excitatory activity in neurons could lead to an increase in the refractory period and slowing down the discharge rate of action potential spikes (Surmeier and Foehring,  2004).
67	Similar effects on firing of action potential spikes upon kainate treatment of retinal ganglion neurons have earlier been reported (Taschenberger and Grantyn, 1998), where Kv2.1 is expressed (Pinto and Klumpp, 1998).
68	In fact using computational modeling studies as well as current-clamp experiments in cultured rat hippocampal neurons we observed that upon glutamate treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons leads to a drastic decrease in action potential firing frequencies (Mohapatra et al., unpublished data).
69	It is noteworthy that these changes in phosphorylation, localization, and function of Kv2.1/IK persisted up to 2 h in cultured neurons.
70	In other words, this Kv2.1 modulation can provide long-lasting changes in the E–S coupling of neurons in response to dynamic changes in neuronal activity.
71	In conclusion, the above-mentioned modulation of Kv2.1 in hippocampal neurons during altered neuronal activity is possibly one of several key players in the process of regulation of neuronal excitability and adaptation of neurons to hyperexcitability.
72	The surface expression levels of somatodendritic GluRl subunits in hippocampal pyramidal neurons is controlled through phosphorylation (Ehlers, 2000), and glutamate receptors2 phosphorylation reduces its affinity for the interacting protein GRIP, leading to changes in localization and synaptic clustering (Chung et al., 2000).
73	That a broad inhibitor for protein phosphatases (okadaic acid) induces hyper-phosphorylation of Kv2.1 revealed a dynamic and constitutive phosphorylation–dephosphorylation cycle of Kv2.1 in cultured neurons (Misonou  unidentified anchoring and/or scaffolding proteins, which determine the clustered localization of Kv2.1 and presumably regulate the somatodendritic `microsignaling' domains.
74	Diagrammatic representation of the intracellular signaling mechanism thought to underlie the activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Kv2.1, and the subsequent changes in Kv2.1 localization and function.
75	Kv2.1 channels are hyperphosphorylated and localized in high-density clusters in the plasma membrane of control neurons (upper panel) and have relatively slow activation and inactivation properties.
76	Under control conditions, neurons have quite uniform action potential properties (upper panel firing pattern).
77	Increased excitatory activity through activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors leads to Ca2+-influx, and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.
78	Upon increased neuronal activity, calcineurin directly or indirectly induces persistent dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 and leads to dispersion of Kv2.1 clusters.
79	An alanine scan through the domain for polarized and clustered localization revealed that three of the four critical amino acids are serine residues (Lim et al., 2000), raising the possibility that changes in phosphorylation alters the affinity of this domain for yet  Kv2.1, the major IK channel in cultured hippocampal neurons, is expressed at a very high level in virtually all brain neurons.
80	This particular abundance presumably reflects a fundamental and general role for Kv2.1 in neurons.
81	Kv2.1 has a single channel conductance of $10 pS when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Chapman et al., 2001; Pascual et al., 1997; Taglialatela and Stefani, 1993).
82	Possible role of Kv2.1 in neuronal signaling.
83	(A) Kv2.1 functions as a potent suppressor of the intrinsic neuronal excitability during high frequency repetitive events.
84	As all electric impulses from dendrites have to pass through the soma before reaching the site of action potential initiation, the electrical properties of the somatic membrane affect the overall excitability of the neuron.
85	Kv2.1 as a major IK channel could function as a bottleneck resistor (RKv2.1) of a neuron.
86	Kv2.1 by antisense oligonucleotides in cultured hippocampal slices (Du et al., 2000) clearly showed that Kv2.1 deficiency causes hyperexcitability in CAl pyramidal neurons under high frequency repetitive stimulation (1 Hz), without affecting the shape of a single action potential under low frequency stimulation (0.2 Hz).
87	Conversely, when IK currents are potentiated by arachidonic acid, IK/Kv2.1 prevents cultured neurons from falling into hyperexcitable state evoked by 4-aminopyridine (Colbert and Pan, 1999).
88	These findings strongly suggest that Kv2.1 functions as a potent suppressor of the intrinsic neuronal excitability during high frequency repetitive events.
89	There are several spatial compartments that are key to processing synaptically-derived electrical signals to affect the input– output relationship of how these signals are passed to target cells: post-synaptic membranes, dendritic spines, dendritic shafts, somata, axons, and nerve terminals.
90	A-type channels localized in dendritic membranes of CA1 hippocampal neurons have been shown to regulate local membrane excitability (Frick et al., 2004).
91	As all electrical signals pass through the soma, this represents an especially important site to efficiently change the net input–output relationship of neurons.
92	This is an effective way for a neuron to scale up and down overall intrinsic excitability (Fig. 6B).
93	The concentration of Kv2.1 channels to the proximal dendritic and somatic membrane makes this channel a good candidate for such an "on/off switch." As discussed above, further dynamic modulation of Kv2.1 by neuronal activity may provide a novel form of homeostatic neuronal plasticity.
94	In conclusion, dynamic modulation of the Kv2.1 channel represents a novel mechanism to regulate neuronal excitability.
95	The high level expression of Kv2.1 on somata and proximal dendrites of neurons throughout mammalian brain, combined with the extent of the effects of altering phosphorylation state on Kv2.1 localization and function, affords neurons a potent yet reversible mechanism to regulate intrinsic excitability.
96	Activity-dependent modulation of Kv2.1, with resultant depression of intrinsic excitability, may provide homeostasis to neuronal function in the face of physiological or pathophysiological increases in excitatory synaptic stimulation.

152	Voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels mediate depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry into electrically excitable cells, including muscle cells, neurons, and endocrine and sensory cells, thereby controlling a large variety of crucial physiological processes.
153	Cav1.4 channels also exhibit a restricted expression profile and are mainly found in retinal neurons [1,3,5,6].
154	Recently, this isoform has also been found in cells of the immune system [5].
155	In contrast, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 are more widely distributed and occur in neurons, sensory cells of the retina and inner ear, endocrine cells, smooth muscle, and the heart (see references in [7]).
156	Both isoforms are often expressed together in a single cell or tissue.
157	Due to the lack of isoform-selective modulators it is impossible to determine their relative contribution to Ca2+ currents or function in these cells by pharmacological means.
158	Therefore, genetically modified mice were  developed [7–11] as powerful tools to successfully dissect their role for many physiological functions, including sinoatrial and AV-node pacemaking, cardiac and smooth muscle contraction, insulin secretion in pancreatic b-cells [7,10], hearing [8], and dihydropyridine-induced antidepressant-like behavior [7].
159	The ERG data are compatible with a defect in neurotransmission within the retina between photoreceptors and second-order neurons [13].
160	Unlike in fast chemical synapses, in which nonLTCCs (such as Cav2.1 and Cav2.2) couple to neurotransmitter release [1], L-type Ca2+ channels are the predominant channels controlling neurotransmitter secretion from cochlear inner hair cells [8] and retinal photoreceptors (see references in [3,5,6]).
161	Unlike in most other fast chemical synapses, where neurotransmitter release occurs only during bursts of short action potentials ("phasic release"), these cells exhibit "tonic" neurotransmitter release in response to graded changes in the membrane potential.
162	Light induces hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells and diminishes excitatory neurotransmitter release at their synaptic terminals.
163	It took several years until cloned Cav1.4 channel complexes could be functionally expressed in mammalian cells [3] to investigate their functional and pharmacological properties [3,5,6].
164	After expression in cultured mammalian cells, recombinant Cav1.4-currents
165	Cav1.4 loss-of-function would therefore be expected to decrease photoreceptor neurotransmitter release capacity and thus impair signaling to second-order retinal neurons, thus explaining the ERG abnormalities.
166	Cav1.4 channels may also contribute to the LTCC currents measured in bipolar cell terminals explaining punctate Cav1.4 a1-immunostaining in the mouse inner plexiform layer [15].
167	Two other missense mutations investigated in our study, R508Q, L1364H, resulted in lower Cav1.4 protein expression density in transfected tsA-201 cells, which may, although not yet proven, also decrease retinal Ca2+ current density.
168	Independent of whether Na+- or Ca2+ channels are mutated, muscle fibers of HPP patients show a paradoxical, long-lasting depolarization in response to low extracellular potassium leading to Na+-channel inactivation, loss of membrane excitability, and paralysis [19,20].
169	This results in skeletal muscle contractures with ATPdepletion, excessive activation of glycogenolysis and cell metabolism, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and lactic acid acidosis.
170	Rather than contributing to fast neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals [7], their somatodendritic Ca2+ signals play a major role in coupling synaptic activity to gene-transcription through different intracellular signaling pathways (for review, see [22]).
171	This allows them to contribute to synaptic plasticity and control neuronal functions of pharmacotherapeutic relevance, including drug taking behavior, mood behavior, and fear memory (for reviews, see [7,22]).
172	Interestingly, enhanced expression is mainly restricted to cerebellar Purkinje cells, suggesting that L-type Ca2+ channels in these cells can mediate episodic dystonia.
173	This is surprising because in these neurons LTCC expression is very low thus mediating only about 7% of the total Ca2+ channel current [25,26].
174	Interestingly, Cav2.1-deficient mice, which also develop severe dystonia, also  show an increased contribution of L-type currents in Purkinje but not in cerebellar granule cells [26].
175	The finding that enhanced LTCC expression, and most likely activity, in Purkinje cells contributes to the paroxysmal dystonia of the tottering phenotype is also in good agreement with the observations that dystonic episodes lead to neuronal activation in the cerebellum and its relay nuclei in these mice [27], and that the dystonic phenotype is absent in tottering mice lacking Purkinje cells [28].
176	As demonstrated here, dysregulation of these channels, even in neurons where they only contribute marginally to total Ca2+ channel currents, can be relevant for disease.

183	Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow.
184	Additional Key Words lactate/pyruvate ratio anaerobic glycolysis cerebral hypoxia  Introduction D In 1967, Froman and Smith1 reported that lactate concentration of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage markedly increased, and it was concluded that the increase was due to the glucose metabolism of shed blood cells per se in the cerebrospinal fluid space.
185	u These facts suggested that even in the presence of blood in cerebrospinal fluid, anaerobic glycolysis of brain tissue, in addition to that of shed blood cells, could be reflected in cerebrospinal fluid lactate level or cerebrospinal fluid lactate/pyruvate ratio.
186	There have been observations suggesting that one of the causes of increased cerebrospinal fluid lactate in subarachnoid hemorrhage could be due to the glycolytic process in the shed blood cells.
187	As the experimental conditions were the same in the two groups except for hematoma formation in intracerebral hemorrhage, the circulatory and the metabolic disturbances of the brain are assumed to be more severe in intracerebral hemorrhage than in subarachnoid hemorrhage. These facts suggest that, in addition to a rise in lactate derived from shed blood cells, an increase in cerebrospinal fluid lactate/pyruvate ratio as well as lactate in hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid seems to reflect the anaerobic state of the brain.

206	Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that, in the developing neocortex, Na 1.1 was clustered predominantly at the axon initial segments of v parvalbumin-positive interneurons.
207	In heterozygous knock-in mice, trains of evoked action potentials in these fast-spiking, inhibitory cells exhibited pronounced spike amplitude decrement late in the burst.
208	Our data indicate that Na 1.1 plays critical roles in the spike v output from positive interneurons and, furthermore, that the specifically altered function of these inhibitory circuits may contribute to epileptic seizures in the mice.
209	Key words: SCN1A; Na 1.1; severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy; parvalbumin-positive; fast spiking; interneurons v  Introduction Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials in electrically excitable tissues, such as brain, muscle, and heart.
210	The pore-forming subunits also serve as voltage sensors, whereas the accessory subunits modulate the voltage dependence and kinetics and cellular localization of the subunits.
211	The type I sodium channel (Nav1.1) has been reported to be expressed in the brain, in which it is localized to somata and dendrites of neurons (Westenbroek et al., 1989; Gong et al., 1999).
212	Recently, Yu et al. (2006) generated Nav1.1-null mice exhibiting spontaneous seizures and whole-cell sodium currents that were significantly reduced in isolated GABAergic interneurons but not in pyramidal cells from hippocampus, suggesting that loss of Nav1.1 might specifically decrease inhibition resulting in epilepsy.
213	However, a reexamination of Nav1.1 distribution and localization in the brain is required to resolve why the loss of Nav1.1 affects only inhibitory, but not pyramidal, neurons when both cell types express the channel.
214	Nav1.1 is predominantly found at the axon initial segments of parvalbumin-positive interneurons.
215	In the hippocampus, Nav1.1 is also predominantly distributed within somata and axons of positive interneurons, whereas pyramidal neurons express Nav1.1 at extremely low levels.
216	Finally, we show that Nav1.1 is involved in sustained high-frequency firing of neocortical fastspiking interneurons.
217	Approximately 10 –15 embryonic stem cells from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) was inserted to the filled Asp718 site to one targeted clone (5D8) was injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts.

220	Transfected embryonic stem cells erozygous for the R1407X mutation was obtained and subsequently crossed were plated on neomycin-resistant, mitomycin C-treated mouse embry- with C57BL/6 females to generate N2 Scn1a R1407X/ mice.

223	Once a fluorescent interneuron from layer II/III was selected using fluorescent microscopy, it was visualized with infrared-differential interference contrast optics (BX50WI; Olympus, Hamamatsu, Japan) and recorded with conventional current-clamp techniques.
224	Electrophysiological properties of neurons were identified in response to injection of positive or negative square current pulses lasting 500 ms.
225	Then, bigger positive currents were applied to look at frequency adaptation of cells.
226	Electrophysiological data were assigned to cell type on the basis of whole-cell biocytin fills during each recording.
227	Slices that contained stained cells were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C and reacted with streptavidin and Alexa Flour 546 conjugate (Invitrogen).
228	Eight neurons (taken from eight animals) were recorded for both WT and HET mice.
229	We choose the R1407X mutation because this mutation is identical to a pathogenic mutation found in three unrelated severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy patients (Sugawara et al., 2002; Fujiwara et al., 2003; Fukuma et al., 2004) and the mutant Nav1.1 expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells was inactive in channel function (Sugawara et al., 2003).

241	Nav1.1 protein localizes largely to somata and axons of parvalbuminpositive interneurons in the developing mouse hippocampus In hippocampus, somata of nonpyramidal cells and fibers scattered in stratum oriens, pyramidale, and radiatum were Nav1.1 immunoreactive moderately, whereas Nav1.1 immunoreactivities of pyramidal cell somata were negligible (Fig. 6 Aa,Ab).
242	as supplemental material) but different from those of previous immunohistochemistry, suggesting that Nav1.1 is expressed in both pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells (Westenbroek et al., 1989; Gong et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2006) (see Discussion).
243	Examination of Nav1.1 colocalization with parvalbumin revealed that nearly all (54 of 55; 98.2%) positive interneurons had Nav1.1-immunoreactive
244	somata and that positive interneurons composed the majority (54 of 71; 76.1%) of Nav1.1-immunoreactive cells (Fig. 6 Ba,Bc,Bd).
245	These fibers were phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactive (Fig. 6Ca–Cc), suggesting possible Nav1.1 localization to distal axons of positive interneurons.
246	fibers were IV-spectrin immunoreactive and located at the axon initial segments of positive interneurons (Fig. 6 Bi–Bl ).
247	These results indicate that Nav1.1 in hippocampus is largely localized to somata and, perhaps, proximal and distal axons of nonpyramidal cells, the majority of which are positive interneurons.
248	ted in almost all of the IV-spectrin-immunoreactive fibers that seemed to be pyramidal cell axon initial segments (Fig. 5C) (Komada and Soriano, 2002).
249	Together, these results indicate that Nav1.1 in the developing neocortex is predominantly localized at axon initial segments of positive interneurons.
250	Subcellular localization of Nav1.1 protein in the developing mouse cerebellum In cerebellum, we observed strongly Nav1.1-immunoreactive fibers, which were also immunoreactive for both IV-spectrin and phosphorylated neurofilaments (Fig. 7 A, Ba–Bd,C).
251	These were distributed in inner portion of the molecular layer, close to the Purkinje cell somata.
252	Because the Nav1.1-immunoreactive fibers were located in the lower molecular layer, they appear to be axons of basket cells (Bishop, 1993).
253	Moreover, the Nav1.1-immunoreactive signals were visible on the proximal portion of IV-spectrin-immunoreactive axon initial segments of Purkinje cells (Fig. 7Be–Bh).
254	These observations are consistent with the results of a previous study showing the reduction in  whole-cell sodium current densities in dissociated Purkinje cells of Nav1.1-null mice (Kalume et al., 2005).
255	Moreover, the Nav1.1 immunoreactivities were undetectable in the IV-spectrin-immunoreactive axon initial segments of Kv1.2-immunoreactive neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei (supplemental Fig.

265	Because single-spike amplitude in Gad1 GFP/ :Scn1a R1407X/ interneurons was unaltered, other Nav channels might be involved in action potential generation in the interneurons.
266	Immunohistochemistry showed that Nav1.6, which would be normally contained in neocortical axon initial segments (Van Wart and Matthews, 2006), were localized at axon initial segments of positive, fast-spiking interneurons in the developing neocortex (supplemental Fig.

282	Nav1.1 was reported to cluster predominantly to the AIS-like During early development, the retina and caudal part of the brain subsets of neuronal fibers in the developing retina (Van Wart et switch from Nav1.2 expression to Nav1.1 expression (Beckh et al., al., 2005) and axon initial segments of retinal ganglion cells (Van Wart and Mat-1989; Van Wart et al., 2005).
283	Although previous immunohistochemical studies have indi- pyramidal cells express Nav1.1 in somata (Westenbroek et al., cated that Nav1.1 is distributed homogenously in the brain 1989; Gong et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2006), our immunohistochem-(Westenbroek et al., 1989), our findings, which involve three ical analyses suggest that whereas Nav1.1 is moderately expressed different antibodies, suggest a heterogeneous distribution: in somata of nonpyramidal cells, pyramidal cells expressed Nav1.1 expression in the caudal brain is higher than that in the Nav1.1 only at negligible levels.
284	Moreover, we verified the specificity of each anti- situ hybridization data indicating that, in hippocampus, nonpybody using the Nav1.1-deficient homozygous knock-in mice as ramidal cells express significantly higher Nav1.1 levels than pyranegative controls.
285	Furthermore, our observations are supported midal cells [Furuyama et al., 1993; the Allen brain atlas (www.
286	Furthermore, our results may ex-  plain the interneuron-specific reduction in whole-cell sodium currents observed in hippocampus of Nav1.1-null mice (Yu et al., 2006) (see Introduction).
287	Most importantly, our immunohistochemistry revealed that Nav1.1 is primarily localized to axon initial segments, axons, and somata of positive interneurons in the developing neocortex and hippocampus.
288	Also, the heterozygous fast-spiking interneurons that should be regarded as positive interneurons (Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002) showed no shift in the single-spike amplitudes but rapidly decreased spike amplitudes in the spiking trains, suggesting that Nav1.1 is involved in the maintenance but not in the initiation of sustained fast spiking in the interneurons and probably also in regulating GABA release from the interneurons.
289	Cortical positive interneurons are morphologically grouped as basket and chandelier cells whose axons exclusively innervate somata, proximal dendrites, and axon initial segments of pyramidal cells (Somogyi et al., 1998; Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002).
290	Also, these interneurons are not only connected electrically and chemically to each other but are also self-innervated (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999; Deans et al., 2001; Gibson et al., 2005; Bacci and Huguenard, 2006; Vida et al., 2006).
291	We propose that lowered levels of functional Nav1.1, arising from Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency, alter function of the inhibitory local circuits and networks mediated by positive interneurons and, thereby, cause epileptic seizures.
292	Neocortical positive interneurons in Kv3.2 knock-out mice also show the rapid amplitude decrement in the spike trains (Lau et al., 2000).
293	Kv3 channels are prominently expressed in positive interneurons in neocortex, and loss of Kv3.2 caused the decreased spike repolarization rate and reduced afterhyperpolarization currents, which may result in the amplitude decrement in the spike trains (Lau et al., 2000; Rudy and McBain, 2001).
294	It is therefore likely that impaired fast spiking in positive interneurons might contribute to seizure phenotypes in Kv3.2 knock-out and our Nav1.1 knock-in mice.
295	severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy mutant Nav1.1 channels expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells are inactivated or have attenuated activity (Lossin et al., 2003; Sugawara et al., 2003; Rhodes et al., 2004; Ohmori et al., 2006).
296	However, in HEK293 cells, whereas some generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures mutations cause loss-of-functional Nav1.1 channels, other mutations are gain of functional (Lossin et al., 2002, 2003; Rhodes et al., 2005).
297	The biophysical study on positive interneurons expressing generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures mutant Nav1.1 channels may help to understand pathological differences among the disorders.
298	Cortical positive interneurons show correlated activity during theta oscillations and sharp-wave-associated ripples that have been implicated in information processing (Klausberger et al., 2003).
299	Moreover, in the developing visual cortex, positive interneurons play important roles in critical period plasticity (Hensch, 2005a,b).

320	Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that, in the developing neocortex, Na 1.1 was clustered predominantly at the axon initial segments of v parvalbumin-positive interneurons.
321	In heterozygous knock-in mice, trains of evoked action potentials in these fast-spiking, inhibitory cells exhibited pronounced spike amplitude decrement late in the burst.
322	Our data indicate that Na 1.1 plays critical roles in the spike v output from positive interneurons and, furthermore, that the specifically altered function of these inhibitory circuits may contribute to epileptic seizures in the mice.
323	Key words: SCN1A; Na 1.1; severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy; parvalbumin-positive; fast spiking; interneurons v  Introduction Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials in electrically excitable tissues, such as brain, muscle, and heart.
324	The pore-forming subunits also serve as voltage sensors, whereas the accessory subunits modulate the voltage dependence and kinetics and cellular localization of the subunits.
325	The type I sodium channel (Nav1.1) has been reported to be expressed in the brain, in which it is localized to somata and dendrites of neurons (Westenbroek et al., 1989; Gong et al., 1999).
326	Recently, Yu et al. (2006) generated Nav1.1-null mice exhibiting spontaneous seizures and whole-cell sodium currents that were significantly reduced in isolated GABAergic interneurons but not in pyramidal cells from hippocampus, suggesting that loss of Nav1.1 might specifically decrease inhibition resulting in epilepsy.
327	However, a reexamination of Nav1.1 distribution and localization in the brain is required to resolve why the loss of Nav1.1 affects only inhibitory, but not pyramidal, neurons when both cell types express the channel.
328	Nav1.1 is predominantly found at the axon initial segments of parvalbumin-positive interneurons.
329	In the hippocampus, Nav1.1 is also predominantly distributed within somata and axons of positive interneurons, whereas pyramidal neurons express Nav1.1 at extremely low levels.
330	Finally, we show that Nav1.1 is involved in sustained high-frequency firing of neocortical fastspiking interneurons.

337	Once a fluorescent interneuron from layer II/III was selected using fluorescent microscopy, it was visualized with infrared-differential interference contrast optics (BX50WI; Olympus, Hamamatsu, Japan) and recorded with conventional current-clamp techniques.
338	Electrophysiological properties of neurons were identified in response to injection of positive or negative square current pulses lasting 500 ms.
339	Then, bigger positive currents were applied to look at frequency adaptation of cells.
340	Electrophysiological data were assigned to cell type on the basis of whole-cell biocytin fills during each recording.

342	Eight neurons (taken from eight animals) were recorded for both WT and HET mice.
343	We choose the R1407X mutation because this mutation is identical to a pathogenic mutation found in three unrelated severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy patients (Sugawara et al., 2002; Fujiwara et al., 2003; Fukuma et al., 2004) and the mutant Nav1.1 expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells was inactive in channel function (Sugawara et al., 2003).

357	Examination of Nav1.1 colocalization with parvalbumin revealed that nearly all (54 of 55; 98.2%) positive interneurons had Nav1.1-immunoreactive

359	These fibers were phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactive (Fig. 6Ca–Cc), suggesting possible Nav1.1 localization to distal axons of positive interneurons.
360	fibers were IV-spectrin immunoreactive and located at the axon initial segments of positive interneurons (Fig. 6 Bi–Bl ).

364	Subcellular localization of Nav1.1 protein in the developing mouse cerebellum In cerebellum, we observed strongly Nav1.1-immunoreactive fibers, which were also immunoreactive for both IV-spectrin and phosphorylated neurofilaments (Fig. 7 A, Ba–Bd,C).
365	These were distributed in inner portion of the molecular layer, close to the Purkinje cell somata.
366	Because the Nav1.1-immunoreactive fibers were located in the lower molecular layer, they appear to be axons of basket cells (Bishop, 1993).
367	Moreover, the Nav1.1-immunoreactive signals were visible on the proximal portion of IV-spectrin-immunoreactive axon initial segments of Purkinje cells (Fig. 7Be–Bh).
368	These observations are consistent with the results of a previous study showing the reduction in  whole-cell sodium current densities in dissociated Purkinje cells of Nav1.1-null mice (Kalume et al., 2005).
369	Moreover, the Nav1.1 immunoreactivities were undetectable in the IV-spectrin-immunoreactive axon initial segments of Kv1.2-immunoreactive neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei (supplemental Fig.

434	Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that, in the developing neocortex, Na 1.1 was clustered predominantly at the axon initial segments of v parvalbumin-positive interneurons.
435	In heterozygous knock-in mice, trains of evoked action potentials in these fast-spiking, inhibitory cells exhibited pronounced spike amplitude decrement late in the burst.
436	Our data indicate that Na 1.1 plays critical roles in the spike v output from positive interneurons and, furthermore, that the specifically altered function of these inhibitory circuits may contribute to epileptic seizures in the mice.
437	Key words: SCN1A; Na 1.1; severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy; parvalbumin-positive; fast spiking; interneurons v  Introduction Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials in electrically excitable tissues, such as brain, muscle, and heart.
438	The pore-forming subunits also serve as voltage sensors, whereas the accessory subunits modulate the voltage dependence and kinetics and cellular localization of the subunits.
439	The type I sodium channel (Nav1.1) has been reported to be expressed in the brain, in which it is localized to somata and dendrites of neurons (Westenbroek et al., 1989; Gong et al., 1999).
440	Recently, Yu et al. (2006) generated Nav1.1-null mice exhibiting spontaneous seizures and whole-cell sodium currents that were significantly reduced in isolated GABAergic interneurons but not in pyramidal cells from hippocampus, suggesting that loss of Nav1.1 might specifically decrease inhibition resulting in epilepsy.
441	However, a reexamination of Nav1.1 distribution and localization in the brain is required to resolve why the loss of Nav1.1 affects only inhibitory, but not pyramidal, neurons when both cell types express the channel.
442	Nav1.1 is predominantly found at the axon initial segments of parvalbumin-positive interneurons.
443	In the hippocampus, Nav1.1 is also predominantly distributed within somata and axons of positive interneurons, whereas pyramidal neurons express Nav1.1 at extremely low levels.
444	Finally, we show that Nav1.1 is involved in sustained high-frequency firing of neocortical fastspiking interneurons.

451	Once a fluorescent interneuron from layer II/III was selected using fluorescent microscopy, it was visualized with infrared-differential interference contrast optics (BX50WI; Olympus, Hamamatsu, Japan) and recorded with conventional current-clamp techniques.
452	Electrophysiological properties of neurons were identified in response to injection of positive or negative square current pulses lasting 500 ms.
453	Then, bigger positive currents were applied to look at frequency adaptation of cells.
454	Electrophysiological data were assigned to cell type on the basis of whole-cell biocytin fills during each recording.
455	Slices that contained stained cells were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C and reacted with streptavidin and Alexa Flour 546 conjugate (Invitrogen).
456	Eight neurons (taken from eight animals) were recorded for both WT and HET mice.
457	We choose the R1407X mutation because this mutation is identical to a pathogenic mutation found in three unrelated severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy patients (Sugawara et al., 2002; Fujiwara et al., 2003; Fukuma et al., 2004) and the mutant Nav1.1 expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells was inactive in channel function (Sugawara et al., 2003).

471	Examination of Nav1.1 colocalization with parvalbumin revealed that nearly all (54 of 55; 98.2%) positive interneurons had Nav1.1-immunoreactive

473	These fibers were phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactive (Fig. 6Ca–Cc), suggesting possible Nav1.1 localization to distal axons of positive interneurons.
474	fibers were IV-spectrin immunoreactive and located at the axon initial segments of positive interneurons (Fig. 6 Bi–Bl ).

477	Together, these results indicate that Nav1.1 in the developing neocortex is predominantly localized at axon initial segments of positive interneurons.
478	Subcellular localization of Nav1.1 protein in the developing mouse cerebellum In cerebellum, we observed strongly Nav1.1-immunoreactive fibers, which were also immunoreactive for both IV-spectrin and phosphorylated neurofilaments (Fig. 7 A, Ba–Bd,C).
479	These were distributed in inner portion of the molecular layer, close to the Purkinje cell somata.
480	Because the Nav1.1-immunoreactive fibers were located in the lower molecular layer, they appear to be axons of basket cells (Bishop, 1993).
481	Moreover, the Nav1.1-immunoreactive signals were visible on the proximal portion of IV-spectrin-immunoreactive axon initial segments of Purkinje cells (Fig. 7Be–Bh).
482	These observations are consistent with the results of a previous study showing the reduction in  whole-cell sodium current densities in dissociated Purkinje cells of Nav1.1-null mice (Kalume et al., 2005).
483	Moreover, the Nav1.1 immunoreactivities were undetectable in the IV-spectrin-immunoreactive axon initial segments of Kv1.2-immunoreactive neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei (supplemental Fig.

493	Because single-spike amplitude in Gad1 GFP/ :Scn1a R1407X/ interneurons was unaltered, other Nav channels might be involved in action potential generation in the interneurons.
494	Immunohistochemistry showed that Nav1.6, which would be normally contained in neocortical axon initial segments (Van Wart and Matthews, 2006), were localized at axon initial segments of positive, fast-spiking interneurons in the developing neocortex (supplemental Fig.

510	Nav1.1 was reported to cluster predominantly to the AIS-like During early development, the retina and caudal part of the brain subsets of neuronal fibers in the developing retina (Van Wart et switch from Nav1.2 expression to Nav1.1 expression (Beckh et al., al., 2005) and axon initial segments of retinal ganglion cells (Van Wart and Mat-1989; Van Wart et al., 2005).
511	Although previous immunohistochemical studies have indi- pyramidal cells express Nav1.1 in somata (Westenbroek et al., cated that Nav1.1 is distributed homogenously in the brain 1989; Gong et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2006), our immunohistochem-(Westenbroek et al., 1989), our findings, which involve three ical analyses suggest that whereas Nav1.1 is moderately expressed different antibodies, suggest a heterogeneous distribution: in somata of nonpyramidal cells, pyramidal cells expressed Nav1.1 expression in the caudal brain is higher than that in the Nav1.1 only at negligible levels.
512	Moreover, we verified the specificity of each anti- situ hybridization data indicating that, in hippocampus, nonpybody using the Nav1.1-deficient homozygous knock-in mice as ramidal cells express significantly higher Nav1.1 levels than pyranegative controls.
513	Furthermore, our observations are supported midal cells [Furuyama et al., 1993; the Allen brain atlas (www.
514	Furthermore, our results may ex-  plain the interneuron-specific reduction in whole-cell sodium currents observed in hippocampus of Nav1.1-null mice (Yu et al., 2006) (see Introduction).
515	Most importantly, our immunohistochemistry revealed that Nav1.1 is primarily localized to axon initial segments, axons, and somata of positive interneurons in the developing neocortex and hippocampus.
516	Also, the heterozygous fast-spiking interneurons that should be regarded as positive interneurons (Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002) showed no shift in the single-spike amplitudes but rapidly decreased spike amplitudes in the spiking trains, suggesting that Nav1.1 is involved in the maintenance but not in the initiation of sustained fast spiking in the interneurons and probably also in regulating GABA release from the interneurons.
517	Cortical positive interneurons are morphologically grouped as basket and chandelier cells whose axons exclusively innervate somata, proximal dendrites, and axon initial segments of pyramidal cells (Somogyi et al., 1998; Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002).
518	Also, these interneurons are not only connected electrically and chemically to each other but are also self-innervated (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999; Deans et al., 2001; Gibson et al., 2005; Bacci and Huguenard, 2006; Vida et al., 2006).
519	We propose that lowered levels of functional Nav1.1, arising from Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency, alter function of the inhibitory local circuits and networks mediated by positive interneurons and, thereby, cause epileptic seizures.
520	Neocortical positive interneurons in Kv3.2 knock-out mice also show the rapid amplitude decrement in the spike trains (Lau et al., 2000).
521	Kv3 channels are prominently expressed in positive interneurons in neocortex, and loss of Kv3.2 caused the decreased spike repolarization rate and reduced afterhyperpolarization currents, which may result in the amplitude decrement in the spike trains (Lau et al., 2000; Rudy and McBain, 2001).
522	It is therefore likely that impaired fast spiking in positive interneurons might contribute to seizure phenotypes in Kv3.2 knock-out and our Nav1.1 knock-in mice.
523	severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy mutant Nav1.1 channels expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells are inactivated or have attenuated activity (Lossin et al., 2003; Sugawara et al., 2003; Rhodes et al., 2004; Ohmori et al., 2006).
524	However, in HEK293 cells, whereas some generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures mutations cause loss-of-functional Nav1.1 channels, other mutations are gain of functional (Lossin et al., 2002, 2003; Rhodes et al., 2005).

ISOM Department of Pharmacology The University of Michigan Ann Arbor  Voltage-gated sodium channels are glycoprotein complexes responsible for initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells such as central and peripheral neurons, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, and neuroendocrine cells.

549	A sodium channel signaling complex is proposed that involves β subunits as channel modulators as well as cell adhesion molecules, other cell adhesion molecules such as neurofascin and contactin, receptor tyrosine phosphatase β, and extracellular matrix molecules such as tenascin.

551	In contrast, these same channels expressed in mammalian fibroblasts gate in a fast mode in the absence of β subunits and β subunit coexpression has more subtle effects than those observed in oocytes, suggesting that the major function of β subunits in neurons may be something in addition to kinetic modulation of sodium channels (Isom, Scheuer, and others 1994).
552	A number of excellent reviews describing the effects of sodium channel β subunits on channel gating have  been published (Catterall 1992; Goldin 1993; Isom, De Jongh, and others 1994; Adelman 1995; Gurnett and Campbell 1996; Catterall 1999; Catterall 2000).
553	So far, only the sodium channel β subunits have been shown to function as cell adhesion molecules.
554	What other proteins associate with sodium channels in neurons, particularly at the node of Ranvier?
555	How is sodium channel function affected by these associated proteins and by the local cellular environment?
556	Finally, can sodium channel β subunits function independently of α depending on the cellular milieu?
557	In this review, we will present evidence that sodium channel β subunits form critical communication links between the extracellular and intracellular environments of the neuron—and that they are anything but auxiliary.
558	Sodium Channel β Subunits Form a Family of Cell Adhesion Molecules  β1, β1A, β2, and β3 are transmembrane proteins with type I topology: containing an extracellular amino-terminus, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular carboxyl terminus.
559	In the adult rat, immunolocalization of β1A polypeptides showed expression in heart and dorsal root ganglion neurons (Kazen-Gillespie and others 2000).
560	All four β subunit molecules contain extracellular immunoglobulin domains that are structurally homologous to the V-set of the immunoglobulin superfamily that includes Cell Adhesion Molecules (Isom and Catterall 1996).
561	This unique property of the sodium channel auxiliary subunits was first discovered following sequence analysis of β2, revealing that its extracellular domain contained an immunoglobulin fold and an extended region with similarity to the CAM contactin (Isom and others 1995).
562	Two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of contactin have greater than 40% amino acid sequence identity with sodium channel β2 subunits.
563	Subsequent analysis of the extracellular domains of β1/β1A, and β3 showed homology to the CAM myelin P (McCormick and o others 1998; Morgan and others 2000).
564	Although the intracellular domain of β1A is very different from β1, there are conserved residues between the two.
565	Structure-Function Experiments Define the immunoglobulin Loop Region of β1 and Sites of α-β1 Interaction  The extracellular domain of β1 is critical for channel gating and modulation of the voltage dependence of brain and skeletal muscle sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2) (Chen and Cannon 1995; Makita and others 1996; McCormick and others 1998; McCormick and others 1999).
566	Removal of the intracellular domain of β1, substitution of the intracellular β1 domain with the corresponding domains from either β2 or the structurally related protein myelin P , or attachment of the β1 extracellular domain to the o plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor all resulted in retention of full β1-like modulation of SCN2A sodium channels (McCormick and others 1998).
567	Site-directed mutagenesis of the extracellular β1 immunoglobulin loop, based on comparison with the crystal structure of the immunoglobulin loop of myelin P , resulted in o identification of key residues in the A/A′ face of β1 required for interaction with Nav1.2 in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2: E4, D6, and E8) (McCormick and others 1998).
568	The studies described above suggested strongly that the extracellular immunoglobulin domain of β1 subunits interacts with α subunits through a site formed by one or more extracellular loops of the α subunit.
569	The extracellular domain has been shown to be critical for α-β1 subunit interactions as well as cell adhesion, whereas the intracellular domain is involved in ankyrin recruitment and interaction with receptor tyrosine phosphatase β.
570	A long QT syndrome-3 mutation in SCN5A (An and others 1998) suggests that the intracellular region of β1 may also be involved in α subunit modulation.
571	Are α-β1 interactions strictly extracellular?
572	According to topology predictions, D1790 is located intracellularly.
573	This mutation has been shown to result in the disruption of α-β1 subunit interactions when expressed in transfected HEK cells.
574	These studies suggest that α and β1 may have both intracellular and extracellular interaction domains and/or that channel modulation is more complex in mammalian cells than in Xenopus oocytes, perhaps requiring other signaling molecules.
575	Two key observations provided important clues: First, β2 subunit expression was found to be required to detect the translocation of newly synthesized sodium channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane of primary cultured embryonic neurons (Schmidt and others 1985; Schmidt and Catterall 1986).
576	Second, expression of β2 subunits alone in Xenopus ooctyes resulted in dramatic changes in membrane capacitance through promotion of intracellular vesicle fusion with the microvillus membrane (Isom and others 1995).
577	To investigate further, our laboratory as well as the Catterall laboratory asked whether β subunits function as cell adhesion molecules (Srinivasan and others 1998; Xiao and others 1999; Malhotra and others 2000): Do  they interact with the extracellular matrix?
578	Do they interact with other cell adhesion molecules leading to cellular aggregation and cytoskeletal changes?
579	Do they participate in cell migration?
580	Sodium Channel β Subunits Interact with Extracellular Matrix Proteins and Influence Cell Migration  Glial-derived extracellular matrix molecules, for example tenascin-C and tenascin-R, play important roles in cellular interactions in developing or injured neuronal cells, such as neuronal migration, neuritogenesis, and neuronal regeneration (Faissner 1997; Schachner 1997).
581	The tenascins were chosen as candidate extracellular matrix molecules because they bind contactin, a CAM with homology to sodium channel β2 subunits (Isom and others 1995).
582	Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing various domains of tenascin-C and tenascin-R were tested for their ability to bind purified sodium channels or the recombinant β2 subunit extracellular domain.
583	Transfected cells expressing β1 or β2 were repelled from tenascin-R plated on a nitrocellulose substrate (Xiao and others 1999).
584	Both the β1- and β2-expressing cell lines were strongly repelled by EGF-like domains (cysteine-rich amino terminus of tenascin-R plus the EGF-like domains) but adhered well to EGF-S (EGF-like domains only), fibronectin 6-8, FG, and Glutathione S-transferase, suggesting that the amino-terminus of tenascin-R may be involved in repulsion of β1- or β2-expressing cells.
585	A mixture of EGF-like domains, EGF-S, and fibronectin6-8 fusion proteins added to the cell culture medium blocked the adhesion of β1-expressing cells to the EGF-like or fibronectin-like domains of tenascin-R in a concentrationdependent manner.

588	The identities of the cell lines are indicated on the figure.
589	Sodium Channel β Subunits Interact Homophilically to Cause Cellular Aggregation and Recruitment of Ankyrin to the Plasma Membrane  Cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily interact homophilically and heterophilically to transduce signals between adjacent cells or adjacent axons where they participate in, for example, axonal fasciculation, growth cone guidance, and nodal formation.
590	It has been shown that Cell Adhesion Molecules of the L1 family interact homophilically in a trans mechanism to produce cellular aggregation (Hortsch and Bieber 1991; Kamiguchi and Lemmon 1997).
591	Following homophilic binding, L1 family Cell Adhesion Molecules that have intracellular carboxyl-terminal domains transduce signals resulting in the recruitment of ankyrin and spectrin to points of cell-cell contact.
592	Drosophila S2 cells are a classic model system in which potential Cell Adhesion Molecules have been tested for these properties (Bieber 1994).
593	S2 cells do not express endogenous Cell Adhesion Molecules and grow as a suspension culture. cDNAs of interest are then cloned into the S2 cell expression vector under the control of an inducible Drosophila metallothionein promoter.
594	Upon induction of protein expression, S2 cells transfected with Cell Adhesion Molecules aggregate.
595	Using the S2 cell model system, we tested whether sodium channel β1 and β2 subunits behave in a similar manner.
596	S2 cells transfected with β1, β2, α-β1, or α-β2 displayed homophilic interactions, whereas cells transfected with α alone did not (Malhotra and others 2000).
597	Immunocytochemical analysis of the cell aggregates revealed recruitment of ankyrin to sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 5).
598	Coimmunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain membranes showed that ankyrin , G which is expressed at mammalian nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments, and β1 or β2 subunits are physically associated in mammalian neurons (Malhotra and others 1999).
599	The intracellular domains of β1 and β2 are critical for ankyrin recruitment (Malhotra and others 2000).
600	Mutant constructs lacking the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domains of β1 and β2, respectively, were transfected into S2 cells and the cells were induced to aggregate.
601	Whereas both cell lines aggregated, ankyrin staining was diffuse and not concentrated to points of cell-cell contact as in cells expressing full-length β subunits.
602	It was concluded that the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domains of β1 and β2 are necessary for transhomophilic-mediated signal transduction to the cytoskeleton.
603	Cytoskeletal interactions through ankyrin and the β subunits may be critical to sodium channel placement in  excitable cells.
604	In other studies, treatment of inside-out patches of ventricular cells with cytochalasin-D induced cardiac sodium channels (Nav1.5) to enter a mode characterized by lower peak open probability with a greater persistent activity, consistent with a decrease in the rate of inactivation (Undrovinas and others 1995).
605	Immunolocalization of β1A subunit polypeptides showed expression in rat lung alveoli and in bronchus columnar epithelial and endothelial cells in pulmonary arterioles (Kazen-Gillespie and others 2000).
606	Thus, there remains the possibility that β subunits may be expressed as cell adhesion molecules in the absence of sodium channels.
607	In this way, sodium channel β subunits may be similar to AMOG/β2, a cell adhesion molecule that can also participate in ion transport as a β2 subunit of the murine Na,K ATPase (Muller-Husmann and others 1993).
608	Interestingly, the extracellular carbonic anhydrase domain of receptor tyrosine phosphatase β interacts with contactin, inducing neurite outgrowth (Peles and others 1995).
609	An intracellular site on β1, but not β2, binds the intracellular phosphatase domains of receptor tyrosine phosphatase β (Ratcliffe and others 2000).
610	Examination of the intracellular tail of β1 and β2 reveals that although this domain of β1 contains a tyrosine residue, the corresponding domain of β2 does not.
611	It has been shown previously that ankyrin binding to neurofascin is regulated by phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue in its intracellular domain (Garver and others 1997).
612	5. β subunit expression results in ankyrin recruitment to points of cell-cell contact.
613	β1-, β2-, αβ1-, or αβ2-transfected S2 cells were induced in the presence of 0.7 mM CuSO , and aggregation was induced by rotary shaking.
614	Two different views of each cell line are presented for comparison.
615	Perhaps the interaction of β1 and receptor tyrosine phosphatase β results in the regulation of ankyrin binding through modulation of this intracellular tyrosine residue in β1.
616	Sodium channel α subunits have also been shown to interact with receptor tyrosine phosphatase β and phosphacan (Ratcliffe and others 2000), with the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (Wood and Slater 1998), with members of the PDZ domain-containing syntrophin family (Gee and others 1998), with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin (Sampo and others 2000), with GTP-binding proteins (Ma and others 1994, 1997), and with the extracellular matrix protein agrin (Sharp and Caldwell 1996).
617	Until recently, there were no identified neuronal sodium channel mutations associated with human disease.
618	This mutation, C121W, changes a critical cysteine residue defining the carboxyl-terminal region of the immunoglobulin loop in β1 to a tryptophan, presumably destabilizing this critical cell adhesion and α subunit association domain (Fig. 1, ; Fig.
619	It will be important in future studies to examine the coexpression of mutant C121W β1 subunits and α subunits in transfected mammalian cells as well as in transgenic animals.
620	Expression of mutant D1790G SCN5A α subunits alone in HEK 293 cells resulted in channels with normal biophysical properties as compared to wild-type, monomeric Nav1.5 channels.
621	The authors proposed that a functional down-regulation of β2 subunits may decrease the interaction of β subunits with tenascins, thereby promoting axonal growth and projection of neurons into the superficial laminae where new synaptic contacts could be initiated.
622	It remains to be seen whether β subunit protein levels correspond to the reported changes in mRNA following neuronal injury.
623	Changes in β subunit protein expression would be expected to regulate sodium channel density and localization in the neuronal plasma membrane or modulate interactions between sodium channels and the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix.
624	Model of voltage-gated sodium channel β subunit cell adhesive interactions at the node of Ranvier.
625	voltage-gated sodium channel β subunits are cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
626	In the nervous system, they are expressed in neurons and in glia.
627	β subunits modulate voltage-gated sodium channel gating and plasma membrane expression levels, interact with the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R, and communicate with other β subunits through trans-homophilic cell adhesive interactions to recruit ankyrin to the plasma membrane.
628	We propose that β subunits on astrocyte projections, on the axon, and on oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells communicate to modulate voltage-gated sodium channel density and localization at nodes of Ranvier.
629	It has now been shown that β subunits also function as cell adhesion molecules in heterologous expression systems.
630	β subunit mRNA ex-  pression has been described in sciatic nerve Schwann cells, astrocytes from spinal cord, optic nerve, and sciatic nerve, and B104 oligodendrocyte precursor cells in culture (Oh and Waxman 1994; Dib-Hajj and others 1996; Oh and others 1997).

664	The cells were held at 120 mV between pulses.
665	In contrast to serial lysine substitution (Wang et al., 2000, 2001), replacement of residues in I-S6 and II-S6 segments with cysteine was well tolerated; all mutant channels were functional when the subunits were coexpressed with the 1 subunits in HEK293 cells.
666	I425C on the extracellular side of I-S6 had a similar shift in the activation curve and a smaller shift in the availability curve in the same direction.
667	V779C on the extracellular side of II-S6 exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts in the activation and availability curves suggesting that this mutation destabilized the closed state and promoted closed state inactivation (Figs.
668	EM studies in the anoxic optic nerve have demonstrated characteristic changes, including mitochondrial swelling and dissolution of cristae, submyelinic vacuoles, detachment of perinodal oligodendrocyte-axon loops, and severe cytoskeletal damage with loss of microtubules and neurofilaments within the axoplasm.
669	In optic nerves exposed to to tetrodotoxin studied at the end of a 60-min period of anoxia, mitochondria showed swelling and loss of cristae, and terminal oligodendroglial loops were detached from the nodal axon membrane.
670	Perinodal astrocytc processes often appeared to be replaced by cellular remnants containing multiple membranous profiles; clusters of shrunken astrocytic processes were present between myelinated axons.
671	Some fibers in the anoxic optic nerve also contain submyelinic vacuoles and display detachment of paranodal oligodendrocyte-axon l o o p s [31].
672	A dense astrocyte process (a) giving rise to a thin perinodal extension can be seen.

674	At most nodes of Ranvier, perinodal astrocyte processes could be observed within the flocculent extracellular matrix surrounding the nodal gap.
675	2 and 3, perinodal astrocyte processes in the optic nerve often arise as thin extensions, radially oriented with respect to the axon, that protrude from larger astrocytic branches.
676	Terminal oligodendroglial loops were, in many cases, detached from the nodal axon membrane (Fig. 4), but the dense undercoating beneath the nodal membrane was clearly preserved at most nodes.
677	The extracellular space at nodes of Ranvier, in anoxic optic nerves exposed to to tetrodotoxin, often appeared expanded and watery, with loss of the flocculent extracellular matrix that is normally seen (Figs.
678	At many nodes in the anoxic optic nerve, at the sites usually occupied by perinodal astrocyte processes, cellular remnants containing multiple membranous profiles, or lucent spaces, were present (Figs.
679	In association with these dense  astrocytic processes, the cxtracellular space was, in some regions, enlarged (Fig. 8).
680	Previous EM studies using this model have demonstrated the presence of mitochondrial swelling with damage to cristae, intramyelinic empty spaces, detachment of paranoda\[ oligodendroglial loops, astrocytic vacuolization, and damage to microtubules and neurofilaments in the axoplasm with dissolution of the axonal cytoskeleton \[31\].
681	The addition of to tetrodotoxin does not, however, prevent the development of other pathologic abnormalities; mitochondrial swelling with damage to cristae, together with detachment of terminal oligodendroglial loops as well as vacuolization of pcrinodal astrocyte processes and shrunken, dense astrocyte processes were observed in the anoxic optic nerve even in the presence of to tetrodotoxin.

714	INTRODUCTION  Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) underlie the rising phase and influence the duration of action potentials in excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac and skeletal myocytes.
715	In vitro, cell-free association of Calmodulin with the carboxy terminus of NaV channels has been demonstrated; however, such studies could be compromised by nonphysiological carboxy terminus peptide conformations that exist under conditions that are required to solubilize the channel or channel fragments.

717	Cell Culture and Transfection Approximately 0.75 × 106 human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in six-well tissue dishes in DMEM supplemented with FBS 10%, l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (10 mg/ml).
718	The cells were cotransfected with 1 and plasmids encoding wild-type sodium channels NaV1.4-EYFP,

720	Transfected cells were identified for patch clamping by ECFP, EYFP, or GFP fluorescence.
721	Current recording was initiated 10 min after establishing the whole-cell configuration to avoid time-dependent shifts in gating.

737	Fusion Constructs Are Functionally Expressed and Interact with Calmodulin We have previously shown that Calmodulin associates with wild type GST-tagged NaV carboxy terminus peptides in vitro (Deschênes et al., 2002), this work motivated studies of the interaction between the carboxy terminus of intact NaV channels and Calmodulin in live cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

In contrast to channel expression, ECFP-Calmodulin expression or the EF hand mutant of Calmodulin (ECFPCaM1234) alone in HEK293 cells is uniform throughout the cell (Fig. 2 A; ECFP-Calmodulin1234 not depicted).

755	Inclusion of the Calmodulin anti-peptide (AIP290-309) in the pipette solution mitigates the Calmodulin-induced shift in the steady-state inactivation curve (V1/2 = 63.7 ± 0.2 mV, n = 7) in cells coexpressing NaV1.4-

761	This nondestructive technique confirms the proximity of the fluorophores and the production of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in cells expressing NaV1.4-EYFP and ECFP-Calmodulin by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ratio of almost 2. (D) Cells coexpressing NaV1.4-EYFP and ECFP-Calmodulin are held at different membrane voltages to populate different channel conformations.
762	fluorescence resonance energy transfer is comparable in cells held at 140 and 60 mV, and is present but reduced at a holding voltage of 20 mV.
763	Deletion mutations of the NaV1.4 carboxy terminus that preserve the IQ motif (e.g., NaV1.41740-EYFP) expressed in HEK293 cells display fluorescence enrichment at the cell perimeter.
764	Both constructs exhibit robust currents when expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 A). (A) Western blots of lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type NaV1.4 and mutant NaV1.4IQ/AA channels reveal a reduction in surface expression of NaV1.4 protein by the IQ/AA mutation compared with wild type with no significant change in immunoreactive protein in total cell lysates.
765	1. (B) The ratio of cell surface expression to total expression of NaV1.4IQ/AA is significantly (P ≤ 0.05, n = 4) reduced compared with wildtype NaV1.4 and NaV1.41740.
766	Cells expressing ECFP alone (n = 5) or coexpressing ECFP with  expressed in HEK293 cells.
767	EYFP-fused wild-type channels are distributed in both the periphery and center of the cell.
768	(D) In contrast, NaV1.4IQ/AA mutant channels fused to EYFP are predominantly distributed in the perinuclear region of the cell, indicating mutant channels are synthesized but remain trapped in internal membranes.
769	The images are as described in C.
770	EYFP (n = 15) exhibited no fluorescence resonance energy transfer (Fig. 6 A); however, HEK293 cells expressing the linked chameleon ECFPEYFP yield a fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency of 28.3 ± 2.8% (n = 12; Fig.
771	The absence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the mutant IQ channel and Calmodulin, and the wild-type channel and free cytosolic ECFP, excludes possibility of fluorescence resonance energy transfer due to generalized enrichment of Calmodulin at the cell membrane, and nonspecific binding of Calmodulin to the channel.
772	Mutant Calmodulin1234 does not bind Ca2+ at physiological intracellular concentrations (Xia et al., 1998), suggesting that the interaction of Calmodulin with NaV1.4 under resting conditions is Ca2+ dependent.
773	However we caution that the cells studied were highly selected to have peak current densities in a range that allows for adequate detection and reliable voltage control.
774	Consistent with the donor dequenching fluorescence resonance energy transfer results, the 33 FRs were <1 in cells expressing the NaV1.4IQ/AA channel with Calmodulin (Fig. 6 C).
775	Coexpressing ECFP-Calmodulin and NaV1.4-EYFP enhanced the ECFP signal in patch-clamped cells held at 140 mV, leading to a mean 22.7 ± 2.0% (n = 15) fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency, which is significantly (P < 0.0006) higher than the fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency of unpatched cells (Fig. 6 D).
776	However, holding at 20 mV yielded a fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency (9.9 ± 2.3%, n = 15) similar to fluorescence resonance energy transfer of unpatched cells (Fig. 6 D).
777	Lysates isolated from cells expressing wild-type or mutant NaV1.4IQ/AA channel proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 7 A) and band intensities were measured to estimate the level of total channel expression.
778	To assess effect of Calmodulin binding on surface expression, cells expressing wild-type or mutant NaV1.4IQ/AA channels were labeled with membraneimpermeable biotin and purified with streptavidin beads.
779	The band intensities of biotinylated proteins, representing cell surface expression, were normalized to the respective total channel protein expression and plotted in Fig. 7 B.
780	eliminates channel function (Fig. 4 G) but does not eliminate cell surface expression, as detected by Western blot and epifluorescence microscopy (Fig.
781	The data suggest that the Calmodulin binding region of the intact carboxy terminus of NaV1.4 is essential for functional cell surface channel expression.
782	To further examine trafficking of the IQ mutant channel, NaV1.4-EYFP or NaV1.4IQ/AAEYFP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cellular channel protein distribution was examined with confocal microscopy.
783	Fluorescence from EYFP-fused wild-type channels was distributed in both the periphery and center of the cell, consistent with trafficking from perinuclear membranes to cell surface (Fig. 7 C).
784	In contrast, signals from the NaV1.4IQ/AA-EYFP mutant channels were predominantly in the perinuclear region, indicating mutant channels are synthesized but remain trapped in  intracellular membranes (Fig. 7 D).
785	Although the IQ/AA mutation interferes with cell surface trafficking of NaV1.4, truncation of the carboxy terminus proximal to IQ generates nonfunctional channels that are expressed on the cell surface.
786	It is possible that the IQ/AA mutation creates a signal that mediates retention in subcellular membranes such as the ER.
787	Either the IQ motif itself or Calmodulin binding to IQ promotes a structure of this region of the carboxy terminus, likely involving residues between 1723 and 1740, that is trafficked to the cell surface.
788	Protein–protein interactions involving the carboxy terminus influence the expression, membrane trafficking, subcellular localization, and gating properties of the pore-forming subunit.
789	Calmodulin Is Tethered to Intact Nav 1.4 through an IQ Motif Our data conclusively demonstrate tethering of Calmodulin to the carboxy terminus of intact NaV1.4 channels in live cells.
790	In resting cells, wild-type Calmodulin increased the donor dequenching fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal in tagged, presumably inactivated NaV1.4 channels (Fig. 6, A and C).
791	We demonstrate that Calmodulin participates in the modulation of cell surface expression of intact NaV1.4 channels by interaction with the IQ motif similar to other channels such as KCNQ1 (Ghosh et al., 2006), SK4 channels (Joiner et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2003), and KCNQ2/Q3 potassium channels (Wen and Levitan., 2002).
792	Our data reveal that mutations in the Calmodulin binding motif reduce total and cell surface expression of NaV1.4.
793	It is possible that the IQ/AA mutation leads to defects in proper channel folding; thus the role of Calmodulin could be in stabilization of proper channel folding and facilitating trafficking of the channel to the cell surface.
794	Calmodulin regulation of channel trafficking to the cell surface and its role in the early stages of channel formation could be a general phenomenon further adding to the diversity of the Calmodulin signaling on ion channel function.
795	In live cells, Calmodulin is associated with carboxy terminus-NaV under resting conditions and Calmodulin remains tethered to the carboxy terminus-NaV over a wide range of voltages, indicating no significant displacement of Calmodulin from any channel conformation.

802	sensory neurons.
803	Nav1.2 deletion leads to massive brainstem neuronal apoptosis and perinatal death (5), and loss of Nav1.6 in natural "med" mutants has been shown to lead to ataxia, dystonia, and paralysis (6).
804	Nav1.7 was first cloned from the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (9, 10).
805	Its presence at high levels in the growth cones of small-diameter neurons (9, 11) suggests that it is likely to play some role in the transmission of nociceptive information.
806	Immunochemical studies of sensory neurons in guinea pigs supports the view that Nav1.7 is associated with nociceptors (12).
807	Next, we used a nociceptor-specific Cre mouse to delete Nav1.7 only in damage-sensing sensory neurons.
808	The Nav1.8 gene is expressed predominantly in nociceptive sensory neurons and is completely absent in tissue other than sensory neurons (19).
809	Crossing these mice with f loxed Nav1.7 mice resulted in viable animals that showed specific deletion of Nav1.7 only in a subset of sensory neurons.
810	The vector was linearized by using NotI and electroporated into 129-derived embryonic stem cells.
811	Arrows highlight double-labeled cells.
812	The complete targeting vector was linearized by using NotI and electroporated into 129-derived embryonic stem cells.
813	These studies were carried out as described previously (20) by using voltageclamp recordings from single dorsal root ganglion neurons of up to 25 m in diameter in culture by using the whole cell variant of the patch-clamp technique.
814	Measurements of electrical input into wide dynamic range neurons in spinal cord neurons were carried out as described in ref.
815	Polyclonal antisera to Nav1.8 and antibodies to other sensory neurons markers were used as described in refs.
816	After screening for homologous recombination in 129 Sv embryonic stem cells selected for the presence of the neomycin-resistance cassette, a single positive cell line was used to generate transgenic  Fig.
817	Functional Cre was expressed in a pattern identical to that of Nav1.8. Expression began at embryonic day 14 in small-diameter neurons in dorsal root, trigeminal, and nodose ganglia but was absent in nonneuronal and CNS tissues.
818	Homologous recombination in 129 Sv embryonic stem cells used a fragment from the SacI site 5 of exon 11 to the NsiI site before exon 16.
819	Thus, deleting Nav1.7 in all sensory and sympathetic neurons causes a lethal perinatal phenotype.
820	We examined the functional consequences of deleting Nav1.7 on sodium channel expression in dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture by using electrophysiological recording (20, 24).
821	A small effect on peak Tetrodotoxin-sensitive current, consistent with residual high levels of Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 in dorsal root ganglion neurons, was observed in the Nav1.7R / knockout.
822	This finding was confirmed by examination of the electrical properties of sensory neurons by using a spinal cord preparation.
823	We examined the evoked responses of single spinal cord lamina V wide dynamic range neurons by using in vivo extracellular recording techniques (25).
824	mice revealed similar patterns of neuronal coding.
825	No difference was observed between the knockout and control mice in the levels of ongoing spontaneous activity, neuronal activity to pinch or brush, or noxious cold stimuli.
826	Likewise, in response to transcutaneous electrical stimulation, Nav1.7R / and fNav1.7 mice displayed similar thresholds for activation of A-and C-fiber input into the spinal cord and the evoked neuronal responses via these afferents after the stimulus train (Fig. 3).
827	(C–F) Responses of lamina V dorsal horn neurons (L3 and L4) receiving input from the hindpaw to peripheral stimuli in Nav1.7 "Input" is the number of spikes evoked by the first stimulus of the train (50 – 800 ms) and reflects nonpotentiated C-fiberevoked dorsal horn neuron response.
828	Excess spikes, additional spikes recorded above the predicted constant baseline response, are a measure of "wind-up," defined as increased neuronal excitability to repeated constant stimulation.
829	First, the channel could form an essential component of a complex containing kinases, scaffolding proteins, and ion channels that function to alter neuronal excitability.
830	Finally, the trafficking of the channel into the membrane could be up-regulated by inflammatory mediators to cause increased neuronal excitability.
831	Tetrodotoxin-resistant currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons lacking Nav1.7.
832	Both control (35.2 4.7%; n 3) and null neurons (69 26%; n 3) showed a dramatic increase in peak Nav1.8 currents minutes after micromolar PGE2 application, suggesting that posttranslational regulation of other channels was normal in the conditional null mutant.
833	Nav1.7 contributes a small proportion of the total Tetrodotoxin-sensitive current in dorsal root ganglion neurons, and sensory neuron terminals are difficult to isolate for electrophysiological studies (4).
834	However, it is practicable to examine PC12 and adrenal chromaffin cells that only express Nav1.7, and, here, strong evidence for enhanced trafficking of Nav1.7 in response to elevated cAMP or Nerve growth factor levels has been obtained.
835	Discussion Nav1.7 is expressed in peripheral, mainly small-diameter sensory and sympathetic neurons.
836	It is coexpressed in sensory neurons  with many other sodium channel isoforms including, at high levels, Nav1.1, -1.2, and -1.6, and the Tetrodotoxin-resistant channels Nav1.8 and -1.9.
837	This effect may ref lect central, autonomic, or enteric sensory neuron dysfunction.
838	Deleting the gene in a subset of sensory neurons that are predominantly nociceptive demonstrates that Nav1.7 plays an important role in pain mechanisms, especially in the development of inflammatory pain.
839	However, because Tetrodotoxin does not block mechanically activated currents in sensory neurons (33), Nav1.7 must play a downstream role in mechanotransduction.
840	Like Nav1.7, a number of proteins expressed in both sensory neurons and other cell types have been suggested to play an important role in pain pathways (1, 41, 42).
841	Human colour discrimination based on a non-parvocellular pathway.
842	SK channels are voltage-independent and activated by submicromolar concentrations of intracellular calcium1.
843	They are high-affinity calcium sensors that transduce fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentrations into changes in membrane potential.
844	Calcium ions are ubiquitous regulators of many cellular processes, and eukaryotic cells have evolved a complex system of transmembrane molecules, channels, pumps and exchangers, which maintain intracellular Ca2+ concentrations at very low levels, 10–100 nM.
845	Several classes of ion channels, such as Ca2+-activated potassium channels, are gated by intracellular Ca2+ ions, thereby coupling intracellular Ca2+ levels and membrane potential.
846	Because of the fundamental role played by SK channels in regulating neuronal excitability, we studied the mechanism underlying Ca2+ gating of SK channels.
847	ATP and other nucleotides were not present in the intracellular solution.
848	Therefore, each of the 21 conserved negatively charged residues within the predicted intracellular domains of the SKchannel α-subunits (Fig. 2a) was mutated individually into a neutral amino acid (E ! Q, D ! N) in the SK2 channel.
849	Analysis of this region, between the cytoplasmic border of transmembrane domain 6 and position 497, showed that it is the most conserved intracellular domain in the SK channels and may be modelled as a series of four α-helices (A–D boxes, Fig.
850	Each circle represents a single residue, and the positions of the conserved intracellular negatively charged amino acids are shaded darkly.
851	The regions in which multiple charge neutralizations were introduced, that is, the 2–3 loop and the proximal domain of the intracellular C terminus, are boxed, and the positions of the truncations are indicated by arrows.
852	Further experiments using subdomains of SK2 showed that helices A–C were sufficient for complementation, whereas regions B–C, B–D, the intracellular amino terminus, the 2–3 loop, the 4–5 loop, and the remainder of the C terminus following the D box (SK2postD) did not interact with calmodulin in this assay (Fig. 3).
853	Fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase and region A–D, B–D, B–C, SK2post D or the intracellular C terminus of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1 were bound to glutathione–agarose beads and exposed to purified bovine brain calmodulin, in either the absence or the presence of 10 μM Ca2+.
854	We used a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the intracellular domain of SK3 for immunoprecipitations with rat brain extracts.

864	To test whether the replication checkpoint could be mediated by both chk1+ and cds1+, we constructed cds1-chk1double mutants and examined their response to hydroxyurea, which causes cells to arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle.
865	chk1-cds1- cells completely lacked a replication checkpoint (Fig. 1).
866	More than 80% of the cells in hydroxyurea-treated chk1-cds1- cultures underwent an aberrant mitosis (`cut') instead of S-phase arrest (Fig. 1a, b).
867	Modest overexpression of chk1+ can suppress the hydroxyurea sensitivity of cds1- cells (Fig. 1c), suggesting that chk1+ can perform some cds1+ functions in response to unreplicated DNA.
868	Checkpoints maintain the order and fidelity of events of the cell cycle by blocking mitosis in response to unreplicated or damaged DNA1.

874	The channel is gated both by membrane depolarization and by increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
875	This strongly suggests that the intracellular domains are crucial for the fine tuning of the effects of these β subunits.
876	Moreover, the intracellular domains of β1 are responsible for the reduction of the BK channel voltage dependence.
877	This agrees with previous studies that suggested the intracellular regions of the α-subunit to be the target of the modulation by the β1-subunit.
878	Purification and cloning of the β1-subunit unveiled the presence of a protein containing two putative transmembrane regions joined together by a large extracellular loop (Knaus et al., 1994a,b). β1 increases the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, slows down the macroscopic activation and deactivation kinetics, and decreases the voltage sensitivity (McManus et al., 1995; Wallner et al., 1995; Dworetzky et al., 1996; Meera et al., 1996; Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Nimigean and Magleby, 2000; Bao and Cox, 2005; Orio and Latorre, 2005).
879	The S0 domain and the extracellular NH2 terminus of the α-subunit are crucial for the adequate functional coupling between α- and  191  β1-subunit (Wallner et al., 1996).
880	Our results show that intracellular NH2 and COOH termini are responsible for most of the modulatory effects on channel activity, with some participation of the transmembrane regions.
881	The extracellular regions have no participation in the differences between β1 and β2IR subunits and may play a structural function related to other effects of the β subunits on the channel.

886	These results strongly suggest that the differential effects of the β subunits on the BK channel properties are related to the transmembrane and/or the intracellular domains of these regulatory subunits but not to the extracellular domain.

889	This suggests that the intracellular portions of the β subunits are responsible for the modulation of the activation kinetics.
890	In summary, the study of the “NC” chimeras suggests that the intracellular regions of the β1 and β2IR subunits determine the modulation of a great part of the properties studied here, with the exception of the  Figure 7.

892	β2TMβ1 chimera, which contains the same intracellular domains as β2 and β1NCβ2 subunits, behaves very much like the β1NCβ2 subunits.
893	On the other hand, the β2TMβ1 chimera, which contains the same intracellular domains as the β1 and β2NCβ1 subunits, behaves as the β2NCβ1 chimera.
894	This can be seen from another point of view: the β1NCβ2 and β2TMβ1 chimeras modulate BK channel properties in a very similar way and they share the transmembrane and intracellular domains with a completely different extracellular loop.
895	This is in complete agreement with the results of the β1Lβ2 and β2Lβ1 chimeras, as the extracellular loop does not determine the differential behavior of the β subunits.
896	(C) Activation time constant (τact) at 5 nM intracellular [Ca2+] plotted against activation voltage.
897	(D) Deactivation time constant (τdeact) at 5 nM intracellular [Ca2+] plotted against voltage.
898	In summary, a gross analysis of the results with the “N” and “C” chimeras indicates that most of the differences between β1 and β2IR subunits reside in the corresponding NH2 terminus, and that for some of the effects (changes in τdeact, for example) both intracellular domains are required.
899	DISCUSSION  Structural Determinants in α–β Subunit Coupling The extracellular NH2 terminus of the α-subunit together with the first transmembrane domain S0 have been proposed to contribute to the functional interaction between β and α subunits (Wallner et al., 1996).
900	A chimera containing only the extracellular NH2 terminus together with the first transmembrane domain S0 of hSlo is able to successfully couple with the β1-subunit.
901	A general view of our results shows that the intracellular regions of β1 and β2 are responsible for most of the differences between the modulatory effects that each of them confer to the activity of BK channel.
902	(D) Activation time constant (τact) at 5 nM intracellular [Ca2+] plotted against activation voltage.
903	(E) Deactivation time constant (τdeact) at 5 nM intracellular [Ca2+] plotted against voltage.
904	It is possible that most of the effects of both subunits reside in a common structural feature of the extracellular loop, while the intracellular and transmembrane domains would be responsible for the fine tuning of these effects giving to each subunit its own identity.
905	Finally, all the voltage and calcium sensitivity in the BK channel has been so far mapped to transmembrane and intracellular domains: the voltage sensor is in the S4 membrane–spanning helix (Diaz et al., 1998), all the postulated calcium binding sites are proposed to be intracellular (Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997; Schreiber et al., 1999; Bian et al., 2001; Bao et al., 2002, 2004; Xia et al., 2002, 2004), and the coupling mechanisms for both voltage and calcium activation have been mapped to intracellular regions as well (see below, Functional Coupling).

909	channel may arise from an interaction of extracellular domains of β and α subunits.
910	Function of the Extracellular Region Several roles have been attributed to the interaction between extracellular regions of the α and β subunits of the BK channel, all of them unrelated to changes in the voltage or calcium sensitivity of the channel.
911	The β3-subunit produces an open channel rectification (Xia et al., 2000; Lingle et al., 2001; Zeng et al., 2001) that is dependent on the disulfide bridges in its extracellular region.
912	Again, this effect is only reproduced by a chimera containing the extra-  cellular loop of β3 (Zeng et al., 2003).
913	Regarding the functional coupling between α and β1 subunits, the results that propose the extracellular domains as part of the interaction domain (Wallner et al., 1996) may be only of structural meaning, these domains being needed for the assembly of the heteromultimer rather than for functional coupling.
914	We have recently shown that a point mutation in the extracellular loop of  the human β1-subunit modifies its effect on BK calcium sensitivity (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2004).
915	Thus, the extracellular loop may play a partial role in the modulation of apparent calcium sensitivity, possibly via some interaction with the external side of the voltage sensor (see Bao and Cox, 2005; Orio and Latorre, 2005).
916	Role of the Intracellular Termini When only the intracellular and transmembrane regions are dissociated (NC and TMs chimeras) the resulting chimeras induce changes in channel properties that resemble the donor of the intracellular regions, suggesting that the intracellular ends are responsible for most of the functional coupling between α and β subunits.
917	This shows that the relevance of the intracellular ends of the β subunits in the α–β subunit coupling may be a characteristic of all β subunits.
918	Functional Coupling It has been proposed that the intracellular domains of each BK α-subunit contributes two RCK (regulatory of K+ conductance) domains and that these eight RCK domains form a gating ring similar to the gating ring of MthK channels (Jiang et al., 2001, 2002).
919	It appears, therefore, inescapable that the intracellular domains of the BK channel are the most probable site of interaction for the modulation of the calcium and voltage sensitivity.
920	Indeed, Qian et al. (2002) showed that the β1-subunit cannot enhance the calcium sensitivity of BK channels when the intracellular “tail” domain is replaced with the tail from the highly related, pH-dependent, Slo3 channel.
921	This and other observations were interpreted as the β1-subunit interacting with the intracellular calciumsensing machinery of the BK channel.
922	We show here that the intracellular domains of the β1 and β2 subunits are indeed responsible for most of the channel activity modulation.

928	For instance, the brain-enriched h 4 subunits not only alter the conductance-voltage curve of mSlo channels but also slow both the activation and deactivation time courses, suggesting that 4 plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release (9).
929	The extracellular application of 20 mM dithiothreitol completely removed the outward rectification of h 3b channels and restored the sensitivity of alone to charybdotoxin.
930	All subunits of BK channels contain a cysteine-rich extracellular segment linking two transmembrane segments.

933	At 90% confluence, cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen).
934	For inside-out recording, the pipette extracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 160 MeSO K, 2 MgCl , 10 HEPES 32 (pH 7.0) titrated with MeSO H.

936	The charybdotoxin solution was made by adding 100 nM 3 charybdotoxin to the extracellular solution.
937	An inside-out or outside-out patch was excised from the transfected HEK293 cells.
938	During recording, the corresponding solutions were perfused locally into cells via a perfusing pipette containing seven solution channels.
939	In this work, only a partial extracellular region (105–137 amino acids) of the h 4 subunit was selected to predict the possible interaction between mSlo and h 4 because the selected region is rich in basic residues (Lys-120, Arg-121, and Lys-125), which would be predicted to be the only possible region to bind the acidic residues in the mSlo turret via a salt bridge interaction.

953	Selective pressure was highest on sequences facing the intracellular side and on proposed transmembrane segments S4- S6, suggesting that these domains are crucial for voltage-dependent potassium channel function.
954	Key words: potassium channel/rat brain/Shaker/protein homology  Introduction  Voltage-dependent potassium (IA) channels in excitable membranes are essential for many diverse cellular functions (Hille, 1984) including action potential duration, neuron bursting and cardiac pacemaking.
955	The channels are highly ion selective, with a narrow selectivity filter inside the membrane facing the extracellular space.
956	Activation of the channels is steeply voltage-dependent, thereby opening a gate facing the intracellular space.
957	This model is consistent with the N-glycosylation site (Asn-207) and the two potential cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites (Ser-322 and Ser-445) being located on the extracellular and on the cytoplasmic sides, respectively.
958	Also, this model predicts that channel protein sequences facing the extracellular side have been varied predominantly during evolution.
959	Sequences facing the extracellular side are not well conserved between Drosophila and rat except for the general density of negative charges and the location of the N-glycosylation site.
960	The sequence similarities between the presumably intracellular domains of the rat and Drosophila protein suggest that a substantial part of the protein lying outside the membrane electric field is very important for channel function.

969	This concept is especially intriguing  as Kv4.2 channels may integrate a variety of intracellular signaling cascades into a coordinated output that dynamically modulates membrane excitability.
970	These mechanisms will be discussed in the context of the physiological role of Kv4.x channels in modulating membrane excitability, particularly in the heart and in neurons.
971	Much work has focused on kinase regulation of A-type K currents in neurons and direct phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 channel subunit.
972	An especially intriguing aspect of these types of regulation is the possibility that Kv4.2 channels serve as molecular signal integration devices, allowing the cell to integrate a variety of cell-surface signals into a coordinated output in terms of membrane electrical properties.
973	Recent data from transgenic and knockout animals as well as expression of dominant negative constructs indicate that these channels participate in the transient outward A-type K current characterized in the somatodendritic compartments of neurons, as well as form the Ca2 -independent A-type K current (transient outward current or Ito) in cardiac myocytes.

975	A: representative A-type K current obtained from a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron.
976	B: steady-state activation and inactivation curves of A-type K currents recorded from cell-attached patches at different locations on CA1 pyramidal dendrites.
977	For example, the heteropodatoxins (167) are specific for the Ito of cardiac myocytes (29, 220), a cellular current likely composed at least in part of Kv4.x family channels.
978	The kinetic properties of the transient A-type K current differ greatly depending on the type of cell in which the current is expressed.
979	This can depend on heteromultimerization between primary subunits when a cell  expresses more than one Kv4.x
980	VI), interaction with various other interacting proteins expressed selectively in various cells (see sect.
981	We illustrate this diversity in A-type K currents, even within a single cell, by drawing your attention to Figure 1.
982	This figure illustrates a current-membrane voltage plot from recordings at two different sites on the dendrite of a hippocampal pyramidal neuron.
983	Notice that the activation curve is shifted 10 mV in the hyperpolarized direction for currents that are 100 m away from the cell soma versus the currents recorded in more proximal dendritic regions.
984	This likely indicates differing primary or interacting subunits in Kv4.x-encoded channels in proximal dendrites compared with distal dendritic regions in these cells.
985	Further evidence of cell context-dependent A-current properties is provided by considering the biophysical properties of the pore-forming Kv4.x -subunit expressed in heterologous systems versus the properties of native Kv4.x-encoded channel in the cell membrane.
986	Therefore, the Kv4.2 subunits must be modified in the hippocampal pyramidal neuron relative to the isolated -subunit expressed in oocytes, possibly by the effects of interacting subunits as well as by phosphorylation.
987	This view is from the extracellular side of the channel looking directly down the central ion-conduction pathway.
988	This view has been somewhat challenged by the recent X-ray structure of another bacterial voltage-gated K channel, KvAP (95, 96), which interestingly contains an intracellular sensor domain.
989	This mechanism involves the tethered amino-terminal inactivation domain (ball) of the channel (230) or a similar domain in a -subunit (158), binding to the intracellular entrance of the pore (90).
990	SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION AND TRAFFICKING  Specific localization and trafficking mechanisms are relevant to Kv4.x channel function in most cells where they have been studied.
991	This is particularly relevant in cells with a complex morphology and many distinct subcellular compartments, such as neurons.
992	In this section we discuss mechanisms for general channel trafficking and for the localization of Kv4.x channels to specific subcellular compartments.
993	One factor necessary to understand the role of Kv4.x channels in neuronal function is to understand their specialized distribution within a cell.
994	For example, both Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 channels mediate a transient, A-type K current; however, Kv4.2 is localized to the soma and dendrites of neurons, while Kv1.4 is concentrated in axons (181).
995	Intrinsic structural features of Kv4.x channels may regulate the subcellular trafficking of these channels.
996	A recent study has shown that this subcellular targeting is mediated at least in part by a 16-amino acid dileucinecontaining motif (160) within the pore-forming -subunit.
997	Instead of being targeted to the cell body and entire dendrite, distribution is limited to the proximal dendrite and proximal axon.
998	Conversely, insertion of the 16-amino acid dileucine motif into the carboxy terminus of Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 is sufficient to alter their subcellular localization from axons to dendritic processes.
999	Thus Kv4.2 is selectively targeted to specific subcellular domains in cardiac myocytes as well.
1000	Although an RXR endoplasmic reticulum retention signal has not been specifically identified in Kv4.2, there exists an RKR in its amino terminus, an RYR in an intracellular loop between the second and third transmembrane domains, and an RIR in its carboxy terminus, any of which would serve as a good candidate for endoplasmic reticulum retention.
1001	Mutation of the amino-terminal RKR potential endoplasmic reticulum retention signal did not alter the endoplasmic reticulum localization of Kv4.2 in COS cells (183), suggesting that this particular site is not involved in endoplasmic reticulum retention; however, other potential endoplasmic reticulum retention sites in Kv4.2 have not been examined.
1002	For example, coexpression of a PDZ domain-containing protein, SAP-97, with the Kv1 family of K channels inhibits endoplasmic reticulum release of the channel and dramatically reduces their cell surface expression (195).
1003	Overall, much more work is required to understand the targeting and distribution of Kv4.x channels; however, these studies suggest that altered release from the endoplasmic reticulum may regulate surface expression of Kv4.x channels, and ultimately changes in cellular excitability.
1004	Many of these auxiliary proteins appear to play a role in the localization of Kv4.x channels within the cell.
1005	The effects of these interacting proteins on Kv4.x channel kinetics and cellular distribution are discussed in section IV.

1007	Another function of -subunits is to serve as chaperone proteins that promote and/or stabilize cell surface expression of K channel -subunits in general (57, 116, 135, 136, 182, 199), including Kv4.3 channels (224).
1008	In addition, Kv 1 and -2 subunits were found to localize in many of the same brain structures as Kv4.x-family -subunits, particularly the hippocampus (159), suggesting they are an integral component of neuronal A-type K currents.  B.
1009	K Channel Interacting Proteins  Although Kv4.x channels are the best candidates for mediating A-type K currents in neurons, Kv4.2 homomers expressed in nonneuronal systems manifest activation curves that are somewhat shifted in the depolarizing direction, and their recovery from inactivation is slower than what is observed for native A-type K currents. The KChIPs are members of the recoverinneuronal calcium sensor superfamily that are Ca2 binding proteins.
1010	KChIPs share sequence similarity with neuronal calcium sensor 1 or frequenin (discussed below), a calcium-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of transmitter release in Drosophila (154).
1011	A recent study has shown that COS1 cells transfected with Kv4.2 alone exhibit a perinuclear pattern of immunofluorescent staining, which is typical for endoplasmic reticulum retained proteins (183), and no detectable surface staining (Fig. 3).
1012	Furthermore, double-labeling of these cells for Kv4.2 and the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin revealed an overlapping staining pattern, while double-labeling with a Golgi apparatus marker revealed no overlapping staining.
1013	Coexpression of Kv4.2 with KChIP1, 2, or 3 dramatically altered the subcellular distribution of Kv4.2 channels (Fig. 3).
1014	Kv4.2 staining in the cotransfected cells exhibited significant cell-surface staining, and the remaining intracellular Kv4.2 colocalized with the Golgi apparatus marker rather than the endoplasmic reticulum marker.
1015	Similarly,  Overall, the ability of KChIPs to restore more nativelike properties to Kv4.x channels and their colocalization with Kv4.x channels in several systems suggests that KChIPs may be an important and integral part of the composition of A-type K channels in cells.

1021	Interestingly, neuronal calcium sensor 1 (also known as frequenin), a member of the EF-hand family of Ca2 sensing proteins which includes KChIPs, is also expressed in mouse brain and coimmunoprecipitates with Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (69, 138).
1022	In heterologous systems, neuronal calcium sensor 1 coexpression with Kv4.x -subunits increases the current density and slows the rate of inactivation of the Kv4.x current.
1023	In contrast to KChIPs, however, neuronal calcium sensor 1 does not affect the voltage dependence of inactivation or rate of recovery from inactivation of the channel.
1024	The effects of neuronal calcium sensor 1 on current density and rate of inactivation are Ca2 dependent, as they are blocked by a membrane-permeable Ca2 chelator.
1025	In addition to altering the biophysical properties of Kv4.x channels, neuronal calcium sensor 1 can also alter the cellular distribution of Kv4.x channels.
1026	In COS cells transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA, Kv4.2 proteins were observed predominantly in perinuclear regions (138).
1027	However, cotransfection of Kv4.2 and neuronal calcium sensor 1 increased the Kv4.2 immunoreactivity in the outer margins of the cells.
1028	Similarly, Guo et al. (70) reported an increase in surface expression of Kv4.3 channels coexpressed with neuronal calcium sensor 1 in HEK-93 cells, and a decrease in surface expression of the channel when neuronal calcium sensor 1 levels were reduced with an antisense oligonucleotide.
1029	In accordance with the enhanced surface expression of the Kv4.x channels, both groups reported an increase in A-type K current when the Kv4.x channel was coexpressed with neuronal calcium sensor 1.
1030	These data suggest that in addition to regulating the rate of current inactivation for Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, neuronal calcium sensor 1 can also regulate A-type K current by enhancing the surface expression of these channels.
1031	DPPX had no previously known function, although it is related to the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase CD-26, which has a role in cell adhesion.
1032	DPPX localizes to the somatodendritic compartments of neurons that are known to contain Kv4.2, such as pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and striatal neurons, as well as to regions that contain Kv4.3, such as the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.
1033	DPPX also localizes to areas known to contain both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, such as granule cells of the cerebellum and dentate gyrus (134).
1034	DPPX also strongly alters the cellular localization of Kv4.x channels (134).
1035	Coexpression of Kv4.2 and DPPX in CHO cells results in a 20-fold increase in surface expression of the channel as measured by a surface protein biotinylation assay.
1036	The striking alteration in cellular localization of Kv4.2 chan-  nels as well as the ability to restore a more native A-type K current suggests that DPPX is also an integral molecular component of Kv4 channels in cells where they are coexpressed.
1037	Cytoskeletal Proteins  A search for proteins responsible for Kv4.2 localization to somatodendritic compartments of neurons (181) led to the discovery that Kv4.2 interacts with filamin, a member of the -actinin/spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins.
1038	Petrecca et al. (151) demonstrated an association between the carboxy terminal of Kv4.2 and filamin in neurons.
1039	These investigators also showed that Kv4.2 and filamin colocalize in cerebellum and cultured hippocampal neurons.
1040	Furthermore, Kv4.2 is expressed in a punctate pattern in neuronal dendrites that colocalizes with the synaptic marker synaptophysin.
1041	Transfection of Kv4.2 into a heterologous cell line lacking filamin resulted in a uniform expression pattern of the channel, while similar expression of Kv4.2 in a cell line that contains filamin resulted in Kv4.2 colocalizing with filamin at the roots of filopods (151).
1042	Transfection of a mutant form of Kv4.2 in which the filamin-binding region had been altered resulted in a uniform expression pattern similar to that observed in the cells without filamin.
1043	Although total Kv4.2 protein expression was the same, the whole cell Kv4.2 current density from Kv4.2 transfected cells was two- to threefold greater in the filamin-expressing cells than in cells without filamin.
1044	Interaction with these cell adhesion molecules may underlie the restricted cellular distribution of the Kv4.x-interacting protein filamin (31).
1045	A possible interaction of Kv4.2 with integrins is supported by a recent study that showed that the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin affects the expression of Kv4.2 in hippocampal explants (205).
1046	Vitronectin is an extracellular ligand for transmembrane integrin proteins.
1047	In developing hippocampal pyramidal neurons, vitronectin exposure for 3– 4 days was found to increase the peak current amplitude of A-type K current.
1048	Furthermore, vitronectin had no effect on the amplitude of the sustained components of K currents in these hippocampal pyramidal neurons, indicating a specific effect on A-type K currents. These data are indicative of a functional interaction of Kv4.2 with integrins, at least in neurons.
1049	Using a surface biotinylation assay, Wong et al. (216) showed that coexpression of Kv4.2 with PSD-95 in CHO cells enhanced the surface expression of Kv4.2 2-fold.
1050	In cells transfected with Kv4.2 alone, the majority of the fluorescence was located in an internal reticular network with some fluorescence at the outer cell margins.
1051	Coexpression of Kv4.2 and PSD-95 resulted in an increase in channel expression on the cell surface as well as the formation of clusters of Kv4.2 channels.
1052	Thus PSD-95 could be another protein responsible for recruiting Kv4.x channels to the cell surface.
1053	MinK-related peptide 1 has been undetected in the brain other than in the pituitary (217), stratum oriens the relevance of MinK to neuronal A-type K current remains to be seen.
1054	These data suggest that palmitoylation of KChIP  is an important mechanism for enhancing cell surface localization of Kv4.x channels.
1055	These data suggest that a similar mechanism may be required to cluster Kv4.x channels at the cell membrane in postsynaptic densities.
1056	Obviously, there is much more work required to understand the role of palmitoylation in regulating Kv4.x channel function, cellular localization, and stability/degradation.
1057	For example, blocking glycosylation of Shaker-type K channels has been shown to dramatically decrease the stability and cell surface expression of the channel but not effect the folding (104) and assembly of functional channels, or their transport to the cell surface (168).
1058	Concerning Kv4.x-family channels specifically, none of the channels contains a consensus sequence for attachment of an N-linked oligosaccharide (N-X-S/T) on their extracellular surface.
1059	Accordingly, an increase in the duration of action potentials was also observed in these cells.
1060	Removal of sialic acid did not block the channels from reaching the cell surface, nor did it block the formation of functional channels, but it did alter the voltage dependence of activation in addition to reducing Ito amplitude.
1061	These results were mimicked by expression of Kv4.3 in a sialylation-deficient heterologous cell line.
1062	Phosphorylation  In the last few years there has been a great deal of evidence that A-type K currents in both neuronal and cardiac cells can be regulated by phosphorylation.
1063	Similarly, recording from pyramidal cell dendrites in the hippocampus, Hoffman and Johnston (76) showed that activation of either protein kinase A or protein kinase C decreased the probability of A-type K channel opening. protein kinase A and protein kinase C activation also increased the amplitude of back-propagating action potentials in distal dendrites, consistent with a decrease in K channel current (see sect.
1064	It has subsequently been shown that protein kinase A and protein kinase C modulation of the A-type K current in hippocampal neurons is mediated through the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (228).
1065	As discussed above, phosphorylation of Kv4.2 by protein kinase A has been shown to modulate the K current in hippocampal neurons (76).
1066	As an aside, the finding that protein kinase A activation causes channel modulation in the oocyte system is in apparent contradiction to the finding that protein kinase A regulation of K current in hippocampal neurons is completely blocked by the MEK inhibitor UO126 (228).
1067	Another possibility is that Kv4.2 forms a larger supermolecular complex with other KChIP or interacting proteins in hippocampal neurons.
1068	The interaction between Kv4.x channels and phosphorylation by protein kinase A is further complicated by recent data from Shibata et al. (183) suggesting that Kv4.2 must be expressed at the plasma cell membrane (potentially through interaction with KChIPs) to be phosphorylated at serine-552.
1069	Similarly, of the three antibodies tested, the soma of CA3 neurons are primarily recognized by the ERK triply phosphorylated Kv4.2 antibody, and the mossy fiber inputs to CA3 are primarily recognized by the carboxy-terminal protein kinase A-phosphorylated Kv4.2 (see Table 2 for  FIG.
1070	Second, as phosphorylation may regulate channel biophysical properties, differential phosphorylation of Kv4.2 in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons may confer unique biophysical properties upon particular dendritic input layers.
1071	The potential role that Kv4.x channels play in regulating neuronal synaptic plasticity is addressed in section VI.
1072	The A-type K current is a critical regulator of the excitable cells of the heart.
1073	Figure 6 shows a cardiac action potential, which is much longer in duration than a neuronal action potential, and the corresponding K currents that participate in repolarization of the action potential.

1075	Ito,f has been characterized in ventricular myocytes as well as atrial cells from various species (140).
1076	Finally, another interacting subunit, neuronal calcium sensor 1 protein (see sect.
1077	Cardiac neuronal calcium sensor 1 protein expression levels are much higher in fetal and neonatal mouse hearts than in the adult.
1078	In addition, neuronal calcium sensor 1 colocalizes with Kv4.2 in ventricular myocytes at the sarcolemma and is most likely an important regulator of Kv4.x subunits in the heart.
1079	Smooth Muscle  In addition to the heart and nervous system, A-type K currents have been characterized in a variety of types  of smooth muscle cells (see Ref. 9 for a review).
1080	A-type K currents have been characterized in the vascular smooth muscles of various species, as well as genitourinary and gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells (9).
1081	While the exact function of the current in smooth muscles has yet to be clarified, it most likely plays a role in the regulation of cellular excitability.
1082	Lung  A recent study has also identified Kv4.x channels in alveolar epithelial cells in the lung (112).
1083	mRNA analysis revealed that all three -subunits messages are present in these cells.
1084	Thus far, however, only Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 proteins have been identified in these cells.
1085	Both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are localized to the apical membrane of alveolar epithelial cells, which are involved in gas exchange in the epithelium.
1086	Although the function of Kv4.x channels in alveolar epithelial cells is unknown, it has been speculated that they are involved in K secretion into the alveolar space, or that they may act as an oxygen sensor (143).
1087	Subunits in the Brain  We focus in this section on the role of Kv4.x channels in the hippocampus because it has been most widely studied, but, of course Kv4.x subunits are expressed in numerous neuronal types throughout the mammalian central nervous system.
1088	The expression patterns of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 messages are complicated, manifesting selective subtype expression patterns in some cells and overlapping expression in others.
1089	Serodio and Rudy (177) found that Kv4.2 transcripts are the predominant form in cells in the caudate-putamen, pontine nucleus, and several nuclei in the medulla.
1090	In contrast, neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the restrosplenial cortex, the superior colliculus, the raphe, and the amygdala express mainly Kv4.3.
1091	In the olfactory bulb Kv4.2 dominates in granule cells and Kv4.3 in periglomerular cells.
1092	Kv4.2 is the most abundant isoform in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, although there is some expression of Kv4.3 in a subset of CA1 pyramidal neurons.
1093	Only Kv4.3 appears to be expressed in CA1 interneurons.
1094	Both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are abundant in CA2CA3 pyramidal cells and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, which also express Kv4.1.
1095	In the cerebellum Kv4.3, but not Kv4.2, is expressed in Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons.
1096	In cerebellar granule cells, both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are expressed.
1097	Finally, it is worth noting that Kv4.x channels appear to have a neuron-specific expression in the central nervous system, and their subcellular distribution is limited to the somato-dendritic compartment in almost all cases examined.
1098	The pyramidal cells of the hippocampus have been studied in great detail and will be specifically discussed in section VIIB.
1099	Antisense knockdown studies of cerebellar granule cells strongly suggest that Kv4.2 generates the A-type  current in this region (184).
1100	An A-type K current also exists in inhibitory interneurons of the stratum oriens of area CA1 of the hippocampus.
1101	Functional studies have also revealed an A-type K current in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra that contributes to pacemaker control of their tonic activity.
1102	Interestingly, the A-type K current density is tightly correlated with the frequency of tonic spontaneous activity of the dopaminergic neurons (118).
1103	A similar correlation of A-type K current density and Kv4.2 expression has been shown in neurons of the basal ganglia and forebrain, suggesting that Kv4.2 is the major constituent of the A-type K current in these neurons (197).
1104	Interestingly, significant differences were seen in the voltage dependence and kinetics of the A-type K currents in these neurons, even though Kv4.2 appears to be the major pore-forming subunit.
1105	This suggests that other mechanisms, including auxillary proteins or posttranslational modification, may contribute to A-type K current variability in these neurons.
1106	Confocal and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that Kv4.2 is highly expressed in the plasma membrane of the cell bodies and dendritic processes of magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (6).
1107	This study also suggests that Kv4.2 in supraoptic neurons is concentrated in postsynaptic plasma membranes found adjacent to presynaptic terminals.
1108	Electrophysiological studies have revealed that these neurons express an A-type K current that contributes to the excitability of these neurons (59, 170).
1109	Finally, recent work has shown that an A-type K current in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb regulate backpropagating action potentials similar to pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (discussed below).
1110	Together, these studies suggest that, indeed, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 underlie A-type K currents throughout the nervous system and these currents participate in regulation of the excitability of a variety of neurons.
1111	K Channels in Neuronal Information Processing  In this section we address the role of Kv4.x channels in the context of neuronal function.
1112	We consider the role of A-type K currents in general and Kv4.x channels in particular in regulating neuronal membrane excitability.
1113	We discuss the function these processes play in neuronal  information processing.
1114	Furthermore, neurotransmitter regulation of Kv4-family channels in hippocampal pyramidal neuron dendrites exemplifies an area where breakthroughs are being made in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of the plasticity of synaptic function in the central nervous system.
1115	Glutamatergic synaptic transmission underlies both baseline cellcell communication between neurons and the capacity for alterations of synaptic strength for which central nervous system neurons are stratum oriens notable.
1116	The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is gated by the ligand (glutamate) as well as voltage, through a voltage-dependent block by Mg2 . N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation allows Ca2 influx into the cell.
1117	The increase in intracellular Ca2 due to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation leads to a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic strength at many synapses in the central nervous system, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation.
1118	long-term potentiation is at present the strongest candidate mechanism for a cellular process contributing to memory formation in the central nervous system.
1119	One theme that is beginning to emerge from work on Kv4.x channels is that these channels can provide the neuron with additional information processing capacity; they do this through controlling the depolarization that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor senses.
1120	It is widely known that action potentials triggered near the cell body of neurons propagate along axons, allowing intercellular communication with downstream targets.
1121	Less generally appreciated is the fact that in many central nervous system neurons action potentials also propagate through neuronal dendrites as well.
1122	These dendritic “back-propagating” action potentials are increasingly becoming recognized as an important means of electrical communication within neurons, signaling the proximal and distal  dendritic tree that the cell has been sufficiently stimulated to fire an action potential.
1123	In dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, a principal model for studying the role of back-propagating action potentials, back-propagating action potentials become progressively smaller in amplitude the further they invade the distal dendrites (121, 134, 189, 228).
1124	Thus anything regulating the voltage-dependent properties and/or density of A-type K currents can have a direct effect on b-action potentials amplitude in pyramidal neuron dendrites.
1125	Neuromodulatory Effects on A-Type K Currents in Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons  In this section we describe one example of how these mechanisms operate in the context of the functioning neuron.
1126	We will illustrate our discussion by focusing on neurotransmitter modulation of A-type K currents in the dendritic membrane of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
1127	7. Examples of CA1 pyramidal neurons and whole cell and cell-attached recordings from soma and dendrites.
1128	A: a pyramidal neuron in hippocampal CA1 region filled with biocytin through a recording electrode patched in the dendrites.
1129	The figure illustrates a neuronal dendrite and two dendritic spines and their associated presynaptic partners.
1130	Second, Kv4.x channels in neurons generally have a somato-dendritic distribution, and sophisticated dendritic attached-patch recording procedures have allowed dendritic A-type K currents to be studied in great detail in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
1131	Finally, we find this system of interest because the cellular physiology may be applicable to the physiology of the whole animal, for example, behavioral output in the context of learning and memory.
1132	Thus studies of Kv4.x regulation may serve as a model for K channel regulation in a variety of subfamilies and cellular systems.
1133	These neurotransmitters increase the likelihood of long-term potentiation occurrence at CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses (also known as Schaffer collateral synapses) as well as enhance the magnitude of long-term potentiation that is induced.
1134	The basis for this modulation is complex, but one known site of action of neuromodulators is regulating back-propagating action potentials in pyramidal neuron dendrites.
1135	As we have already described, the general functions of A-type K currents in neuronal dendrites are repolarizing the membrane after an action potential, contributing to setting the resting membrane potential (modestly), and regulating firing frequency.
1136	This inhibition of A-type K currents mechanism is mediated by cellular signal transduction cascades.
1137	In addition, it is worth noting that regulation of A-type K currents in dopaminergic midbrain neurons caused by glial-derived neurotrophic factor is mediated by ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (225).
1138	Overall, these observations indicate that A-type K current modulation of dendritic membrane potential is regulated by cell surface neurotransmitter receptors coupled to ERK activation.
1139	What is the molecular basis for this regulation of A-type K currents? As described in section I, Kv4.x subunits are the key components underlying the rapidly inactivating K currents operating at subthreshold membrane potentials in neurons, the neuronal A-type K currents. In addition, Kv1.4,
1140	Kv3.4, and other members in the Kv1 family may also contribute to formation of A-type K currents, but several lines of evidence have suggested that Kv4.x subunits are the best candidate for primary subunits that contribute to dendritic A-type K currents of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.
1141	In brief, this evidence is as follows: the similarity of biophysical properties between the currents mediated by heterologously expressed Kv4.x channels and native A-type K currents in dendrites (11, 91, 134, 178, 188), the subcellular distribution of Kv4.2 revealed by immunostaining (122, 181), and the similarity in regulation by certain protein kinases between Kv4.2 subunits and dendritic A-type K currents (3, 12, 228).
1142	At present, several labs are working on introducing dominant negative mutations of Kv4.2 into hippocampal pyramidal neurons (L. L. Yuan, personal communication).
1143	In a similar vein a Kv4.2 knock-out mouse line has been created, and efforts are being made to determine if the dendritic A-type K current of CA1 pyramidal neurons is diminished in these mutant animals (Yuan, personal communication).
1144	We await future results from these experiments to determine the molecular identity of the channels encoding central nervous system neuronal A-type K currents.
1145	However, the current evidence indicates that Kv4.2 subunits are localized to dendrites in CA1 pyramidal neurons and are likely  the pore-forming subunit of dendritic A-type K currents in this region.
1146	Moreover, Kv4.2 is a substrate for ERK in vitro and in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (3); thus Kv4.2 is a target for regulation by ERK / mitogen-activated protein kinase.
1147	This mechanism is a basis for controlling back-propagating action potentials in pyramidal neuron dendrites.
1148	This is particularly interesting because theta-frequency stimulation mimics an endogenous CA1 neuron firing pattern that rodents manifest when they are learning about their environment.
1149	Thetafrequency stimulation causes action potential bursting in area CA1 cells, which can back-propagate into the dendrites and depolarize synapses.
1150	What is the physiological role of this complex -adrenergic receptor regulation of Kv4.2? We believe that it contributes to increasing the sophistication of information processing that can be achieved by the hippocampal pyramidal neuron.
1151	Three-way coincidence detection in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
1152	This allows for intricate information processing at the synaptic level, and allows for complex decision making at the molecular and cellular levels.
1153	The inclusion of A-type K current modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function supports a greater sophistication in cellular information processing than could be achieved by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor alone.
1154	As described above, the effect of norepinephrine on hippocampal neuron excitability is mediated byadrenergic receptors via activation of the cAMP cascade, ultimately resulting in the activation of protein kinase A and ERK.
1155	However, in hippocampal pyramidal neurons various norepinephrine, dopamine, and muscarinic ACh receptor subtypes can also couple to phospholipase C, leading to activation of protein kinase C. protein kinase C activation also leads to activation of ERK in the hippocampus.
1156	By serving as a biochemical signal integrator in this way, additional sophistication is available through which cell surface receptors can regulate the depolarization signal that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor senses.
1157	For example, a downregulation of A-type K current has been described in hippocampal dentate granule cells of several patients with lesion-associated temporal lobe epilepsy (22).
1158	The critical role that the A-type K current plays in regulating the excitability of neurons in the hippocampus suggests that alterations in these currents may contribute to seizures in these patients.
1159	Similarly, the high seizure susceptibility in endopiriform nucleus of piriform cortex compared with more superficial layers (layer II) may be related to layer-specific differences in A-type K currents. In endopiriform nucleus neurons, A-type K currents have smaller peak amplitudes, and steady-state inactivation is shifted toward more hyperpolarized potentials (18).
1160	Normal oscillatory behavior of thalamic neurons involves a balance between an A-type K current and a Ca2mediated inward current (IT).
1161	Kv4.2 and Kv1.2 mRNA levels were transiently reduced in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus following pentylenetetrazoleinduced generalized seizures (200).
1162	In the kainate epilepsy model, Kv4.2 mRNA expression levels also decreased in the dentate granule cell layer 3 h after seizures (60).
1163	In this model heterotopic pyramidal neurons in the cortex demonstrate a downregulation of Kv4.2 channel proteins (36).
1164	Consistent with this molecular finding, the heterotopic neurons are hyperexcitable.
1165	Although the significance of Kv4.2 alterations in these epilepsy models has not been definitively characterized, it is possible that the increased excitability of these neurons and the decreased seizure threshold seen in these models are due to alterations in expression of Kv4.2 subunits and subsequent downregulation of A-type K currents. Alterations in the expression of the KChIP3 auxillary subunit have been shown in epilepsy.
1166	Transfection of HEK293 cells or rat ventricular myocytes with Presenilin 1 increases the endogenous outward K currents in these cells.
1167	No effect on K currents was observed when these cells were transfected with a mutant form of Presenilin 1 (123), suggesting that mutant Presenilin 1 expression would decrease K currents in neurons relative to normal Presenilin 1 expression.
1168	Various nonpathological functions of presenilins have been described as well, which include membrane trafficking, amyloid precursor protein processing, Notch signaling, neuronal plas-  ticity, cell adhesion, and endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis.
1169	Cardiac Pathology  As discussed in section VI, the currents formed by Kv4.x channels participate in action potential repolarization in the excitable cells of the heart.
1170	In addition to dramatic reductions of Ito, the myocytes of these animals also showed reductions in other K currents, prolonged action potentials, and increased cell capacitance, an electrical measure of cell size which indicates hypertrophy.
1171	These mice developed clinical and hemodynamic evidence of congestive heart failure, such as myocardial cellular and molecular remodeling, hypertrophy, chamber dilatation, and interstitial fibrosis (214).
1172	Likewise, dogs with either chronic atrial fibrillation or brief episodes of fibrillation exhibited significantly reduced Ito current density and altered kinetics in atrial cells (53).
1173	Similarly, the number and diversity of cellular signal transduction pathways regulating A-type K current is constantly expanding.
1174	In the limit, we believe that a fundamental change in perspective concerning A-type K currents is called for; we need to begin to think of the pore-forming subunits as one small part of a very large and quite complicated supramolecular complex that performs a variety of functions in the cell.
1175	Subcellular trafficking issues are also likely to be a very fruitful area of future investigation for Kv4.x channels.
1176	Their unique distribution patterns in neurons and in the cardiovascular system suggested to the first investigators in the field that issues of localization and trafficking were likely to be important.
1177	Several investigators studying Kv4.x channels are pioneering efforts to understand the distribution of ion channels in selective subcellular domains.
1178	This is one area in which studies of Kv4.x channels may fundamentally contribute to our understanding of cell biology.
1179	A recurrent theme that one may have noticed throughout this review is that a tissue-specific and cellspecific distribution of each Kv4.x protein exists.
1180	For example, while rodent atrial cells express Kv4.2 exclusively, ventricular cells express both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3.
1181	These kinetic differences cause alterations in the A-type current which would translate into differences in cell excitability.
1182	This mechanism may allow cells to regulate their excitability based on the physiological demand for that cell.
1183	How do cells regulate levels of one Kv4.x protein versus another?
1184	This regulation could be at the transcriptional level with cell-specific differences in the control of gene expression.
1185	Although these are purely speculative ideas, we expect more research to determine the mechanisms responsible for the cellular segregation of Kv4.x proteins and the functional consequences of their distinct expression pattern in the next few years.
1186	These important considerations in themselves provide compelling motivation for continued, focused investigation into the molecular and cellular biology of this channel family.

1235	There has been some debate as to the localization of tyrosine hydroxylase within neurons, but a recent immunohistochemical study13 indicated that the enzyme is associated with organelles but is also diffusely spread throughout the cytoplasm.

1237	However, compared with other areas in the neuron the neurotransmitter concentrations relative to their biosynthetic enzymes are highest at the nerve endings where the transmitters are stored, and this might account for the differences in distribution.

1247	Hormonal influences could be directed towards alteration of neuronal membrane receptors, so that a given amount of norepinephrine could cause a shift in the resting membrane potential.
1248	Thus, it is conceivable that the hypothalamic  hormones bring about their presumed changes by altering the cyclic nucleotide content of the postsynaptic cell membrane receptors which in turn could alter the ionic permeability of the membrane and thus the state of polarization and ability to relay impulses.

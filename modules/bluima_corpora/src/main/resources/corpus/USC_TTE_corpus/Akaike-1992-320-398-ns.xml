    olivary neurons projecting to the cerebellar tecto-olivo-recipient 
    zones (lobule VII, crus 11, lobulus simplex, and paramedian lobule)

    of the fastigial nucleus; and 2) superior colliculus-the

    Huerta and Harting, &apos;84b; Akaike, &apos;85), the rabbit

    the contralateral side in the rat (Hess, &apos;82; Swenson and 
    Castro, &apos;83; Huerta and Harting, &apos;84b), the cat (Weber et

  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s20">The nucleus subceruleus (nSC) comprises a heterogeneous 
    cell grouping in the dorsolateral rostral pontine tegmentum 
    (Dahlstrom and Fuxe, &apos;64; Maeda and Shimizu, &apos;72; 
    Andrezik and Beitz, &apos;85; Paxinos and Watson, &apos;86; Newman, 
    &apos;85; Rye et al., &apos;87, &apos;88).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s21">Although the nSC contains both noradrenergic (NE) and 
    non-NE neurons (Tohyama et al., &apos;78; Satoh, &apos;79; Rye et 
    al., &apos;87, &apos;881, most investigations of the nSC have 
    focused on the large NE neurons located immediately ventral to the 
    locus ceruleus and dorsomedial to the motor trigeminal nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s22">This cell grouping, defined initially with the locus 
    ceruleus as the A6 catecholamine cell group (Dahlstrom and Fuxe, 
    &apos;641, the A6v (Hokfelt et al., &apos;84), or part of the A7 
    group (Olson and Fuxe, &apos;72; Westlund and Coulter, &apos;80; 
    Westlund et al., &apos;82, &apos;83), has been shown to have 
    widespread projections throughout the neuraxis to sites including 
    the periventricular preoptic area and hypothalamus (Maeda and 
    Shimizu, &apos;72; Olson and Fuxe, &apos;721, spinal cord (Kuypers 
    and Maisky, &apos;75; Hancock and Fougerousse, &apos;76; Nygren and 
    Olson, &apos;77; Satoh et al., &apos;77; Satoh, &apos;79; Tohyama 
    et al., &apos;78; Guyenet, &apos;80; Westlund and Coulter, 
    &apos;80; Westlund et al., &apos;82, &apos;83), cerebellum (Tohyama 
    et al., &apos;781, and pons and medulla (Olson and Fuxe, &apos;72; 
    Levitt and Moore, &apos;79).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s23">Results from these and other studies provide evidence 
    that the nSC is involved in a variety of somatic and visceral 
    behaviors (Moore and Bloom, &apos;79; Westlund and Coulter, 
    &apos;80; Westlund et al., &apos;82; Bjorklund and Skagerberg, 
    &apos;82; Bjorklund and Lindvall, &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s24">Of particular interest to this laboratory is evidence 
    supporting a prominent role for the nSC in the modulation of motor 
    reflexes (Westlund and Coulter, &apos;80; Westlund et al., 
    &apos;82; Bjorklund and Skagerberg, &apos;82), and involvement in 
    oral motor behaviors such as respiration (Bertrand and Hugelin, 
    &apos;71; Bertrand et al., &apos;73; Feldman and Gautier, &apos;76) 
    and phonation (Thoms and Jurgens, &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s25">Since the tongue is an active participant in these 
    behaviors (Sauerland and Mitchell, &apos;70, &apos;75; Remmers et 
    al., &apos;78; Brouillette and Thach, &apos;79, &apos;801, and 
    reflexive control of the tongue is presumably an essential 
    mechanism underlying this participation, I questioned whether 
    motoneurons in the hypoglossal nucleus (XII) that innervate the 
    tongue musculature (Ram6n y Cajal, &apos;09; Barnard, &apos;40) 
    receive direct afferents from the nSC.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s26">Although recent studies have documented nSC-XI1 
    projections in monkey (Westlund and Coulter, &apos;80; Thoms and 
    Jurgens, &apos;871, this issue has not been adequently investigated 
    in the rat (Jones andYang, &apos;85; Rye et al., &apos;87).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s27">An additional impetus for this investigation was the 
    observation that NE fibers terminate most prodigiously among a 
    specific subgrouping of protrusor motoneurons in the 
    caudoventromedial district of XI1 (Aldes et al., &apos;88a,c; 
    &apos;90a,b).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s28">Although it was previously reported that the nSC did not 
    provide NE fibers to XI1 or other cranial nerve motor nuclei in the 
    rat (Levitt and Moore, &apos;791, recent results from this 
    laboratory indicate the contrary (Chapman and Aldes, &apos;89; 
    Aldes et al., &apos;90b in preparation).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s29">In view of these conflicting observations, a second goal 
    of the present study was to determine whether nSC afferents, if 
    present, exhibit the same distribution pattern in XI1 as NE.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s30">It will be demonstrated, on the basis of complementary 
    retrograde and anterograde transport methodologies with 
    confirmation of the latter at the electron microscopic level, that 
    the nSC does indeed innervate XI1 in the rat, and that the nSC-XI1 
    projection is topographically organized and targets a specific 
    subgrouping of protrusor motoneurons in the caudoventromedial 
    district of XII.</S>

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s144">Axodendritic terminals contained mainly small, round,

    central core and outer clear periphery (Fig. 8c).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s147">Only a few axodendritic terminals contained a mixture of

    exclusively flattened vesicles (F-type).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    encountered.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s149">The variation in morphology of labeled axon terminals is 
    consistent with light microscopic observations that nSC neurons of 
    different sizes and shapes project to XI1 (Fig. 31, and is in 
    accord with previous studies that demonstrated multiple cell types 
    in the nSC (Tohyama et al., &apos;78; Satoh, &apos;79; Newman,

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    distribution patterns of trigeminal-XI1 axon terminals (Aldes and 
    Boone, &apos;85; Borke and Nau, &apos;87; Borke et al., &apos;881, 
    but appear to differ from those derived from reticule-XI1 afferents

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s155">From a functional viewpoint, Sand F-type terminals have 
    been correlated with excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, 
    respectively (Uchizuno, &apos;65).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s156">Although the validity of this concept has not been 
    universally established, if one assumes its accuracy relative to 
    XII, one would predict a dominant excitatory or facilitatory affect 
    on XI1 motoneuron activity by the nSC that is directed primarily at 
    distal dendrites ( &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 3 km in diameter).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s157">Although speculative, especially since the effects of 
    nSC afferents on XI1 motoneurons are unknown, it is likely that 
    this input plays an important role in establishing or modifying the 
    background level of XI1 motoneuron activity and/or in modulating 
    tongue reflexes.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s158">Furthermore, it is likely that this input is but a 
    single component of a complex, integrative network that is involved 
    in modulating a variety of oral motor behaviors.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s159">That nSC terminal fields were found within the motor 
    trigeminal, facial, and ambiguus nuclei supports this hvDothesis 
    (Fie. 5). and is consistent with recent findings in u mdnkey (Thoms 
    and Jurgens, &apos;87).</S>

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s160">The possibility that labeled axon terminals occurred as 
    a result of spurious uptake of WGA-HRP by non-nSC neurons whose 
    axons traversed the injection site en route to XI1 requires 
    additional comment since other components of the dorsolateral 
    rostra1 pontine tegmentum including the principal sensory 
    trigeminal nucleus (Aldes and Boone, &apos;851, parabrachial 
    nuclear complex (Saper and Loewy, &apos;80; Tokado et al., 
    &apos;82; Travers and Norgren, &apos;83; Ermini and Aldes, 
    &apos;881, and supratrigeminal region (Tokado et al., &apos;82; 
    Travers and Norgren, &apos;83; Aldes and Boone, &apos;85) project 
    to XII.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s161">However, militating against the likelihood of this 
    possibility is the consistent lack of retrogradely labeled neurons 
    in these sites following discrete injections into the nSC.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s162">Such labeling would be anticipated if significant axonal 
    uptake had occurred.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s163">Furthermore, the course and terminal distribution 
    patterns of these afferents are different from the nSC in that they 
    do not preferentially target the caudoventromedial quadrant of XI1 
    (Aldes and Boone, &apos;85; Ermini and Aldes, &apos;88).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s164">These observations are consistent with the view that 
    WGA-HRP shows little propensity for anterograde transport by 
    damaged axons or fibers-en-passage in the CNS (Steindler, &apos;82; 
    Grob et al., &apos;82; Brodal et al., &apos;83).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s165">Of further interest is the observation that the terminal 
    distribution pattern of nSC afferents found in this study is 
    strikingly similar to that previously reported for NE projections 
    to XI1 (Aldes et al., &apos;88a,c, &apos;90a).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s166">Moreover, the synaptic distribution (mainly 
    axodendritic) and the morphology of labeled nSC terminals (mainly 
    S-type) correlates closely with previously described NE axon 
    terminals in XI1 (Aldes et al., &apos;90a).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s167">In view of these correlations, and the fact that the nSC 
    is a major repository of NE neurons (Dahlstrom and Fuxe, &apos;64; 
    Swanson and Hartman, &apos;75; Hokfelt et al., &apos;841, it is 
    reasonable to question if, and to what extent, nSC-XI1 projections 
    are NEergic.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s168">The fact that Probst&apos;s tract, the route by which 
    nSC afferents reach XI1 (Fig. 5C-F), and the medullary 
    catecholamine bundle, the major descending NE pathway (Hokfelt et 
    al., &apos;841, occupy overlapping positions in the dorsolateral 
    reticular formation (compare Fig. 144, p. 370, Hokfelt et al., 
    &apos;84 to Fig. 71, Paxinos and Watson, &apos;86) provides 
    additional support for this consideration.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s169">However, Levitt and Moore, (&apos;79) concluded on the 
    basis of biochemical and histofluorescence methodologies that the 
    nSC and locus ceruleus were not sources of NE to XI1 or other 
    cranial nerve motor nuclei.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s170">Yet, results from this laboratory using contemporary 
    doublelabeling immunocytochemical techniques strongly suggest that 
    NE-containing neurons in and around the nSC do indeed project to 
    XI1 in rat (Chapman and Aldes, &apos;89; Aldes et al., &apos;90b in 
    preparation).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s171">Since the nSC contains both NE and non-NE neurons 
    (Tohyama et al., &apos;78; Satoh, &apos;79; Newman, &apos;85; Rye 
    et al., &apos;87, &apos;881, and results from the present study 
    show that different cell types in the nSC project to XI1 (Fig. 3), 
    it is likely that both NE and non-NE neurons contribute to the 
    innervation of XII.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s172">Interestingly, NE and non-NE nSC neurons have been shown 
    to have similar projection patterns in the spinal cord (Toyhama et 
    al., &apos;78), and a similar relationship may exist in XII.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    distribution.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s178">Furthermore, interneurons of XI1 have been reported to

    trigeminal nucleus (Aldes, &apos;88a).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s179">Since injections of WGA-HRP included part of the latter,

    in the present study project to the motor trigeminal nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s180">Alternatively, interneurons of XI1 may also project to

    consistent with recent electrophysiological observations in the rat 
    suggesting the existence of two secondary areas, one of which is 
    located ventrally to the primary auditory area (Kelly and Sally, 
    &apos;88; Sally and Kelly, &apos;88).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s139">In the cat, several areas have been identified.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s140">Auditory field AII receives fibers from the MGD, MGM 
    (Diamond et al., &apos;69; Pontes et al., &apos;75; Raczkowski et 
    al., &apos;75; Winer et al., &apos;77; Niimi and Matsuoka, 
    &apos;79; Andersen et al., &apos;80; Niimi et al., &apos;84; Mitani 
    et al., &apos;87; Rouiller et al., &apos;89b) and ventrolateral 
    division of the MG complex (Andersen et al., &apos;80; Mitani et 
    al., &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s141">Additional weak input from the SG has also been reported 
    (Mitani et al., &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s142">The temporal area receives an input from the caudal MG, 
    MGD, MGM (Raczkowski et al., &apos;75; Cranford et al., &apos;76; 
    Winer et al., &apos;771, and ventrolateral MG (Niimi and Matsuoka, 
    &apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s143">The insular area receives a projection from the POm, 
    MGD, and MGM (Raczkowski et al., &apos;75; Cranford et al., 
    &apos;76; Winer et al., &apos;77).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s144">The posterior ectosylvian gyrus has been recently 
    subdivided into three longitudinal strips: a rostral tonotopic 
    band, an intermediate &quot;auditory belt,&quot; and a caudal 
    &quot;visual belt&quot; (Bowman and Olson, &apos;88a,b).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s145">In agreement with previous studies (Diamond et al., 
    &apos;69; Winer et al., &apos;77; Niimi et al., &apos;84; Mitani et 
    al., &apos;87), Bowman and Olson (&apos;88a) established that the 
    auditory belt receives an input from the MGD (superficial dorsal 
    subdivision), ventrolateral MG and posterior parts of the SG and 
    Pol.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s146">The present study indicating that the sector lying 
    ventrally to the primary auditory field receives a thalamic input 
    arising mainly from the MGD, MGM, and PPA would suggest that Te2 
    and Te3 share some hodological similarities with the cat&apos;s 
    auditory field AIL The situation is far from simple, however, since 
    Te2 and Te3 also share several hodological similarities with the 
    cat&apos;s temporal area.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s147">In fact, the dense projection from the cat&apos;s caudal 
    MG (Raczkowski et al., &apos;75; Winer et al., &apos;77) would seem 
    to be comparable with that noted from the MGCD in the present 
    study.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s148">The sectors lying just caudal and caudodorsal to Tel 
    receiving fibers from the MGM, SG, MGD, Pol, and PPA (Scheel, 
    &apos;88; see control cases 170, 172 and 184 of the present study) 
    would share some hodological similarities with the auditory belt of 
    the cat&apos;s posterior ectosylvian gyrus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s149">The hodological and electrophysiological organizations 
    of these caudal and caudodorsal regions deserve, however, further 
    investigations.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s150">In conclusion, the present results and recent 
    electrophysiological observations indicate the existence of 
    secondary auditory areas Te2 and Te3 located ventrally to Tel.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s151">In contrast to Tel, which receives a dense, 
    topographically organized projection from the MGV, Te2 and Te3 
    receive dense projections from the remaining nuclei of the MG 
    complex, with no evidence of precise topographic arrangement.</S>

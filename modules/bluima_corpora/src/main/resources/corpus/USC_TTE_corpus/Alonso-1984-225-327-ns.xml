     id="s1">The reciprocal connections between the septum and the 
    entorhinal area (EA) was studied in the rat brain using anteroand 
    retrograde axonal transport methods.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s2">After injections of large volumes (2 x 100 nl) of 
    horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to wheat-germ agglutinin 
    (WGA) into the medial septum (MS) and the diagonal band of Broca 
    (dbB), anterogradely transported HRP-WGA was found primarily in 
    layers I1 and IV of the medial and lateral EA.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s3">Injections of HRP-WGA (50-100 nl) or fluorescent dyes 
    (50100 nl) into different parts of the retrohippocampal region 
    resulted in labeling, by retrograde axonal transport, of cells in 
    the MS and dbB, both ipsiand contralateral to the injected 
    hemisphere.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s4">The labeled cells were either small (long axis of soma: 
    10-15 pm), round, and oval, or medium (15-25 pm) to large (25-35 
    pm) of fusiform or multipolar shape.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">By using the method of retrograde fluorescent double 
    labeling, the septal afferents to the EA were found to give off 
    collaterals to other parts of the hippocampal region.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

     id="s7">Studies employing retrograde transport of HRP in 
    combination with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry on the 
    same tissue section showed that, while a large number of cells 
    projecting to the EA contain AChE, many projecting cells are devoid 
    of AChE reaction products.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    of Pharmacology, Astra Research Laboratories, SGde,-tglje, Sweden, 
    The hippocampal region&apos; of the rat is innervated by neurons 
    located in the medial parts of the septal area (Meibach and Siegel, 
    &apos;77; Raisman, &apos;66; Siegel and Tassoni, &apos;71; Swanson 
    and Cowan, &apos;77).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s19">Several neuroanatomical studies have shown that the 
    septal projections to the hippocampal formation originate in the 
    medial septal nucleus (MS) and the nucleus of the diagonal band of 
    Broca (dbB) (Segal and Landis, &apos;74; Wyss et al., &apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s20">The major terminal fields of these hippocampal afferents 
    are found in the hilus and the molecular layer of the area dentata 
    as well as in the stratum oriens and stratum pyramidalae of the 
    regio inferior and regio superior (Mellgren and Srebro, &apos;73; 
    Rose et al., &apos;76, Mosko et al., &apos;73).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s21">While most earlier studies have focused on the 
    organization of the septal projections to the hippocampal 
    formation, far less is known about the septal innervation of the 
    retrohippocampal structures, and, in particular the entorhinal 
    area.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s22">Nevertheless, studies using degeneration (Mellgren and 
    Srebro, &apos;73) and axonal transport (Segal, &apos;77; Beckstead, 
    &apos;78; Swanson and Cowan, &apos;77) methods have pointed out the 
    possible existence of a projection from the septum to the 
    entorhinal area in the rat brain, although the exact origin, 
    termination, and neurochemical identity of this projection have 
    remained unknown.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s23">In the rat, the EA is the major route by which cortical 
    input reaches the hippocampal formation.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s24">The perforant path, which originates in layers I1 and I11 
    of the EA (Steward, &apos;76; Steward and Scoville, &apos;761, 
    provides a potent excitatory input to the granule cells of the area 
    dentata (Andersen et al., &apos;66).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s25">Thus, the neurons of the EA occupy a key position within 
    the intrinsic neuronal circuit of the hippocampal region, and the 
    identification of their afferent and efferent connections remains 
    an important step in understanding hippocampal function.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s26">Recent studies have shown that the EA is innervated by 
    neurons situated in a large number of different cortical and 
    subcortical brain regions, including the septum (Srebro et al., 
    &apos;79; Wyss et al., 79).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s27">Furthermore, it has been suggested that the 
    septo-entorhinal projection is part of a larger cholinergic system 
    connecting the septum with the hippocampal region (Mellgren and 
    Srebro, &apos;73; Shute and Lewis, &apos;67).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s28">In the present study, we have examined the 
    septo-entorhinal connections in more detail, using anterograde and

    histochemistry in the rat brain.</S>

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s179">The extensive labeling of this pathway in our experiment

    5 days).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s180">The need for large injections of tracer to demonstrate 
    this pathway is probably due to the elongated and slightly curved 
    shape of the dbB, which harbors a majority of the EA projecting 
    cells, since restricted injections of HRP-WGA (Alonso and Kohler, 
    unpublished observations) or 3H-amino-acids (Swanson and Cowan,

    lesion experiments, showing a loss of AChE activity and the

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s185">The question remaining to be settled, however, is to

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s186">The usefulness of AChE as a histochemical marker for 
    cholinergic neurons has been challenged in several recent studies 
    (see Fibiger, &apos;82, for review) and many studies have shown 
    that in some brain regions AChE-positive cells do not contain 
    choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity (CAT) (see Levey et al., 
    &apos;83).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s187">There exists good experimental evidence that AChE 
    activity in the hippocampal formation resides partly in cholinergic 
    afferents from the medial septum and the diagonal band of Broca, 
    although far less is known about the identity of entorhinal 
    AChE.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s188">Numerous CAT-immunoreactive fibers have been 
    demonstrated in the hippocampal region (Kimura et al., &apos;80),

    innervation.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s189">However, the possibility that entorhinal AChE derives

    present.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s190">Interesting in this regard is the observation that in

    (SP) (see Chubb et al., &apos;80).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s191">Since SP-immunoreactive nerve terminals are present in

    excluded.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s192">Although further studies are needed to settle this 
    issue, there is indirect evidence indicating that part of the 
    septo-entorhinal projection indeed belongs to a general cholinergic 
    pathway connecting the medial septum and the diagonal band with the 
    hippocampal region (see Shute and Lewis, &apos;67; Mellgren et al., 
    &apos;73).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s193">For example, the distribution of AChEand CAT-positive 
    cells appears to overlap in the medial septum (Kimura et al.,

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s194">The septal neurons retrogradely labeled from the EA 
    contain AChE (present study), and lesions of the septum result in a 
    depletion of AChE staining in both the hippocampus and EA with a 
    similar time course (Mellgren and Srebro, &apos;73).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    hippocampal injections of HRP.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s199">Recent studies using antibody to CAT (Kimura et al.,

    are cholinergic.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s200">Furthermore, massive injections of HRP (or

    resulted in retrograde labeling of more cells per section than 
    could be accounted for by the number of AChE-stained cells found in 
    adjacent sections or in sections cut from fresh tissue (present

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s201">The presence of HRP-labeled neurons lacking AChE

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s204">First, the number of AChE-positive cells or the quality

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s207">Third, the sections were analyzed using Nomarski optics, 
    which enhances the contrast in the section and greatly facilitates

    double-labeling experiments, although a single neuron may have an 
    axon that crosses to the contralateral EA.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s215">The same type of organization has been observed in 
    another midline structure, the dorsal raphe nucleus, where few 
    cells project bilaterally to the EA (Kohler and Steinbusch, 
    &apos;82) or the striatum (Van der Kooy and Hattori, &apos;80) as 
    shown by the method of fluorescent retrograde tracing.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s216">The enforhinul-septul projection Until recently, the 
    perforant path was regarded as the only efferent pathway of the 
    entorhinal area in the rat.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s217">It is now well established that the EA has extensive 
    extrahippocampal projections to a number of cortical and 
    subcortical structures in the rat (Srebro et al., &apos;79; Wyss, 
    &apos;81).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s218">One important target of these EA efferents is the septum 
    as shown earlier using retro grade fluorescent tracing (Kohler and 
    Eriksson, &apos;81), and ii the present study using both 
    anterograde and retrogradt tracing methods.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s219">Within the septum, the terminal distribution of the EA 
    projection is restricted to the intermediate parts of the lateral 
    septum, parts of the medial septal nucleus, and the vertical limb 
    of the dbB.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s220">This distribution is different from the terminal field 
    occupied by projections from the dorsal hippocampus, but overlaps 
    to a certain degree with the projections originating from cells 
    situated at ventral levels of the hippocampal formation (Swanson 
    and Cowan, &apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s221">Although the lateral septal area has been shown to 
    project to several hypothalamic areas (see Swanson and Cowan, 
    &apos;79), little is yet known about the efferent projection(s) of 
    its intermediate parts.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s222">Until this information becomes available it is difficult 
    to relate the EA innervation of the intermediate part of the 
    lateral septum to a more general neuronal network connecting this 
    particular septal nucleus with other parts of the brain.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s223">It is interesting, however, that a small component of 
    the projections from the EA enters the MS-dbB complex, since this 
    part of the septum contains neurons that project back upon the 
    hippocampal region, including the entorhinal area.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s224">A majority of the cells in the EA which contribute to 
    the septal projection are situated in layer IV and to a minor 
    extent in layer I1 of both the medial and lateral EA.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s225">These are the same layers that receive afferents from 
    the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s226">It remains to be shown if the same neurons of layer IV 
    that project to the septum are innervated by the septal efferents 
    to this layer.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s227">The projections from layer IV of the EA to the septum 
    have axon collaterals to the nucleus accumbens septi as well as to 
    the frontal cortex, as demonstrated in retrograde fluorescence 
    tracing experiments (Kohler and Eriksson, &apos;81).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s228">Layer I1 of the EA contains neurons that give rise to 
    the perforant path (Steward and Scoville, &apos;76) as well as some 
    of the septal projecting cells, but it is not known if these cells 
    have axon collaterals to both the septum and the hippocampus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s229">The chemical identity of the projection to the septum is 
    not known at present.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s230">It is possible that at least some of these fibers may 
    use glutamate or aspartate since it has been shown (Zaczek et al., 
    &apos;79; Walaas, &apos;81) that their transection results in 
    reductions of the high-affinity uptake of 3H-glutamate in the 
    septal area.</S>

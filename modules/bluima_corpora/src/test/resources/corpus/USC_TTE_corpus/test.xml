     id="s1">Tecto-olivary and olivocerebellar projections in the rat 
    were investigated in order to identify the tectorecipient zone in 
    the inferior olivary nucleus and to determine whether inferior 
    olivary neurons projecting to the cerebellar tecto-olivo-recipient 
    zones (lobule VII, crus 11, lobulus simplex, and paramedian lobule) 
    originate in the different regions within the tectorecipient 
    zone.</S>

					Membrane-permeable compounds that reversibly inhibit a particular
					step in
					gene expression are highly useful tools for cell biological and
					biochemical/structural studies. In comparison with other gene
					expression steps
					where multiple small molecule effectors are available, very few
					compounds have
					been described that act as general inhibitors of pre-mRNA splicing.
					Here we
					report construction and validation of a set of mammalian cell lines
					suitable
					for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of pre-mRNA
					splicing.
					Using these cell lines, we identified the natural product isoginkgetin
					as a
					general inhibitor of both the major and minor spliceosomes. Isoginkgetin
					inhibits splicing both
					<italic>in vivo</italic>
					and
					<italic>in vitro</italic>
					at similar
					micromolar concentrations. It appears to do so by preventing stable
					recruitment of the U4/U5/U6 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein,
					resulting in
					accumulation of the prespliceosomal A complex. Like two other recently
					reported general pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors, isoginkgetin has been
					previously described as an anti-tumor agent. Our results suggest
					that splicing
					inhibition is the mechanistic basis of the anti-tumor activity of
					isoginkgetin. Thus, pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors may represent a
					novel avenue
					for development of new anti-cancer agents.

			The removal of introns from nascent transcripts by the process of
			pre-mRNA
			(precursor to messenger RNA) splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene
			expression. Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, a highly
			dynamic,
			multimegadalton machine composed of five small stable nuclear RNAs
			(snRNAs)
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref>
			and more
			than 100 polypeptides (reviewed in Ref.
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
			). Within the spliceosome,
			intron excision occurs in two chemical steps: 1) 5&#x02032; splice site
			cleavage
			accompanied by lariat formation at the branch point adenosine and 2) 3&#x02032;
			splice site cleavage accompanied by exon ligation. Both of these
			steps are
			readily observable in
			<italic>in vitro</italic>
			reactions containing crude nuclear
			extract and ATP as an energy source. In such reactions, spliceosome assembly
			occurs in a distinctly stepwise fashion. First, the pre-mRNA
			substrate is
			coated with a heterogeneous mixture of RNA-binding proteins (referred to as
			H
			complex). Interaction of U1 snRNP (U1 snRNA and its associated proteins) with
			the 5&#x02032; splice site and recognition of the branch point
			adenosine by U2
			snRNP generates an early commitment complex (E or CC complex). A
			subsequent
			ATP-dependent step stabilizes the U2 snRNP-branch point interaction, resulting
			in formation of the prespliceosome (A complex). Entry of the U4/U5/U6
			tri-snRNP to form B complex is followed by multiple structural
			rearrangements,
			which produce the catalytically active C complex, wherein the two chemical
			steps of splicing occur. Finally, the ligated exon and lariat
			products are
			released, and the remaining spliceosome components are disassembled.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the more than two decades since its initial description
			(
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
			,
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
			), a wealth of information has
			been gleaned regarding the parts list of the spliceosome, its gross
			assembly/disassembly pathway, certain key local structural
			interactions, and
			the activities of individual components. However, in comparison with
			other
			macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome and RNA polymerase II, our
			understanding of the spliceosome's inner workings and its detailed
			structure
			is still in its infancy. Mechanistic understanding of other
			macromolecular
			complexes has been greatly enhanced by the availability of multiple small
			molecule inhibitors impeding their functional cycles at different
			points
			(
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
			,
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
			). Such small molecules have
			been likened to wrenches that can be thrown into the works to freeze
			cellular
			machines in specific conformations, making them more amenable to biochemical
			and structural investigation
			(
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
			). Although a set of such
			wrenches that inhibit splicing
			<italic>in vitro</italic>
			or inhibit specific or
			alternative splicing events
			<italic>in vivo</italic>
			is being generated
			(
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
			,
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
			&#x02013;
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
			),
			there is currently a paucity of small molecules that affect general
			pre-mRNA
			splicing
			<italic>in vivo</italic>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this paper, we describe a cell-based assay to screen for general
			splicing inhibitors. This assay takes advantage of the observation
			that some
			amount of unspliced pre-mRNA can escape from the nucleus and become
			available
			for translation in the cytoplasm
			(
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
			,
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
			). By screening for an
			increase in reporter protein expression from a mammalian pre-mRNA designed
			such that only the unspliced version generates active protein, we
			were able to
			identify a compound that acts as a general inhibitor of splicing both
			<italic>in
				vivo</italic>
			and
			<italic>in vitro</italic>
			. This inhibitor is the naturally occurring
			biflavonoid isoginkgetin. In
			<italic>in vitro</italic>
			reactions, isoginkgetin causes
			accumulation of the prespliceosomal A complex. Like two other compounds
			recently described as
			<italic>in vivo</italic>
			splicing inhibitors
			(
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
			,
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
			), isoginkgetin is a known
			anti-tumor agent (
			<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
			). Our
			results suggest that the mechanistic basis of the anti-tumor activity of
			isoginkgetin is its inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing.

				<italic>Plasmids</italic>
				&#x02014;Reporter construct I was created by replacing the

				<italic>Renilla</italic>
				luciferase 5&#x02032; intron (pSHM06T)
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>

				gene from plasmid pGL4.10 (Promega). Construct II is identical
				to construct I except that site-directed mutagenesis was used to
				remove an
				in-frame stop codon in the intron and add a G at position 6 in TPI exon 7.
				Construct III was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of II to
				inactivate
				the 5&#x02032; splice site. Constructs I, II, and III were subcloned
				into vector
				pcDNA5/FRT for integration into the
				<italic>flp</italic>
				recombinase target (FRT)
				sequence in HEK293 cells (described below).
			</p>
			<p>
				<italic>Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines</italic>
				&#x02014;Cells were
				grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal
				bovine
				serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen), as indicated below. Trypan blue
				(Invitrogen) and Alamar blue (BIOSOURCE) assays were done according
				to
				standard protocols. To generate a host cell line containing an integrated
				FRT
				site, HEK293 cells (ATCC) were transfected with ScaI-linearized
				pFRT/
				<italic>lac</italic>
				Zeo (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as
				per the Flp-In&#x02122; system manual (Invitrogen). Stable integrants
				were
				selected with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml zeocin. Southern blotting and
				&#x003b2;-galactosidase
				assays identified cell clones with integrants expressing intermediate
				levels
				of the LacZ-Zeo fusion. Two such clones (293F1 and 293F2) were
				subsequently
				co-transfected with one of the three reporter plasmids and pOG44 (Invitrogen),
				which encodes Flp recombinase. Successful targeting of the reporter
				plasmid to
				the FRT site was selected by treatment with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml
				hygromycin.
			</p>
			<p>
				<italic>Luciferase Assays and RNA Isolation</italic>
				&#x02014;Cells were grown in
				24-well, 6-well, or 6-cm dishes and treated with DMSO or DMSO plus
				isoginkgetin, as indicated in the figure legends. Luciferase assays
				(luciferase assay system; Promega) were performed using a TD-20/20
				Luminometer
				(Turner Systems). Protein concentrations were determined for lysates using
				the
				DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent
				(Molecular Research Corp.) and DNase-treated (Promega) according to
				the
				manufacturers' protocols. When a sample was to be used both for monitoring
				luciferase activity and for preparing RNA, cells were harvested in
				ice-cold
				1&#x000d7; phosphate-buffered saline; 25% was diluted 2-fold with 2&#x000d7;
				passive lysis buffer (Promega) and used for luciferase assays, and
				the
				remainder was added to 5.5 volumes of TRI Reagent for RNA isolation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<italic>Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR</italic>
				&#x02014;RT-PCR was carried out using
				the SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For qualitative
				experiments, 60 ng of DNase-treated total RNA was used per
				25-&#x003bc;l reaction,
				run on 2% agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. For
				semiquantitative RT-PCR (using [&#x003b1;-
				<sup>32</sup>
				P]dATP), different
				amounts of DNase-treated total RNA (0.1&#x02013;100 ng) were used,
				depending on
				the transcript being amplified. Reactions were performed with at least
				two
				concentrations of RNA to ensure that they were within the linear range. When
				the amplification product crossed an intron-exon boundary, primers
				amplifying
				U6 snRNA, an unspliced polymerase III transcript, were included as a
				control.
				Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1.

				<italic>High Throughput Screening</italic>
				&#x02014;All high throughput screening was
				performed at the Broad Institute in association with the Chemical Biology
				Program.
			</p>
			<p>Cells were plated in 384-well plates at cell densities ranging
				from 1500 to
				9000 cells/well. Plating &#x0223c;4000 cells/well gave the least
				variability in
				luciferase activity while maximizing the signal difference between cell lines
				II and III. Cells were plated in a 30-&#x003bc;l total volume using
				a Multidrop 384
				or a Multidrop Micro (Thermo Scientific) liquid handler. To test
				sensitivity
				to DMSO (the carrier for the compound libraries), cell lines II and
				III were
				incubated overnight in growth media containing 0&#x02013;1% DMSO.
				Concentrations
				up to 1% DMSO did not cause significant changes in signal intensity or
				reproducibility for any of the cell lines.</p>
			<p>
				For high throughput screening, cell lines II and III were plated on
				day 0
				in growth medium in white, opaque bottom 384-well plates (Nunc) at a
				density
				of 3000&#x02013;6000 cells/30 &#x003bc;l. On day 1, 100 nl of test
				compounds or DMSO
				was pin-transferred using a CyBio robot with a 384-well pin array to
				duplicate
				plates. On day 2, &#x0223c;24 h after the pin transfer, luciferase
				activities were
				read using the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to
				the
				manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 30 &#x003bc;l of the combined cell lysis and
				assay reagent buffer were added directly to the well using a Matrix
				Wellmate
				(Thermo Scientific). After agitating plates for 10 min, luciferase readings
				were collected using an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life
				Sciences).
				Data analysis was performed as described
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
				) to determine
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-scores and assess reproducibility of compound effects. For follow
				up experiments, cells were grown in 24-well, 6-well, or 6-cm dishes
				and
				treated with DMSO or DMSO plus isoginkgetin, as described above.
			</p>
			<p>
				<italic>Isoginkgetin</italic>
				&#x02014;Screening and initial follow up experiments
				were carried out with isoginkgetin obtained from MicroSource.
				Isoginkgetin for
				subsequent experiments was purchased from Gaia Corp. To validate their
				identity and purity, all samples were subjected to C18 reverse phase
				high
				pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. One sample from
				Gaia that exhibited no activity in cellular assays proved
				&#x0003c;50% pure,
				whereas a second sample that proved &#x0003e;99% pure by high pressure
				liquid
				chromatography-mass spectrometry did exhibit the expected activity.

				<italic>Development of Cell Lines for in Vivo Screening</italic>
				&#x02014;To generate
				constructs appropriate for
				<italic>in vivo</italic>
				screening, we created a splicing
				reporter consisting of the human TPI gene exon 6-intron 6-exon 7 cassette
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
				) upstream of the firefly
				luciferase open reading frame (
				<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">
					Fig.

					<italic>A</italic>
				</xref>
				, positive control; construct I). In this construct,
				the start codon is in the first exon, and active luciferase is
				generated only
				from spliced mRNA. In order to generate the screening reporter
				(construct II),
				we removed all in frame stop codons from the intron and added one base
				at the
				beginning of the second exon, such that the luciferase open reading frame is
				out of frame with the start codon in the spliced mRNA but is in
				frame when the
				intron is retained. We also created a mutant reporter (construct III)
				identical to the screening reporter except for a 5&#x02032; splice
				site point
				mutation predicted to abolish splicing (U to A at position 2 in the intron).
				All three reporters were subcloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus

				in plasmid pcDNA5/FRT. This plasmid also contains an FRT site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stable cell lines expressing each reporter were generated using the
				Flp/FRT
				recombinase system. To do so, we clonally selected HEK293 cell lines stably
				transfected with a plasmid containing a FRT site at a single
				position in a
				transcriptionally active portion of the genome, as confirmed by LacZ
				expression (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). Independent
				co-transfection of two of these cell lines (293F1 and 293F2) with
				the reporter
				constructs and a plasmid encoding Flp recombinase generated the screening cell
				lines (293F1-I, -II, and -III and 293F2-I, -II, and -III). RT-PCR
				analysis of
				total RNA from each cell line confirmed that transcripts from constructs
				I and
				II were spliced, whereas those from construct III were not (see
				<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">
					Fig. 1
					<italic>B</italic>
				</xref>
				for the
				293F1-based lines; 293F2-based lines, data not shown). Consistent with this,
				luciferase activity levels were high in the positive control cells
				(I), low in
				the splicing reporter cells (II), and intermediate in the mutant
				reporter
				cells (III) (
				<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">
					Fig. 1
					<italic>C</italic>
				</xref>
				).
				Since the three reporters behaved identically in both the 293F1 and 293F2
				backgrounds, the two cell line sets were used interchangeably.
			</p>
			<p>
				<italic>High Throughput Screening of Compound Libraries</italic>
				&#x02014;Paired cell
				lines containing either reporter II or III were used to screen for small
				molecules that specifically inhibited splicing. We expected that
				such
				inhibitors would increase the luciferase activity from reporter II but would
				have little or no effect on reporter III. Comparison of compound
				effects on
				reporters II and III allowed us to discriminate between effects on splicing
				and other potential means of increased protein expression (
				<italic>e.g.</italic>
				increased cell proliferation, transcription, translation, etc.). The
				6-fold
				difference between the luciferase activities of reporters II and III under the
				screening conditions (0.3% DMSO) provided a sufficient window for
				compound
				identification.
			</p>
			<p>
				For high throughput screening, cells were grown in 384-well plates,
				exposed
				in duplicate to compounds dissolved in DMSO or an equivalent volume of
				DMSO
				alone for 24 h, after which luciferase activities were measured. Each
				luciferase value was expressed as the number of S.D. values from the
				mean (the
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score) of control DMSO-treated cells
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
				). A composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score was derived by combining the vectors of each replicate's
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score for every given compound/cell line pair. This score allows
				easy comparison of effects upon two separate biological systems that
				have
				differently distributed spreads of average values (in this case, the average
				luciferase activity of cells expressing construct II
				<italic>versus</italic>
				those
				expressing construct III)
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
				). For each compound deemed
				to have a reproducible effect (
				<italic>i.e.</italic>
				its duplicates matched in
				direction and degree), the composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score for reporter II was
				plotted against the composite Z-score for reporter III
				(
				<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				Approximately 8000 compounds were screened from natural product and
				synthetic libraries, some at multiple concentrations (15&#x02013;100
				&#x003bc;
				<sc>m</sc>
				). Of these, about half were known bioactives from
				commercially available NINDS, SpecPlus, and Biomol collections, and the
				remainder were the products of multiple diversity-oriented synthesis
				endeavors. A complete list of compounds screened and the scores each
				yielded
				in our assay can be found on the World Wide Web via ChemBank. The vast
				majority of compounds fell either within the noise range as defined
				by DMSO
				treatment (&#x0007c;composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score&#x0007c; &#x02264; 2.5) or on the line
				defined by
				<italic>x</italic>
				=
				<italic>y</italic>
				(
				<italic>i.e.</italic>
				affecting reporters II and
				III similarly). As expected, compounds such as the transcription
				inhibitor
				actinomycin D and the translation inhibitor cycloheximide decreased luciferase
				activity of both reporters II and III, thus yielding negative
				composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-scores for both.
			</p>
			<p>
				A limited number of compounds yielded a positive composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score
				&#x02265;3 for one reporter while having a negligible effect on the other
				(
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>
				). Among this set, one
				compound stood out strikingly as having a very large positive effect on
				luciferase activity in cells expressing construct II (composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score = 27.9) but no significant effect in cells expressing
				construct III (composite
				<italic>Z</italic>
				-score = &#x02013;2.5). This compound is the
				biflavonoid isoginkgetin, a natural product found in a variety of plant
				species, including
				<italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>
				.

				isoginkgetin (the

				(&#x0223c;1.8-fold) (

				</xref>
				). As observed in the screen, the effect on reporter

			<p>
				To verify that the observed changes in luciferase activity were due
				to
				inhibition of splicing, we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted
				from isoginkgetin- and DMSO-treated cells. This analysis confirmed
				that
				overnight exposure to 33 &#x003bc;
				<sc>m</sc>
				isoginkgetin was sufficient to shift
				the predominant species generated from constructs I and II from spliced
				mRNA
				to unspliced pre-mRNA (
				<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">
					Fig.
					3
					<italic>B</italic>
				</xref>
				). Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that this shift
				toward accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA was detectable within 3 h of
				isoginkgetin addition (
				<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">
					Fig.
					3
					<italic>C</italic>
				</xref>
				). Consistent with this, luciferase activity from
				reporter I began to decrease, and that from reporter II began to increase
				within a similar time frame (
				<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">
					Fig.
					3
					<italic>D</italic>
				</xref>
				). The effect of isoginkgetin treatment was also
				concentration-dependent, since treatment with 100 &#x003bc;
				<sc>m</sc>
				isoginkgetin led to a greater increase in pre-mRNA accumulation
				within 4 h
				than did treatment with either 10 or 33 &#x003bc;
				<sc>m</sc>
				isoginkgetin
				(
				<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">
					Fig. 3
					<italic>E</italic>
				</xref>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				To test whether the effect of isoginkgetin on splicing was specific
				to our
				reporter system or more general, we analyzed several endogenous transcripts,
				including those encoding &#x003b2;-tubulin, actin, DNAJB1, TPI,
				glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and RIOK3. All of these
				transcripts
				exhibited pre-mRNA accumulation (2&#x02013;20-fold) upon treatment with
				isoginkgetin (
				<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">
					Fig. 4,
					<italic>A</italic>
					and
					<italic>B</italic>
				</xref>
				, and data not shown). We also monitored NOL1 intron 7,
				a known substrate for the minor spliceosome
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
				). As observed for other
				endogenous transcripts, isoginkgetin treatment led to an increase in the
				amount of unspliced NOL1 intron 7 (
				<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">
					Fig.
					4
					<italic>C</italic>
				</xref>
				). Taken together, these results indicate that
				isoginkgetin is a general inhibitor of splicing that targets both the major
				and minor spliceosomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				As expected for a general inhibitor of an essential step in gene
				expression, treatment of cells with isoginkgetin at concentrations
				inhibitory
				for splicing resulted in growth arrest
				(
				<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">
					Fig. 5
					<italic>A</italic>
				</xref>
				). Trypan blue
				and Alamar blue analyses suggested that this growth arrest was not
				accompanied
				by a loss of cell viability (data not shown). Consistent with this,
				removal of
				isoginkgetin after 24 h restored both expression of luciferase from reporter I
				and cellular proliferation (
				<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">
					Fig. 5,
					<italic>B</italic>
					and
					<italic>C</italic>
				</xref>
				). Thus, isoginkgetin appears to be a
				reversible inhibitor of pre-mRNA splicing.

				<italic>Isoginkgetin Inhibits Splicing in Vitro</italic>
				&#x02014;To determine whether
				isoginkgetin could inhibit splicing
				<italic>in vitro</italic>
				, we performed splicing
				assays in HeLa cell nuclear extract using multiple RNA substrates. For
				these
				assays, isoginkgetin was diluted in DMSO, which itself did not affect
				splicing
				efficiency at concentrations of &#x02264;2% (data not shown). Radiolabeled
				pre-mRNAs were spliced for 60 min in standard reactions supplemented
				with
				0&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;
				<sc>m</sc>
				isoginkgetin (&#x02264;1% v/v). Splicing of AdML,
				&#x003b2;-globin, and TPI (exon 6-intron 6-exon 7, equivalent to the
				<italic>in

				splicing reporter) transcripts was inhibited by isoginkgetin in a
				dose-dependent manner. For all three constructs, splicing was
				completely
				inhibited by 50 &#x003bc;
				<sc>m</sc>
				isoginkgetin, with an IC

				of
				&#x0223c;30 &#x003bc;

				(
				<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">

				<italic>in vitro</italic>
				splicing inhibition was
				reproducible with several different HeLa nuclear extract preparations, and

			<title>DISCUSSION</title>
			<p>
				In comparison with other steps in gene expression, there is
				currently a
				paucity of small molecule modulators of pre-mRNA processing. Such
				modulators,
				particularly if their action is reversible, can be incredibly useful tools for
				both cell biological and biochemical analyses. Here we describe the
				development of a set of stable mammalian cell lines that we
				successfully
				employed in a high throughput screen to identify a new general inhibitor of
				pre-mRNA splicing. Our design principle was that inhibition of
				splicing should
				lead to a readily detectable positive readout, in our case an increase
				in
				luciferase activity. This design is similar to one previously employed in
				budding yeast, where a rise in copper resistance due to expression
				of Cup1p
				signaled increased use of one 5&#x02032; splice site over another
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
				). This CUP1 system has
				proven highly adaptable for studying other aspects of pre-mRNA processing
				as
				well (
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
				).
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to ours, a number of other reporter systems for
				monitoring
				either general or alternative splicing in mammalian cells via a protein
				activity readout have been described
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
				). For example, Nasim
				<italic>et
					al.</italic>
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
				) characterized a
				dual reporter system in which a transiently transfected plasmid encodes
				&#x003b2;-galactosidase in the first exon and firefly luciferase in
				the second.
				The two exons are separated by an intron containing multiple in-frame
				stop
				codons. Thus, whereas &#x003b2;-galactosidase is produced from both
				pre-mRNA and
				mRNA, luciferase is only expressed from the latter. In this system,
				specific
				inhibition of splicing is signaled by a decrease in luciferase activity
				without a concomitant decrease in &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity.
				An alternate
				dual reporter scheme was developed by Lynch and co-workers
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
				) to monitor exon exclusion
				of CD45 exon 4. In their system, skipping-dependent expression of the
				transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 drives expression of green
				fluorescent
				protein. Augmentation of the initial readout (
				<italic>i.e.</italic>
				an increase in
				Gal4-VP16 expression) by transcriptional synergy enabled amplification of a
				3&#x02013;5 fold change in splicing pattern into a 30&#x02013;50
				fold change in
				green fluorescent protein expression. This system was used successfully
				to
				identify two small molecules that promote exon 4 exclusion
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
				). More recently Stoilov
				<italic>et al.</italic>
				employed an alternative splicing reporter expressing either
				green fluorescent protein or red fluorescent protein in an alternative
				exon-dependent manner in a small scale screen
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
				). Of particular note was the
				140-fold dynamic range of this cell-based assay obtained by monitoring the
				ratio of two alternative splicing reporters. From their screen,
				Stoilov
				<italic>et
					al.</italic>
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
				) identified a
				number of well known cardiotonic steroids, such as digoxin, as altering
				the
				splicing pattern of MAPT exon 10, their initial reporter construct. Although
				some of these same compounds were tested in our screen, they did not
				have any
				significant effects in our system. This is consistent with the idea that they
				are specific, not general, splicing effectors.

				In contrast to the aforementioned systems, our cell-based assay was
				specifically designed to identify a general inhibitor of pre-mRNA
				splicing. It
				is based entirely on luciferase as a readout and employs three nearly
				identical reporters. By using the FLP/FRT system to generate cell
				lines stably
				transfected at identical genetic loci, we eliminated possible effects at the
				level of transcription due to different genomic contexts. By
				comparing the
				expression of two reporters that differed by only one nucleotide at the RNA
				level but were identical at the protein level, we eliminated
				possible
				differential effects of compounds on RNA or protein stability, RNA
				translatability, or protein activity. Here we used reporter cell
				lines II and
				III to identify a pre-mRNA splicing inhibitor. However, other
				combinations of
				these cell lines could be used to screen for compounds affecting a
				different
				step in mRNA biogenesis. For example, a compound promoting release of
				unspliced RNA from the nucleus without directly affecting splicing
				might be
				predicted to increase the luciferase signal from construct III while only
				minimally affecting those from constructs I and II. We note that
				several
				compounds having this particular set of differential effects were identified
				in our screen (
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>
				, rows
				6&#x02013;11) and may be worthy of follow up.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite screening a relatively small number of compounds
				(&#x0003c;8000), we
				were able to identify a
				<italic>bona fide</italic>
				splicing inhibitor, the natural
				product isoginkgetin, which was by far our most positive hit. Isoginkgetin
				has
				previously been described as one of several biflavonoids isolated from
				<italic>G.
					biloba</italic>
				, many of which have been characterized as having
				antiproliferative, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and/or neuroprotective
				activities
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
				)
				(reviewed in Ref.
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
				). Perhaps
				the best characterized role of isoginkgetin is as an inhibitor of tumor
				cell
				invasion. At isoginkgetin concentrations similar to those we found inhibitory
				of splicing both
				<italic>in vivo</italic>
				and
				<italic>in vitro</italic>
				, Yoon
				<italic>et al.</italic>
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
				) showed that tumor cell
				invasion was inhibited. Supporting this, they documented changes in the
				levels
				of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in tumor cell invasion. These gene
				expression changes were suggested to result from inhibition of the
				kinase-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ATK/NF-&#x003ba;B
				signaling
				pathway, although the exact target of isoginkgetin was not identified in
				that
				study.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, two other classes of cell-permeable compounds have emerged
				as
				general pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors: pladienolide-B and spliceostatin A, a
				derivative of FR901464 (
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
				). Although these natural
				products were isolated from different organisms and have different core
				structures, they both target the SF3b complex. SF3b, which consists
				of the
				three proteins SAP130, SAP145, and SAP155, is a component of U2 and U12
				snRNPs
				important for early spliceosome assembly and branch point adenosine
				definition. Extracts lacking SF3b fail to assemble A complex
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
				). Also known as the
				prespliceosome, A complex represents the first ATP-dependent stage of
				spliceosome assembly, and contains U2 snRNP stably associated with the branch
				site. Consistent with SF3b being the target of spliceostatin A, we
				recently
				showed that meayamycin, another FR901464 analog, which is 2 orders of
				magnitude more potent than FR901464
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
				), completely blocks A
				complex formation
				<italic>in
					vitro</italic>
				.
				<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref>
				In
				contrast, isoginkgetin appears to act by a different mechanism, since its
				presence promotes the accumulation of A complex in
				<italic>in vitro</italic>
				splicing
				reactions. Although we have not yet identified the target of isoginkgetin,
				likely candidates would be components of both the major and minor
				spliceosomes
				required for the A to B complex transition. An example of such a component
				is
				the SRPK2 kinase, which phosphorylates PRP28, allowing stable
				association with
				the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP and progression to B complex
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
				). Regardless of its
				target, isoginkgetin should prove a useful reagent for the accumulation of
				prespliceosomes for mechanistic and structural studies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like isoginkgetin, pladienolide-B and FR901464 (and its derivatives)
				have
				been reported to have antiproliferative activity. Indeed, it was their
				promise
				as anti-tumor agents that prompted the studies leading to the
				identification
				of SF3b as the cellular target of both. That isoginkgetin,
				pladienolide-B, and
				spliceostatin A all have both anti-tumor and anti-splicing activity but
				inhibit splicing by two different mechanisms (inhibition of A complex
				formation
				<italic>versus</italic>
				the A to B complex transition) suggests that their
				shared anti-tumor activity is a consequence of failure to express some
				limiting component needed for tumor cell growth due to general
				splicing
				inhibition. In
				<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>
				, for example, mutation of
				the general splicing factor CDC5 leads to a cell cycle defect due to
				decreased
				splicing efficiency of &#x003b1;-tubulin pre-mRNA. The simple requirement
				for
				large quantities of &#x003b1;-tubulin at the G
				<sub>2</sub>
				/M transition leaves
				the cell vulnerable to anything limiting &#x003b1;-tubulin production
				(
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
				). A similar mechanism may
				be at work with small molecule inhibitors of splicing. The
				antiproliferative
				effect may be the result of an increased sensitivity to decreases in
				certain
				limiting proteins in proliferating cells. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of
				general pre-mRNA splicing potentially represent an exciting new
				avenue for the
				development of novel anti-inflammatory and/or anti-cancer agents.

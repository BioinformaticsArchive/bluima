12529	The effects of kinins on the level of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin and on their metabolites, i.e., normetanephrine, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoloacetic acid in the brain tissue divided into cerebellum, corpus striatum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and midbrain were investigated. It was shown that bradykinin in a dose of 4 mug decreased the content of norepinephrine in corpus striatum, midbrain, and cerebellum. It also decreased the level of dopamine in corpus striatum but increased the level of serotonin in corpus striatum and midbrain. Similar changes were observed with 100 Mu/kg of kallikrein. It was that changed levels of investigated neuromediators are accompanied by changed levels of their metabolites. Bradykinin, in a dose of 4 mug, decreased the level of normetanephrine in corpus striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain and the level of homovanillic acid in corpus striatum, and increased the level of 5-hydroxyindoloacetic acid in corpus striatum and hippocampus. It was also shown that bradykinin increased norepinephrine uptake by the blood platelets when its level in the platelets was low, and released the absorbed norepinephrine into the medium when the level of norepinephrine was higher. The above results confirm the existence of an interaction of kinins with neuromediators in the central nervous system.
44543	Activity of membrane-bound gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) was examined in various regions of mouse brain, in capillaries of the cerebral cortex and in telencephalic choroid plexuses. The level of activity in the capillaries was double and that of the choroid plexus nine times that of the gamma-GTP activity found in the brain, septum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, frontal cortex, pons, medulla oblongata, and amygdala. Histochemically the gamma-GTP activity was demonstrated in the surface membranes of choroidal cells and in the endothelium of small capillaries. The activities of gamma-GTP of cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and capillaries from rabbit were 5--17 times greater than those from corresponding areas of mouse brain. While 30 mM methionine stimulated (in vitro) the enzyme from mouse brain, no such effect was observed with the enzyme activity from rabbit brain. The gamma-GTP activity from the capillaries of cerebral cortex of both mouse and rabbit was not affected by the presence of methionine. These findings suggest existence of differences in the specificity of gamma-GTP activity in these two species.
56207	In 5 squirrel monkeys the anatomical projections from the 'cingular' vocalization area were studied by the autoradiographic tracing technique. The 'cingular' vocalization area lies around the sulcus cinguli at the level of the genu of the corpus callosum; its electrical stimulation yields purring and cackling calls. The following efferent connections were found: corticocortical fibers could be traced into the orbital cortex (areas 10 and 11), dorsomedial frontal cortex (areas 9, 8 and 6), limbic cortex (areas 25, 24 and 23), Broca's area (area 44), frontal operculum (area 50), insula (areas 13 and 14), and auditory association cortex (area 22). Subcortical terminal fields within the telencephalon were found in the nucleus caudatus, putamen, claustrum, globus pallidus, olfactory tubercle, preoptic region and nucleus centralis and basolateralis amygdalae. Fibers reached most of these structures along different trajectories. In the diencephalon terminal fields lay in the dorsal hypothalamus, the subthalamus, lateral habenular nucleus, and the following thalamic nuclei: nucleus reticularis, ventralis anterior, centralis medialis, centralis superior lateralis, centralis inferior, submedius, medialis dorsalis and centrum medianum. In the midbrain, the periaqueductal gray was the only projection area, extending into the parabrachial nuclei at the pontomesencephalic transition. The most caudal terminal field was found in the medial pontine gray. No terminals were detected in the nucleus ambiguus, nucleus n. hypoglossi or in any other cranial motor nucleus involved in phonation processes. A comparison of this projection system with the whole of structures producing vocalization when electrically stimulated yielded only partial overlap. Not all vocalization areas lie within the 'cingular' projection system, and inversely, not the whole projection system yielded vocalization. Overlap took place in the anterior limbic cortex, preoptic region, central amygdaloid nucleus, midline thalamus, dorsal hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray and parabrachial nuclei. These structures are considered to compose a functionally coherent vocalization system. The projections into Broca's area, nucleus ventralis anterior thalami, frontoopercular cortex within the lateral fissure, pontine nuclei and superior temporal gyrus are discussed in their possible relationship to vocalization processes.
57820	The projections of serotonin-containing neurons of the midbrain raphe nuclei (nucleus raphe dorsalis, nucleus centralis superior) are studied by analysis of axonal transport of labeled amino acids. These results are correlated with regional alterations of serotonin content following midbrain raphe lesions which produce significant serotonin depletion in nearly all regions of the central nervous system. Twenty-four hours following injection of 100 muCi [3H]proline, raphe neurons have taken up labeled material and transported it, presumably as protein, to telencephalon, diencephalon, brain stem, the cerebellum and the spinal cord. This transport appears to take place predominantly in serotonin neurons. After injection of 100 muCi [3H]5-HTP into nucleus raphe dorsalis or nucleus centralis superior, the pattern of regional distribution of transported material is very similar to that obtained with tritiated proline. Selective lesions of serotonin terminals with 5.6-DHT result in greatly diminished axonal transport of proteins to all telencephalic, diencephalic and mesencephalic areas as well as to cerebellum, pons-medulla and spinal cord. Unilateral destruction of the medial forebrain bundle results in significant reduction in axonal transport of labeled material to ipsilateral telencehalon and thalamus. These results provide further support for the view that serotonin neurons of the midbrain raphe nuclei project widely throughout the neuraxis to telencephalon, diencephalon, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord.
61975	The efferent connections of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) of the rat have been examined using the autoradiographic method. Following injections of small amounts (0.4-2.0 muCi) of tritium labeled amino acids, fibers from the VMH can be traced forward through the periventricular region, the medial hypothalamus and the medial forebrain bundle to the preoptic and thalamic periventricular nuclei, to the medial and lateral preoptic areas, to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and to the ventral part of the lateral septum. Some labeled axons continue through the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis into the stria itself, and hence to the amygdala, where they join other fibers which follow a ventral amygdalopetal route from the lateral hypothalamic area and ventral supraoptic commissure. These fibers terminate in the dorsal part of the medial amygdaloid nucleus and in the capsule of the central nucleus. A lesser number of rostrally directed fibers from the VMH crosses the midline in the ventral supraoptic commissure and contributes a sparse projection to the contralateral amygdala. Descending fibers from the VMH take three routes: (i) through the medial hypothalamus and medial forebrain bundle; (ii) through the periventricular region; and (iii) bilaterally through the ventral supraoptic commissure. These three pathways are interconnected by labeled fibers so that it is not possible to precisely identify their respective terminations. However, the periventricular fibers seem to project primarily to the posterior hypothalamic area and central gray, as far caudally as the anterior pole of the locus coeruleus, while the medial hypothalamic and medial forebrain bundle fibers apparently terminate mainly in the capsule of the mammillary complex, in the supramammillary nucleus and in the ventral tegmental area. The ventral supraoptic commissure fibers leave the hypothalamus closely applied to the medial edges of the two optic tracts. After giving off their contributions to the amygdala, they continue caudally until they cross the dorsal edge of the cerebral peduncle to enter the zona incerta. Some fibers probably terminate here, but others continue caudally to end in the dentral tegmental fields, and particularly in the peripeduncular nucleus. Within the hypothalamus, the VMH appears to project extensively to the surrounding nuclei. However, we have not been able to find evidence for a projection from the VMH to the median eminence. Isotope injections which differentially label the dorsomedial or the ventrolateral parts of the VMH have shown that most of the long connections (to the septum, amygdala, central tegmental fields and locus coeruleus) originate in the ventrolateral VMH, and there is also some evidence for a topographic organization within the projections of this subdivision of the nucleus.
62770	The axoplasmic retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from axon terminals to their parent cell bodies and histochemical fluorescence microscopy have been used to study the ipsilateral centrifugal fibers to the olfactory bulbs and anterior olfactory nucleus in the rabbit. Focal injections of peroxidase were placed unilaterally into the main or accessory olfactory bulb or into the anterior olfactory nucleus. In animals with injected HRP confined within the main bulb, perikarya retrogradely labeled with the protein in the ipsilateral forebrain were observed in the anterior prepyriform cortex horizontal limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band, and far lateral preoptic and rostral lateral hypothalamic areas. Brain stem cell groups that contained HRP-positive somata include the locus coeruleus and midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus. Except for the prepyriform cortex, the basal forebrain structures with labeled perikarya correlate well with locations of cell bodies containing acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase. These somata may represent a cholinergic afferent system to the main olfactory bulb. Peroxidase-labeled cell bodies in the locus coeruleus and midbrain raphe are indicative of noradrenergic and serotonergic innervations respectively of the olfactory bulb. In rabbits in which peroxidase was injected or diffused into the accessory olfactory bulb and anterior alfactory nucleus, HRP-positive somata were identified in the prepyriform cortex bilaterally, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band nucleus, lateral hypothalamic region, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, corticomedial complex of the amygdala, mitral and tufted cell layers of the ipsilateral main olfactory bulb, locus coeruleus, and the midbrain raphe. Evidence for centrifugal fibers to the accessory olfactory bulb from the corticomedial complex of the amygdala, locus coeruleus, and possibly the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract and midbrain raphe is discussed. A similar distribution of labeled perikarya in the forebrain and brain stem was seen in rats in which peroxidase injected into the main olfactory bulb had spread into the accessory bulb and anterior olfactory nucleus. Histochemical fluorescence microscopy of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs in the rabbit and rat revealed fine caliber, green fluorescent fibers and varicosities predominantly in the granule cell layer and less so among cells in the glomerular layer. In sections through the root of the main olfactory bulb, a similar fluorescence was seen in the deep half of the plexiform layer of the pars externa of the anterior alfactory nucleus. These fluorescent fibers likely represent the noradrenergic innervation of the olfactory bulbar and retrobulbar formations. A fluorescent yellow hue was observed in the glomerular layer of the main bulb and may signify a serotonergic innervation of this lamina...
63306	Experiments were performed by either retrograde (horseradish peroxidase histochemistry) or anterograde ([3H]leucine radioautography) transport methods to determine the efferent connections of the septum in the rat. It was observed that the dorsal septum projects to the lateral preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, periventricular hypothalamus and midline thalamus. Fibers from the ventral half of the septum project topographically to the hippocampal formation, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain. Specifically, neurons located along the midline in the vertical limb of the diagonal band project through the dorsal fornix to all CA fields of the dorsal hippo campus and adjacent subicular cortex. Other fibers from this region project through the stria medullaris to the medial habenular nucleus and anteromedial nuclhe pars posterior of the medial mammillary nucleus. Cells located immediately lateral to the midline in the vertical limb of the diagonal band project through the medial part of the fimbria to all CA fields of the posterior hippocampus and adjacent subicular cortex. Other fibers which originate from this region project through the stria medullaris to both the medial and lateral habenular nuclei and the paratenial nucleus of the thalamus, and through the medial forebrain bundle to the pars posterior of the medial mammillary nucleus. Cells located in the intermediolateral septum project through the lateral part of the fimbria to all CA fields of the ventral hippocampus and adjacent subicular and entorhinal cortices. These cells also send fibers through the stria medullaris to the lateral habenular nucleus and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Other axons arising from these cells descend through the medial forebrain bundle to terminate in a region dorsal to the interpeduncular nucleus. Fibers from the most lateral part of the ventrl septum (i.e., bed nucleus of the anterior commissure) project through the stria terminalis to the ventral subiculum. In addition, cells located in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band project massively to the pars posterior of the medial mammillary nucleus and the ventral tegmental area, and amygdala.
64477	The mediodorsal nucleus of the rat thalamus has been divided into medial, central and lateral segments on the basis of its structure and axonal connections, and these segments have been shown by experiments using the autoradiographic method of demonstrating axonal connections to project to seven distinct cortical areas covering most of the frontal pole of the hemisphere. The position and cytoarchitectonic characteristics of these areas are described. The medial segment of the nucleus projects to the prelimbic area (32) on the medial surface of the hemisphere, and to the dorsal agranular insular area, dorsal to the rhinal sulcus on the lateral surface. The lateral segment projects to the anterior cingulate area (area 24) and the medial precentral area on the dorsomedial shoulder of the hemisphere, while the central segment projects to the ventral agranular insular area in the dorsal bank of the rhinal sulcus, and to a lateral part of the orbital cortex further rostrally. (The term "orbital" is used to refer to the cortex on the ventral surface of the frontal pole of the hemisphere.) A ventral part of this orbital cortex also receives fibers from the mediodorsal nucleus, possibly its lateral segment, but the medial part of the orbital cortex, and the ventrolateral orbital area in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus receive projections from the paratenial nucleus and the submedial nucleus, respectively. All of these thalamocortical projections end in layer III, and in the outer part of layer I. The basal nucleus of the ventromedial complex (the thalamic taste relay) has been shown to have a similar laminar projection (layer I and layers III/IV) to the granular insular area immediately dorsal to, but not overlapping, the mediodorsal projection field. However, the principal nucleus of the ventromedial complex appears to project to layer I, and possibly layer VI, of the entire frontal pole of the hemisphere. The anteromedial nucleus does not appear to project to layer III of the projection field of the mediodorsal nucleus, although it may project to layers I and VI, especially in the anterior cingulate and medial precentral areas. A thalamoamygdaloid projection from the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala has also been demonstrated, which reciprocates an amygdalothalamic projection from the basolateral nucleus to the medial segment. The habenular nuclei also appear to project to the central nucleus of the amygdala. These results are discussed in relation to the delineation and subdivision of the prefrontal cortex in the rat, and to amygdalothalamic and amygdalocortical projections which are described in a subsequent paper (Krettek and Price, '77).
65364	The efferent connections of the hippocampal formation of the rat have been re-examined autoradiographically following the injection of small quantities of 3H-amino acids (usually 3H-proline) into different parts of Ammon's horn and the adjoining structures. The findings indicate quite clearly that each component of the hippocampal formation has a distinctive pattern of efferent connections and that each component of the fornix system arises from a specific subdivision of the hippocampus or the adjoining cortical fields. Thus, the precommissural fornix has been found to originate solely in fields CA1-3 of the hippocampus proper and from the subiculum; the projection to the anterior nuclear complex of the thalamus arises more posteriorly in the pre- and/or parasubiculum and the postsubicular area; the projection to the mammillary complex which comprises a major part of the descending columns of the fornix has its origin in the dorsal subiculum and the pre- and/or parasubiculum; and finally, the medial cortico-hypothalamic tract arises from the ventral subiculum. The lateral septal nuclei (and the adjoining parts of the posterior septal complex) constitute the only subcortical projection field of the pyramidal cells in fields CA1-3 of Ammon's horn. There is a rostral extension of the pre-commissural fornix to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus accumbens, the medial and posterior parts of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the taenia tecta, and the infralimbic area, which appears to arise from the temporal part of field CA1 or the adjacent part of the ventral subiculum. The projection of Ammon's horn upon the lateral septal complex shows a high degree of topographic organization (such that different parts of fields CA1 and CA3 project in an ordered manner to different zones within the lateral septal nucleus). The septal projection of "CA2" and field CA3 is bilateral, while that of field CA1 is strictly unilateral. In addition to its subcortical projections, the hippocampus has been found to give rise to a surprisingly extensive series of intracortical association connections. For example, all parts of fields CA1, CA2 and CA3 project to the subiculum, and at least some parts of these fields send fibers to the pre- and parasubiculum, and to the entorhinal perirhinal, retrosplenial and cingulate areas. From the region of the pre- and parasubiculum there is a projection to the entorhinal cortex and the parasubiculum of both sides. That part of the postsubiculum (= dorsal part of the presubiculum) which we have examined has been found to project to the cingulate and retrosplenial areas ipsilaterally, and to the entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum bilaterally.
76452	The Fink-Heimer silver impregnation and the autoradiographic methods were used to study the fiber projections of the cingulate cortex in the squirrel monkey. It was found that this cortex provides inputs to the straitum, thalamus and several areas of isocortex. Evidence was found for a number of fiber projections (1) Fibers from the anterior limbic area were traced to the central part of the head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, septum, dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, anterior hypothalamus and lateral basal nucleus of the amygdala. (2) Projections from the cingulate area were traced to the lateral part of the head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and to the centromedian, anterior, lateral dorsal, and lateral ventral thalamic nuclei and to medial nuclei of the base of the pons. (3) There were porjections from the retrosplenial area of the anterior, lateral dorsal, dorsomedial, and posterior thalamic nuclei and lateral nuclei of the pons. These results indicate that most of the cingulate gyrus is an intermediate structure between the thalamus and overlying cortex. The anterior limbic area forms a bridge between the thalamus and other areas of the cingulate gyrus and the frontal cortex. (4) the retrosplenial area and the posterior part of the cingulate area bridge the adjacent visual snesory association cortex and pelvic areas of the snesory motor cortex, respectively. These areas of the cingulate gyrus project directly to the striatum as well as to the thalamus, structurally providing limbic system input to subcortical motor structures.
77176	The mesencephalic and diencephalic afferent connections to the superior colliculus and the central gray substance in the cat were examined by means of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After deep collicular injections numerous labeled cells were consistently found in the parabigeminal nucleus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, substantia nigra pars reticulata, the nucleus of posterior commissure, the pretectal area, zona incerta, and the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body. A smaller number of cells was found in the inferior colluculus, the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, the central gray substance, nucleus reticularis thalami, the anterior hypothalamic area, and, in some cases, in the contralateral superior colliculus, Forel's field, and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Only the parabigeminal nucleus and the pretectal area showed labeled cells following injections in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. In the cats submitted to injections in the central gray substance, labeled cells were consistently found in the contralateral superior colliculus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, substantia nigra parts reticulata, zona incerta and various hypothalamic areas, especially the ventromedial nucleus. In some cases, HRP-positive cells were seen in the nucleus of posterior commissure, the pretectal area, Forel's field, and nucleus reticularis thalami. A large injection in the mediodorsal part of the caudal mesencephalic reticular formation, which included the superior colliculus and the central gray substance, resulted in numerous labeled cells in nucleus reticularis thalami. The findings are discussed with respect to the suggested functional division of the superior colliculus into deep and superficial layers. Furthermore, the possible implications of labeled cells in zona incerta and the reticular thalamic nucleus are briefly discussed.
77865	The ascending projections of serotonin neurons of the midbrain raphe were analyzed in the rat using the autoradiographic tracing method. Axons of raphe serotonin neurons ascend in the ventral tegmental area and enter the medial forebrain bundle. A number of fibers leave the major group to ascend along the fasciculus retroflexus. Some fibers enter the habenula but the majority turn rostrally in the internal medullary lamina of the thalamus to innervate dorsal thalamus. Two additional large projections leave the medial forebrain bundle in the hypothalamus; the ansa peduncularis-ventral amygdaloid bundle system turns laterally through the internal capsule into the striatal complex, amygdala and the external capsule to reach lateral and posterior cortex, and another system of fibers turns medially to innervate medial hypothalamus and median eminence and form a contrelateral projection via the supraoptic commissures. Rostrally the major group in the medial forebrain bundle divides into several components: fibers entering the stria medullaris to terminate in thalamus; fibers entering the stria terminalis to terminate in the amygdala; fibers traversing the fornix to the hippocampus; fibers running through septum to enter the cingulum and terminate in dorsal and medial cortex and in hippocampus; fibers entering the external capsule to innervate rostral and lateral cortex; and fibers continuing forward in the medial olfactory stria to terminate in the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory bulb.
80249	The HRP method has been used to identify all the brain stem nuclei, which may project to lobule VI and/or VII of the posterior cerebellar vermis. Three tentative degrees of labeling of the different structures have been assigned: 'massive', 'clear' and 'discrete'. (1) Massive projections have been found to reach lobule VI and VII from the inferior olive and lobule VII only from the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. (2) Clear projections have been found to reach lobule VI only from the pontine nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the nucleus reticularis lateralis and the reticularis paramedianus; lobule VII only from the raphe nuclei, and both VI and VII from the perihypoglossal and vestibular nuclei. (3) Discrete projections have been found to reach lobule VI and VII from the deep cerebellar nuclei; lobule VI only from the nucleus tracti solitarii and nucleus cuneatus externus; lobule VII only from the nucleus lemnisci lateralis pars ventralis, the nuclei parabrachiales and the nucleus subcoeruleus.
84004	The distribution of spinocerebellar tract (SCT) neurons has been studied in the entire length of the spinal cord of the cat following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the cerebellum, and whether or not the axons of the labeled neurons crossed within the spinal cord was determined in cases with injections preceded by hemisections at the cervical levels. The SCTs were classified into the following crossed and uncrossed tracts according to the cell origin and the fiber course; the crossed SCTs originate from (1) the central cervical nucleus (the CCN-SCT), (2) lamina VIII neurons of the cervical to the lumbar cord (the lamina VIII-SCT), (3) spinal border cells (the border cell-SCT), (4) neurons in the medial lamina VII of the lumbar to the caudal spinal segments (the medial lamina VII-SCT), (5) ventral horn neurons (laminae VII and VIII) of the sacral and caudal segments (the ventral horn-SCT) and (6) dorsal horn neurons (lamina V) of the sacral and the caudal segments (the dorsal horn-SCT). The uncrossed tracts originate from (1) neurons of the medial lamina VI of C2 to T1 (the medial lamina VI-SCT of the cervical cord), (2) neurons in the central part of lamina VII of C6 to T1 (the central lamina VII-SCT of the cervical enlargement), (3) lamina V neurons of the lower cervical to the lumbar cord (the lamina V-SCT), (4) Clarke's column (the Clarke's column-SCT and (5) neurons in the medial lamina VI of L5 and L6 (the medial lamina VI-SCT of the lumbar cord). The present study suggests that the spinocerebellar system originates from more diverse laminae than has previously been known, and further refined studies on the topographic projections of each tract will yield more important and valuable information in this field.
102406	In the guinea pig brain, LH-RH-containing cell bodies are located not only within the classical hypophysiotrophic area but also in the medial preoptic area, septum and olfactory tubercle. LH-RH fiber tracts project not only to the primary portal plexus in the median eminence but also throughout the limbic forebrain and limbic midbrain regions. Using radiofrequency lesions in different brain regions, the projections of LH-RH cell bodies were determined. Cells in the medial preoptic area project ot the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the mammillary body complex and the ventral tegmental area. LH-RH neurons in both the medial septal nucleus and medial preoptic area project via the stria medullaris to the medial habenular nucleus and from there via the fasciculus retroflexus to the interpeduncular nucleus of the midbrain. Other LH-RH neurons in the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and olfactory tubercle are congregated in small clusters around large blood vessels which penetrate into this area, and they do not appear to send axons outside their immediate vicinity. The types of LH-RH axonal terminations and the roles of these peptide-containing neurons are discussed.
114555	Subcortical projections of six visual cortical areas (Areas 17 and 18, the Middle Temporal, Dorsomedial and Medial Areas, and the Posterior Parietal Region) in the owl monkey, Aotus trivigatus, were investigated with autoradiographic methods following injections of tritiated proline. No contralateral projections were demonstrated. While some brainstem structures received input from all six subdivisions of cortex, each cortical area appeared to exhibit its own unique pattern of subcortical projections. All six cortical areas were found to project to the superior and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pretectum and superior colliculus. Other subcortical targets of one or more visual cortical areas were the basal ganglia, claustrum, zona incerta, one or more of the intralaminar nuclei, lateral posterior nucleus, pregeniculate nucleus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and pontine nuclei. Furthermore, details of corticofugal projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectum and superior colliculus varied with the cortical area studied. The projections to the reticular nucleus, pregeniculate nucleus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the inferior and a portion of the superior division of the pulvinar and the superior colliculus were found to be topographically organized. The targets of the subcortical projections were compared with those of the retina, as revealed by autoradiographic methods following tritiated proline injections of the eye and were found to overlap to varying extents in the superior colliculus, pretectum and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and to be segregated in the pregeniculate nucleus. The results substantiate the validity of previous studies in the owl monkey that suggest that the visual cortex is subdivided into several functionally distinct areas; and illustrate the complexity of corticofugal influence on visual processing.
120544	The kinetics of synaptosomal tryptophan accumulation has been determined in five regions of the rat brain. For tryptophan concentrations ranging from 2.5 -- 20 microM, we found an active uptake in all the structures studied, i.e.: Corpus striatum, midbrain, brainstem, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex + hippocampus. The Vm of tryptophan uptake was highest in the cortex, followed in descending order by corpus striatum, hypothalamus, midbrain and brainstem, while the Km was highest in the cortex, then in descending order corpus striatum, brainstem, midbrain and hypothalamus. In spite of the possible nonspecific high affinity tryptophan uptake into serotoninergic neurons, we found a correlation between the Vm of tryptophan uptake and the different results in the literature concerning uptake and release of serotonin. These observations might indicate a correlation between the Vm of tryptophan uptake and the functional activity of serotonergic neurons.
191149	The localization of opiate receptors in the spinal cord and lower medulla has been elucidated by the autoradiographic identification of stereospecific [3H]diprenorphine (a potent opiate antagonist) binding sites. The opiate receptors were higly localized to: layers I (marginal cell zones) and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord; the substantia gelationsa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus; components of the vagal system, including the vagus nerve, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus commissuralis, nucleus intercalatus, nucleus ambiguus and nucleus originis dorsalis vagus; the area postrema. Examination of [3H]etorphine (a potent opiate agonist) binding sites showed the same distribution. We conclude that, in these brain regions, opiate receptors are (1) highly associated with areas receiving small, afferent primary fibers, (2) strategically placed to modulate noxious stimuli as well as explain some visceral side effects of opiate administration.
194249	Using specific antisera to methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin, we have visualized apparent enkephalin-containing neuronal fibers and terminals throughout the central nervous system of the rat. Immunoreactive enkephalin displays sharply defined localizations. Regions of highest immunofluorescent density include the laminae I and II of the spinal cord, the substantia gelatinosa of the caudal nucleus of nerve V, the vagal nuclei of the medulla, the periventricular and periaqueductal areas of the upper medulla and midbrain, dorsomedial thalamic regions, specific hypothalamic nuclei, the basal ganglia, particularly the globus pallidus and the central nucleus of the amygdala, and the lateral septum. In certain regions enkephalin immunofluorescence corresponds closely with the distribution of autoradiographic opiate receptor grains.
197324	Dibutyrul cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) was injected intracerebroventricularly into rats in doses of 50, 100 or 200 microgram. Noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations were measured spectrophotofluorimetrically in discrete brain areas: cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus with nucleus amygdala and nucleus accumbens (limbic system) and pons with medulla oblongata. DbcAMP (in each dosage administered) decreased, NA content of cortex and of pons with medulla oblongata. NA content in the hypothalamus and striatum was decreased only after the largest dose of dbcAMP. In the limbic system NA concentration was diminished after a dose of 100 or 200 microgram of dbcAMP. There was a decrease in DA level measured in the striatum alone after a dose of 100 microgram of dbcAMP. 5-HT concentration was increased in the striatum and the pons with medulla oblongata after each dose level of dbcAMP; in the cortex after a dose of 50 and 100 microgram; and in the hypothalamus after a dose of 200 microgram. 5-HIAA level was increased in the striatum, limbic system, pons with medulla oblongata after all doses of dbcAMP. We conclude that dbcAMP affects presynaptic central catecholaminergic and serotoninergic neurons in an opposite, manner, although discrete brain areas have a different susceptibility to dbcAMP action. These findings provide some explanation for the behavioural effects of dbcAMP.
220001	Within the first 10 ms after a sine-shaped sound wave (tone pip) seven small-amplitude potentials can be recorded in persons with normal hearing and normal brainstem functions. These components, in the nanovolt range, correspond to the electrical activity of various pathways of the auditory tract. In accordance with this view the resulting potentials were assigned to the following structures in the region of the periphery and the brainstem: component I corresponds to the cochlea or acoustic nerve (receptor, II to the cochlear nucleus (medulla), III to the upper olive (caudal pons), IV to the lateral lemniscus (rostral pons), V to the inferior colliculus (midbrain), VI to the medial geniculate body (diencephalon), VII to the acoustic radiation (cortex). Clinically well defined lesions of the acoustic nerve and brainstem indicate that there is a close topographical relationship between the clinical localisation and absence or delay of the individual components.
225691	The rates of disappearance of tritiated isethionic acid (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid) in eight regions of the rat central nervous system were studied. By utilizing the technique of graphical analysis ("curve peeling"), it was determined that seven areas (striatum, diencephalon, pons-medulla, midbrain, hippocampus, spinal cord, and cortex) exhibited triphasic (fast, intermediate, and slow) disappearance rates while only the cerebellum displayed a biphasic (fast, slow) rate. The half-lives for the fast component in the different regions of the central nervous system varied from 0.5 hr (midbrain and cortex) to 1.5 hr (diencephalon, cerebellum, and spinal cord): the half-lives for the intermediate component of the triphasic rate varied from 3.5 hr in the midbrain and spinal cord to 5.5 hr in the hippocampus. Half-lives estimated for the slow component of the multiphasic rate of disappearance of tritiated isethionic acid ([3H]ISA) varied from 28 hr (cerebellum) to 90 hr (spinal cord).
226233	Afferent projections to the locus coeruleus from the various raphe nuclei, particularly of the midbrain (nuclei raphe dorsalis and medianus) and pons (nuclei raphe pontis and magnus), have been studied in the rat by retrograde transport methods using horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The locus coeruleus, in both its dorsomedial and ventrolateral divisions, and in its various anterior-posterior components, were injected with 0.05 microliters of horseradish peroxidase following which various structures of the brainstem, particularly the raphe nuclei, were examined for HRP reactive cells. It was found that injections in most components of the locus coeruleus were associated with HRP positive cells in varying degrees of density in the nuclei raphe dorsalis, medianus, pontis, and magnus, with considerably sparser labelling in the anterior aspects of the medullary raphe nuclei pallidus and obscurus. Labelled cells were also seen in the nuclei of the solitary tract, contralateral locus coeruleus. lateral reticular areas of the pons and midbrain, nuclei pontis oralis and caudalis, vestibular nuclei, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, fastigial nuclei of cerebellum and medial parabrachial nuclei. These data, showing widespread innervation of the locus coeruleus from all raphe nuclei, as well as many other brainstem areas, in the rat support the general view of heavy innervation of the locus coeruleus from both extra-raphe and raphe nulcei. These latter raphe projections, probably serotonergic in nature, provide anatomical support for the various experiments indicating considerable regulation of locus coeruleus activities, such as phasic events of REM sleep, among other, by widespread projections from most raphe nuclei was well as several other regions of the brainstem.
252443	Since the time of Elliot Smith (1910) it has been recognized that the septal complex occupies a pivotal position within the mammalian telencephalon, being strategically placed between the hippocampal formation on the one hand and the basal forebrain and diencephalon on the other. However, it is only in the last few years that the detailed interrelationships between the different nuclear groups within the septum and the various subfields of the hippocampus have been studied. We have recently re-examined the connections of both the septum and the hippocampal formation using the techniques based on the anterograde transport of isotopically labelled proteins and the retrograde transport of the enzyme marker, horseradish peroxidase. Our findings may be summarized as follows. Field CA1 of Ammon's horn and the adjoining subiculum project through the fimbria and pre-commissural fornix upon the lateral septal nucleus of the same side in a topographically ordered manner. Field CA3, on the other hand, projects bilaterally upon the lateral septum. The lateral septal nucleus in turn, projects partly upon the medial septal nucleus and nucleus of the diagonal band, and partly to the lateral hypothalamus and the mamillary complex. The medial septal-diagonal band complex projects back, through the fimbria and dorsal fornix, to fields CA3 and CA4 of the hippocampus, to the dentate gyrus, to the subicular complex, and to the entorhinal area. The subicular complex projects through the post-commissural fornix to the anterior thalamic group, the mamillary complex, and the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus. Ammon's horn and the subiculum also project to the posterior septal nuclei (triangular and septofimbrial), which in turn send their output to the habenular and interpeduncular nuclei. The significance of these projections is analysed in a review of the major known afferent and efferent connections of the septum and hippocampus, and the cell groups to which they project directly.
264154	Unilateral lesions in the area of the loci coeruleus and subcoeruleus in the cat are associated with a significant and sustained decrease of noradrenaline (NA) in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex without any important change in the concentrations of NA in the contralateral cortex and in the spinal cord of both sides. The serotonin (5-HT) concentrations of the spinal cord and cerebral cortex of both sides remained unchanged in the same groups of animals. Bilateral lesions in the same area result also in a marked decrease of NA in the cerebral cortex of both sides. The latter lesions also result in slight decreases of NA in the hypothalamus and of NA and 5-HT in the spinal cord but the NA and 5-HT concentrations of the striatum and thalamus and the 5-HT concentrations of the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus are unmodified by such lesions. Unilateral lesions of the area immediately rostral to the locus coeruleus (praelocus lesions) result in a very significant decrease of NA in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex without any change of NA in the contralateral cerebral cortex and spinal cord of both sides. Similar lesions produced bilaterally in another group of cats resulted in marked decreases of NA in the cerebral cortex of both sides and a slight decrease of NA in the thalamus without any change of NA in the striatum, hypothalamus and spinal cord and of 5-HT in the cerebral cortex. In the same group of animals with lesions which, however, extended more closely to the midline than in cats with locus coeruleus lesions, 5-HT is markedly decreased in the striatum and thalamus and slightly decreased in the hypothalamus and spinal cord. These results support the view that the noradrenergic coeruleo-cortical pathway is made up of fibers which originate in the loci coeruleus and subcoeruleus and predominantly end ipsilaterally to their origin in the cerebral cortex. Ascending NA fibers ending in the thalamus appear to originate from NA neurons located more laterally in the upper pons and more specifically at the level of the parabrachial nuclei.
301051	The ascending projections of the locus coeruleus were studied using an autoradiographic method. The major projection of locus coeruleus neurons ascends in a dorsal pathway traversing the midbrain tegmentum in a position ventrolateral to the periaqueductal gray. At the caudal diencephalon the locus coeruleus axons descend to enter the medial forebrain bundle at a caudal tuberal hypothalamic level. They are jointed in the medial forebrain bundle by a much smaller locus coeruleus projection which takes a ventral course through the midbrain tegmentum and enters the medial forebrain bundle via the mammillary peduncle and ventral tegmental area. Terminal projections are evident in the midbrain to the periaqueductal gray, tegmentum and raphe nuclei. There are widespread projections to the dorsal thalamus. The heaviest of these are to the intralaminar nuclei, the anteroventral and anteromedial nuclei, the dorsal lateral geniculate and the paraventricular nucleus. In the hypothalamus the largest projections are to the lateral hypothalamic area, periventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. As the locus coeruleus projection ascends in the medial forebrain bundle, fibers leave it to traverse the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta and enter the internal capsule, the ventral amygdaloid bundle and ansa peduncularis. These appear to terminate in the amygdaloid complex and, via the external capsule, in the lateral and dorsal neocortex. At the level of the septum 4 projections are evident. One group of fibers enters the stria medullaris to terminate in the paraventricular nucleus and habenular nuclei. A second group joins the stria terminalis to terminate in the anygdaloid complex. The third group turns into the diagonal band and medial septum; some fibers terminate in the septal nuclei and others continue into the fornix to termimate in hippocampus. A large component continues around the corpus callosum into the cingulum to terminate in the cingulate and adjacent neocortex, the subiculum and hippocampus. The remaining fibers continue rostrally in the medial forebrain bundle to terminate in olfactory forebrain and frontal neocortex. Commissural projections arise at 4 locations. The first decussation occurs in the dorsal tegmentum just below the central gray rostral to the locus coeruleus. The crossing fibers enter the contralateral dorsal bundle. A second group of fibers leaves the ipsilateral dorsal pathway, crosses in the posterior commissure and enters the contralateral dorsal pathway at the level. The third commissural projection arises more rostrally and crosses in the dorsal supraoptic commissure to enter the contralateral medial forebrain bundle. The fourth commissural projection is through the anterior commissure. The termination of the contralateral projection appears similar to that of the ipsilateral projection.
314832	Small injections of tritiated leucine and proline confined to the ventral tegmental area (AVT) were found to label fibers ascending: (a) to the entire ventromedial half of the striatum, but most massively to the ventral striatal zone that includes the nucleus accumbens; (b) to the thalamus: lateral habenular nucleus, nuclei reuniens and centralis medius, and the most medial zone of the mediodorsal nucleus; (c) to the posterior hypothalamic nucleus and possibly the lateral hypothalamic and preoptic region; (d) to the nuclei amygdalae centralis, lateralis and medialis; (e) to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and the medial half of the lateral septal nucleus; (f) to the anteromedial (frontocingulate) cortex; and (g) to the entorhinal area. Further AVT efferents descend to the medial half of the midbrain tegmentum including an anterior region of the median raphe nucleus, to the ventral half of the central grey substance including the dorsal raphe nucleus, to the parabrachial nuclei, and to the locus coeruleus. Similar injections centered in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNC) label fibers that are distributed in the striatum in an orderly medial-to-lateral arrangement, and almost entirely avoid the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. With the exception of the lateral quarter of the substantia nigra, which apparently does not project to the extreme rostral pole of the striatum, each small SNC locus, regardless of its anteroposterior localization, distributes nigrostriatal fibers throughout the length of the striatum. Descending SNC efferents are distributed to the same general regions that receive descending AVT projections, except that no SNC fibers appear to enter the locus coeruleus. Isotope injections confined to the pars reticulata (SNR) label sparse nigrostriatal fibers, and numerous nigrothalamic fibers ascending mainly to the nucleus ventromedialis and in lesser number to the parafascicular nucleus and the paralamellar zone of the nucleus mediodorsalis. Descending SNR fibers leave the nigra as a voluminous fiber bundle that bifurcates into a large nigrotectal and a smaller nigrotegmental component, the latter terminating largely in the pedunculopontine nucleus of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum.
318208	Direct projections primarily ipsilateral to hippocampus from medial septal, diagonal band, supramammillary, submammillothalamic, locus coeruleus, and dorsal and medianus raphe nuclei were demonstrated. The locus coeruleus projects primarily through the cingulum and fornix superior to the dorsal posterior hippocampus, with its terminal fields in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the subiculum and areas CA 1-CA 2 of the dorsal posterior hippocampus. LC projections to the granular layer of the dentate hilus were not found. Raphe nuclei project through the cingulum, fornix superior, and primarily the fimbria, to the dorsal and ventral posterior hippocampus, with their terminal fields in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the dorsal posterior subicular region, stratum radiatum of CA 1-CA 3 in the dorsal hippocampus, and the stratum polymorph of the dentate gyrus, primarily in its superficial part. Raphe projections to the anterior hippocampal rudiment were found. However, no projection was found to the subiculum of the ventral posterior hippocampus, nor to stratum oriens. Hypothalamic nuclei project through the fornix superior and the fimbria, mainly to the dorsal posterior hippocampus with abundant terminal fibers in the depth of the dentate hilus. Smaller cells in these hypothalamic nuclei appear projecting to the ventral hippocampus. The number of neurons in the entorhinal area, the diagonal band, and the hypothalamic nuclei projecting to the hippocampus suggests these groups as the main sources of the extrinsic hippocampal afferents. In addition, they may also serve as relay stations for inputs from more caudal nuclei, and the topographic organization of their terminal fields as described herein may have important functional implications.
350597	The cortical projections of the brain stem were investigated in detail in the cat by means of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde axonal transport. Most of the cells providing ascending fibers to the neocortex were located in the pons (locus coerulus and related structures, central gray substance, dorsal tegmental nucleus, raphe nuclei, reticular nuclei); labeled neurons were also identified in the mesencephalon, mainly in the periaqueductal gray and in the nucleus linearis rostralis. These projections, and particularly the pontine fibers, were diffusely distributed throughout the cerebral cortex.
359601	The distribution of immunoreactive enkephalin in rat brain and spinal cord was studied by immunoperoxidase staining using antiserum to leucine-enkephalin ([Leu5]-enkephalin) or methionine-enkephalin ([Met5]-enkephalin). Immunoreactive staining for both enkephalins was similarly observed in nerve fibers, terminals and cell bodies in many regions of the central nervous system. Staining of perikarya was detected in hypophysectomized rats or colchicine pretreated rats. The regions of localization for enkephalin fibers and terminals include in the forebrain: lateral septum, central nucleus of the amygdala, area CA2 of the hippocampus, certain regions of the cortex, corpus striatum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus including median eminence, thalamus and subthalamus; in the midbrain: nucleus interpeduncularis, periaqueductal gray and reticular formation; in the hind brain: nucleus parabrachialis, locus ceruleus, nuclei raphes, nucleus cochlearis, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, motor nuclei of certain cranial nerves, nucleus commissuralis and formatio reticularis; and in the spinal cord the substantia gelatinosa. In contrast enkephalin cell bodies appear sparsely distributed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. The results of the histochemical staining show that certain structures which positively stain for enkephalin closely correspond to the distribution of opiate receptors in the brain and thus support the concept that the endogenous opiate peptides are involved in the perception of pain and analgesia. The localization of enkephalin in the preoptic-hypothalamic region together with the presence of enkephalin perikarya in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei suggest a role of enkephalin in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.
405084	Autordiographic tracing methods were used to determine the differential projections of the pretectal nuclei, in the rhesus monkey, in relation to their inputs. The sublentiform (SL) and olivary (ON) nuclei receive projections from the visual cortex, superior colliculus (SC) and equal bilateral projection from the retina. The nucleus of the posterior commissure (NPC) and its subdivisions do not receive any of these inputs. The projections of the pretectum involve a number of structures within the thalamus and brain stem and there are differences in the projection targets of the pretectal region which receives direct visual input (i.e., SL and ON) and the region which does not (i.e., nucleus of the posterior commissure, NPC). For example, while all pretectal regions project within the pretectum and to the SC, accessory oculomotor nuclei, reticular formation, intralaminar nuclei and hypothalamus, it is only the retinorecipient zone which projects to rostral regions such as the visceral oculomotor nuclei, the lateral pulvinar, the border between the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar, the oral pulvinar as well as to the thalamic reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta and other structures. It is concluded that the retina, SC and cortex which influence the visceral oculomotor nuclei can only do so by virtue of their projections to the pretectum, and that any consideration of accommodative and pupillary reflexes must view the pretectum as an obligatory link through which various structures can influence the intrinsic musculature of the eye. In contrast to the SC, the pretectum does not project to any of the visual relay nuclei of the thalamus, such as the inferior pulvinar, which project to the visual cortices. Instead, the pretectum projects directly to visuomotor, visceromotor and arousal systems.
416887	The autoradiographic method was used to trace projections from the monkey locus coeruleus (LC) and adjacent nuclei (nn. parabrachiales, n. tractus mesencephalicus nervus trigemini, substantia grisea centralis). Pathways attributed to LC are presented diagrammatically in a set of 26 coronal sections. They include a descending pathway along the tractus tegmentalis centralis, a caudal pathway entering the corpus medullaris cerebellaris via the lateral wall and roof of ventriculus quartus, and an ascending pathway along the tractus tegmentalis centralis giving off branches to the commissura posterior, tractus habenulo-interpeduncularis, centrum medianum and n. ventralis posteromedialis thalami, fasciculus lenticularis, lamina medullaris thalami lateralis, capsula interna, commissura supraoptica dorsalis, tractus supraoptico-hypophyseus, stria terminalis, laminae medullaris interna and medialis and pars interna of globus pallidus, corpus subfornicale, capsula externa, stria longitudinalis, cingulum, and gyrus rectus. A contribution to the branches entering n. ventralis posteromedialis thalami and the commissura supraoptica dorsalis was attributed to the nn. parabrachiaels. Axons entering trigeminal structures via the tractus mesencephalicus nervus trigemini were attributed to labeling of cells in the nucleus of that tract. Terminal areas attributed to labeling of LC axons were evident in decreasing order of density in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, substantia innominata, nn. amygdalae anterior, centralis and basalis (dorsal portion), nn. paraventricularis, supraopticus and dorsomedialis hypothalami, and n. antero-ventralis thalami.
441508	Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and left either at room temperature (21-23 degrees C) for periods of 1, 2, and 4 hours or in the refrigerator (4-5 degrees C) for periods of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours. The brains were left in the intact animals in order to stimulate human autopsy materials. At the end of each period, the rat was decapitated and the brain removed and immediately dissected into the following regions: cerebral cortex, striatum, midbrain, pons and medulla, and cerebellum. The levels of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in brain regions were determined fluorometrically. In animals kept at room temperature the level of NE decreased gradually with time reaching 61%, 76%, 68%, and 68% of control in the cerebral cortex, midbrain, pons and medulla, and cerebellum at 4 hours post mortem respectively. Striatal DA reached 61% of control at 2 hours and remained the same at 4 hours post mortem. The NE level declined at a slower rate in brain regions obtained from refrigerated animals, reaching 65%, 81%, 77%, and 77% of control in cerebral cortex, midbrain, pons and medulla, and cerebellum at 24 hours post mortem. Striatal DA reached 54% of control at 16 hours and showed no further decline at 54 hours post mortem. There was a significant post mortem decrease in NE and DA levels in all brain regions examined, however, the rate of this decline varied from region to region. The tissues obtained from refrigerated animals showed statistically less of a decline in amine levels.
456893	DNA content was measured in four areas of the brain (cerebral hemisphere, cerebellum, diencephalon, and lower brain stem) of young adult (5-month-old) and aged 24- to 30-month-old Long-Evans rats. There was no change in DNA content in all four areas in old age. The number of brain cells was counted in three areas of the brain (cerebral hemisphere, cerebellum and brain stem) with an ultrasonic separation method. In old age, there was significant loss in the total number of brain cells in the cerebellum but no cell loss in the cerebral hemisphere and the brain stem. The neuron number was significantly decreased and the glia/neuron ratio was increased in the cerebellum and cerebral hemisphere, but neither of them changed in the brain stem in old age. The cerebellum showed significantly more neuron loss than the cerebral hemisphere in old age. DNA content in individual brain cells in the cerebral hemisphere, cerebellum and brain stem does not change in old age; thus, calculation of brain cell number from DNA content in the brain of old rats is justified.
460520	A sensitive and rapid assay method method for cysteic acid decarboxylase was develped which combined the selectivity of ion exchange resin (a complete retention of the substrate, cysteic acid, and exclusion of the product, taurine) with the speed of a vacuum filtration. The synthesis and purification of 35S-labeled cysteic acid were described. The validity of the assay was established by the identification of the reaction product as taurine. With this new method, the decarboxylase activity was measured in discrete regions of bovine brain. Putamen had the highest activity, 172 pmol taurine formed/min/mg protein (100%), followed by caudate nucleus, 90%; cerebral cortex, 82%; hypothalamus, 81%; cerebellar cortex, 79%; cerebellar peduncle, 59%; thalamus, 42%; brain stem, 25%; pons, 10%; and corpus callosum, 3%. The decarboxylase activity in various mouse tissues was also determined as follows: liver, 403; brain, 145; kidney, 143; spinal cord, 59; lung, 21; and spleen, 10 pmol taurine formed/min/mg. No activity could be detected in skeleton muscle and heart, suggesting a different biosynthetic pathway for taurine synthesis in these tissues. The advantages and disadvantages of the new assay method are also discussed.
466469	Norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) concentration and dopamine turnover were measured 12 days after a unilateral or bilateral noradrenergic ventral bundle (VB) transection to determine the noradrenergic projection sites and possible interactions with dopaminergic systems. Both bilateral and unilateral VB transection resulted in a significant reduction of NE of the nucleus accumbens, lateral septal nucleus, medial forebrain bundle, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and medial amygdaloid nucleus. Bilateral transection also decreased NE content of the median eminence and the periventricular and arcuate nuclei. In the medial preoptic nucleus, the nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis and the central gray catecholamine area, bilateral transection significantly decreased NE concentrations while unilateral lesions had no significant effect. The anterior hypothalamic, lateral preoptic, and paraventricular nuclei responded to bilateral VB transection with a decrease in NE concentration and to unilateral lesion with a bilateral increase in NE. In the dorsal hippocampus and the caudate nucleus, bilateral lesions had no effect on NE concentrations while unilateral transection significantly decreased NE concentrations. Regions in which neither bilateral nor unilateral VB transection produced a significant change in NE content are the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus tractus diagonalis, substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata, ventral tegmental area, habenula, superior colliculus, and the cingulate and piriform cortices. Transection of the noradrenergic ventral bundle also produced changes in dopaminergic systems suggesting a noradrenergic--dopaminergic interaction. Bilateral VB transection decreased the dopamine concentration and turnover in the nucleus accumbens, increased steady-state levels and turnover in the nucleus tractus diagonalis and increased dopamine concentration in the lateral septum. Unilateral VB transection decreased DA concentration bilaterally in the caudate nucleus, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens and the nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis but increased concentrations in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (ipsilateral) and in the ventral tegmental area (bilateral). These results indicate a broad projection field for the noradrenergic ventral bundle and suggest a noradrenergic--dopaminergic interaction.
489776	Using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a study has been made of projections to the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VTA) and related dopaminergic cell groups (A 10). In order to minimise the possibility of damage to fibres of passage, a technique was evolved for the microiontophoresis of HRP such that minimal current strengths and durations were applied. In addition to a sham injection, control injections were also made to the medial lemnisuc, red nucleus, deep tegmental decussations, mesencephalic reticular formation and brachium conjunctivum. Following HRP injections confined to the areas of the VTA containing the dopamine cell groups, labelled neurons appeared in prefrontal cortex, dorsal bank of rhinal sulcus, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, amygdala, diagonal band of Broca, substantis innominata, magnocellular preoptic area, medial and lateral preoptic areas, anterior, lateral and postero-dorsal hypothalamus, lateral habenular, nucleus parafascicular nucleus of thalamus, superior colliculus, nucleus raphe dorsalis, nucleus raphe nagnus and pontis, dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus and deep cerebellar nuclei. Regions containing catecholamine groups A 1, A 5, A 6, A 7, A 9, A 13 and the serotonin group B 7 corresponded to the topography of labeled cell groups. Injections of HRP to the interfascicular nucleus resulted in labeling predominantly confined to the medial habenular and median raphe nuclei. The results are discussed in relation to the known connections of these regions. Other regions of the brain labelled by VTA injections are assessed in relation to control injections and the limitations of the HRP technique. A review of the organisation of some of these afferents in relation to the known cortical-subcortical-mesencephalic projection systems, suggests that the VTA is in a position to recieve information from a massively convergent system derived ultimately from the entire archi-, paleo-, and neo-cerebral cortices. In addition A 10 dopaminergic neurons are known to project to restricted regions of both pre-frontal and entorhinal cortices, which themselves also recieve massively convergent association cortico-cortical connections. It would appear reasonable to propose that these neurons perform a correspondingly important integrative function.
519514	[3H]Propylbenzilylcholine mustard ([3H]PrBCM) is a synthetic, potent muscarinic antagonist, which binds specifically and irreversibly by means of a covalent linkage to muscarinic receptors. Ten micrometer coronal cryostat sections taken through unfixed rat brain at the level of the maximum extent of the caudate nucleus were mounted on glass slides and incubated with 2.4 nM [3H]PrBCM at 30 degrees C for 25 min. They showed a total binding of 3250 pmol/g protein, of which 2130 pmol/g protein was sensitive to pretreatment with 10-6 M atropine. The specific (atropine-sensitive) binding was saturable. Saturation was reached at 15 min, with a rate constant of 1.3 x 106 M-1 sec-1. Binding was unaffected by drugs acting at nicotinic receptors (D-tubocurarine, hexamethonium), or by physostigmine, but was inhibited by muscarinic drugs (pilocarpine, oxotremorine, 3-quinuclidinylbenzilate). Postfixation for 15 min in Carnoy's fixative reduced the specific binding by 10% and the non-specific by 50%. Prefixation (i.e. before incubation with [3H]PrBCM) with any fixatives containing formaldehyde largely prevented specific binding, but a range of concentrations of glutaraldehyde (2% to 0.05%) caused only small reductions in specific binding (e.g. 0.1% glutaraldehyde caused only a 6% reduction). Clear, regionally specific patterns of localization of specific label in light microscope autoradiographs could be obtained from cryostat sections prefixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, incubated with 2.4 nM [3H]PrBCM for 15 min at 30 degrees C, and postfixed for 15 min in Carnoy's solution. Of the 105 forebrain areas studied 12 had grain counts between 6 and 9 times the non-specific level and a further 30 had counts 4 to 6 times non-specific. The higher grain counts were in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, pyriform cortex, stratum radiatum of the hippocampus, stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus, lateral amygdaloid nucleus, cortico-amygdaloid transition zone, anteroventral thalamic nucleus, hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and in laminae 3 and 6 of the neocortex (parietal region). There were high grain densities over the choroid plexus the lateral but not the third or fourth ventricles.
546974	Following an autoradiographical study on the projections from the feline sensorimotor cortex (representation of the limbs) to the brain stem, new projections to nucleus pretectalis posterior, the coerulear nuclei, nuclei corporis pontobulbares, nucleus intertrigeminalis, nucleus f, x and z of the vestibular nuclear complex, nucleus parvocellularis compactus, nucleus parasolitarius, nuclei insulae cuneati laterales, the nuclei of the raphé, nucleus reticularis lateralis and nucleus fastigii were found besides the well known projections to the tectal nuclei, the reticular formation, nucleus ruber, griseum pontis, the sensory trigeminal nuclei and the dorsal column nuclei. There was no evidence of projections to nucleus tractus solitarii. The amounts of radioactivity within the nuclei seem to be in favour of EM autoradiographical studies on the synaptology of these projections, apart from faintly labelled structures like most of the reticular nuclei, the sensory trigeminal nuclei, the coerulear nuclei and nucleus fastigii.
576520	Monospecific antisera against the purified protein component of tissue thromboplastin (apoprotein-III) from human brain have been raised in goats and rabbits. The antisera neutralized tissue thromboplastin prepared from brain, thyroid gland and pulmonary tissue, indicating that apoproteins in the various preparations cross-reacted immunologically and therefore were similar or identical. Comparison of the activities of tissue thromboplastin preparations from 34 different areas of the brain demonstrated a characteristic distribution pattern and a wide range of activities. White and grey matter from the same areas had similar activities. Bulbus and tractus olfactorius, medulla oblongata, corpus pineale, hippocampus and hypothalamus contained 160-270% of the average activity, whereas cerebellum globus pallidus, nucleus ruber and substantia nigra contained 30-60%. The distinct distribution pattern was unrelated to tissue vascularization, and may suggest that apoprotein-III could serve other functions, apart from the coagulation of blood. The predominance in phylogenetically older brain regions would suggest that it represents a primitive or fundamental feature.
632378	The association and commissural fiber systems arising in the olfactory cortical areas caudal to the olfactory peduncle (the piriform cortex, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, periamygdaloid cortex and entorhinal cortex) have been studied utilizing horseradish peroxidase as both an anterograde and a retrograde axonal tracer. In the piriform cortex two sublaminae within layer II (IIa and IIb) layer III have been found to give rise to distinctly different projections. Retrograde cell labeling experiments indicate that the association fiber projection from layer IIb is predominatnly caudally directed, while the projection from layer III is predominantly rostrally directed. Cells in layer IIa project heavily to areas both caudal and rostral to the piriform cortex. The commissural fibers from the piriform cortex are largely restricted in their origin to layer IIb of the anterior part of the piriform cortex and in their termination on the contralteral side to the posterior part of the piriform cortex and adjacent olfactory cortical areas. A projection to the olfactory bulb has also been found to arise from cells in layers IIb and III of the ipsilateral piriform cortex, but not in layer IIa. In addition to those from the piriform cortex, association projections have also been found from other olfactory cortical areas. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract has a heavy bilateral projection to the medial part of the anterior piriform cortex and the lateral part of the olfactory tubercle (as well as a lighter projection  to the olfactory bulb); both the anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala and the periamygdaloid cortex project ipsilaterally to several olfactory cortical areas. The entorhinal cortex has been found to project to the medial parts of the olfactory tubercle and the olfactory peduncle. The olfactory tubercle is the only olfactory cortical area from which no association fiber systems (instrinsic or extrinsic) have been found to originate. A broad topographic organization exists in the distribution of the fibers from several of the olfactory areas. This is most obvious in the anterior part of the olfactory cortex, in which fibers from the more rostral areas (the anterior olfactory nucleus and the anterior piriform cortex) terminate in regions near the lateral olfactory tract, while those from more caudal areas (the posterior piriform cortex and the entorhinal cortex) terminate in areas further removed, both laterally and medially, from the tract. Projection to olfactory areas from the hypothalamus, thalamus, diagonal band, and biogenic amine cell groups have been briefly described.
641221	Techniques of intra-axonal transport were utlizied to elucidate the organization of diencephalic and midbrain projections to the inferior olivary nucleus of the Virginia opossum. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into the olive suggests that terminals within it arise from the subparafascicular nucleus of the caudal thalamus, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, the fields of Forel, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the periaqueductal grey, the caudal pretectal nucleus, the tegmentum dorsomedial to the red nucleus, the red nucleus (minimal), the nucleus linearis, as well as the dorsolateral midbrain tegmentum and tectum (Henkel et al., '75). Tritiated leucine injections were made into each of the above-mentioned cell groups so that the olivary terminals of their axons could be demonstrated autoradiographically. In general, the projection systems show three basic patterns of organization. Ventromedial areas of the midbrain, including the ventral periaqueductal grey, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, part of the red nucleus and the tegmentum dorso-medial to it, provide a substantial and topographically organized projection to the principal nucleus of the olive, as well as minor inputs to the accessory nuclei. Secondly, neurons within the subparafascicular nucleus, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and the fields of Forel project most heavily to parts of the medial accessory nucleus, although they also provide input to the other major subdivisions of the olive. Third, axons from the dorsolateral tegmentum and tectum completely avoid the principal nucleus, while supplying small regions of the accessory nuclei.
679038	Ascending projections from the caudal (general-visceroceptive) part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were studied experimentally in the rat by the aid of the anterograde autoradiographic and the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer techniques. Microelectrophoretic deposits of tritiated proline and leucine which involved the caudal part of the NTS, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dmX), and portions of the hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus intercalatus and/or nucleus gracilis were found to label ascending fibers that, besides going to numerous brain stem territories that included prominently the parabrachial area, could also be traced to serveral forebrain structures, namely, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the paraventricular (PA), dorsomedial (HDM) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of the hypothalamus, the central nucleus of the amygdaloid complex (AC), the medial preoptic area (PM) and the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus (TPV). Smaller isotope injections almost completely confined to the NTS and dmX resulted in lighter labeling of a similar set of parabrachial and forebrain projections, whereas in another case, in which the deposit was almost exclusively limited to the nucleus gracilis, no label was seen in the aforementioned structures. In another series of experiments, aimed at further localizing the neurons of origin of the prosencephalic projections under consideration, small microelectrophoretic HRP injections confined almost totally to BST, PA, HDM, AC, PM or TPV, as well as both small and large injections involving ARC, resulted in labeled neurons situated in the dorsal medullary region, mainly in the medial portion of the NTS at the level of and caudal to the area postrema. Taken together, these observations indicate for the first time the existence of relatively direct conduction lines by which interoceptive information might be conveyed to limbic forebrain structures; some of the possible physiological correlates of these anatomical findings are discussed.
690266	The afferent connections of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs in the rat were examined by injecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into one or the other of these structures either by microelectrophoresis or by hydraulic pressure. Alternate sections were stained with newly developed HRP-procedures using either benzidine dihydrochloride (de Olmos and Heimer, '77) or tetramethyl-benzidine. Eighteen to twenty-four hours after unilateral HRP injections confined to the main olfactory bulb, a large number of HRP-labeled perikaria appeared in the following telencephalic structures on the ipsilateral side: All portions of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) except its external part, the lateral transitional field (LT) between AON and the paleocortex, the whole extent of the primary olfactory cortex (POC); the medial forebrain bundle area deep to the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (NHDB) and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT). A moderate to small number of labeled cells, furthermore, were seen in the dorsal (DT) and medial (MT) transition fields, the ventral praecommissural hippocampus (tt2), the ventral superficial part of the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band (NVDB), the sublenticular part of the substantia innominata (SI), the anterior amygdaloid area, the posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus (C2) and the transition region (28 L') between the olfactory cortex and the lateral entorhinal area proper. On the contralateral side a large number of labeled cells were found in all parts of the AON, with especially heavy labeling in its external part. A moderate number of labeled cells could also be detected in the lateral transition  field (LT) and the NLOT. In the diencephalon and the brain stem a moderate number of HRP-labeled perikaria were observed in the dorsal, perifornical, and lateral hypothalamus, as well as in locus coeruleus and the dorsal and medial raphae nuclei. Following large HRP injections in the main olfactory bulb a moderate to small number of labeled cells were seen also in the posterior and premammillary hypothalamus and in field CA1 of the retrocommissural hippocampus on the ipsilateral side, as well as in POC on the contralateral side. It is possible, however, that the uptake of label took place in an undetected pool of HRP in the very rostal part of AON rather than in the olfactory bulb. HRP injections in the accessory olfactory bulb resulted in labeled neurons in the posterior ventro-lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, the rostrodorsal portions of the medial amygdaloid nucleus, and the whole extent of the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus (C3) on the ipsilateral side. A few lightly labeled cells were seen also in the contralateral C3.
719523	Patterns of alpha-bungarotoxin (alphaBuTX) binding within the brain of the rat have been studied following one of the two procedures: (1) the intraventricular injection of 125I-labeled toxin followed by a survival period of 1--8 days before aldehyde perfusion, or (2) the incubation of fresh cryostat sections of brain tissue in dilute solutions of radioactive toxin. Appropriate controls with nicotine, curare, atropine and native alphaBuTX established that specific nature of the binding. The principal observations were that toxin binding sites are predominantly associated with central areas of the brain in direct receipt of sensory inputs (the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, superior colliculus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, cochlear nuclei, the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord and spinal trigeminal nucleus, the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal, and the dorsal column nuclei) and with limbic areas of the brain (hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory tubercle, medial mammillary nucleus, and the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden). Toxin was not found to bind to cranial motor nuclei with the exception of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the nucleus ambiguus. The discrete distribution of clusters of silver grains within the granule layer of cerebellar folia I, IX, and X is described as well as the heavy labeling of the inferior and accessory olivary nuclei. In many areas of the brain silver grains were found to overlie cell bodies. It is suggested that this may reflect the presence of both membrane-bound toxin and internalized ligand following initial binding to a membrane receptor site. An attempt was made to correlate the localization of toxin binding sites with the terminal distributions of previously described cholinergic pathways. There appears to be a reasonably good agreement between the distribution of toxin receptors and proposed sites of cholinergic transmission within the hippocampus, interpeduncular nucleus and cerebellum. In most other cases however, lack of data precluded such correlations. The anatomical relationship of alphaBuTX binding activity and neurotransmitters other than acetylcholine is also considered.
818134	The structure and connectivity of the basal nucleus of Meynert, the substantia innominata in which it lies, and certain related areas have been examined in New World and Old World Monkeys, using retrograde and anterograde axonal transport methods. Experiments using the retrograde, horseradish peroxidase method confirm the observations of Kievet and Kuypers ('75) that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata project directly, heavily and with a somewhat crude topography upon the neocortex. Experiments involving the anterograde, autoradiographic method show that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata form part of a complex pathway that links them together with the lateral hypothalamus, certain parts of the amygdala and the peripeduncular nucleus of the midbrain. The peripeduncular nucleus is often regarded as a part of the central auditory pathway; it gives rise to a fiber bundle of considerable size that ascends on the dorsal surface of the ipsilateral optic tract and terminates ultimately in the lateral hypothalamic area of both sides. As well as distributing fibers to the basal nucleus, substantia innominata and lateral hypothalamus, this pathway provides a heavy projection to a cytoarchitectonically distinct posterior part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, the medial and intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and a less dense projection to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Certain parts of the hypothalamus and possibly the preoptic areas give rise to a complementary descending pathway that distributes fibers to the ipsilateral basal nucleus, substantia innominata and amygdala, and ends in the peripeduncular nuclei of both sides. Decussating fibers in both the ascending and descending pathways cross in the ventral supraoptic commissure. It is concluded that the basal nucleus should include most of the aggregated and unaggregated large cells that lie in the substantia innominata and which in places intrude upon the preoptic regions and the nucleus of the diagnonal band of Broca. Together, these may form a complex that receives inputs from a variety of brainstem sources, and projects widely and diffusely upon all cortical structures of the telencephalon.
819097	In order to test for the presence or absence of endogenous peroxidatic activities within the brains of normal squirrel monkeys, sections from the brain stems were incubated in buffered media of diaminobenzidine (DAB) and hydrogen peroxide, according to the methods of Graham and Karnovsky20 or Novikoff and Goldfischer39. It was found that neurons within certain regions were consistently stained by both mediamthese reactive neurons belong to the extrapyramidal motor system (globus pallidus, substantia nigra (pars diffusa), red nucleus, pontine and mesencephalic reticular formation), to certain cranial nerve nuclei (oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, mesencephalic trigeminal, vestibular) and to relay nuclei of the auditory pathway (superior olivary nucleus and nucleus of the trapezoid body). Neurons within other regions of the brain stem, such as thalamus, hypothalamus and corpus striatum were not stained. On the other hand, the neuropil, excluding the neurons, in other motor areas (such as the subthalamic nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus and corpus striatum) and other auditory relay nuclei (inferior colliculus, nucleus of lateral lemniscus) were also significantly stained. Processes around the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were particularly reactive. Under the electron microscope, reaction products were localized prominently along the cristae and limiting membranes of the mitochondria and within peroxisome-like bodies of the stained neurons. Non-reactive neurons have little or no reaction products in their organelles. The staining was absent when DAB was withheld, and it was weak or absent if H2O2 was omitted from the media. The addition of inhibitors of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol did not affect the staining intensity, whereas the addition of potassium cyanide, a strong inhibitor of metalloenzymes, especially heme-enzymes, almost completely abolished the reactions. In addition, a 3-day 'bleaching treatment' with 30% H2O2 did not affect the reactions. These results suggest that the reactivity in the above regions was due not to neuromelanin or other pigments, but rather to heme-enzymes and/or other hemoproteins. It was postulated that a higher concentration of the reactive agents was characteristic of certain neuronal types in the brain stem of the squirrel monkeys, and could be related to the cells' functional needs, energy requirements and perhaps to the metabolism of their specific neurotransmitters.
819466	The normal morphology of the rat preoptic region has been briefly described on the basis of Nissl- and silver-stained preparations and its efferent connections have been studied autoradiographically in over 50 rat brains with single small injections of 3H-proline, or various mixtures of 3H-proline, 3H-leucine, and 3H-lysine. Injections in the anteroventral part of the lateral preoptic area labeled fibers projecting through, and perhaps to, the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas and ending in the supramammillary region, and ventral fiber lamina of the mammillary complex; other labeled fibers ended in the periventricular hypothalamic gray and the internal lamina of the median eminence. The posteromedial lateral preoptic area projects to the same regions, as well as to the medial septal-diagonal band complex, and to the lateral habenula through the stria medullaris. Injections of the posterolateral lateral preoptic area labeled each of the above fiber systems as well as fibers to the main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus and taenia tecta. Other fibers coursed over the genu of the corpus callosum, through the stria terminalis and ansa peduncularis to the medial, cortical and basal amygdaloid nuclei and the anterior amygdaloid area, and through the medial forebrain bundle to the substantia nigra. The transition region between the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas at the level of the supraoptic nucleus has widespread connections as a whole (a) with the medial septal-diagonal band complex, lateral septum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, (b) through or to most of the hypothalamus, the substantia nigra, central tegmental field, central gray, superior central nucleus, and the locus coeruleus, (c) through the stria medullaris to the lateral habenula (bilaterally), parataenial, paraventricular, and mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, (d) through the stria terminalis and ansa peduncularis to the central, medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, and (e) to the main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, cingulate bundle, olfactory tubercle, medial septal-diagonal band complex and the lateral septum.
821589	Stereotaxic injections of [14C]leucine were made in nulei raphe centralis superior, raphe dorsalis, raphe magnus and raphe pontis of the cat. The organization of the regional connections was outlined in a stereotaxic atlas using the autoradiographic tracing method: the majority of the ascending pathways from the rostral raphe nuclei are directed mainly through a ventrolateral bundle via the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, with some lateral extensions to the substantia nigra, and then through the fields of Forel and the zona incerta. More rostrally the fibers are joined to the medial forebrain bundle through the hypothalamic region up to the preoptic area or the diagonal band of Broca. Multiple divisions leave this tract towards the epithalamic or the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the stria terminalis, the septum, the capsula interna and the ansa lenticularis. The bulk of the rostral projections terminates in the frontal lobe, while some labeling is scarcely distributed throughout the rest of the neocortex. The projections of nucleus (n.) raphe centralis superior are specifically associated with the n. interpeduncularis, the mammillary bodies and the hippocampal formation while the n. raphe dorsalis innervates selectively the lateral geniculate bodies, striatus, piriform lobes, olfactory bulb and amygdala. The rest of the ascending fibers form the centrolateral or the dorsal ascending tracts radiating either in the reticular mesencephalic formation or in the periventricular gray matter. On the contrary there are heavy descending projections from n. raphe centralis superior which distribute to the main nuclei of the brain stem, the central gray matter and the cerebellum. The ascending projections form the caudal raphe nuclei are much less dense. They disseminate mainly in the colliculus superior, the pretectum, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, the preoculomotor complex and the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. From n. raphe pontis, a dense labeling is selectively localized at the n. paraventricularis hypothalami with some rostral extensions to limbic areas. Diffuse caudal and rostral projections from both nuclei are observed in the mesencephalic, pontobulbar reticular formation and the cerebellum. The main differences come from the specific localization of their descending bulbospinal tracts inside the lateroventral funiculus of the spinal cervical cord.
821768	The projections from the cortical vocal fold area were studied in five squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) with the aid of the autoradiographic tracing technique. The location of the cortical vocal fold area was determined by exploring the exposed frontal cortex with roving electrodes while examining the larynx for vocal fold adduction. The following projections were found: To the orbital cortex (area 11), dorsomedial frontal cortex (areas 6 and 8), Broca's area (area 44), lower fronto-parietal cortex (areas 6, 4, 3 and 1), fronto-parietal operculum (area 50), insula (areas 14 and 13), caudatum, putamen, claustrum nucl. reticularis th., nucl. ventralis anterior, nucl. ventralis lateralis, nucl. ventralis posteromedialis, nucl. centralis inferior, nucl. centralis lateralis, nucl. medialis dorsalis, nucl. pulvinaris medialis, griseum pontis, nucl. parabrachialis medialis and lateralis, nucl. tr. spinalis n. trigemini and nucl. tr. solitarri. A comparison of the projection system with a previous mapping study for vocalization (Jürgens and Ploog, 1970) revealed that there are two areas yielding vocalization when electrically stimulated which receive direct projections from the cortical larynx area, namely, the cortex around the anterior sulcus cinguli and the parabrachial nuclei at the pons-midbrain transition. The possible relevance of these structures for vocalization is discussed.
821976	The laminar and cellular structure of retrosplenial cortex in the rhesus monkey was studied with Nissl stained and rapid Golgi impregnated tissue and the results were used to evaluate morphological features of a cortical transition zone. The granular layer of retrosplenial granular cortex is composed primarily of small, density packed, star pyramidal cells. These cells branch within the granular layer itself, while the apical dendrite enters layer I where it branches infrequently or not at all. This cell type is similar to the star pyramid first described by Lorente de No except in its areal and laminar distribution. Cytoarchitectonic observations of retrosplenial agranular cortex show, that, although this area is relatively "agranular" in comparison to other cortical areas, it does possess an incipient layer II and layer IV. These layers are composed mainly of small and medium sized pyramidal cells, but many non-pyramidal cell types were found in these and other layers in this area in rapid Golgi preparations. Stellate cells with beaded or smooth, lightly spinous dendrites were found throughout layer I-IV, while fusiform cells with smooth or very lightly spinous dendrites appear in layers III-VI. Areas surrounding retrosplenial cortex in the posterior cingulate region were also evaluated in Nissl and Golgi preparations including the indusium griseum, subiculum (dorsal to the corpus callosum) and area 23. The laminar and cellular constitutents of retrosplenial cortex were then evaluated in the context of cortical architectonic transition. The transition from one cellular layer in the indusium griseum to five cellular layers in area 23 is made by the addition of layers II, III, IV and VI in retrosplenial cortex to the one ganglionic layer of the indusium griseum and subiculum. Besides the addition and subdivision of layers in retrosplenial cortex, two aspects of cell morphology were found to change in this region. First, the structure of pyramidal cells progressively changes from those in the indusium griseum which have predominently round or oval somata and a preponderance of apical and few basal dendrites to those in layer V of retrosplenial cortex and area 23 which have pyramidal shaped somata and a great number of basal dendrites which branch frequently and spread horizontally for hundreds of microns. Second, there is a change in the number and distribution of non-pyramidal cell types. Evidence was not found that the indusium griseum, dorsal subiculum or layer V of retrosplenial granular cortex contain a significant number of stellate or fusiform cells. At the retrosplenial granular/agranular border, though, these cells gradually begin to constitute a greater proportion of the cell population and in area 23 form a major component of layer IV...
823181	The areal and laminar distribution of the cortical efferents of the medial, lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei (PM, PL and PI respectively) were determined in rhesus monkey using autoradiography and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP). The autoradiographic data indicated that: areas 8a, 45 and 46 on the convexity and 11 and 12 on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe received projections from PM; areas 20, 21 and 22 in temporal lobe received projections from PM primarily with caudal-medial parts of PM projecting to more rostral-dorsal parts of temporal lobe and rostral-lateral parts of PM projecting to more caudal-ventral parts of temporal lobe but PL also sends some efferents to caudal temporal lobe; areas 5 and 7 in parietal lobe and 18 and 19 in occipital lobe received projections primarily from the region in pulvinar comprising PL and PI with the more ventral parts of this region porsal parts of this region projecting to the more dorsal-lateral and medial parts of parieto-occipital cortex and with PM comtributing slightly to these projections rostrally. The autoradiographic information on the pulvinar projections to frontal lobe and temporal pole was supplemented by data derived from cortical HRP injections. These indicated that although only PM of the pulvinar subnuclei projected to these regions, three other caudal thalamic structures, i.e., medial dorsal nucleus, nucleus limitans and suprageniculate nucleus also projected to these regions raising some questions about the identity of the densocellular part of the medial dorsal nucleus which has also been considered to be part of pulvinar. The laminar distribution of pulvinar cortical efferents was uniformly similar regardless of the pulvinar recipient area examined. Elevated numbers of silver grains were observed over all cortical layers, but the silver grains were densest over the deep parts of layer III. The thalamic reticular nucleus was the only diencephalic structure observed to receive projections from pulvinar and it did so from PM, PL and PI. The pulvinar's efferents are to homotypical rather than heterotypical cortex and its connections are most extensive with cortex rather than with subcortical structures.
824152	In 38 squirrel monkeys 251 vocalization-producing electrode positions were tested for their positive and negative reinforcing properties. Two groups of vocalization-producing brain areas could be distinguished: One group in which the electrically elicited vocalization was independent of the accompanying reinforcement effect, and a second group in which vocalization and reinforcement effect were correlated. The first group included the anterior cingulate gyrus, the adjacent supplementary motor area, gyrus rectus, ventromedial edge of the capsula interna, caudal periaqueductal gray and adjacent parabrachial region. The second group consited of the caudatum, septum, substantia innominata, amygdala, inferior thalamic peduncle, stria terminalis, midline thalamus, ventral and periventricular hypothalamus, substantia nigra, rostral periaqueductal gray, dorsolateral midbrain tegmentum and lateral medulla. It is hypothesized that the first group contains predominantly or exclusively "primary" vocalization substrates; the second group is thought to be composed mainly of structures whose stimulation yields vocalization secondarily due to stimulus induced motivational changes.
825423	In 12 rhesus monkeys the injection of alumina cream into the temporal cortex, amygdala or hippocampus induced seizures after a latent period of six weeks to three months. Clinically the attacks are characterized by an arrest of movement, staring, unresponsiveness to most stimuli, wandering conjugate eye movements, automatisms, twitching of the contraleteral ear and less commonly commonly vocalization, chewing, hiccoughing, vomiting, adversive head movements and twitching of the face. The spiking from the amygdala and hippocampus, which usually fire together, propagates to the temporal cortex and multiple subcortical structures including the hypothalamus, anterior perforated space, anteromedial thalamus, cingulate gyrus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamus and mesencephalic reticular formation; from the temporal cortex to the amygdala and hippocampus, and secondarily to the diencephalic centers. There is a fairly consistent sequence of preferential propagation. Although there are some differences in the occurrences of clinical manifestations depending upon the sites of the focus, no specific structural correlation with clinical manifestations could be established. This experimental condition may provide a proper model for the study of clinical psychomotor epilipsy.
830673	Nucleus cuneatus projections to nucleus ventralis posterolarteralis pars medialis (VPLm) and other thalamic as well as midbrain and medullary nuclei were studied in cats using the Fink-Heimer I silver technique. Single electrolytic lesions of very small size were made stereotaxically in different zones of nucleus cuneatus under electrophysiological control. All zones studied projected to contralateral VPLm in a pattern of discrete terminal arborizations or clusters, which were organized in onionskin-like dorso-ventral laminae. The clusters of degeneration varied in size and density according to their dorsoventral location within VPLm. Those in dorsal areas were smaller in diameter (50-125 mu) and contained less dense amounts of degeneration than clusters (150-300 mu) in more ventral regions. The clustered terminal arborizations mirrored the organization of the VPLm neuronal clusters, themselves. Terminations within VPLm were topographically organized, but were completely inverted, i.e. dorsal nucleus cuneatus projected to ventral VPLm and ventral to dorsal, lateral to medial, and medial to lateral VPLm. A ventral zone of nucleus cuneatus, which contained "deep" units, projected to a separate dorsal zone of VPLm. In addition to its classical connection with VPLm, nucleus cuneatus projected to the following contralateral brainstem or thalamic nuclei: medial and dorsal accessory olives, external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, ventrolateral part of the superior colliculus, nucleus ruber, medial geniculate nucleus pars magnocellularis, suprageniculatus, medial and lateral divisions of the posterior thalamic nuclear group, zona incerta, and Fields of Forel. Very sparse amounts of degeneration were also present within nuclei ventralis posteromedialis (caudal pole) and ventralis posterolateralis pars lateralis. The brain-stem and thalamic projections of the dorsocaudal part (cell nest region) of the cuneate nucleus were more restricted than those of its rostral and ventral regions. The clusters of both the VPLm neurons and cuneate terminations within VPLm provides an anatomical basis for the functional characteristics of synaptic security, fine grain somatotopia and modality specificity so prominent in the dorsal column nuclei-medial lemniscal system.
838895	Projections are described from the basolateral, lateral and anterior cortical nuclei of the amygdaloid complex, and from the prepiriform cortex, to several discrete areas of the cerebral cortex in the rat and cat and to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in the rat. These projections are very well-defined in their origin, and in their area of laminar pattern of termination. The basolateral amygdaloid nucleus can be divided into anterior and posterior divisions, based on cytoarchitectonic and connectional distinctions. In both the rat and cat the posterior division projects to the prelimbic area (area 32) and the infralimbic area (area 25) on the medical surface of the hemisphere. The anterior division projects more lightly to these areas, but also sends fibers to the dorsal and posterior agranular insular areas and the perirhinal area on the lateral surface. Furthermore, in the cat the perirhinal area is divided into two areas (areas 35 and 36) and the anterior division projects to both of these and also to a ventral part of the granular insular area; this last area is adjacent to, but separate from the auditory insular area and the second cortical taste area. In most of these areas, the fibers from the basolateral nucleus terminate predominantly in two bands: one in the deep part of layer I and layer II, and a heavier band in layer V (in the rat) or layers V and VI (in the cat). The lateral amygdaloid nucleus projects heavily to the perirhinal area, and also to the posterior agranular insular area. These fibers terminate predominantly in the middle layers of the cortex, although the cellular lamination in these two areas is relatively indistinct. The anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus and the prepiriform cortex both project to the infralimbic area and the ventral agranular insular area, and the anterior cortical nucleus also projects to the posterior agranular area and the perirhinal area. In all of these areas, the fibers from these olfactory-related structures terminate in the middle of layer I. In the rat, the two divisions of the basolateral nucleus also project to the medial segment of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, with the anterior division projecting mainly to the posterior part of this segment and the posterior division to the anterior part. The endopiriform nucleus, deep to the prepiriform cortex, projects to the central segment of the mediodorsal nucleus; this may constitute the major olfactory input into the mediodorsal nucleus, since little or no projection could be demonstrated from the prepiriform cortex itself. Projections to the mediodorsal nucleus have not been found in the cat.
890482	The purpose of the present study was to determine if the administration of testosterone propionate (TP) to neonatal rats is followed in vivo by alterations in the transport of the non-metabolizable amino acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid  (AIB), into specific regions of the brain. Forty-eigh hours after birth, male and female rats were injected s.c. with either 1,25 mg TP or an equivalent volume of vehicle. Five, 10 and 17 days after birth, control and TP-treated rats were decapitated at intervals of 2, 5, 60 and 300 min after the i.p. injection of 0.25 muCi [1-14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid/g body weight. Twelve brain regions, i.e., amygdala, cerebellum, corpora quadrigemina, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, medulla, occipital cortex, olfactory bulbs, olfactory tubercles, parietal cortex, pons, pyriform cortex and samples of serum were analyzed in terms of disint./min/mg tissue and as tissue/serum (T/S) ratios. At the end of 300 min there was a significant increase in the active transport of AIB in all brain regions of the 5-days-old TP-treated rats. Similarly, by 300 min, the active transport of AIB was significantly increased in all brain regions sxcept cerebellum and pons of the 10-day-old TP-treated rats. The administration of TP to neonatal rats did not alter the accumulation and/or active transport of AIB in brain regions of the 17-day-old rat at any of the tested intervals. These data indicate that (1) neonatally administered TP enhanced (either directly or indirectly) the transport and/or accumuation of AIB in specific brain regions of 5- and 10-day-old rats and (2) the effectiveness of the steroid decreased with the age of the rat.
922504	Using a retrograde tracer technique with protein horseradish peroxidase (HRP), attempts were made to determine afferent projections to the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD). As a control, the injection of the HRP was also made into one of the following structures adjacent to the NRD: (1) mesencephalic periaque ductal gray; (2) nucleus linearis intermedius; and (3) third cranial nucleus. The present results indicate that the NRD, particularly is rostral part, receives direct projections arising from: (1) locus coeruleus complex (locus coeruleus, locus coerulus alpha, and locus subcoeruleus); (2) parabrachial nuclei (nucleus parabrachialis lateralis and medialis); (3) nucleus laterodorsalis tegmenti; (4) griseum centrale pontis, particularly the caudal part of the nucleus incertus; (5) substantia nigra; (6) lateral habenular nucleus; (7) hypothalamic areas, particularly dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas; (8) preoptic areas; (9) anarea dorso-lateral to the inferior olivary complex and medial to the lateral reticular nucleus; and (10) raphe nuclei; particularly nucleus linearis intermedius, centralis superior, pontis and magnus. The present findings thus confirm some previous reports on the afferent projections to the NRD described in the cat and rat, and further indicate the richness of afferent connections of the NRD. Some problems of the peroxidase technique have also been discussed.
939821	A topographic mapping of dopamine (DA)-containing neurons and fibers was done mainly in the mesencephalon of the dog using the fluorescent histochemical technique of Falck and Hillarp. The extensive DA neuron system was found to be located in the ventral and medial regions of the mesencephalon; the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, the area almost corresponding to the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (which consists of three groups, a caudal, the nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus, a ventral, the nucleus paranigralis and a rostral, the caudal part of the nucleus tegmentalis ventralis of Tsai), the nucleus linearis of the raphe, and the mesencephalic reticular formation. The nigro-neostriatal projection can be traced in the non-treated or nialamide plus L-dopa treated puppies without the lesion-degeneration technique. Most fibers arising from these DA cell groups assemble at the prerubral area and ascend just dorsal to the medial forebrain bundle. Most fibers turn laterally at the lateral hypothalamus and enter the neostriatum via the dorsal part of the subthalamic nucleus, the zona incerta and the capsula interna. These findings show that the distribution of DA neurons and the nigro-neostriatal pathway are fundamentally similar to those in other mammals. In this study, the processes of the nigral and paranigral DA neurons have been demonstrated to project into the pars reticulata in the dog.
961335	Mast cells, which had until recently been believed to be not present in the mammalian brain, were studied in the brains of 29 mammalian species. Although there was considerable intraspecific and interspecific variation, mast cells were most numerous within the leptomeninges (especially in those overlying the cerebrum and the dorsal thalamus - most rodents, most carnivores, chimpanzees, squirrel monkeys and elephant), the cerebral cortex (most rodents, tiger, fox, chimpanzee, tarsier, and elephant) and in many nuclei of the dorsal thalamus (most rodents, tiger, lion, and fox). In some mammals, mast cells were also numerous in the stroma of the telencephalic choroid plexuses (chimpanzee, squirrel monkey), the putamen and the claustrum (chimpanzee), the subfornical organ (pack rat, tiger, chimpanzee), the olfactory peduncles (hooded rat, albino rat), the stroma of the diencephalic choroid plexus (lion, chimpanzee, squirrel monkey), the pineal organ (chimpanzee, squirrel monkey), some nuclei of the hypothalamus (tiger), the infundibulum (hooded rat, tiger, fox) the area postrema (pack rat, chinchilla, lion, spider monkey, chimpanzee, fox) and some nuclei and tracts of the metencephalon and the myelencephalon (tiger). Neither the sex of the animal nor electrolytic lesions made in the brains of some of the animals at various times prior to sacrifice appeared to effect the number and the distribution of mast cells. Age-related changes in mast cell number and distribution were detected in the albino rat.
991939	Acetylcholine (ACh) levels were determined in the brain of rats killed by decapitation or focussed microwave radiation during drug-induced convulsions. During metrazol or strychnine-induced convulsions a diffuse decrease in ACh levels was found in rats killed by decapitation. When the rats were killed by radiation and the brain was only divided into three large regions, strychnine caused no changes in ACh levels; metrazol caused a decrease in the cerebral cortex and lower brainstem. When discrete brain regions were investigated in rats killed by radiation, metrazol-induced convulsions were associated with a decrease in ACh level in all regions dissected and strychnine-induced convulsions with a decrease in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus only. Picrotoxin-induced convulsions were associated with a decrease in ACh level in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and medulla-pons, those induced by bicuculline with an increase in ACh level in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and medulla-pons, by dimefline with an increase in the frontal cortex, midbrain and medulla-pons and a decrease in the caudate nucleus. The experiments show that each type of convulsant affects ACh levels in discrete brain regions in a different way.
1100685	A sensitive immunofluorescence technique was used to describe systematically the distrubution of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)-containing cell bodies, non-terminal fiber pathways, and terminal fields in the brain of the male albino rat. DBH is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline, and as such is useful as an anatomical marker for noradrenaline and possibly adrenaline neurons. The enzyme is not present in dopamine- or indolamine-containing neurons. Ten micron frozen sections (1-in 20 series) were prepared in the frontal, sagittal, and horizontal planes from the olfactory bulb to the upper cervical segments of the spinal cord; adjacent sections in each plane were stained for DBH and for cells (toluidine blue=azure II). An atlas consisting of 40 projection drawings of selected frontal sections illustrates the results of the investigation. DBH perikarya are confined to three groups in the pons and medulla: the well defined locus coeruleus, a more diffuse but continuous subcoeruleus group that arches through the pons and ventral medulla, and a third dorsal medullary group centered in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. A single principal adrenergic fiber system distributes a great many of the axons from these neuron groups to a majority of nuclear areas in the brain. In the pons and medulla two components of the fiber system may be distinguished. A medullary branch may be followed from the posterior aspect of the subcoeruleus group dorsally and then anteriorly through the lateral tegmental field and ventral aspect of the vestibular complex to a position subjacent to the locus coeruleus, where it is joined by a subcoeruleus branch consisting of a large number of fibers coursing among cells along the length of the subcoeruleus group, and by fibers arising from the locus coeruleus. Anterior to the locus coeruleus the principal adrenergic bundle courses as a single fiber tract immediately ventrolateral to the central gray in the mesencephalon and in the zona incerta and substantia innominata in the diencephalon. At the level of the septal area separate bundles reach the cortex dorsally over the genu of the corpus calosum via the medial septal-diagonal band nuclei and the lateral septum and ventrally between the olfactory tubercle and caudate-putamen. In the medulla and pons adrenergic fibers undoubtedly course in both directions. Anterior to the most rostral pontine cell bodies, however, all fibers presumably ascend. Along the course of the bundle distinct branches emerge to innervate circumscribed terminal fields. In addition, certain regions of the brain such as the reticular formation and pontine gray receive diffuse DBH innervation derived from less clearly defined pathways. A small number of areas in the brain contain little or no detectable DBH. These include the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, olfactory tubercle, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, pretectal area, third, fourth and sixth cranial verve nuclei, and the trapezoid body nucleus.
1112928	We studied and compared the ipsilateral efferents of the superficial and deep layers of the superior colliculus of the rhesus monkey. Using a stereotaxic method, microelectrodes were inserted through the contralateral hemisphere in order to make electrolytic lesions of the superior colliculus. Large lesions involved all layers of the superior colliculus, while smaller lesions involved either the superficial or the deep layers of the superior colliculus. Following various survival times, the brains were prepared with the Fink-Heimer technique ('67). Following lesions of the superficial layers of the superior colliculus, definite degenerated axonal endings were found in the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei, inferior pulvinar, centrointermediate nucleus, magnocellular dorsomedial nucleus, anterior pretectal nucleus and pretectal region. Sparse degenerated axonal endings were found in the limitans nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus and some intralaminar nuclei following lesions of the superficial layers in the rostral portion of the superior colliculus. Following lesions of the deep layers of the superior colliculus, degenerated axonal endings were found in the central gray, magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus, suprageniculate nucleus, limitans nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus, medial and oral pulvinar, nucleus of the accessory optic tract, zona incerta, subdivisions of the ventral lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, ventral posterior inferior nucleus, denosocellular and multiform dorsomedial nuclei, all intralaminar nuclei, inferior colliculus, parabigeminal nucleus, olivary nucleus, reunions nucleus, Forel's Field H and an undefined midbrain nucleus. In general the projections were topographically organized in that the caudal portion of the superior colliculus projected to the rostral portions of thalamic nuclei and the rostral portion of the superior colliculus projected to the caudal portions of thalamic nuclei. All the degeneration patterns seen after lesions of the superficial and deep layers were accounted for by large lesions which involved all layers of the superior colliculus. It is concluded that the superficial and deep layers of the rehesus monkey superior colliculus have different ascending projections. The finding, are related to the organization of visual and multimodal thalamocortical systems in primates and other mammals.
1113069	Acute brain stimulation experiments were carried out in anesthetized male green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Semen discharge was evoked consistently by low level electrical stimulation (100 muA or less) in the following areas: the preoptic region, dorsal hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain tegmentum and the basolateral midbrain and medulla. Areas which were stimulated repeatedly at 100 muA and were always negative for sperm release included: the telencephalon with the exception of the preoptic region, the optic tectum, the cerebellum, the inferior lobe of the hypothalamus, the nucleus rotundus and the dorsal medulla. Removal of most of the optic tectum and cerebellum failed to block reponses evoked from the preoptic area; however, they were usually eliminated by transecting the rostral spinal cord. Electrical stimulation of an isolated 4 mm segment of spinal cord located at the third vertebral level resulted in sperm release, indicating that adequate mechanisms for semen discharge are present within the upper spinal cord. The results of this study suggest that a sperm release system in the green sunfish extends from the preoptic area to the spinal cord passing through the hypothalamus, midbrain tegmentum and basal midbrain and medulla.
1148868	The brain distribution and metabolism of progesterone were studied in female, rhesus monkeys. Adult monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine and were given a constant infusion of [3H]- or [14C] progesterone. Blood samples were obtained from cannulae inserted into the carotid artery, the jugular vein and lateral (transverse) sinus. The metabolic clearance rate of progesterone was 295 +/- 49 (S.E.) 1/day. The head extraction of progesterone was 30.4 +/- 8.3% (S.E.) and the brain extraction 26.0 +/- 9.18% (S.E.). The peripheral conversion ratios of progesterone to 20alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one (20alpha-OHP) and 5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione (5alpha-DHP) were 10.0 +/- 1.3% (S.E.) and 2.4 +/- 0.3% (S.E.), respectively. These same conversion ratios for across the head were 4.8 +/- 1.0% (S.E.) and 1.5 +/- 0.6% (S.E.) and for across the brain 5.0 +/- 0.7% (S.E.) and 2.2 +/- 0.6% (S.E.). The concentration of radioactive progesterone was 2-5 times higher in brain tissues compared to the carotid arterial blood. The tissue concentrations of radioactive progesterone compared to a cerebrum 'control' sample: was lower in the central gray (P less than 0.05); were the same for the amygdala, hippocampus, preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and anterior pituitary; and were higher in the cervical spinal cord, optic chiasm, mesencephalon, medulla oblongata and pons (P less than 0.1). The distribution pattern of 20alpha-OHP formed from progesterone was similar to that of progesterone. 5alpha-DHP formed from progesterone had a different distribution than progesterone, being highest in the central gray area. High concentrations of 5alpha-DHP were also observed in the mesencephalon, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus and low values in the anterior pituitary. Infusions of [3H]20alpha-OHP and [3H]5alpha-DHP were used to evaluate the in vivo metabolism of progesterone by different brain areas. [3H]Estradiol infused into one monkey had its highest concentration in the anterior pituitary which was 20 times higher than in the carotid arterial blood.
1174957	The projections from the lateral geniculate body of the rat were followed using the technique of autoradiography after injections of [3H] proline into the dorsal and/or ventral nuclei of this diencephalic structure. Autoradiographs were prepared from either frozen or paraffin coronal sections through the rat brain. The dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate projected via the optic radiation to area 17 of the cerebral cortex. There was also a slight extension of label into the zones of transition between areas 17, 18 and 18a. The distribution of silver grains in the various layers of the cerebral cortex was analyzed quantitatively and showed a major peak of labeling in layer IV with minor peaks in outer layer I and the upper half and lowest part of layer VI. The significance of these peaks is discussed in respect to the distribution of geniculocortical terminals in other mammalian species. The ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body had 5 major projections to brain stem structures both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injected nucleus. There were two dorsomedial projections: (1) a projection to the superior colliculus which terminated mainly in the medial third of the stratum opticum, and (2) a large projection via the superior thalamic radiation which terminated in the ipsilateral pretectal area; a continuation of this projection passed through the posterior commissure to attain the contralateral pretectal area. The three ventromedial projections involved: (1) a geniculopontine tract which coursed through the basis pedunculi and the lateral lemniscus to terminate in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral parts of the pons after giving terminals to the lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, (2) a projection via Meynert's commissure to the suprachiasmatic nuclei of both sides of the brain stem as well as to the contralateral ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, and (3) a medial projection to the ipsilateral zona incerta. The results obtained in these experiments are contrasted with other data on the rat's central visual connections to illustrate the importance of these connections in many subcortical visual functions.
1176643	The efferent connections of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs in the female albino rabbit have been studied using the autoradiographic method for tracing axonal pathways. Following unilateral injections of 3H-proline or 3H-leucine into the main olfactory bulb, radioactively labeled material transported intraaxonally by axoplasmic flow in an anterograde direction from soma to axon terminal is present ipsilaterally in the superficial half of the plexiform layer (IA) of: the entire circumference of the olfactory peduncle, the tenia tecta, the full mediolateral extent of the olfactory tubercle, the entire length of the prepyriform cortex, a transition area between the prepyriform cortex and the horizontal limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the anterior cortical and posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nuclei (periamygdaloid areas 1, rostral half of 2, 5 of Rose, '31), and the ventrolateral entorhinal cortex (entorhinal areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 of Rose, '31). No subcortical or contralateral projection of main bulb efferents was found. After a unilateral injection of 3H-leucine into the accessory olfactory bulb, transported material could be followed caudally along the dorsal surface of the ipsilateral lateral olfactory tract. This heavily labeled projection is distinct from the unlabeled lateral olfactory tract and has been termed the accessory olfactory tract. Beginning at the level of the caudal third of the olfactory tubercle and extending caudally to the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is a group of small neurons intimately associated with the accessory olfactory tract. This cell group is referred to as the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract. Projection sites of the accessory bulb include the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract and layer IA of the medial nucleus and the posteromedial cortical nucleus of the amygdala (periamygdaloid areas 3, 4, PAM, caudal half of 2, 6 of Rose, '31). An additional accessory bulb efferent projection was found to enter the stria terminalis at the level of the medial amygdaloid nucleus and could be traced to a posterior segment of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The autoradiographic findings indicate that the accessory olfactory bulb connects with portions of the amygdala that do not receive afferent input from the main olfactory bulb and provide evidence for the existence of two distinct and separate olfactory systems.
1200387	Following coagulation of either the substantia nigra or the caudate nucleus and fundus caudati of the cat, the distribution of degenerating terminals in the sections of the striatum has been determined especially in the fundus caudati on one side and in the various cell groups of the substantia nigra compacta on the other side; and the types of synapses have been described. There are reverberating circuits between the fundus caudati and the medial groups of the nigra characterized by their small cells, between the putamen and the postero-lateral cell groups of the nigra, between the caudatum and the rostral cell groups of the nigra, presumably with the specialization that the lateral caudatum is in two-way connection with the rostro-lateral cell groups of the nigra as is the medial caudatum with the rostro-medial cell group. The transmitter for the striatofugal terminals in the nigra which have pleomorphic synapses is probably GABA. Dopamine is the transmitter of the axo-spinous synapses of the nigrostriatal neurons with the small striatal nerve cells for which the transmitter seems to be Acetylcholine. The nigro-striatal reverberating circuits have three outputs available; 1. from parts of the striatum to the entopeduncular nucleus (internal segment of pallidum) and from there through the H2 and H1 fields of Forel to the oral ventral nucleus of the thalamus (V.o.a) which directly projects to the area 6 a alpha of motor cortex; 2. also from parts of the striatum to the pallidum (outer segment) and continuing through the descending pallido-reticulospinal pathway and 3. from the postero-lateral cell groups of the nigra probably through descending fibers which cross the midline in the commissura colliculi superioris and extend through the reticular formation directly or indirectly to the spinal cord.
1206126	The efferent connections of the anterior olfactory nucleus in the female albino rabbit have been studied using the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase methods for tracing axonal pathways. Following a unilateral injection of 3H-leucine into the olfactory peduncle, radioactively labeled efferent projections from the anterior olfactory nucleus were traced into all layers of the ipsilateral main olfactory bulb beneath the olfactory nerve layer and through the ipsilateral anterior limb of the anterior commissure and plexiform layer of the medial side of the cerebral hemisphere to the deep half of the plexiform (IB) and pyramidal cell (II) layers of the prepyriform cortex, the tenia tecta, and the entire surface of the olfactory tubercle. Labeled projections crossing the midline within the anterior commissure were followed to the layers IB and II of the contralateral anterior prepyriform cortex and pars externa, pars lateralis, and pars dorsalis of the anterior olfactory nucleus, and through the periventricular layer of the olfactory peduncle to all layers of the main olfactory bulb beneath the olfactory nerve layer. No well-defined labeled projection was traced to the contralateral accessory olfactory bulb. Evidence for possible anterior olfactory nucleus and/or prepyriform cortical projections to the ipsilateral paleocortical half of the claustrum, horizontal limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band, the posterior lateral hypothalamus at the level of the mammillary complex, and to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is discussed. Intra-axonal retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase from axon terminals to parent cell bodies after unilateral injection of the protein into the main olfactory bulb or anterior olfactory nucleus revealed that anterior olfactory nucleus projections to the olfactory bulbs and the contralateral anterior olfactory nucleus arise predominately from the pars externa. The autoradiographic data indicate that the anterior olfactory nucleus projects to olfactory cortical structures which also receive afferent input from the olfactory bulb and that the termination of these projections is complementary to those from the olfactory bulb.
1224002	Norepinephrine (NE) and Dopamine (DA) were measured in 30 brain areas of depressive suicides and alcoholic suicides and in controls who had died of natural causes, in an effort to test directly the "catecholamine hypothesis" of depressive illness. Levels of NE were highest in the hypothalamus, tegmentum of pons, red nucleus and mesencephalic tegmentum; lowest in centrum semi-ovale, hippocampus and cingulate gyrus. Highest values for DA were found in the putamen, head of caudate, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, red nucleus and a few areas of the hypothalamus; lowest in cerebral cortex, ventral pons and thalamus. Our data showing a slight increase in NE levels in four areas of the suicide brains is probably of little clinical importance. In no case were the NE or DA levels in the suicide brains significantly less than in the controls. Alteration of monoamine metabolism as an etiologic factor in depressive illness remains a possibility if the mechanism involves blocking of the uptake of amines into neurons or changes in membrane permeability. It is unlikely that an alteration of amine metabolism per se is involved, since four selected metabolizing enzymes previously studied showed no difference in activity and the present study shows no depletion of amines.
1232091	The intraspecific allometric relation between brain weight and body weight of wild Norway rats and laboratory rats was gained from sufficient material. The intraspecific allometry exponent a=0.25, being typical for mammals, also came out as a result for Norway and laboratory rats. But laboratory rats have 8.3% less brain substance at a comparable body weight. This decrease in brain size was interpreted as an adaption to the specific conditions of domestication and discussed accordingly. Futhermore the fresh volumes of the fundamental brain parts telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, neocortex, corpus striatum and allocortex were ascertained by means of serial sections of 8 Norway and 8 laboratory rats, and they were compared with each other by their average brain proporationing. Consequently, differently strong reduction intensities in the sizes of these brain parts from 1.6% (medulla oblongata) to 12.5% (neocortex) became evident. The high reduction values of corpus striatum (10.9%) and cerebellum (10.3%) were especially remarkable. They almost reached the same degree as the forebrain (10.6%). The size reduction of the measured brain parts of rats, caused by domestication were compared with the results of other domestic mammals and discussed accordingly.
1235007	A case of Seitelberger's infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (a rare familial neurologic disease of childhood) is described. The clinical picture is characterized by a progressive deterioration of psychomotor functions leading to flaccid paraplegia with hypotonia of axial muscles, complete involution of language, and total loss of communication with the external world; death due to recurrent unassociated disease occurred at the age of 4 years. Histology showed numerous axonal spheroids mainly in the gray matter of the C.N.S. and plurisystemic degenerations of the motor and sensory systems, of the cerebellum, of the basal ganglia, and of specific sensory system such as the optic and (reported here for the first time) of the olfactory and acoustic systems. In particular, the main histopathological findings included: 1) a characteristic distribution of axonal swellings prevailing in the posterior horn of the spinal cord and in the dorsolateral portions of the medulla oblongata, mainly at the level of the sensory nuclei; 2) demyelinization of the pyramidal tracts and of the ascendings pathways of the sensory system with fibrillar gliosis and myelin breakdown products in some areas (internal capsule, pes pedunculi, VPL thalamic nuclei); 3) severe cerebellar atrophy with almost complete loss of granule and Purkinje cells and marked fibrillary gliosis; 4) presence of enormous amount of sudanophilic lipids in the striatum and pallidum; 5) optic, acoustic and olfactory system degeneration with demyelinization and gliosis at all levels examined and, in particular, sudanophilic lipid deposition in the optic radiations, trigone, and olfactory striae. The discussion emphasized the dying-back type of evolution of the degenerative process insofar as a) the spheroids represent a peculiar alteration of presynaptic endings (as demonstrated by electron microscopy) prevailing at the first sensory neuron, and b) in all systems involved, the degeneration is most marked at distal levels. The striato-pallidal lipophanerosis suggests that the sudanophilic lipids are, here as in other systems, parenchymal degeneration products. On the other hand, there are still many unresolved problems in this rare and complex disease, such as a) the predilection of the lesions for the sensory systems which in our case involved all three special senses; b) the extreme cerebellar atrophy; and c) the etiopathogenetic substrate of the process. All biochemical and histochemical studies have not yielded any results up to the present.
1262541	Using the autoradiographic method in the zebra finch (poephila guttata), areas of the brain were identified which contain cells which accumulate testosterone. Among these areas are the caudal nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale, nucleus intercollicularis of the midbrain, and the tracheosyringeal portion of the hypoglossal nucleus of the medulla (nXIIts). These three are known to control or influence androgen dependent song and other vocalizations of passeriform birds, and nXIIts is composed of the motoneurons innervating the vocal (syringeal) muscles. Other areas containing hormone-concentrating cells are the medial preoptic area, nucleus periventricularis magnocellularis of the hypothalamus, dorsal infundibular layers, dorsomedial thalamus, lateral septum, magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum, periventricular medial neostriatum, nucleus taeniae of the archistriatum, and ventral paleostriatum augmentatum. Accumulation by cells in the preoptic area, hypothalamus, and limbic forebrain is consistent with a general vertebrate pattern of distribution of brain cells which accumulate sex steroids. Some of these same areas may be involved in the control of androgen dependent events such as courtship, copulation, aggression, and feedback regulation of the hypophysis.
1265265	Previous descriptions of the course and anatomic relationships of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), as visualized in the lateral projection, have not been found by the authors. Dissection and radiography of 32 injected human cerebella show that AICA and its major branches define the position of the pontomedullary sulcus; supra-olivary fossette; 5th-11th cranial nerves; brachium pontis; flocculus; great horizontal fissure; posterolateral fissure; superior semilunar lobule; inferior semilunar lobule; biventral lobule; foramen of Luschka; and the choroid plexus of the lateral recess of the 4th ventricle. With magnification and high-quality subtraction, AICA and its associated structures may be identified in the lateral projection in the large majority of patients.
1270609	The projections of the locus coeruleus and adjacent pontine tegmentum have been studied using anatomical and physiological methods in the cat. Axonal trajectories were traced using either the Fink-Heimer I method following electrolytic lesions, or the autoradiographic method after injection of tritiated proline into the nucleus. Results with both methods were similar. Axons of locus noeruleus neurons ascended ipsilaterally through the mesencephalon lateral to the medial longitudinal fasiculus, ventrolateral to the central gray. In the caudal diencephalon, the ascending fibers entered the centrum medianum-parafascicular complex where they diverged into two fascicles: a dorsal fascicle which terminated in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, and a ventral fascicle which gave off fibers to the ventrobasal complex and reticular nucleus of the thalamus while continuing centrolaterally into the lateral hypothalamus medial to the internal capsule. Fibers of the ventral fascicle ascended in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta and were traced through the preoptic region into the septum. Fibers could not be consistently traced to the cerebral cortex, and were not seen at all in the cerebellum. Throughout the ascending course of the path from the locus coeruleus, axons were given off to the pretectal area, the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei and the amygdala; fibers passed contralaterally through the posterior commissure, the midline thalamus, and the supraoptic commissure. Fibers descending from the locus coeruleus surrounded the intramedullary portion of the facial nerve and further caudally were observed ventrolateral to the hypoglossal and dorsal vagal nuclei. The axonal trajectories visualized with degeneration and autoradiographic methods followed closely those previously shown for reticular formation neurons, but were also similar to locus coeruleus projections revealed by histofluorescence methods. After injections of horseradish peroxidase into the centrum medianum-parafascicular complex, lateral hypothalamus or preoptic region, labeled neurons were located in the locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, and lateral parabrachial nucleus. Reticular formation neurons were not labeled. Neurons in locus coeruleus and adjacent pontine tegmentum could be antidromically activated by stimulation in the rostral midbrain or caudal diencephalon. Our data indicate that both adrenergic and non-adrenergic neurons of the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum have similar projections.
1279454	The general goal of the present study was to investigate structural components of a neural system anatomically as well as functionally. The rat motor system, which is reasonably well understood, was selected and a new procedure was developed to combine a functional marker with axonal tracing methods (in the same animal). This was achieved by mapping c-fos induction immunocytochemically as a result of intracortical microstimulation in the distal forelimb area of the motor cortex. The anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin or biocytin were deposited at the site of intracortical microstimulation, the former three weeks and the latter two to three days before stimulation. Neuronal nuclei, labeled for the expressed c-fos protein, were present and mapped in the following structures: motor cortex; basal ganglia (caudate-putamen, globus pallidus); thalamus (reticular, ventromedial and posterior nuclei); subthalamic nucleus; substantia nigra; tectum; red nucleus; pontine nuclei; inferior olive; external cuneate nucleus; cerebellar cortex; deep cerebellar nuclei. Labeling was often bilateral but generally more substantial ipsilaterally, except in the cerebellum where it was mainly contralateral. Axonal labeling, including terminal branches and boutons, was also found in most of the above structures with the exception of the globus pallidus, deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar cortex and external cuneate nucleus. These expected exceptions demonstrate that activity changes in these latter structures, as revealed by c-fos labeled neurons, were induced over more than one synapse. This combined procedure might, therefore, be useful in deciding whether two structures in a given system are linked directly (monosynaptically) or indirectly (polysynaptically) to each other. In contrast to the 2-deoxyglucose technique, functional mapping by means of c-fos induction provides cellular resolution, making it possible to establish fine details of axonal contacts with target neurons: boutons in close apposition to c-fos labeled neurons were clearly observed here, for instance in the cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and pontine nuclei. Surprisingly, the ventrolateral and ventrobasalis nuclei of the thalamus contained numerous and dense axon terminals labeled with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin or biocytin, but the contacted neurons in the ventrolateral and ventrobasalis nuclei were not marked with c-fos. However, with respect to directly connected structures, there was, in general, a good correlation between structures with axonal labeling and those with c-fos labeled neurons.
1279462	The afferent connections of the parvocellular reticular formation were systematically investigated in the rat with the aid of retrograde and anterograde horseradish peroxidase tracer techniques. The results indicate that the parvocellular reticular formation receives its main input from several territories of the cerebral cortex (namely the first motor, primary somatosensory and granular insular areas), districts of the reticular formation (including its contralateral counterpart, the intermediate reticular nucleus, the nucleus of Probst's bundle, the dorsal paragigantocellular nucleus, the alpha part of the gigantocellular reticular nucleus, the dorsal and ventral reticular nuclei of the medulla, and the mesencephalic reticular formation), the supratrigeminal nucleus and the deep cerebellar nuclei. Moderate to substantial input to the parvocellular reticular formation appears to come from the central amygdaloid nucleus, the parvocellular division of the red nucleus, and the orofacial and gustatory sensory cell groups (comprising the mesencephalic, principal and spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the rostral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract), whereas many other structures, including the substantia innominata, the field H2 of Forel, hypothalamic nuclei, the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the retrorubral field and the parabrachial complex, seem to represent relatively modest additional input sources. Some of these projections appear to be topographically distributed within the parvocellular reticular formation. From the present results it appears that the parvocellular reticular formation receives afferents from a restricted group of sensory structures. This finding calls into question the traditional characterization of the parvocellular reticular formation as an intermediate link between the sensory nuclei of the cranial nerves and the medial magnocellular reticular districts, identified as the effector components of the reticular apparatus. Some of the possible physiological correlates of the fiber connections of the parvocellular reticular formation in the context of oral motor behaviors, autonomic regulations, respiratory phenomena and sleep-waking mechanisms are briefly discussed.
1281526	The fate of serotonin and substance P receptors following serotonin/substance P hyperinnervation of CNS tissue was investigated in the inferior olivary complex of adult rats subjected to earlier intraventricular administration of 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine. [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(Dl-n-propylamino)tetralin, [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, [3H]ketanserin and [125I]Bolton-Hunter-substance P were respectively used to label 5-hydroxytryptamine1A, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B, 5-hydroxytryptamine2 and neurokinin-1 receptor sites for quantitative ligand binding autoradiography. Only 5-hydroxytryptamine2 and neurokinin-1 sites were detected in the normal or serotonin/substance P-hyperinnervated inferior olivary complex. In the normal inferior olivary complex, the density of [3H]ketanserin binding (5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors) was relatively low, being the highest in pars a of the caudal medial accessory olive and the principal olive; moderate in pars c of the caudal medial accessory olive; truly low in the medial and the lateral dorsal accessory olive, nucleus b and pars b of the caudal medial accessory olive; and negligible in the middle medial accessory olive, rostral medial accessory olive and the smaller subnuclei. [125I]Bolton-Hunter-substance P binding (neurokinin-1 receptors) appeared denser, being highest in nucleus beta and the middle medial dorsal accessory olive; moderate in the three portions of the caudal medial accessory olive, the lateral dorsal accessory olive and the dorsal cap of Kooy; low in the rostral medial accessory olive, the ventrolateral outgrowth and the dorsomedial cell column; and very low or null in the principal olive and the medial dorsal accessory olive. After serotonin/substance P hyperinnervation, there were striking increases in the apparent density of both populations of receptor. [3H]Ketanserin binding was now stronger in the most olivary subnuclei, including some in which it had not been found in the normal, such as the middle and the rostral medial accessory olive. [125I]Bolton-Hunter-substance P binding showed even greater elevations in a few subnuclei, such as the principal olive and the dorsomedial cell column; it was now detectable in the medial dorsal accessory olive, unchanged in the dorsal cap of Kooy and the ventrolateral outgrowth, and slightly decreased in the lateral dorsal accessory olive. The normal and altered distributions of both ligands did not match the respective patterns of serotonin and substance P innervation and hyperinnervation previously demonstrated with immunocytochemistry. In some sectors of the inferior olivary complex where both transmitters are presumably co-localized, there was no overlap in the distribution of the respective binding sites either in the normal or in the hyperinnervated state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1291032	To reveal central nervous system (CNS) structures involved in the baroreceptor reflex we studied the distribution of Fos protein-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain after one hour of electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve (ADN). In 13 male Wistar rats under urethane the ADN was cut on both sides and the central ends were placed on stimulating electrodes. Intermittent (11 s on, 6 s off) electrical stimulation at parameters set to elicit a drop in mean arterial pressure of 15-30 mmHg was applied to one, both or neither ADNs for 1 h. CNS sections were incubated for 48 h in anti-Fos antibody and prepared for visualization of the reaction product using the ABC immunoperoxidase technique. Label was found in several discrete brain nuclei primarily on the side ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. In the medulla labelled nuclei were found in the nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguus and medullary reticular formation. In the pons labelled neurons were found in the lateral and ventrolateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, pontine reticular field and A5 region. In the forebrain labelled nuclei were observed in the peri- and paraventricular hypothalamus, supraoptic nucleus, subfornical organ, preoptic area, central nucleus of the amygdala, median preoptic area, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and islands of Calleja. In control animals moderate amounts of label were present in the supraoptic nucleus and periventricular hypothalamus bilaterally. These results define central pathways involved in mediating the baroreceptor reflex.
1303168	Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes and in situ hybridization of choline-O-acetyltransferase mRNA, both alone and in combination with immunohistochemical procedures for the synthetic enzyme of acetylcholine, were used to map the topography of putative cholinergic neurons in the rat central nervous system. Only the anti-sense riboprobe yielded specific labeling, which was absent in brain sections processed with sense riboprobe. Telencephalic neurons demonstrating the mRNA for choline-O-acetyltransferase and choline-O-acetyltransferase-like immunoreactivity were found in the caudate-putamen nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercule, Islands of Calleja complex, medial septal nucleus, vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, substantia innominata, nucleus basalis, and nucleus of the ansa lenticularis, as well as occasionally in the amygdala. Neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and primary olfactory structures did not demonstrate hybridization signal, even though some cells in those areas were observed to exhibit choline-O-acetyltransferase-like immunopositivity. Thalamic cells were devoid of hybrido- and immunoreactivity, with the exception of several neurons located primarily in the ventral two-thirds of the medial habenula. A few cell bodies labeled with riboprobe and co-localizing choline-O-acetyltransferase-like immunopositivity were found in the lateral hypothalamus, caudal extension of the internal capsule, and zona incerta. Neurons in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei evinced moderate hybridization signal, whereas cells of the parabigeminal nucleus were very weakly reactive. In contrast, motor neurons of the cranial nerve nuclei demonstrated high levels of choline-O-acetyltransferase mRNA and choline-O-acetyltransferase-like immunoreactivity. Putative cholinergic somata in the ventral horns and intermediolateral cell columns of the spinal cord and around the central canal were also labeled with riboprobe. It is concluded that hybridocytochemistry with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes confirms the existence of cholinergic neurons in most of the neural regions believed to contain them on the basis of acetylcholinesterase pharmacohistochemistry and choline-O-acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry, with the prominent exceptions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and caudal raphe nuclei, which apparently do not possess neurons expressing detectable levels of the mRNA for the synthetic enzyme of acetylcholine.
1312131	The expression patterns of 13 GABAA receptor subunit encoding genes (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 3, gamma 1-gamma 3, delta) were determined in adult rat brain by in situ hybridization. Each mRNA displayed a unique distribution, ranging from ubiquitous (alpha 1 mRNA) to narrowly confined (alpha 6 mRNA was present only in cerebellar granule cells). Some neuronal populations coexpressed large numbers of subunit mRNAs, whereas in others only a few GABAA receptor-specific mRNAs were found. Neocortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen displayed complex expression patterns, and these areas probably contain a large diversity of GABAA receptors. In many areas, a consistent coexpression was observed for alpha 1 and beta 2 mRNAs, which often colocalized with gamma 2 mRNA. The alpha 1 beta 2 combination was abundant in olfactory bulb, globus pallidus, inferior colliculus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus, medial septum, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also apparent for the alpha 2 and beta 3 mRNAs, and these predominated in areas such as amygdala and hypothalamus. The alpha 3 mRNA occurred in layers V and VI of neocortex and in the reticular thalamic nucleus. In much of the forebrain, with the exception of hippocampal pyramidal cells, the alpha 4 and delta transcripts appeared to codistribute. In thalamic nuclei, the only abundant GABAA receptor mRNAs were those of alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta. In the medial geniculate thalamic nucleus, alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, delta, and gamma 3 mRNAs were the principal GABAA receptor transcripts. The alpha 5 and beta 1 mRNAs generally colocalized and may encode predominantly hippocampal forms of the GABAA receptor. These anatomical observations support the hypothesis that alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors are responsible for benzodiazepine I (BZ I) binding, whereas receptors containing alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 contribute to subtypes of the BZ II site. Based on significant mismatches between alpha 4/delta and gamma mRNAs, we suggest that in vivo, the alpha 4 subunit contributes to GABAA receptors that lack BZ modulation.
1313157	The effect of U-50,488H, a selective kappa opiate agonist, on tolerance-dependence and abstinence on the TRH receptors of the spinal cord and discrete regions of the brain of male Sprague-Dawley rats was determined. Rats were injected intraperitoneally twice daily with 25 mg/kg of U-50,488H for 4 days. Rats serving as controls were injected with the vehicle. On day 5, rats which were labeled as tolerant to U-50,488H were injected with U-50,488H (25 mg/kg) and sacrificed 1 hr later, whereas those labeled as abstinent were sacrificed without any injection. The above procedure has been previously shown to produce a high degree of tolerance to the analgesic and hypothermic effects of U-50,488H. The spinal cord and regions of the brain (hippocampus, cortex, midbrain, hypothalamus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, and amygdala) were isolated for binding studies. The ligand [3H]MeTRH was used for TRH receptors. The binding constants, Bmax and Kd values, of [3H]MeTRH to bind to membranes prepared from various regions of the brain and spinal cord of rats tolerant-dependent on U-50,488H were unaffected. However, in rats abstinent to U-50,488H, the binding of [3H]MeTRH to membranes of the hypothalamus, and pons and medulla, was decreased. The decreased binding of [3H]MeTRH to hypothalamic membranes was due to changes in Bmax value, while in pons and medulla it was due to an increase in the Kd value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1315904	The expression of mRNAs encoding the alpha 3 and alpha 4 subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor in the rat brain was investigated by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Both subunits showed a wide but uneven distribution, which did not coincide with the distribution of any other subunit so far reported. The cerebral cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, subiculum, lateral and medial nuclei of the amygdaloid complex, anterior nuclei of the thalamus, pars compacta of the substantia nigra, trigeminal sensory nuclei, and cochlear nucleus were some of the areas where strong expression of mRNA for both the alpha 3 and alpha 4 subunits was detected. In the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the preoptic area and locus coeruleus, strong expression of only the alpha 3 subunit was detected. In the granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, tenia tecta, pyramidal cell layer of the CA region and granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation, dorsomedial and ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus, dorsal part of the lateral geniculate body, preolivary nuclei and pontine nuclei, only the alpha 4 subunit showed strong expression. The diverse distribution of these two subunits is considered to indicate that each has a different role in the central nervous system.
1320718	Type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) is one of four major serine-threonine specific phosphoprotein phosphatases which modulate various intracellular activities. By in situ hybridization analysis of the adult rat, expression signals of mRNA for PP2C were observed most highly in the granule cells and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and plexus choroideus of the lateral ventricle, whereas moderate levels of its expression were observed in the medial habenula, piriform cortex and the pineal body. Several discrete nuclei of the brainstem including pars compacta of the substantia nigra, the pontine nuclei, and the locus ceruleus expressed the mRNA moderately. Weak expression of PP2C mRNA was observed in mitral and internal granule cells of the olfactory bulb, spinal cord gray matter, the cerebral neocortex, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. Only faint expression was detected in the caudate putamen. These patterns of expression are different from that of calcineurin/PP2B reported by other immunohistochemical studies and it is suggested that various neuronal proteins are differentially dephosphorylated by the different types of PP.
1322222	The distribution of retrogradely and transneuronally labeled neurons was studied in CNS of rats 4 days after injections of the Bartha strain of pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle. Tissue sections were processed for immunohistochemical detection of PRV. Retrogradely labeled cells were identified in the ipsilateral MG motor column in the caudal L4 and the L5 spinal segments. In order to evaluate the efficacy of PRV retrograde cell body labeling, the number of PRV retrogradely labeled neurons in the MG motor column was compared to the number labeled with two conventional retrograde cell body markers--Fluoro-Gold and cholera toxin-HRP. A ratio of 1:3 representing medium-sized (less than 30 microns) versus large neurons (greater than 30 microns) was found in the Fluoro-Gold dye experiments; a 1:2 ratio was seen in the PRV experiments. In contrast, when cholera toxin-HRP was used as a retrograde marker, mainly large neurons were labeled; the medium-to-large cell body ratio was 1:10 suggesting cholera toxin-HRP may have a greater affinity for the terminals of alpha-motoneurons as opposed to gamma-motoneurons. Transneuronally labeled cells were identified in the L1-L6 spinal gray matter, intermediolateral cell column (T11-L2), lateral spinal nucleus and medial part of lamina VII in C4 and C5 spinal segments, brainstem (caudal raphe nuclei, rostral ventrolateral medulla, A5 cell group, paralemniscal nucleus, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus nucleus, red nucleus) and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. In the L5 spinal cord, transneuronally labeled neurons were seen in the ipsilateral spinal laminae I and II and bilaterally in spinal laminae IV-VIII, and X. Similar results were obtained in rats that had chronic unilateral L3-L6 dorsal rhizotomies indicating most of the labeling was due to retrograde transneuronal cell body labeling. In order to determine whether PRV was transported into the spinal cord by the dorsal root axons, the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were examined for PRV immunoreactivity; none was found. However, using the polymerase chain reaction, viral DNA was shown to be present in the ipsilateral DRGs indicating that some of spinal cord cell body labeling may have resulted from anterograde transneuronal labeling, as well.
1323311	In rat brain, the cellular localization of a phosphoinositide-linked metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1 alpha) was demonstrated using antibodies that recognize the C-terminus of the receptor. mGluR1 alpha, a 142 kd protein, is enriched within the olfactory bulb, stratum oriens of CA1 and polymorph layer of dentate gyrus in hippocampus, globus pallidus, thalamus, substantia nigra, superior colliculus, and cerebellum. Lower levels of mGluR1 alpha are present within neocortex, striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, and medulla. Dendrites, spines, and neuronal cell bodies contain mGluR1 alpha. mGluR1 alpha is not detectable in presynaptic terminals. mGluR1 alpha and ionotropic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor subunits show differential distributions, but in Purkinje cells, mGluR1 alpha and specific AMPA receptor subunits colocalize. The postsynaptic distribution of mGluR1 alpha is consistent with postulated physiological roles of this subtype of glutamate receptor.
1324082	Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is structurally similar to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). We investigated the characteristics and topographical distribution of [125I]PACAP binding sites compared with those of [125I]VIP binding sites in the rat brain. Radiolabeled PACAP and VIP showed highly specific binding to sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus. The specific binding of [125I]PACAP was 10 times higher than that of [125I]VIP in hippocampal sections. [125I]PACAP binding was scarcely displaced by unlabeled VIP, while [125I]VIP binding was effectively displaced by unlabeled PACAP. Therefore, PACAP binding sites may reflect both PACAP specific binding sites and VIP/PACAP binding sites. However, the amount of VIP/PACAP binding sites was negligibly low. Autoradiography revealed that [125I]PACAP binding sites were dense in the piriform cortex, diagonal band, accumbens nucleus, anterior part of the striatum, hippocampal formation, habenular nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, superior colliculus and dorsal raphe nucleus. Moderate to high labeling was observed in the medial septal nucleus, olfactory tubercle, caudal part of the striatum, most parts of the thalamus, supraoptic and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, central gray, substantia nigra pars compacta, locus coeruleus, pontine reticular nucleus and cerebellum. Distribution pattern was remarkably different from that of [125I]VIP binding sites in the hippocampal formation, lateral hypothalamic area, substantia nigra pars compacta, pontine reticular nucleus and cerebellum. The present results suggest that PACAP may have a physiological role in the regulation of the central nervous system.
1324768	In the present work the anatomical distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the human central nervous system was studied in detail by quantitative autoradiography using the selective alpha 2 agonist [3H]bromoxidine ([3H]UK-14304) as a ligand. Only postmortem tissues from subjects free of neurological disorders were used in this study. Very high or high densities of alpha 2-adrenoceptors were found along layers I and III in non-visual neocortex, layers III and IVc of the visual cortex, CA1 field--stratum lacunosum-moleculare--and dentate gyrus--stratum granularis--at the hippocampal formation, nucleus arcuatus at the hypothalamus, locus ceruleus, nucleus dorsalis of vagus and at the stratum granularis of the cerebellar cortex. Relevant densities of alpha 2-adrenoceptors were also observed along the remaining layers of neocortex, nuclei centralis, medialis and corticalis at the amygdala, anterior thalamic group and rotundocellularis nuclei, paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, substantia innominata, superior colliculus--stratum zonale--and lateral periaqueductal area at the midbrain, nucleus tractus solitarii and dorsal horn--substantia gelatinosa--of the spinal cord. [3H]Bromoxidine specific binding was very low or negligible in the remaining brain areas. Although a general parallelism between the distribution of these receptors could be observed for the rat and human brain, dramatic species differences in the level of alpha 2-receptors were found in several brain areas, such as thalamus, amygdala or cerebellar cortex. In general, the distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the human brain found here was parallel to that described for the noradrenergic presynaptic terminals in the mammalian central nervous system, lending some weight to the proposed predominant presynaptic localization of these receptors. The relevance of the anatomical distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the human brain for a better knowledge of the neurochemistry of neuropsychiatric disorders is discussed.
1327400	The density of specific prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) binding sites was quantitatively mapped in the rat brain using in vitro autoradiography. The anterior wall of the third ventricle and the nucleus solitary tract were found to have a very high density of binding sites (greater than 15 fmol/mg tissue). Two thalamic nuclei (paraventricular and anteroventral nuclei) and the dorsal parabrachial nucleus contained a high density of binding sites (10-15 fmol/mg tissue). Entorhinal cortex, ventral hippocampus, amygdala, dorsomedial hypothalamus, mammillary complex, some thalamic nuclei, central gray, superior colliculus, raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus (caudal part) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (laminae 1 and 2) had each a moderate density of binding sites (5-10 fmol/mg tissue). Binding tended to occur in brain regions rich in neuronal cell bodies or neuronal cell processes (dendrites and axon terminals). PGE1, whose central actions are very similar to those of PGE2, had essentially the same pattern of binding sites as did PGE2 throughout the entire brain, suggesting there are receptors common to these two PGEs. In addition to already known functions of receptors common to these two PGEs. In addition to already known functions of PGE2 in the hypothalamus, which include fever genesis, promotion of wakefulness, cardiovascular control and LH-RH release, the unique distribution of extrahypothalamic PGE2 binding sites found in this study suggests its involvement in the processing or modulation of viscerosensory, somatosensory (nociceptive and possibly thermal) and visual inputs as well as in the central integration of autonomic and limbic functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1330210	Rab3A is a small GTP-binding synaptic vesicle protein, shown to dissociate from synaptic vesicle membranes upon depolarization-induced exocytosis. Using an antiserum raised against rab3A, we found that the antigen was localized to the neuropil of specific brain regions, but was not present in major fiber tracts or most cell bodies. For example, the neuropil of several thalamic nuclei (i.e., dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus, ventroposterior nucleus), cerebral cortex, upper layers of the superior colliculus and matrix zones of the neostriatum, were strongly immunoreactive, while the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, optic tract and internal capsule were devoid of staining. The hippocampus, regions of cerebral cortex and the cerebellum exhibited striking laminar distributions of rab3A immunoreactivity. In the hippocampus, dark staining was observed in the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, while the pyramidal, stratum lacunosum moleculare and dentate granule layers were not stained. In cerebellum the molecular layer and to a lesser extent, the underlying granule cell layer showed enhanced immunoreactivity. Seven days after excitotoxic lesions of the cerebral cortex, rab3A immunoreactivity was diminished in the mirror locus in the contralateral cortical hemisphere and in certain thalamic nuclei ipsilateral to the injection site. These results show that rab3A is localized to a number of specific regions. Its absence from other areas suggests that this synaptic vesicle protein is not universal to all neuronal terminals and pathways. In addition, our lesion studies indicate that for some brain regions, much of the antigen originates in cortical neurons and is distributed within specific axonal projections.
1331338	Neuronal activity and oxidative energy metabolism are tightly coupled. There is evidence that cytochrome oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, can serve as a metabolic marker of neuronal activity. All the respiratory chain enzymes have iron containing prosthetic groups and therefore represent an important component of iron utilisation. Since iron entry into cells is mediated by the transferrin receptor, this receptor may also serve as marker of neuronal activity. The histochemical distribution of cytochrome oxidase has therefore been compared with the autoradiographic distribution of the transferrin receptor in the human spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum. Cytochrome oxidase activity showed a very similar pattern of distribution to the transferrin receptor in the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum. The highest levels of cytochrome oxidase activity and transferrin receptor binding were associated with; in the spinal cord, the substantia gelatinosa, laminae II and III and the motor neurones; in the medulla and pons, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, inferior and superior olives, nucleus praepositus, nucleus paramedianus, central grey, superior central nuclei and locus coeruleus; in the cerebellum, the molecular layer. The results suggest that the transferrin receptor may provide a useful marker of total neuronal respiratory activity.
1331658	The distribution of GABAA receptor gamma 1 subunit was examined in the rat central nervous system using in situ hybridization histochemistry. The gamma 1 subunit was expressed in relatively limited areas compared to other subunits investigated previously. The brain regions strongly expressing this subunit were the septum, globus pallidus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamic periventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, medial and central nuclei of the amygdaloid complex, medial part of the medial geniculate body, substantia nigra pars reticulata, interpeduncular nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus. This relatively limited expression implies a possible role of gamma 1 subunit in relation to some specific neuronal circuit.
1331669	Localization of mRNA for the c-kit receptor and its ligand (Sl factor) in the brain of adult rats was studied using in situ hybridization histochemistry. The mRNA for the c-kit receptor was detected in the forebrain, the lower brain stem and the cerebellum. In the forebrain, the c-kit mRNA signals were detected in the olfactory bulb, the caudate-putamen, throughout the superficial cortex, the accumbens nucleus, the nucleus of vertical limb diagonal band, the bed nucleus of anterior commissure, Ammon's horn, the entopeduncular nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the parasubiculum, the presubiculum, the ventricular nucleus of lateral lemniscus, and the entorhinal cortex. In the lower brain stem, the signals were detected in the inferior colliculus, the spinal vestibular nucleus, the spinal tract nucleus of trigeminal nerve, and the pyramidal tract. In the cerebellum, the signals were detected in the molecular layer of the cortex and cerebellar nuclei. By contrast, the signals of mRNA for Sl factor were detected in the forebrain and the cerebellum. In the forebrain, the signals were detected in the olfactory bulb, the endopiriform nucleus, the septohippocampal nucleus, the habenular nuclei, and most of the thalamic nuclei. In the cerebellum, the signals were detected in Purkinje cells. Several pairs of structures were found in which mRNA of either the c-kit receptor or the Sl factor was expressed and between which the synaptic connection had been reported, suggesting that the interaction between the c-kit receptor and the Sl factor may play some roles in the development of such synaptic connections.
1335065	The binding of [3H]11-OH-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol-1, 1-dimethyl-heptyl (THC-DMH), a recently synthesized cannabinoid analog, was characterized in an in vitro brain slice binding assay and compared to that obtained with [3H]CP-55,940, the radiolabeled ligand used originally to characterize cannabinoid binding sites. The binding of both [3H]CP-55,940 and [3H]11-OH-delta 9-THC-DMH exhibited high affinity (Kd of 19 +/- 3 and 29 +/- 9 nM, respectively), and was saturable, reversible and specific. Values of maximal concentration of receptors determined for [3H]11-OH-delta 9-THC-DMH and [3H]CP-55,940 were 4.0 +/- 0.3 and 3.0 +/- 0.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. The distribution of [3H]11-OH-delta 9-THC-DMH and [3H]CP-55,940 binding in 30-microns rat brain sections was then compared by autoradiographic analysis. The binding of both ligands was densest in the basal ganglia (substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and regions of the caudate putamen) and cerebellum (molecular layer). Low levels of binding were observed in discrete brain regions including the brain stem (medulla and pons), thalamic nuclei, hypothalamus, corpus callosum and the deep nuclear layer of the cerebellum. Intermediate levels of binding were seen in layers I and VI of the cortex, and the dentate gyrus and CA pyramidal cell regions of the hippocampus. The ability of selected cannabinoid analogs to compete with [3H]11-OH-delta 9-THC-DMH binding was determined. The Ki's were correlated to the in vivo potencies for producing catalepsy, antinociception, hypothermia and decreasing spontaneous locomotor activity in mice (correlation coefficients > 0.86).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1337943	Previous in situ hybridization experiments reported that beta4 (beta 4) neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) transcripts were found only in the medial habenula (MHB). Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of the beta 4 subunit and any one of three ligand-binding or alpha subunits results in the formation of functional nAChRs. Comparisons between the pharmacology of nAChRs expressed in oocytes and the pharmacology of nAChRs found in the rat CNS prompted a further investigation of the localization of transcripts encoding the beta 4 nAChR subunit. Using two beta 4-specific cRNA probes, in situ hybridization was performed in rat brain. beta 4 mRNA was detected at high levels in the presubiculum, parasubiculum, subiculum and dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, in layer IV of the isocortex, in the medial habenula, in the interpeduncular nucleus, and in the trigeminal motor nerve nucleus. Moderate hybridization signals were seen in the isocortex (layers I-III), in olfactory regions, in fields CA1 through CA4 of Ammon's horn and the entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation, in the supramammillary nucleus, in the pontine nucleus, in the cerebellum, and in the locus coeruleus. No hybridization above background was detected in the septum, basal ganglia, sensory portions of the brainstem, or spinal cord.
1346714	We studied the distribution of somatostatin-28 (1-12)-immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies in the cat brainstem. A moderate density of cell bodies containing the peptide was observed in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, accessory dorsal tegmental nucleus, retrofacial nucleus and in the lateral reticular nucleus, whereas a low density of such perikarya was found in the interpeduncular nucleus, nucleus incertus, nucleus sagulum, gigantocellular tegmental field, nucleus of the trapezoid body, nucleus praepositus hypoglosii, lateral and magnocellular tegmental fields, nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus ambiguous and in the nucleus intercalatus. Moreover, a moderate density of somatostatin-28 (1-12)-immunoreactive processes was found in the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, dorsal tegmental nucleus, accessory dorsal tegmental nucleus, periaqueductal gray and in the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum. Finally, few immunoreactive fibers were visualized in the interpeduncular nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus incertus, superior and inferior central nuclei, nucleus sagulum, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, nucleus praepositus hypoglosii, medial vestibular nucleus, Kölliker-Fuse area, nucleus ambiguous, retrofacial nucleus, postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, lateral reticular nucleus and laminar and alaminar spinal trigeminal nuclei.
1354338	As a result of its interaction with a specific receptor, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes intracellular calcium. The metabolism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is rather complex: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase produces inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, a putative second messenger. In order to elucidate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate function, a comparative in situ hybridization study of the distributions of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase and receptor mRNAs was performed in the adult rat brain using oligonucleotides derived from their cDNA sequences. The neuronal distributions of the mRNA for the receptor were larger than for the kinase. Highest levels of both mRNAs were found in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, where they were enriched in their neuronal perikarya and to a lesser extent in their dendrites. In addition to the cerebellum, mRNAs were mainly detected in the hippocampal pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector of the Ammon's horn and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and also in a majority of the neurons in the cortical layers II-III and V, especially in the frontal cortex and cingulate cortex; caudate-putamen, accumbens, olfactory tubercle and Calleja islets; claustrum; anterior olfactory nucleus; taenia tecta; piriform cortex; dorsolateral septum; bed nucleus stria terminalis; amygdala; hippocampal CA2-4 sectors and subiculum. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor mRNA but not kinase mRNA was found in a majority of the neurons in the thalamus, especially in the parafascicular nucleus; hypothalamus, especially the medial hypothalamus; substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area; superior colliculus; lateral interpeduncular nucleus and central gray. Taking into account the limitation in sensitivity of the technique, both mRNAs were not detected in glial cells and in the olfactory bulb; basal nucleus of Meynert, diagonal band nuclei; medial septal nucleus; substantia innominata; globus pallidus; entopeduncular nucleus; substantia nigra pars reticulata; ventral pallidum; subthalamic nucleus; spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. In conclusion, cerebellum and hippocampus appear to contain almost similar levels of kinase mRNA. This is in contrast to receptor mRNA levels which were at much higher levels in the cerebellum when compared with the hippocampus. For this reason, we have chosen hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells for studying inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase function.
1355075	Regional astrocyte cultures were derived by dissecting six regions; brain stem, cerebellum, mesencephalon, basal ganglia plus diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, from 3 to 4-day-old neonatal rat brains. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the astrocyte composition of the cultures. The percentage of GFAP (+) cells between regions varied from 75% to 100%. Once confluent these cultures were incubated with radiolabeled serotonin or glutamate for uptake and autoradiographic studies. For the different brain regions Na(+)-dependent, [3H] L-glutamate, and fluoxetine-sensitive [3H] 5-HT uptake varied markedly. The relative order of uptake for [3H] 5-HT was MS (mesencephalon) greater than CC (cerebral cortex) greater than BG + DI (basal ganglia + diencephalon) greater than HP (hippocampus) greater than BS (brain stem) greater than CB (cerebellum). For [3H] L-glutamate the order was HP greater than CC greater than BG + DI greater than MS = BS greater than CB. For [3H] 5-HT this essentially corresponds to the reported order of binding in situ of the [3H] 5-HT-specific uptake ligand [3H] citalopram. For [3H] L-glutamate regional variation of the uptake for the different cultures corresponds to the regional uptake reported for different regions of rat brain. Double-label studies with GFAP and radiolabeled neurotransmitters were also used to study uptake into GFAP(+) astrocytes by autoradiography. Flat GFAP cells with or without processes comprised 65-98% of the cultures and represented most of the uptake. The percentage of all GFAP(+) cells that were positive for uptake of ARG varied from 50% to 90% and also showed differences in grain density both intra- and inter-regionally. These differences in transmitter uptake by GFAP(+) astrocytes in primary culture, which are dependent on the region of origin and correspond to regional differences in situ, suggest that such uptake in vitro may reflect uptake by astrocytes in vivo. Implied in this is that uptake by astrocytes represents a significant component of serotonin uptake in vivo.
1355391	The effect of morphine tolerance dependence and protracted abstinence on the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in discrete brain regions, spinal cord, pituitary gland and peripheral tissues was determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Of all the tissues examined, the highest level of dynorphin (1-13) was found to be in the pituitary gland. Among the brain regions and spinal cord examined, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in descending order were: hypothalamus, spinal cord, midbrain, pons and medulla, hippocampus, cortex, amygdala and striatum. The descending order for the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in peripheral tissues was: adrenals, heart and kidneys. In morphine tolerant rats, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) increased in amygdala but were decreased in pons and medulla. In morphine abstinent rats, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) were increased in amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus. The levels of dynorphin (1-13) were increased in pituitary but decreased in spinal cord and remained so even during protracted abstinence. The levels of dynorphin (1-13) in the peripheral tissues of morphine tolerant rats were unaffected. However, in the heart and kidneys of morphine abstinent rats, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) were increased significantly. It is concluded that both morphine tolerance and abstinence modify the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in pituitary, central and peripheral tissues. Morphine abstinence differed from non-abstinence process in that there were additional changes (increases) in the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in brain regions (hypothalamus and hippocampus) and peripheral tissues (heart and kidneys) and may contribute to the symptoms of the morphine abstinence syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1357566	The involvement of synaptosomal neurotransmitter amino-acids in seizure susceptibility and seizure severity was explored. The amino-acid contents of brain synaptosomes were determined in three sublines of Rb mice differing in their response to an acoustic stimulus: Rb1, clonic-tonic seizure-prone, Rb2, clonic seizure-prone, and Rb3, seizure-resistant. Synaptosomes were prepared from 6 brain areas considered to be involved in seizure activity: olfactory bulbs, amygdala, inferior colliculus, hippocampus, cerebellum, pons-medulla. The steady-state levels of GABA and glycine (Gly), inhibitory amino-acids, of taurine (Tau), an inhibitory neurotransmitter of neuromodulator, of aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu), excitatory amino-acids, as well as of serine (Ser) and glutamine (Gln), two precursors of neurotransmitter amino-acids, were determined by HPLC. Low levels of Tau, GABA, and Ser in hippocampus, Gly in amygdala, Glu in hippocampus, inferior colliculus and pons, Gln and Asp in inferior colliculus appeared to correlate with seizure-susceptibility. GABA and Asp in olfactory bulb, Gln in amygdala, hippocampus and pons, ser in olfactory bulb and pons, appeared to be associated either with seizure-severity or -diversity. A strong involvement of hippocampus (Tau, GABA, Ser, Glu, and Gln) and inferior colliculus (Asp, Glu, Gln) in audiogenic seizure-susceptibility, and of olfactory bulb (GABA, Asp) in seizure-severity and/or -diversity is suggested.
1357764	The regional distribution of mRNA coding for the neuropeptide somatostatin has been studied in the human brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. We show that somatostatin mRNA-containing neurons are widely distributed in a number of nuclei and grey areas of the human brain, including neocortex, putamen, nucleus caudatus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, midbrain, medulla oblongata, hippocampal formation, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and posterior nucleus of the hypothalamus. No significant hybridization signal was observed in the substantia nigra, claustrum, globus pallidus, thalamus, and cerebellum. The topographic localization of neurons containing SOM mRNA in the human brain is in agreement with previous studies using immunocytochemical or radioimmunoassay techniques. These results show that in situ hybridization histochemistry with oligonucleotide probes can be used to map the distribution of neurons expressing SOM mRNA in human postmortem materials.
1357923	Although the central mechanisms of electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA) have been investigated, a systematic study for the involvement of neuronal populations of central nervous system (CNS) in EAA has not been well undertaken, largely due to the difficulty in tracing the neuronal pathways by traditional techniques. Recently developed c-fos expression examination by immunohistochemical method with Ab-1 antisera might be used for this purpose as a useful marker for neuronal activity in CNS. In this study, tail flick latency (TFL) was tested as an index of pain threshold in conscious rats. After unilateral electroacupuncture was applied at 'Zuan-san-li' and 'Huan-tiao', the TFL was significantly prolonged. To explore the possible involvement of certain neuronal groups of central nervous system in EAA, we examined the EAA accompanied c-fos expression throughout the neuraxis, and a lot of specific c-fos protein labelled neurons were found in lumbar spinal cord (laminae I and II), nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe dorsalis, substantia grisea centralis, nucleus habenulae lateralis, nucleus habenulae medialis, nucleus medialis thalami, nucleus lateralis hypothalami, nucleus supramamillaris, nucleus supraopticus, nucleus arcuatus, nucleus preopticus medialis, nucleus amygdala, nucleus tractus diagonalis, etc. No obvious c-fos expression was shown in these areas on control rats. These results strongly suggested that the functional activation of above-mentioned nuclei by electroacupuncture was underlied in EAA action.
1374086	Cerebellar projections of the nucleus interpolaris and oralis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus were studied in the cat by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Injections of WGA-HRP into these nuclei labeled many mossy fiber terminals mainly ipsilaterally in the rostral folium of lobule IX (IXa or IXa + b), the simple lobule, the anterior part (sublobule A) of the paramedian lobule and the posterior part of crus II. Labeled terminals were also seen in the anterior lobe, lobules VI and VII, the anterior part of crus I, and the paraflocculus dorsalis. Projection fields in the horizontal plane of lobules were reconstructed from a series of transverse sections through each folium of lobule IX, the paramedian lobule, and the posterior part of crus II on the ipsilateral side. In sublobule IXa + b, labeled terminals were distributed in five longitudinal areas extending along the apicobasal axis of the sublobule. These five areas were located in the apical two-thirds of the ipsilateral half of the sublobule. Labeled terminals were distributed in five longitudinal areas in sublobule A (the rostral part) of the paramedian lobule. In the posterior part of crus II, four aggregations of labeled terminals were present in cross sections through a lobule. They were distributed in the apicobasal extent of the lobules. The present study indicates that the projection fields of trigeminocerebellar fibers are longitudinally arranged along the apicobasal axis of the cerebellar lobules.
1374442	Neurokinin B (NKB) belongs to the family of neuropeptides named tachykinins. Members of this family such as substance P or neurokinin A have been proposed to function as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Searching for possible sites of action of NKB in the central nervous system, we have now investigated its distribution within the rat brain by immunohistochemical techniques and in situ hybridization. For immunohistology two different antisera directed against amino acid sequences within preprotachykinin B were used. One antiserum had been raised against a synthetic derivative of NKB; the other one was directed towards the amino acids 50-79 of preprotachykinin B, which are referred to as peptide 2. Essentially the same distribution of immunoreactive perikarya was obtained with both antisera and it closely corresponded to the cellular localization of preprotachykinin B mRNA. Neurons containing NKB immunoreactivity and mRNA were present in many areas including cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdaloid complex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventral pallidum, habenula, medial preoptic area, arcuate nucleus, and lateral mammillary bodies. Dense immunoreactive fibers were observed in various parts of the brain and were most prominent in the olfactory bulb and tubercle, the lateral olfactory tract, medial hypothalamus, around blood vessels of the median eminence and interpeduncular nucleus, amygdaloid nuclei, stria terminalis, subbrachial nucleus, and medial geniculate nucleus. Fibers of less intense staining were seen among other brain areas in the substantia nigra, the reticular formation, and the area of the nucleus of the solitary tract. Surgical lesion of the fasciculus retroflexus revealed that the dense fiber network observed in the interpeduncular nucleus originates from the ventral and dorsal parts of the medial habenula. Our data suggest a widespread and distinct distribution of neurons expressing NKB within the central nervous system, suggesting possible neuromodulatory roles of this neuropeptide for various brain functions.
1374871	The special areal and laminar distributions of cortical afferent connections from various thalamic nuclei in the monkey (Macaca fuscata) were studied by using the anterograde axonal transport technique of autoradiography. The following findings were obtained. The superficial thalamocortical (T-C) projections, terminating in the (superficial half of) cortical layer I, arise mainly from the nucleus ventralis anterior, pars principalis (VApc) and nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and possibly from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars medialis (VLm) and nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc). The VApc gives rise to the superficial T-C and deep T-C projections onto the postarcuate premotor area around the arcuate genu and spur, and onto the dorsomedial part of the caudal premotor area as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA). The VApc also gives rise to only deep T-C projections onto the remaining premotor area and onto the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus as well as the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus at the level of the premotor area. The VLo gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the ventrolateral part of the motor area (mainly to the forelimb motor area) and onto the dorsomedial part to the mesial cortex at the rostral level of the motor area. The VAmc gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the banks of the arcuate genu and adjacent region of area 8. Area X, the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc), nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and possibly the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc) send only deep T-C projections. The dorsal and medial parts of the VLc project onto the premotor area, the rostral part of the motor area and the SMA, and also the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. Area X projects onto the premotor area, the SMA, and the caudal part of area 8. The thalamic relay nuclei projecting onto the frontal association cortex were found to be the VAmc, medial VLc and area X.
1376455	The neuronal distribution of cannabinoid receptor in the adult rat brain is reported, combining receptor binding radioautography using the synthetic psychoactive cannabinoid ligand CP55,940 with in situ hybridization histochemistry using oligonucleotide probes complementary to rat cannabinoid receptor cDNA. In the cerebral cortex, especially in the frontal and cingulate cortex, dense binding was found in layers I and VI together with slight mRNA levels in a majority of both pyramidal and non-pyramidal-shaped neurons and of high mRNA levels in a moderate number of non-pyramidal-shaped neurons especially in layers II-III and V-VI. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, very dense staining was found in the molecular layer together with high mRNA levels in a moderate number of hilar neurons close to the granular layer. In Ammon's horn, especially in the CA3 sector, very dense binding was found in the dendritic layers together with slight mRNA levels in the majority of the pyramidal cells and high mRNA levels in a moderate number of interneurons. In the basal ganglia, binding was very dense in the lateral putamen, substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus and entopeduncular nucleus, moderate in the medial putamen and caudate; and slight in the accumbens, together with slight to moderate mRNA levels in the striatal medium-sized neurons. Together with slight binding, slight to moderate mRNA levels were found in the majority of the neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. No binding and mRNA were found in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Slight to moderate binding was found together with slight to moderate mRNA levels in the majority of neurons in the anterior olfactory nucleus; septum, especially medial septum and diagonal band of Broca; amygdala, especially basolateral amygdala; lateral habenula; ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus; lateral interpeduncular nucleus; central gray, dorsal cochlear nucleus; parabrachial nucleus; dorsal pontine tegmentum; pontine nuclei; commissural part of the nucleus tractus solitarius; inferior olive and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In the cerebellum, very dense binding was found in the molecular layer together with slight mRNA levels in the majority of the granule cells and moderate mRNA levels in the basket and stellate cells. In conclusion, this study provides, for the first time, indirect assessment of the neurons containing cannabinoid receptor in the entire adult rat brain and will serve as a basis for future direct morphological confirmation using receptor immunohistochemistry and for functional studies.
1379535	We studied axonal trajectories of single Forel's field H (FFH) neurones (n = 19) in the mesencephalon, pons and medulla by systematic antidromic threshold mapping in cats and differentiated them into two major types. Type I neurones were characterized by projections to the oculomotor nucleus (IIIn) and type II neurones by lack of projections to the IIIn. 2. Type I neurones (11/19) were further classified into three subtypes by the lowest level of projections; type Ic (n = 3) which projected to the cervical cord and type Ib (n = 7) which terminated at the ponto-medullary level and type Ia (n = 1) at more rostral level. In the mesencephalon, stem axons passed just lateral to the IIIn and projected collaterals to the IIIn and the ventral part of the periaqueductal gray matter. In the lower brain stem, stem axons of type Ib and Ic neurones passed in the dorsal part of the reticular formation or in the medial longitudinal fasciculus and projected collaterals to the dorsal part of the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (NRPC) and the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NRG) and the reticular formation underlying the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (PH) and the raphe region. Projections to the superior colliculus were observed in two cases. 3. Type II neurones (8/19) were classified into 2 type IIb projecting to the ponto-medullary reticular formation and 6 type IIc projecting to the cervical spinal cord. In the mesencephalon, stem axons passed through a more lateral region than those of type I and projected collaterals to the mesencephalic reticular formation and the red nucleus. In the lower brain stem, the stem axons passed in the ventral part of the reticular formation corresponding to the central tegmental tract and projected collaterals to the ventral part of the NRPC and NRG. Projections to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the inferior olive and the reticular formation underlying the PH were also observed. 4. The dorsal and ventral location of, respectively, stem axons of type I and type II neurones in the lower brain stem was confirmed in a larger number of neurones in experiments with restricted mapping. 5. There was not much difference in location of cell bodies of type I (totally n = 50) and type II (n = 46) neurones. The proportion of spinal-projecting neurones were larger in type II (21/46, 46%) than in type I (7/50, 14%) neurones.
1380015	To better understand the functional organization of the mammillary nuclei, we investigated the afferents to this nuclear complex in the rat with iontophoretically injected wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Particular attention was paid to tracing local hypothalamic afferents to these nuclei. Injections into the medial mammillary nucleus (MMN) revealed strong projections from the subicular region, and weaker projections from the prefrontal cortex, medial septum, and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca. Other descending subcortical projections to the MMN arise from the anterior and the lateral hypothalamic area, the medial preoptic area, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Ascending afferents to the MMN were found to originate in the raphe and various tegmental nuclei. Following all injections into the MMN, labelled neurons were found in nuclei surrounding the mammillary body. The lateral and posterior subdivisions of the tuberomammillary nucleus projected mainly to the pars medianus and pars medialis of the MMN. The dorsal and ventral premammillary nuclei projected to the pars lateralis of the MMN. The supramammillary nucleus at rostral level had a small projection to the pars medialis and lateralis of the MMN. However, the most obvious projection from this nucleus was to the pars posterior of the MMN, chiefly from the lateral part of the caudal supramammillary nucleus. Injections into the lateral mammillary nucleus revealed inputs from the presubiculum, parasubiculum, septal region, dorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. In addition, the lateral mammillary nucleus was found to receive a moderate projection from the medial part of the supramammillary nucleus and stronger projections from the lateral part of the caudal supramammillary nucleus. A very light projection was also seen from the lateral and posterior subdivisions of the tuberomammillary nucleus. These findings add to our knowledge of the extensive and complex connectivity of the mammillary nuclei. In particular, the local connections we have demonstrated with the supramammillary and tuberomammillary nuclei indicate the existence of significant local circuits as well as circuits involving more distant brain regions such as the septal nuclei, subiculum, prefrontal cortex, and brain stem tegmentum.
1380136	We have examined collateral projections of locus coeruleus afferent neurons in the rostral medulla to the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract or to the periaqueductal gray using double retrograde labeling techniques in the rat. The present findings confirm previously reported connections to the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral periaqueductal gray from the nucleus paragigantocellularis in the rostral ventral medulla. Our results also reveal previously unreported projections from the rostral dorsomedial medulla (in a similar region as locus coeruleus-projecting neurons) to the lateral periaqueductal gray. Following retrograde tracer injections into the nucleus of the solitary tract and the locus coeruleus, doubly labeled neurons were seen in both the nucleus paragigantocellularis and in the rostral dorsomedial medulla. Cell counts revealed that approximately 25% of locus coeruleus-projecting neurons in the nucleus paragigantocellularis, and 12% in the dorsomedial medulla, also innervate the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract. In contrast, no doubly labeled neurons within the rostral ventral medulla were found following injections into the lateral periaqueductal gray and the locus coeruleus, although singly labeled neurons for the two tracers were interdigitated in some regions. Following these injections, numerous neurons were also retrogradely labeled in the dorsomedial medulla in the region of the medial prepositus hypoglossi and the perifascicular reticular formation. A small percentage of locus coeruleus afferents in the dorsal medulla (approximately 10%) also projected to the lateral periaqueductal gray. These results indicate that neurons in both the ventrolateral and dorsomedial rostral medulla frequently send collaterals to both the locus coeruleus and the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract. A small number of neurons in the dorsomedial medulla project to both the locus coeruleus and the lateral periaqueductal gray, but separate populations of neurons project to the locus coeruleus and the lateral periaqueductal gray from the ventrolateral medulla. These results functionally link the locus coeruleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract by virtue of common afferents, and support other studies indicating the importance of central autonomic circuitry in the afferent control of locus coeruleus neurons.
1380518	The afferent connections of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) and the adjacent midbrain extrapyramidal area (MEA) were examined by retrograde tracing with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Major afferents to the PPT originate in the periaqueductal gray, central tegmental field, lateral hypothalamic area, dorsal raphe nucleus, superior colliculus, and pontine and medullary reticular fields. Other putative inputs originate in the paraventricular and preoptic hypothalamic nuclei, the zona incerta, nucleus of the solitary tract, central superior raphe nucleus, substantia innominata, posterior hypothalamic area, and thalamic parafascicular nucleus. The major afferent to the medially adjacent MEA originates in the lateral habenula, while other putative afferents include the perifornical and lateral hypothalamic area, periaqueductal gray, superior colliculus, pontine reticular formation, and dorsal raphe nucleus. MEA inputs from basal ganglia nuclei include moderate projections from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, entopeduncular nucleus, and a small projection from the globus pallidus, but not the subthalamic nucleus. Dense anterograde labeling was observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and caudate-putamen only following WGA-HRP injections involving the MEA. The results of this study demonstrate that the PPT and MEA share many potential afferents. Remarkable differences were found that support distinguishing between these two nuclei in future studies regarding the functional organization of the midbrain and pons. The results, for example, confirm our previous observations that the largely reciprocal connections between the midbrain and basal ganglia distinguish the MEA from the PPT. Afferents from the lateral habenula and contralateral superior colliculus represent extensions of more traditional basal ganglion circuitry which further delineate the MEA from the PPT. The results are discussed with respect to the important role of the midbrain and pons in behavioral state control and locomotor mechanisms.
1380998	Effects of nutritional status on the levels of tryptophan (Trp), serotonin (5HT), and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) in six brain regions of rats were investigated. 1) A low-protein high-carbohydrate diet decreased Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA levels in the cortex and hippocampus, and those of 5HT and 5HIAA in the hypothalamus. This diet did not affect the contents of Trp and 5HT in the midbrain, but decreased 5HIAA. No significant changes of Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA were observed in the pons and medulla and striatum. 2) A low-carbohydrate high-protein diet increased the levels of Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA in the striatum, and 5HT and 5HIAA in the cortex, but showed no effect on the contents of Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA in the hippocampus, midbrain, pons and medulla and hypothalamus. 3) An energy-restriction low-carbohydrate diet increased Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA contents in the striatum, and 5HT and 5HIAA in the cortex and pons and medulla. In the hypothalamus, only 5HIAA was increased by this diet. The diet did not influence Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA contents of the midbrain and hippocampus. These results suggest that i) lowered fat and carbohydrate intakes enhance 5HT synthesis and metabolism in the cortex and that lowered carbohydrate intake enhances them in the striatum, ii) energy restriction enhances the 5HT metabolism in the cortex, pons and medulla and hypothalamus, and 5HT synthesis in the cortex and pons and medulla, iii) lowered protein intake inhibits 5HT metabolism in the cortex, midbrain, hippocampus and hypothalamus, and 5HT synthesis in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus.
1381985	The distribution of substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) in the guinea pig brain has been studied by immunohistochemistry and the results compared with the distribution in similar regions in the rat brain. In both species, dense SP-LI staining was found in the median eminence, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe and dorsal tegmental nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and spinal cord. Less dense staining was found in the caudate putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, habenula, hypothalamic areas, and central grey. SP-LI cell bodies were found in areas previously described for the rat brain including several hypothalamic areas, limbic areas, central grey, and dorsal raphe and solitary tract nuclei. The major difference between the two species was found in the cortex and hippocampus. The guinea pig cortex contained many more SP-LI cells and fibres, distributed in layers II-VI, than the rat cortex. The guinea pig hippocampus contained marked staining, particularly in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1-3 fields of Ammon's horn and in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, and SP-LI cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, whereas rat hippocampus contained few cells and no regions of dense staining. It is concluded that because the guinea pig brain has an extensive distribution of SP-LI in the cortex and hippocampus it resembles the primate brain more closely than does the rat brain.
1385367	Galanin-like immunoreactivity was localized in the brain of Urodela (Ambystoma, Pleurodeles) and Anura (Bufo, Xenopus) by immunocytochemistry with anti-porcine galanin antiserum. In the four species, immunoreactive perikarya were observed in the telencephalon (striatum, amygdala), diencephalon preoptic area mainly along the anterodorsal wall of the preoptic recessus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, ventral and dorsal infundibular nuclei, paraventricular organ, and rhombencephalon (nucleus of the solitary tract). Galaninergic fibres extended in similar regions and in the medial septum, ventral telencephalon, ventral hypothalamus, median eminence, and various mesencephalic and rhombencephalic regions. Contacts with the cerebrospinal fluid cavity occurred along the preoptic recessus (Ambystoma) and the ventral infundibular wall (all species). Fibres were scarce in the neurohypophysis. The distal and intermediate lobes of the pituitary were virtually devoid of immunoreactivity. The galaninergic system appeared more developed in adult amphibia than in young animals, suggesting the stimulating influence of sex steroids on the expression of galanin as previously described in Anguilla. The extensive distribution of the galanin-like immunoreactive neurons in amphibian brains suggests that this peptide may act as a neuromodulatur and/or neurotransmitter.
1388697	Brain phenolsulfotransferase (PST) in 105.000 x g supernatant fractions prepared from post mortem human brain catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of dopamine (DA). Using 50 microM DA, the PST activity was linear up to one hour. The KM value for DA was 3.1 microM. Higher concentrations of DA from 25 b microM up caused inhibition of PST activity. Assessment of regional distribution in normal brain using 20 microM DA concentration revealed the highest PST activities in temporal and frontal cortex. About ten times lower activities were measured in parietal and occipital lobe, amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, whereas the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis of Meynert, caudate nucleus, and substantia nigra showed the lowest activities (about 1% of those in frontal and parietal cortex). In the brains of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with levodopa, a significant reduction of PST activities was observed in hypothalamus, frontal and temporal cortex, amygdaloid nucleus, occipital and parietal cortex (between 20 and 38.8% of controls). Depletion of PST activity was less severe in hippocampus (46% of controls), nucleus accumbens, putamen, and substantia nigra (67 and 72% of controls, respectively). No changes were observed in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, while PST activity was increased in the caudate nucleus (174 to 203% of controls). The presented data indicate that on PD brain the PST activity is reduced in areas of the cerebral isocortex and limbic system, while in the basal ganglia it is either mildly reduced (putamen) or increased (caudate nucleus). Selective changes of PST activity in PD brain may indicate an important function of this enzyme in the metabolism and/or storage of DA under pathological conditions.
1393292	1. It has been demonstrated previously that conversion of big endothelin-1 (bET-1) to endothelin-1 (ET-1) is inhibited in vitro and in vivo by phosphoramidon. In addition, ET-1 binding sites and mRNA have been shown within the brain. Here we expand upon our previous observation that rat brain contains phosphoramidon-inhibitable endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) and show that this activity is not uniformly distributed throughout the brain. 2. ECE activity was detected by a bioassay which depended upon the 10,000 fold difference in potency between bET-1 and ET-1 as stimulants of guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) accumulation in kidney epithelial (PK1) cells of the pig. Data were confirmed by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employing antibody directed against ET-1/3(17-21). 3. Following homogenization of the whole brain and ultracentrifugation the 100,000 g pellet contained greater than 4 times more ECE activity than the cytosol. Washing of the pellet with KCl (1 M) and extraction with the detergent CHAPS (20 mM) revealed a phosphoramidon-inhibitable ECE within the residual particulate fraction (nominally classified as the cytoskeletal fraction). Phosphoramidon (IC50, approx. 5 microM) or EDTA inhibited the conversion of bET-1 to ET-1 by the cytoskeletal fraction of rat brain by more than 60%.2+ 4. Following dissection of rat brain into olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, midbrain (including thalamus), hypothalamus and medulla oblongata (including pons) the greatest ECE was detected in the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata.After fractionation, the ECE-activities in the cytoskeletal fractions prepared from the hypothalamus or medulla oblongata were inhibited concentration-dependently by phosphoramidon or EDTA, with maximum inhibitions of>80% and >70%, respectively.5. These data show that rat brain contains a phosphoramidon- and EDTA-inhibitable ECE which maybe similar to that present in endothelial cells. The localization of this enzyme correlates with published reports of immunoreactive-ET-l, ET-1-binding sites, and messenger RNA for ET-1 in the rat brain, and suggests the presence of the entire synthetic pathway for ET-1.
1393516	Horseradish peroxidase or tritiated proline was unilaterally injected into the medial pallium in bullfrogs in order to determine the sources of afferent projections to the medial pallium and the targets of pallial efferent projections. Some cells in all telencephalic centers, except the corpus striatum and the pars lateralis of the amygdala, project to the ipsilateral medial pallium. The medial pallium receives projections from fewer centers in the contralateral hemisphere, which include the medial septal nucleus, the pars medialis of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the pallial commissure and the medial pallium. The raphe nucleus and the anterior thalamic nuclei appear to be the only sources of afferents to the medial pallium from outside the telencephalon. Efferents of the medial pallium are far more extensive than reported in earlier studies. The medial pallium projects ipsilaterally to all telencephalic nuclei, with the exception of a large part of the corpus striatum, and contralaterally to the medial septal nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, amygdala, medial pallium and bed nucleus of the pallial commissure. Extensive efferent projections also terminate in preoptic and hypothalamic regions, as well as in most thalamic relay nuclei, the pretectum and, possibly, the optic tectum. Similarities to the medial pallium in other tetrapods and to that in mammals suggest that the medial pallium in anurans is homologous to the subicular and CA fields and, possibly, the dentate gyrus in mammals. However, the extensive projections of the medial pallium to the dorsal thalamus and pretectum in anurans may be primitive features of the medial pallium retained in anurans, or uniquely derived features in anurans.
1401259	The anatomical organization of cholinergic markers such as acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, and nerve growth factor receptors was investigated in the basal ganglia of the human brain. The distribution of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive axons and varicosities and their relationship to regional perikarya showed that the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus of the human brain receive widespread cholinergic innervation. Components of the striatum (i.e., the putamen, caudate, olfactory tubercle, and nucleus accumbens) displayed the highest density of cholinergic varicosities. The next highest density of cholinergic innervation was detected in the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. The level of cholinergic innervation was of intermediate density in the globus pallidus and the ventral tegmental area and low in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Immunoreactivity for nerve growth factor receptors (NGFr) was confined to the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and their processes. Axonal immunoreactivity for NGFr was therefore used as a marker for cholinergic projections originating from the basal forebrain (Woolf et al., '89: Neuroscience 30:143-152). Although the vast majority of striatal cholinergic innervation was NGFr-negative and, therefore, intrinsic, the striatum also contained NGFr-positive axons, indicating the existence of an additional cholinergic input from the basal forebrain. This basal forebrain cholinergic innervation was more pronounced in the putamen than in the caudate. The distribution of NGFr-positive axons suggested that the basal forebrain may also project to the globus pallidus but probably not to the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, or red nucleus. The great majority of cholinergic innervation to these latter three structures and to parts of the globus pallidus appeared to come from cholinergic neurons outside the basal forebrain, most of which are probably located in the upper brainstem. These observations indicate that cholinergic neurotransmission originating from multiple sources is likely to play an important role in the diverse motor and behavioral affiliations that have been attributed to the human basal ganglia.
1403090	The tetradecapeptide somatostatin has been implicated as an important regulator of neuronal and neuroendocrine function in the CNS. The cellular actions of somatostatin are mediated by specific receptors. The genes encoding two different somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) have been isolated and characterized, and RNA blotting studies have shown that both SSTR1 and SSTR2 are expressed in the brain. In order to gain a better understanding of the functions of somatostatin in the CNS, the distribution of SSTR1 and SSTR2 mRNAs was determined using the technique of in situ hybridization. SSTR1 mRNA was present throughout the mouse brain, particularly in the supra- and infragranular layers of the cortex, the amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, hypothalamus, pretectum, substantia nigra, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. SSTR2 mRNA was primarily observed in the infragranular layers of the cortex, the amygdala, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and medial habenular nucleus. Several regions of the brain reported to contain dense somatostatin-like immunoreactive terminal fields and receptor binding sites were devoid of both SSTR1 and SSTR2 mRNA, suggesting the existence of additional SSTR subtypes.
1403102	The reinforcing properties of cocaine can readily become associated with salient environmental stimuli that acquire secondary reinforcing properties. This form of classical conditioning is of considerable clinical relevance as intense craving can be evoked by the presentation of stimuli previously associated with the effects of cocaine. To understand better the neurobiology of cocaine-induced environment-specific conditioning, Fos expression was examined in the forebrain of rats exposed to an environment in which they had previously received cocaine. These results were compared to those observed following an acute injection of cocaine. Consistent with its stimulant actions, cocaine produced an increase in locomotion that was accompanied by an increase in Fos expression within specific limbic regions (cingulate cortex, claustrum, piriform cortex, lateral septal nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, lateral habenula, and amygdala) as well as the basal ganglia (dorsomedial striatum and nucleus accumbens). Exposure of rats to the cocaine-paired environment also produced an increase in locomotion, as compared to various control groups. In addition to this behavioral effect, conditioned subjects exhibited a significant increase in Fos expression within the cingulate cortex, claustrum, lateral septal nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, lateral habenula, and the amygdala, suggesting increased neuronal activity within these regions. In contrast to the dramatic effects observed within these structures, no conditional activation was observed within the piriform cortex, nucleus accumbens, or dorsal striatum, suggesting that these brain areas are not involved in the conditioned response. The present findings indicate that specific limbic regions exhibit increased neuronal activation during the presentation of cocaine-paired cues and may be involved in the formation of associations between cocaine's stimulant actions and the environment in which the drug administration occurred. Although the nucleus accumbens is necessary for the reinforcing and locomotor effects of cocaine, it does not exhibit a conditional Fos response, suggesting that different neural circuits are involved in the unconditioned and conditioned effects of cocaine.
1421530	The use of 3H-paroxetine as a ligand for quantitative autoradiography of serotonin (5-HT) transport sites was optimized, and the distribution of 3H-paroxetine binding sites in rat brain was studied. Under the conditions described, 3H-paroxetine binding in forebrain sections was of high affinity and saturable, with a Kd of 0.18 +/- 0.02 nM (mean +/- SEM) and Bmax of 268 +/- 12 fmol/mg of protein (n = 3). Nonspecific binding was 10.7% +/- 1.0 of the total binding (n = 8). The distribution of 3H-paroxetine binding sites closely matched the regional distribution of 5-HT nerve terminals and cell bodies. The highest concentrations of 3H-paroxetine binding sites were found in the dorsal raphe nucleus (563 +/- 55 fmol/mg tissue, n = 4), and high densities of binding were also found in the locus coeruleus, medial forebrain bundle, substantia nigra, several limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, olfactory tubercle, septum, and thalamus), and components of the visual relay system (superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate body). Although lesioning of 5-HT neurons with p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) drastically eliminated 3H-paroxetine binding in most regions of the rat brain, significant binding remained in the raphe nuclei and medial forebrain bundle suggesting that 3H-paroxetine binding in these regions was to presynaptic sites on cell bodies or axons relatively resistant to PCA.
1423513	The distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), immunoreactive structures in the central nervous system of the frog, Rana esculenta, was studied using the peroxidase immunohistochemical method. Immunoreactive perikarya were found in all major parts of the brain. In the forebrain, neurons of the septohippocampal formation, the amygdala, the ventromedial and posterocentral thalamic nuclei, and the cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons in the diencephalic periventricular organ showed immunoreactivity. The pear-shaped neurons of the optic tectum, and perikarya of the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain were also immunoreactive. In the hindbrain, neurons of the cranial nerve motor nuclei, neurons of the superior vestibular nucleus, giant cells of the reticular formation, and preganglionic parasympathetic neurons of the superior salivatory nucleus were stained. Motoneurons presented immunostaining also in the spinal cord. Immunoreactive fibers were shown to occur in the olfactory tract, the striatum, the tegmentum and the basis mesencephali, the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve, the solitary tract, Lissauer's tract, and the dorsal horn of spinal cord. A comparison of the distribution of CGRP immunoreactivity in the mammalian and amphibian central nervous system revealed that, in relation to the size of the brain, CGRP is more extensively distributed in the amphibian than in the mammalian limbic system.
1430307	Distribution of the mRNA for a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1), which is linked to phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, was investigated in adult and developing rat central nervous system (CNS) by in situ hybridization. Transcripts of mGluR1 were specifically localized to neurons and widely distributed throughout the adult rat brain. Most intensely labeled neurons were Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb, and neurons in the hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, ventral pallidum, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, substantia nigra, and dorsal cochlear nucleus. Moderately labeled neurons were seen in high density in the dentate gyrus, striatum, islands of Calleja, superficial layers of the retrosplenial, cingulate and entorhinal cortices, mammillary nuclei, red nucleus, and superior colliculus. In the developing rat brain, the level of mGluR1 expression gradually increased during early postnatal days in accordance with the maturation of neuronal elements. These results show prominent expression of mGluR1 in the major targets of putative glutamatergic pathways and unique distribution pattern of mGluR1 distinct from those reported for ionotropic subtypes of glutamate receptors, suggesting specific roles of mGluR1 in the glutamatergic system.
1430327	The connections of a relatively homogeneous band of neurons in the caudal amygdala have been examined with anterograde and retrograde axonal tracing methods in the rat. This region, called here the posterior nucleus of the amygdala (PA), corresponds in part to an area that has been referred to as the cortico-amygdaloid transition area, posterior part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, amygdalo-hippocampal transition area, and posteromedial basal nucleus. Experiments with fluorogold and phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) indicate that the major neuronal input to the PA arises in the ventral premammillary nucleus, and that substantial projections also arise in olfactory-related areas such as the medial nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, and posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, as well as in the ventral subiculum and adjacent parts of hippocampal field CA1. Other seemingly minor inputs, including cholinergic fibers from the substantia innominata, dopaminergic fibers from the ventral tegmental area, and serotoninergic fibers from the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, were also identified. The efferent projections of the PA as determined with the PHAL method appear to follow five major routes: 1) a relatively small group of laterally directed fibers innervates the dorsal endopiriform nucleus, and a few of these fibers reach cortical area TR and the lateral entorhinal area; 2) another small group of fibers courses medially to innervate the ventral subiculum and adjacent parts of field CA1; 3) many fibers course ventrally to innervate the outer molecular layer of the medial part of the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala; 4) a moderate group of fibers courses rostrally to innervate primarily the posterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, although some fibers continue on to end less densely in rostral parts of the medial nucleus of the amygdala before leaving the amygdala through the ansa peduncularis; and 5) the major output of the PA courses through the stria terminalis. One branch of this pathway massively innervates the principal nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis before entering the medial hypothalamus, where it ends massively in the anteroventral periventricular and medial preoptic nuclei, ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus and adjacent parts of the basal lateral hypothalamic area, and ventral premammillary nucleus. The other branch sends fibers to the ventral lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and infralimbic area of the prefrontal cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1430328	The projections of the ventral subiculum are organized differentially along the dorsoventral (or septotemporal) axis of this cortical field, with more ventral regions playing a particularly important role in hippocampal communication with the amygdala, bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BST), and rostral hypothalamus. In the present study we re-examined the projection of the ventral subiculum to these regions with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) method in the rat. The results confirm and extend earlier conclusions based primarily on the autoradiographic method. Projections from the ventral subiculum course either obliquely through the angular bundle to innervate the amygdala and adjacent parts of the temporal lobe, or follow the alveus and fimbria to the precommissural fornix and medial corticohypothalamic tract. The major amygdalar terminal field is centered in the posterior basomedial nucleus, while other structures that appear to be innervated include the piriformamygdaloid area, the posterior basolateral, posterior cortical, posterior, central, medial, and intercalated nuclei, and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. Projections from the ventral subiculum reach the BST mainly by way of the precommissural fornix, and provide rather dense inputs to the anterodorsal area as well as the transverse and interfascicular nuclei. The medial corticohypothalamic tract is the main route taken by fibers from the ventral subiculum to the hypothalamus, where they innervate the medial preoptic area, "shell" of the ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, ventral premammillary nucleus, and cell-poor zone around the medial mammillary nucleus. We also observed a rather dense terminal field just dorsal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus that extends dorsally and caudally to fill the subparaventricular zone along the medial border of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and ventrolateral border of the paraventricular nucleus. The general pattern of outputs to the hypothalamus and septum is strikingly similar for the ventral subiculum and suprachiasmatic nucleus, the endogenous circadian rhythm generator.
1430329	The projections of the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) have been examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) method in adult male rats. The results indicate that the nucleus gives rise to two major ascending pathways and a smaller descending pathway. One large ascending pathway terminates densely in most regions of the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus, with the notable exception of the suprachiasmatic, suprachiasmatic preoptic, and median preoptic nuclei. This pathway is in a position to influence directly many cell groups known to regulate anterior pituitary function. The second large pathway ascends through the medial zone of the hypothalamus and densely innervates the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus and adjacent basal parts of the lateral hypothalamic area, medial preoptic nucleus, principal nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, ventral lateral septal nucleus, posterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, posterior nucleus, and immediately adjacent regions of the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala. It is already known that these regions are major components of the sexually dimorphic circuit, and, interestingly, that they provide the major neural inputs to the PMv. The smaller descending projection from the PMv seems to innervate preferentially the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, although a small number of fibers appear to end in the tuberomammillary nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, specific regions of the medial mammillary nucleus, interfascicular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, dorsal nucleus of the raphe, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, Barrington's nucleus, and locus coeruleus. Relatively sparse terminal fields associated with ascending fibers were also observed in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus; in the nucleus reuniens, parataenial nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and mediodorsal nucleus; in the central nucleus of the amygdala, anterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, posterior part of the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala; and in the ventral subiculum and adjacent parts of hippocampal field CA1, and the infralimbic and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the PMv receives two major inputs--one from the sexually dimorphic circuit, and the other from the blood in the form of gonadal steroid hormones--and gives rise to two major outputs: one (perhaps feed-forward) to the neuroendocrine (periventricular) zone of the hypothalamus, and the other (perhaps feed-back) to the sexually dimorphic circuit.
1432106	To identify rat brainstem nuclei involved in the initial, short-term response to a change in gravito-inertial force, adult Long-Evans rats were rotated in the horizontal plane for 90 min in complete darkness after they were eccentrically positioned off the axis of rotation (off-axis) causing a centripetal acceleration of 2 g. Neural activation was defined by the brainstem distribution of the c-fos primary response gene protein, Fos, using immunohistochemistry. The Fos labeling in off-axis animals was compared with that of control animals who were rotated on the axis of rotation (on-axis) with no centripetal acceleration, or who were restrained but not rotated. In the off-axis animals there was a significant labeling of neurons: in the inferior, medial, and y-group subnuclei of the vestibular complex; in subnuclei of the inferior olive, especially the dorsomedial cell column; in midbrain nuclei, including the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and dorsolateral periaqueductal gray; in autonomic centers including the solitary nucleus, area postrema, and locus coeruleus; and in reticular nuclei including the lateral reticular nucleus and the lateral parabrachial nucleus. Also, there was greater Fos expression in the dorsomedial cell column, the principal inferior olive subnuclei, inferior vestibular nucleus, the dorsolateral central gray, and the locus coeruleus in animals who had their heads restrained compared to animals whose heads were not restrained. As one control, the vestibular neuroepithelium was destroyed by injecting sodium arsanilate into the middle ear, bilaterally. This resulted in a complete lack of Fos labeling in the vestibular nuclei and the inferior olive, and a significant reduction in labeling in other nuclei in the off-axis condition, indicating that these nuclei have a significant labyrinth-sensitive component to their Fos labeling. The data indicate that several novel brainstem regions, including the dorsomedial cell column of the inferior olive and the periaqueductal gray, as well as more traditional brainstem nuclei including vestibular and oculomotor related nuclei, respond to otolith activation during a sustained centripetal acceleration.
1434290	Input neuronal structures to the nucleus locus subcoeruleus (LSC) and the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis (PoO) were investigated by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) study in cats. Under halothane anesthesia, a double barreled electrode was inserted into the LSC where electrical stimulation increased bladder capacity and the external urethral sphincter muscle activity, and into the PoO where chemical stimulation with carbachol increased bladder capacity and decreased the external urethral sphincter muscle activity. After identification of these regions, the HRP was ionphoretically injected into the LSC or PoO. By injecting the HRP into the LSC, retrogradely HRP labeled cells were located broadly in the frontal, rectal, orbitalis, rostral cingulate, internal aspect of posterior sigmoidal and anterior sylvian gyli, nucleus corticomedialis of amygdala, lateral area of the hypothalamus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, reticular formation of the mesencephalon, pons and medulla, cerebellar nuclei and intermediate gray of the spinal cord. By injecting the HRP into the PoO, retrogradely HRP labeled cells were located broadly in the frontal, rectal, orbitalis, internal aspect of the posterior sigmoidal and anterior sylvian gyli, lateral area of the hypothalamus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, periaqueductal gray, reticular formation of the mesencephalon, pons and medulla, cerebellar nuclei and intermediate gray of the spinal cord. These areas where HRP labeled cells were located mostly corresponded to the areas where electrical stimulation evoked either bladder relaxation or contraction in the previous reports. The LSC and the PoO seem to perform important roles in the neuronal mechanism for urine storage, receiving the inputs which facilitate or inhibit micturition from the extended areas between the cerebral cortex and the sacral spinal cord.
1436660	The effects of i.v. administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were examined in both healthy adult (3-5 months old) and healthy aged (24-25 months old) male Wistar rats under halothane anesthesia. The rCBFs in 9 different brain regions-cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, hippocampus, thalamus + hypothalamus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla-were measured by [14C]iodoantipyrine method. In the adult rats, i.v. administration of TRH (300 micrograms/kg) produced significant increases in rCBFs in cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, hippocampus, thalamus + hypothalamus and superior colliculus. In the aged rats, the rCBFs in all brain regions measured did not change significantly by TRH administration. From these results, it is suggested that the system involved in TRH-induced vasodilatation of cerebral blood vessels was impaired with aging.
1437720	The distribution of neurokinin B (NKB) was determined by immunocytochemistry with antisera directed toward its amino terminus. Immunoreactive perikarya were detected in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, cortical regions, the olfactory tubercle, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the diagonal band of Broca, the nucleus accumbens, the septum, the neostriatum, several hypothalamic nuclei, the superior colliculus, the central gray, the substantia nigra, the medullary reticular formation, and the external cuneate nucleus. The distribution of NKB-containing perikarya revealed by immunocytochemistry was similar to the distribution of protachykinin B-containing cells previously visualized by in situ hybridization. Immunoreactive nerve fibers and terminals were detected in all major subdivisions of the brain. The levels of NKB measured by radioimmunoassay were highest in the hypothalamus. The distribution of NKB in the rat brain was similar to the distribution of substance P; however, there were several regions where the two distributions were clearly different.
1438479	Cocaine HCl (0, 10, or 50 mg/kg) was injected into adult male ICR mice IP. Thirty minutes later, brains were removed and nine regions were isolated: olfactory bulbs (OB), olfactory tubercles (OT), prefrontal cortex (PC), septum (SP), striatum (ST), amygdala (AMY), hypothalamus (HT), hippocampus (HC), and thalamus (TH). Using high-performance liquid chromatography, concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their major metabolites were determined. At 10 mg/kg cocaine, NE levels were increased in the AMY and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), was decreased in the PC, AMY, and HT. DA levels were also increased in the AMY, while its intracellular metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), was decreased in the ST and its extracellular metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), was decreased in the PC. 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT) levels were not altered in any tissue. 5-HT levels were increased in the AMY, HT, and TH, while its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was decreased in the OB and ST. MHPG/NE ratios were decreased in the PC, AMY, and HT as were those for HVA/DA. DOPAC/DA ratios were decreased in the ST and AMY and increased in the SP while those for 3-MT/DA were decreased in the TH and increased in the PC. 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios were decreased in the AMY, HC and TH. At 50 mg/kg cocaine, there was an increase in DA in the TH. There was a decrease in DOPAC, HVA, and 3-MT, as well as the DOPAC/DA ratio in the ST. In the OT, there was a decrease in DOPAC, the DOPAC/DA ratio, 3-MT, and the 3-MT/DA ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1460107	The orbitofrontal cortex of the monkey can be subdivided into a caudal agranular sector, a transitional dysgranular sector, and an anterior granular sector. The neural input into these sectors was investigated with the help of large horseradish peroxidase injections that covered the different sectors of orbitofrontal cortex. The distribution of retrograde labeling showed that the majority of the cortical projections to orbitofrontal cortex arises from a restricted set of telencephalic sources, which include prefrontal cortex, lateral, and inferomedial temporal cortex, the temporal pole, cingulate gyrus, insula, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and claustrum. The posterior portion of the orbitofrontal cortex receives additional input from the piriform cortex and the anterolateral portion from gustatory, somatosensory, and premotor areas. Thalamic projections to the orbitofrontal cortex arise from midline and intralaminar nuclei, from the anteromedial nucleus, the medial dorsal nucleus, and the pulvinar nucleus. Orbitofrontal cortex also receives projections from the hypothalamus, nucleus basalis, ventral tegmental area, the raphe nuclei, the nucleus locus coeruleus, and scattered neurons of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum. The non-isocortical (agranular-dysgranular) sectors of orbitofrontal cortex receive more intense projections from the non-isocortical sectors of paralimbic areas, the hippocampus, amygdala, and midline thalamic nuclei, whereas the isocortical (granular) sector receives more intense projections from the dorsolateral prefrontal area, the granular insula, granular temporopolar cortex, posterolateral temporal cortex, and from the medial dorsal and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. Retrograde labeling within cingulate, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices was most pronounced when the injection site extended medially into the dysgranular paraolfactory cortex of the gyrus rectus, an area that can be conceptualized as an orbitofrontal extension of the cingulate complex. These observations demonstrate that the orbitofrontal cortex has cytoarchitectonically organized projections and that it provides a convergence zone for afferents from heteromodal association and limbic areas. The diverse connections of orbitofrontal cortex are in keeping with the participation of this region in visceral, gustatory, and olfactory functions and with its importance in memory, motivation, and epileptogenesis.
1460748	To elucidate the mechanism of general anesthesia, effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on dopamine metabolism in rat brain were studied. Sevoflurane 3% was administered for 20 minutes to Wistar male rats weighing 230-270 g under spontaneous respiration. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains were rapidly removed. They were dissected into nine discrete regions, locus coeruleus, pons plus, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex. The contents of dopamine (DA) and its major metabolites, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with the dual-cell coulometric detector before anesthesia, 20 minutes after the start of anesthesia and at the recovery from anesthesia. Significant increases in DA levels were observed in the pons, hypothalamus, thalamus and amygdala by sevoflurane anesthesia as compared with the control group. DOPAC levels increased significantly in the pons, hypothalamus, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex at the recovery from anesthesia. A significant increase in HVA levels was observed in amygdala by sevoflurane anesthesia, while an appreciable decrease in HVA levels was observed in hippocampus at recovery from anesthesia. It is concluded that DA metabolism is significantly suppressed in the pons, hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain and amygdala during sevoflurane anesthesia and this change in DA metabolism may be associated with the mechanism of sevoflurane anesthesia.
1465195	A new class of G-proteins, the Gq family, has been recently identified and found to be involved in phospholipase C activation. The alpha subunits of the Gq and G11 members of this family are separate polypeptides but appear to have the same function. In this study, the cellular distribution in the adult rat brain of these G-proteins, Gq alpha/G11 alpha, was determined by immunohistochemistry using an antipeptide antiserum directed against the predicted C-terminal decapeptide which is conserved between these polypeptides. The specificity of the antiserum was verified by Western blot analysis using rat brain homogenates. Immunoreactivity was detected in neurons, where it was localized in the dendrites and at the periphery of the cell bodies. The staining was abundant in the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Staining was also found in neurons in the olfactory bulb, minor and major islets of Calleja, anterior olfactory nuclei and piriform cortex; the different cortical areas especially in their superficial layers; caudate-putamen, accumbens and olfactory tubercle; lateral septum and amygdala; hippocampal CA2-4 sectors of Ammon's horn, dentate gyrus and hilus; hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus; cerebellar granular layer; colliculi and superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In conclusion, the brain neuronal localizations of Gq alpha/G11 alpha match that of phospholipase C, 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and, to a lesser extent 1,4,5-triphosphate-3-kinase.
1465196	Tachykinins exert a broad range of actions in the mammalian nervous system. While much is known about the localization of peptides derived from one of the two mammalian tachykinin genes (substance P- and neurokinin A-encoding preprotachykinin), little has been reported on the localization of peptides derived from a second tachykinin gene encoding neurokinin B. Using an antiserum raised against a 30-residue peptide fragment (Peptide 2) of the protein precursor to neurokinin B, we have mapped the distribution of Peptide 2 by immunocytochemistry. Peptide 2 antiserum specificity was determined by western blot analysis (which showed antibody cross-reactivity to a neurokinin B fusion protein from a cloned neurokinin B-encoding complementary DNA) and by the elimination of immunoreactive product in brain tissue sections upon preabsorption with a 10 microM concentration of Peptide 2 peptide. In addition, we report on the distribution of neurokinin B-messenger RNA with a full-length complementary RNA probe to localize cells that express the neurokinin B precursor. Peptide 2 immunoreactivity and neurokinin B-messenger RNA-positive cells were found, in some instances, paralleling the distribution of substance P and in other cases existing separately from substance P. Peptide 2 immunoreactivity as well as neurokinin B-messenger RNA-positive cells were found in the main olfactory bulb, cortex, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, medial habenula, periaqueductal gray, superior and inferior colliculus, and nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract. Whereas substance P is found throughout the rat brain, neurokinin B appears to be partitioned more to forebrain than to brainstem structures. The marked differences in the distribution of both tachykinins in the rat central nervous system suggests that neurokinin B may play an important role in olfactory, gustatory, visceral, and neuroendocrine processing of information.
1467968	In order to determine the possible contribution of altered distribution of morphine in the morphine tolerance process, the distribution of morphine was studied in brain regions and spinal cord, following its intravenous administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made tolerant to morphine by implanting 6 morphine pellets, each containing 75 mg of morphine base, for 7 days. Seventy-two hours after the removal of the pellets, a time when serum morphine levels were negligible or absent and yet tolerance to the pharmacological effects of morphine was present, morphine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) was injected in placebo and morphine pellet implanted rats. At various times (5, 30, 60, 120 and 360 min) after the injection of morphine, brain regions (hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, pons and medulla, striatum and amygdala), spinal cord and serum were collected. The level of morphine in the tissues was determined by using a highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Five minutes after morphine injection, the concentration of morphine was the highest in the hypothalamus and the lowest in amygdala. The concentration of morphine in hypothalamus, pons and medulla, hippocampus and midbrain of morphine tolerant rats was smaller than in placebo pellet implanted rats. The tissue to serum ratio of morphine in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain and cortex were also smaller in morphine tolerant than in non-tolerant rats. The concentration of morphine in brain regions with time did not exhibit linearity. At other time intervals like 30 and 60 min, the concentration of morphine in several brain regions and spinal cord was significantly higher in morphine tolerant than in non-tolerant rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1467977	Several studies have demonstrated that exogenous bombesin (BN) elicits a potent satiety effect when administered centrally or systemically. It has been suggested that BN-like peptides may play a physiological role in the control of food intake. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the levels of endogenous BN-like peptides change in response to a meal. All rats were food deprived overnight for a 12 h period. Half the animals were then allowed to feed for 35 min (postprandial group) and the remainder formed the preprandial group. Regions of the brain (hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla, pons, neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulbs, striatum, midbrain and pituitary), gut (oesophagus, fundus, antrum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon) and adrenal glands were analyzed for BN-like peptide levels using radioimmunoassay. Our results indicate significant increases in the levels of BN-like peptides in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, as well as in the antrum of the stomach, after food ingestion. These results are the first to demonstrate the activation of endogenous BN-like peptide mechanisms in response to ingestion. These rapid alterations in peptide levels may support the contention that BN-like peptides play a physiological role in the regulation of ingestive behavior.
1484125	The projections of the supramammillary nucleus (SUM) were examined in the rat by the anterograde anatomical tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The majority of labeled fibers from SUM ascended through the forebrain within the medial forebrain bundle. SUM fibers were found to terminate heavily in the hippocampal formation, specifically within the granule cell layer and immediately adjoining molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. In addition, SUM fibers were shown to distribute densely to several structures with strong connections with the hippocampus, namely, the nucleus reunions of the thalamus, the medial and lateral septum, the entorhinal cortex, and the endopiriform nucleus. SUM fibers were also shown to project significantly to several additional subcortical and cortical sites. The subcortical sites were the dorsal raphe nucleus, the midbrain central gray, the fields of Forel/zona incerta, the dorsomedial hypothalamic area, midline/intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (posterior paraventricular, rhomboid, central medial, intermediodorsal, and mediodorsal), the medial and lateral preoptic areas, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the substantia innominata, the vertical limb of the diagonal band nucleus, and the claustrum. The cortical sites were the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. Some notable differences were observed in projections from the lateral as compared to the medial SUM. For example, fibers originating from the lateral SUM distributed heavily to the hippocampal formation and parts of the cortex, whereas those from the medial SUM projected sparsely to these two regions. The SUM projections to the hippocampal formation and associated structures may serve as the substrate for a SUM involvement in the generation of the theta rhythm of the hippocampus and the gating of information flow through the hippocampal formation.
1486501	In order to elucidate the neuronal mechanism of the motor disturbances of the Rolling mouse Nagoya (rolling), a neurological mutant mouse (genotype rol/rol) showing frequent lurching and falling over on walking, we determined absolute rates of local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) with the [14C]deoxyglucose method. The rates were compared with those of heterozygote (+/rol) with normal behavior, and of normal mice (+/+) of the same strain (C3Hf/Nga). Rolling showed marked and significant increases in LCGU in the structures of the basal ganglia such as the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta and pars reticulata, and subthalamic nucleus, confirming our previous finding with semiquantitative LCGU determination. Additional significant but much less marked increases in LCGU of rolling were found in some structures of the brainstem and limbic system, such as the pedunculopontine nucleus, red nucleus, ventral tegmental area, lateral habenula, and CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus. Although rolling has been regarded as an animal model of cerebellar ataxia, rolling showed no alterations of LCGU in the cerebellum. The heterozygote showed intermediate increases in LCGU between rolling and normal mice in the basal ganglia structures such as the globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and subthalamic nucleus. Our findings indicate that rolling has a definite, genetically determined dysfunction of the basal ganglia. The primary site of the basal ganglia dysfunction might probably be in the striatum, involving both the neostriatum and limbic striatum, and resulting in secondary dysfunction in their target structures.
1501769	The expression of c-fos protein was examined by immunohistochemistry in serial sections of brainstem following the instillation of either autologous arterial blood (0.3 ml) or mock cerebrospinal fluid (0.3 ml) through a catheter placed in the cisterna magna, or following catheter placement alone in pentobarbital-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. After injection, blood was distributed within the subarachnoid space surrounding the brainstem and in the region of the circle of Willis. c-fos protein-like immunoreactivity was present at 1 h, peaked at 2 h and decreased by 8 h. At 2 h, immunoreactivity was strongly expressed within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (lamina I, IIo), as well as within nucleus of the solitary tract, area postrema, ependyma, pia mater and arachnoid in every animal. Moderate labeling was found in parabrachial nucleus, medullary lateral reticular nucleus and central gray. Sparse labeling was present in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (lamina III-V) and trigeminal nucleus interpolaris; few or no labeled cells were detected in other parts of the trigeminal nuclear complex, thalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex or trigeminal ganglion. The number of positive cells was not related to the volume of injectate but was related to the amount of injected blood. The density of cell labeling evoked by injecting mock cerebrospinal fluid or after catheter placement was markedly lower than after blood in all brainstem areas. The number of labeled cells was greatly reduced within trigeminal nuclear complex, parabrachial nucleus and medullary lateral reticular nucleus, but not within the nucleus of the solitary tract, area postrema or ependyma when blood was injected into adult animals in which unmyelinated C-fibers were destroyed by neonatal capsaicin treatment. Similar results were obtained after blood was instilled into the cisterna magna of rats in which meningeal afferents were chronically sectioned at the ethmoidal foramen bilaterally. We conclude that blood in the subarachnoid space is an effective stimulus for activating c-fos expression within subpopulations of brainstem neurons. Activation within trigeminal nucleus caudalis is mediated in large part by excitation of small-caliber meningeal afferents (trigeminovascular fibers), whereas c-fos expression within nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema may reflect direct stimulation of blood or blood products, or possibly the response to autonomic activation from noxious stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1515911	The spatial distribution of cells in the adult rodent forebrain which express estrogen receptor mRNA, as shown by in situ hybridization histochemistry with isotopically-labeled probes, has been reported to overlap with regions that are known targets of estrogen and which bind estrogen. The extent to which detection of estrogen receptor mRNA within developing forebrain neurons of the postnatal day 10-12 female rat is accompanied by translation into estrogen binding sites was investigated by combining [125I]estrogen autoradiography with non-isotopic (digoxigenin) in situ hybridization, using a 48-base oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe encoding a sequence of the estrogen-binding domain of rat uterine estrogen receptor cDNA. Estrogen receptor mRNA and estrogen binding sites appeared to be restricted to neurons. No mRNA or binding was seen in ependymal cells. Cells expressing estrogen receptor mRNA were widely distributed in the developing rat forebrain and were found in brain regions generally corresponding to those previously shown in the adult, with the addition of some regions not previously described, such as the medial habenula and dorsal endopiriform nucleus. Although there was widespread overlapping of estrogen receptor mRNA expression with known estrogen binding sites, there were regional and cellular variations in the extent of receptor mRNA translation. This pattern was true for developing forebrain regions previously defined as estrogen receptor-containing (hypothalamus, preoptic area, medial and lateral septum, vertical and horizontal nuclei of the diagonal band, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala) as well as for regions heretofore not considered estrogen targets (the thalamus, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, ventral pallidum/substantia innominata and the basal nucleus of Meynert) or characterized as estrogen-responsive in the adult without previously documented estrogen binding [caudate-putamen (striatum)]. While estrogen binding and receptor mRNA expression always co-localized, neurons expressing estrogen receptor mRNA did not always exhibit ligand binding and there was no clear-cut relationship between the intensity of the hybridization signal and estrogen binding. Little, however, is known about translational control of estrogen receptor expression in the brain. Localization of estrogen binding sites to regions not generally considered targets of estrogen would appear to reflect the greater sensitivity of the iodinated ligand than the tritiated estrogens more commonly used for autoradiography. Non-isotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry combined with [125I]estrogen autoradiography represents a very powerful tool with which to study regulation of estrogen receptor gene expression at the single cell level with an exceptional degree of cellular and anatomical resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1517485	Evidence from tissue culture studies suggests that glial cells are the principal source of prostaglandins in the brain. We have used immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and enzyme activity assays to localize cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, in situ in the normal ovine brain. We observed very few immunoreactive glial cells. In contrast, an extensive distribution of COX-like immunoreactive (ir) neuronal cell bodies and dendrites and a corresponding pattern of COX enzyme activity were observed. COXir neurons were most abundant in forebrain sites involved in complex, integrative functions and autonomic regulation such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus. Moderate populations were observed in other regions of the central nervous system implicated in sensory afferent processing, including the dorsal column nuclei, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and superior colliculus, and in structures involved in autonomic regulation, such as the nucleus of the solitary tract, parabrachial nucleus, and the periaqueductal gray matter. We did not observe COXir axons or terminal fields, however. Our results suggest that neurons may use prostaglandins as intracellular or perhaps paracrine, but probably not synaptic, mediators in the normal brain.
1521138	Neurons located in the zona incerta (ZI) of the ventral thalamus project to several regions of the central nervous system, including the neocortex, superior colliculus, and brainstem. However, whether these projections are functionally segregated remains unknown. This issue was addressed here by combining neuroanatomical tracers with immunohistochemical staining for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or parvalbumin, coupled with neurophysiological mapping. GABAergic projection neurons were found in four distinct subregions of the ZI including: (1) the rostral pole of the ZI, from which neurons project to the supragranular layers of the neocortex (especially layer I); (2) the dorsal subregion of the ZI, where both ascending projections to the neocortex and descending projections to the pretectal area were observed; (3) the ventral subregion of the ZI, whose neurons project to the superior colliculus; and 3) the caudal pole of the ZI, from which descending projections to the lower brainstem and spinal cord were observed. Somatotopic representations of the contralateral cutaneous periphery were also identified in the dorsal and ventral subregions of ZI, both of which were found to receive dense direct afferent projections from the trigeminal complex, and dorsal column nuclei. These results suggest that the rat ZI is a major somatosensory relay in the ventral thalamus, carrying feed-forward inhibitory signals to neocortical and subcortical targets, in parallel with the excitatory somatosensory pathways.
1525648	We recorded extra- and intracellular responses from rat amygdaloid neurons in vivo after electrical stimulation of the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, hippocampal fields CA3 and CA4, entorhinal cortex, subicular complex); medial geniculate; and basal forebrain (diagonal band, ventral pallidum, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area, substantia innominata). Stimulation of hippocampal formation structures evoked IPSPs or EPSP-IPSP sequences in which the IPSP had a lower threshold than the EPSP. Recordings from candidate inhibitory neurons in the amygdala indicated that excitatory afferents from the hippocampal formation contact both amygdaloid inhibitory and principal neurons (feedforward inhibition), and that the inhibitory neurons have a lower threshold of activation. Medial geniculate stimulation also evoked EPSP-IPSP sequences. In marked contrast to these results, stimulation of basal forebrain structures evoked short latency IPSPs in amygdaloid neurons. This provides the first physiological evidence for direct inhibition of the amygdala by the basal forebrain. Basal forebrain stimulation also evoked EPSP-IPSP sequences in amygdaloid neurons. Individual amygdaloid neurons could show responses to stimulation of the hippocampal formation, basal forebrain, and medial geniculate, indicating that synaptic input from these areas converges onto single amygdaloid cells. The findings provide further information about the synaptic organization of afferents to the amygdala, and indicate that single amygdaloid neurons play a role in the synaptic integration of input from these diverse sources.
1525649	The immunohistochemical localization of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was studied in the adult rat brain, using a specific antibody against a synthetic bFGF fragment (the N-terminal 12 residues). Widespread but uneven regional localization of bFGF-like immunoreactive neurons and fibers was observed. Ependymal cells were also stained. The immunoreactive neurons were found in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, septum, basal magnocellular nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, red nucleus, central gray of the midbrain, cerebellum, dorsal tegmental area, reticular formation, cranial motor nuclei and spinal cord. Immunoreactive fiber bundles and nerve terminals were also detected. These results indicate that bFGF is produced by or present in a specific neuronal cell population of the central nervous system.
1527717	Parenchymal tissue-uptake (TU) and permeability-surface area (PS) product of [3H]prostaglandins (PG) D2, E2 and F2 alpha [1.85 MBq, 0.5 mg/kg (270 nmol)] were examined in 98 regions of the brain and in 19 other tissues of urethane-anesthetized male rats (180-200 g) 15 sec after i.v. administration with [14C]dextran [0.185 MBq, 0.6 mg/kg (2 nmol)] used as a blood spacer. Slight and insignificant change in blood volume was observed in most of the tissues and brain regions between vehicle- and PG-administered groups. TU for the three PG was markedly high in kidney and lung (2388-3952 ng/g), exceeding the blood concentration (2021-2320 ng/ml), but low (less than 10% of the blood concentration) in epididymis, epididymal fat, testis (59-163 ng/g), brain and spinal cord (33-67 ng/g). TU in brain were detected about 0.1% of the administered PG. Based on a two-compartment model, the PS product for the three PG ranged from 0.75 to 4.16 microliters/g/sec in the latter tissues. The value of brain was 1.22 +/- 0.18 microliters/g/sec for PGD2, 1.69 +/- 0.05 for PGE2 and 1.33 +/- 0.13 for PGF2 alpha, indicating that PGE2 enters the brain more readily than PGD2 and PGF2 alpha. In various brain structures, the ranges of the PS product were large and completely overlapped among the three PG (PGD2, 0.14-1.56 microliters/g/sec; PGE2, 0.05-1.78; PGF2 alpha, 0.05-1.82). The highest PS product for the three PG was found in olfactory bulb and cerebellum (0.96-1.82 microliters/g/sec) and the lowest was in septum (0.05-0.53). However, the level of the PS product was different among the PG in each brain region as follows: PGD2 greater than PGE2, PGF2 alpha in septum and anterior part of pyriform cortex; PGE2 greater than PGD2, PGF2 alpha in olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, basal forebrain, middle part of pyriform cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and lateral neocortex; and PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2, PGE2 in posterior part of pyriform cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala and entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices. Low correlation coefficients (0.708, 0.522 and 0.562 for PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, respectively) between the PS product and cerebrovascular volume in various regions revealed heterogeneous cerebrovascular permeabilities of PG.
1531593	The regional brain distribution and binding of the antipsychotic benzamide drug remoxipride was studied in the male rat. After i.v. injections of 3H-remoxipride (1 mumol.kg-1) more than 85% of the radioactivity was identified as authentic remoxipride in brain by using reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Autoradiographic and spectroscopic analysis showed that 3H-remoxipride was distributed relatively even in different brain areas, with exception of the following structures, which showed highest drug concentrations: the choroid plexus, septum, medial part of the caudate nucleus, different areas of the thalamus and hypothalamus situated close to the cerebral ventricles. A closer analysis of the autoradiograms showed a gradient of radioactivity extending from the cerebral ventricles to the deeper parts of the brain at 30 minutes after injections. After 60 minutes radioactivity was detected throughout all forebrain dopamine receptive areas. These findings suggest that remoxipride enters the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the vascular bed of the choroid plexus and that it enters the brain interstitial fluid from the CSF. In the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and olfactory bulb 30-40% of the radioactivity was reduced by pretreatment with the dopamine D-2 selective drug raclopride. In addition, small, but significant, reductions (10-15%) of 3H-remoxipride derived radioactivity was found in the neocortex, hippocampus and the cerebellum, suggesting that remoxipride interacts with a D-2 receptor also in these cortical structures. Taken together, these studies show that after i.v. injections, 3H-remoxipride enters the brain primarily in unmetabolized form when given in doses that affect DA receptor mediated behaviours, that it distributes to most areas throughout the neuraxis and that it binds to D-2 receptors in different parts of the basal ganglia, neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum.
1535312	The hepatic, vascular-type (V1aR) and the renal, antidiuretic-type (V2R) vasopressin receptor cDNAs were recently cloned from rat liver and kidney libraries, respectively. DNA fragments containing the region encoding the putative 5/6 transmembrane loops of these receptors were subcloned, separately, into RNA polymerase promoter-containing vectors from which 35S-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed high levels of V1aR transcripts in the liver and the renal medulla among the vascular bundles. Sparser labeling was found in the renal cortex, but there were no grains over the glomeruli. V1aR mRNA was detected in many brain areas, including the hippocampal formation, central amygdala, dorsolateral septum, lateral hypothalamus, suprachiasmatic, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, nucleus of the solitary tract, cerebellum, spinal nucleus of the trigeminal tract, reticular formation, inferior olivary nucleus, and choroid plexus. Rare labeled cells were seen along the periphery of the posterior pituitary. V2R transcripts were not detected in the liver or brain, but were present in high amounts in the inner and outer renal medulla, primarily associated with collecting ducts. Sparser labeling was found in the renal cortex, and no grains were seen over the glomeruli. These data confirm the expression of the V1a vasopressin receptor in liver and brain and demonstrate that kidney expresses mRNAs encoding V1a and V2 vasopressin receptors.
1545010	N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) is a membrane bound enzyme that cleaves glutamate from the endogenous neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG). We report the immunocytochemical localization of NAALADase in rat brain and kidney by using specific anti-NAALADase antiserum. NAALADase-immunoreactivity (NAALADase-IR) was widely distributed, abundant in neuropil, absent from neuronal cytoplasm, and displayed regional heterogeneity. Staining was selectively enriched in several structures previously reported to contain NAAG-immunoreactivity (NAAG-IR) including the amygdala, caudate-putamen, central gray, dorsal raphe, globus pallidus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, locus coerulus, medial and lateral geniculate, olfactory bulb, periaqueductal gray, solitary nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, substantia nigra, superior colliculus, and thalamus. Staining within these structures was enriched in neuropil; no intracellular staining was detected, even after colchicine treatment. In addition, NAALADase-IR was observed in some NAAG-containing fiber tracts including the corpus callosum, fornix, habenular commissure, solitary tract, stria medularis, and stria terminalis. The co-localization of NAALADase-IR and NAAG-IR support the hypothesis that NAALADase is responsible for the catabolism of NAAG in vivo. NAALADase-IR was also detected in brain regions that, to date, have not revealed NAAG-IR, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the median eminence. In addition, NAALADase-IR was detected in the rat kidney cortex, specifically in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubules. The observation that NAALADase-IR was more widespread than NAAG-IR suggests that NAALADase may also be involved in the catabolism of other structurally related neural and renal peptides.
1545506	In spite of many investigations done for many years, the mechanism of general anesthesia remains still unclear. To elucidate the mechanism of general anesthesia, effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on norepinephrine metabolism in rat brain was studied. Sevoflurane 3% was administered for 20 minutes to Wistar male rats weighing 230-270g under spontaneous respiration. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains were rapidly removed. They were dissected into nine discrete regions, locus coeruleus, pons plus medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex. The contents of norepinephrine (NE) and one of its major metabolites, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-ethylene glycol (MHPG) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with the dual-cell coulometric detector before anesthesia, 20 minutes after the start of anesthesia and at recovery from anesthesia. Significant increases in NE levels were observed in the pons, thalamus and hippocampus by sevoflurane anesthesia for 20 minutes compared with the control group and also in the pons and midbrain at recovery from anesthesia. MHPG levels were significantly decreased in the pons and cortex by sevoflurane anesthesia, while an appreciable increase in MHPG levels was observed in the thalamus by sevoflurane anesthesia. It is concluded that NE metabolism is significantly suppressed in the pons, thalamus and hippocampus during sevoflurane anesthesia and this change in NE metabolism may be associated with a mechanism of sevoflurane anesthesia.
1550908	The pharmacokinetic profiles of biperiden (BP) in blood and in specific brain regions were investigated in rats after acute i.v. administration. The regional brain-to-blood unbound concentration ratios (Kpf) were also determined after 16 h intravenous infusion of BP. The Kpf values ranged from 30 to 75 in the different brain regions and showed decreasing concentrations in the following order: pons + medulla oblongata, basal ganglia, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, mesencephalon, bulbus olfactorius + septum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum. The relationship between BP and acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations in the brain regions was examined. ACh levels in the various brain regions ranged from 8 to 44 ng g-1 tissue. There was a significant correlation between the Kpf values of BP and the levels of ACh in the brain regions except for the pons + oblongata. BP concentrations in the brain regions after BP administration were predicted based on the physiological pharmacokinetics. There was reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the observed data.
1559566	We modified a previously reported enzyme immunoassay method to make it more sensitive for quantification of nerve growth factor (NGF), and succeeded in measuring the NGF content in as small as 2 mg (wet weight) of rat brain tissue. Rat brain was cut into about 600 pieces of the same size, and the NGF content in each piece was determined by this method. The findings were as follows: (i) In the cerebral cortex, NGF contents were unevenly distributed, ranging from less than 0.1 to 1.8 ng/g wet wt. The level was highest in the caudal parietal and rostral occipital cortices and lowest in the lateral parietal cortex. (ii) Areas comprising the limbic system such as the cingulate gyrus, pyriform cortex, amygdala, anterior and medial thalamus, hippocampus, septum, and diagonal band of Broca contained high levels of NGF. (iii) In the brain stem and cerebellum, the levels were low; however, a relatively high level was registered in the cerebellar nuclei, lateral vestibular nucleus, ventral cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and pontine reticular nuclei. These findings, taken together with previously published information, suggest that the neurons in the anterior and medial thalamus, pontine reticular nuclei, superior olive, ventral cochlear nucleus, and cerebellar Purkinje cells may be additional populations of NGF-responsive neurons in the rat brain.
1578001	Monoclonal antibodies against two alpha-bungarotoxin-binding subunits (alpha 7 and alpha 8) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were used as immunohistochemical probes to map their distribution in the chick diencephalon and mesencephalon. The distribution of the alpha 7 and alpha 8 nAChR subunits was compared to the distribution of immunoreactivity produced by a monoclonal antibody against the beta 2 structural subunit of the nAChRs. Structures that contained high numbers of alpha 7-like immunoreactive (LI) somata included the intergeniculate leaflet, nucleus intercalatus thalami, nucleus ovoidalis, organum paraventricularis, nucleus rotundus, isthmic nuclei, nucleus trochlearis, oculomotor complex, nucleus interstitio-pretecto-subpretectalis, stratum griseum centrale of the optic tectum, and nucleus semilunaris. Neuropil staining for alpha 7-LI was intense in the nucleus dorsomedialis hypothalami, nucleus geniculatus lateralis ventralis, griseum tecti, isthmic nuclei, nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, nucleus of the basal optic root, and stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale of the tectum. High numbers of alpha 8-LI somata were found in the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale of the tectum and the nucleus interstitio-pretecto-subpretectalis, and intense neuropil staining for alpha 8-LI was found in the dorsal thalamus, nucleus geniculatus lateralis ventralis, lateral hypothalamus, griseum et fibrosum superficiale of the tectum. High numbers of beta 2-LI somata were found only in the nucleus spiriformis lateralis, whereas neuropil staining for beta 2-LI was intense in the nucleus geniculatus lateralis ventralis, nucleus suprachiasmaticus, nucleus lateralis anterior, nucleus habenularis lateralis, area pretectalis, griseum tecti, nucleus lentiformis mesencephalis, nucleus externus, and nucleus interpeduncularis, and in the stratum griseum centrale, stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale, and stratum opticum of the tectum. These results indicate that there are major disparities in the localization of the alpha-bungarotoxin-binding alpha 7 and alpha 8 nAChR subunits and the beta 2 structural nAChR subunit in the chick diencephalon and mesencephalon. These nAChR subunits appear, however, to coexist in several regions of the chick brain.
1578263	A solution-hybridization ribonuclease-protection assay was used to identify epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA in mouse brain and to compare the regional and developmental levels of EGF gene expression in the CNS with those of its structural homolog, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). Adult brain regions examined included brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, striatum, and thalamus. While both EGF and TGF-alpha mRNAs were detected in all regions, TGF-alpha mRNA levels were 15-170 times higher, ranging from 0.39 (cerebellum and cerebral cortex) to 2.93 (striatum) pg TGF-alpha mRNA/micrograms total cytoplasmic RNA. In contrast, EGF mRNA levels ranged from 11 to 36 fg EGF mRNA/micrograms, with the highest regional concentrations observed in olfactory bulb, basal hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In our comparison between sexes, no significant male-female differences in EGF or TGF-alpha mRNA levels were observed for any region of adult brain. However, in the pituitary gland, consisting of both endocrine and neural elements, EGF and TGF-alpha mRNA levels were significantly higher in males (234 and 215 fg/micrograms, respectively) than in females (172 and 118 fg/micrograms, respectively). An examination of growth factor gene expression in the developing CNS revealed EGF and TGF-alpha mRNAs detectable as early as embryonic day 14 (earliest time point studied). While gene expression for both peptides continued into the postnatal period, EGF and TGF-alpha mRNA levels were nearly equal to adult concentrations by postnatal day 10. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for the synthesis of EGF in brain and suggest a role for both EGF and TGF-alpha in the development and support of the mammalian CNS.
1578281	Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A and MAO-B) oxidatively deaminate neurotransmitter and xenobiotic amines. Since the cellular localization of the isoenzymes in the CNS and peripheral organs determines to a large extent which substrate has access to which isoenzyme, knowledge of their tissue distribution and cellular localization is essential. Here we describe how reversible and selective inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B [Ro 41-1049 and Ro 19-6327 (lazabemide), respectively] can be used, as tritiated radioligands, to map the distribution and abundance of the enzymes in microscopic regions of the rat CNS and peripheral organs, and human brain by quantitative enzyme radioautography. The in vitro binding characteristics of both radiolabeled inhibitors revealed them to be selective, high-affinity ligands for the respective enzymes. KD and Bmax values for 3H-Ro 41-1049 in rat cerebral cortex were 10.7 nM and 7.38 pmol/mg protein, respectively, and for 3H-Ro 19-6327 were 18.4 nM and 3.45 pmol/mg protein, respectively. In accordance with their potencies as enzyme inhibitors, binding to MAO-A and MAO-B was competitively inhibited by clorgyline (IC50 = 1.4 nM) and L-deprenyl (selegiline; IC50 = 8.0 nM), respectively. The capacities of various rat and human tissues to bind the radioligands correlated extremely well with their corresponding enzyme activities. As revealed by the respective binding assays, the distribution and abundance of MAO-A and MAO-B in the tissues investigated differed markedly. MAO-A was most abundant in the locus coeruleus, paraventricular thalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, median habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus, raphe nuclei, solitary tract nucleus, inferior olives, interpeduncular nucleus, claustrum, and numerous peripheral tissues, including liver, vas deferens, heart, superior cervical ganglion, and exocrine and endocrine pancreas. In contrast, MAO-B was most abundant in the ependyma, circumventricular organs, olfactory nerve layer, periventricular hypothalamus, cingulum, hippocampal formation, raphe nuclei, paraventricular thalamus, mammillary nuclei, cerebellar Bergmann glia cells, liver, posterior pituitary, renal tubules, and endocrine pancreas. The cellular localization of the isoenzymes in both rat and human brain differs markedly and does not reflect the distribution of the presumed natural substrates, for example, absence of MAO-A in serotoninergic neurons. Indeed, the present evidence suggests that, whereas MAO-A is found in noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons, MAO-B occurs in astrocytes, serotoninergic neurons, as well as ventricular cells, including most circumventricular organs. The physiological roles of the enzymes are discussed in the light of these findings, some of which were unexpected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1578609	The author studied the effect of isoflurane anesthesia on norepinephrine (NE) metabolism in rat brain to elucidate a mechanism of anesthesia by measuring NE and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Male Wistar rats weighing 230-270 g were anesthetized in a cage (42 x 27 x 19 cm3) with 2% isoflurane in air for 20 minutes. Rats were allocated to one of three groups randomly: unanesthetized control group (8 rats), anesthesia group (8 rats) and recovery group (8 rats). The rats were decapitated after only staying in the cage for 20 minutes in the control group, immediately after isoflurane anesthesia for 20 minutes in the anesthesia group and 20 minutes after recovery from anesthesia in the recovery group. Immediately after decapitation, their brains were rapidly dissected on the ice into the locus coeruleus, pons plus medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, thalamus, corpus striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex. NE and MHPG contents were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The NE contents of the pons plus medulla oblongata, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex increased significantly in the anesthesia group as compared with those of the control group. A significantly lower NE content was observed in the amygdala, and cerebral cortex of the recovery group as compared with that of the anesthesia group. The MHPG contents of the locus coeruleus, pons plus medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, and thalamus increased significantly in the recovery group as compared with those of the anesthesia group. The MHPG/NE ratio was calculated to determine NE turnover. The ratios of the locus coeruleus, pons plus medulla oblongata, thalamus, corpus striatum, and cerebral cortex decreased significantly in the anesthesia group as compared with the control group, while those of the locus coeruleus, pons plus medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, thalamus, and amygdala increased significantly in the recovery group as compared with the anesthesia group. The results obtained in the study suggest that a possible mechanism of isoflurane anesthesia in rat might be associated with decreased NE release in the locus coeruleus, pons, medulla oblongata and thalamus.
1583153	Previous results indicate that the pattern of capsaicin-induced degeneration in the rat central nervous system is age-related. Experiments utilizing capsaicin's selective neurodegenerative effects to study the function of central neural circuits will therefore require a detailed understanding of capsaicin's central neurotoxicity in rats of different ages. The goal of this experiment was to characterize the degeneration induced in the rat brain by systemic treatment with capsaicin at different ages (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 75 days, or 11 months), using a cupric silver stain to label degenerating neurons. Results revealed degenerating cell bodies in the ventromedial brainstem in capsaicin-treated rats of all age groups, though they were more numerous in adult rats than in pups. In addition, many areas contained capsaicin-induced nerve terminal degeneration both in rat pups and in adult rats. These areas were the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord dorsal horn; the solitary tract; the nucleus of the solitary tract, visceral portion; the area postrema; the trigeminal nerve and spinal trigeminal nucleus; the medial nucleus of the inferior olive; the rostral, dorsomedial and dorsolateral interpeduncular subnuclei and overlying interfascicular nucleus; the supramammillary area; the lateral septal nucleus; the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior medial portion; the optic nerve and tract; the suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventroposterolateral portion; the magnocellular subnucleus of the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus; the intergeniculate leaf; the medial pretectal nucleus and the olivary pretectal nucleus. In several, but not all of these areas, the apparent density of degenerating terminals was significantly less in adult rats than in pups. In other brain sites, capsaicin-induced degeneration was observed only in rats younger than 30 days of age. These areas were the lateral habenula, medial part; the sphenoid nucleus; and the stria medullaris. Still other brain sites lost their sensitivity to capsaicin sometime between 30 and 75 days of age. These areas were the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial posteromedial part; the medial preoptic nucleus, central part; the septohypothalamic nucleus; the ventral reuniens area; and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Adult rats 75 days and 11 months of age did not differ detectably in their response to capsaicin. Thus, loss or attenuation of capsaicin sensitivity is not progressive throughout life. It does not occur in all capsaicin-sensitive sites. Where it does occur, loss of sensitivity occurs prior to adulthood and follows a distinct and reproducible time course that may differ for different sites.
1597300	Four pedigrees of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) were reported. Main clinical features of 21 patients in these pedigrees were cerebellar ataxia, limb spasticity, gaze nystagmus, facio-lingual twitchings, and external ophthalmoparesis. Amyotrophy, hypokinesia, or dystonia were manifested with advance of the illness. In patients with younger onset age, such extrapyramidal signs were dominated. Neuropathological study of one autopsied case disclosed that there were degeneration of spinocerebellar tract, anterior horn cells, pontine nuclei, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, internal segment of globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and motor nuclei of brain stem; neurons of cerebellar cortex and inferior olivary nucleus were preserved. From these clinical and pathological features, these 4 pedigrees satisfied the criteria of MJD, and were differentiated from hereditary olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Currently, MJD is accepted as a new entity of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias. However, there are still controversies as to whether Azores-Portuguese MJD and Japanese MJD are identical disorder. Furthermore, the nosological relationship between MJD and a number of similar cases, as reported historically under the diagnosis of Brown type ataxia or Marie's ataxia, has not been clearly established. From reviewing such cases critically, pathological and clinical features of our cases are so similar to those of the latter, indicating that the probably identical genetic disorder has been classified under the different categories.
1600566	The distribution of immunoreactive arginine vasotocin (AVT-ir) was determined in the brain of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Cells and fibers containing AVT-ir were found in the medial septal region, lamina terminalis, lateral forebrain bundle, preoptic area, supraoptic nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, periventricular nucleus, arcuate nucleus, and ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus. Occasional AVT-ir cells were found in the interpeduncular nucleus. Fibers containing AVT-ir were found in the cortex, around the olfactory ventricle, in the diagonal band of Broca, amygdala area, dorsal ventricular ridge, striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, medial forebrain bundle, median eminence, pars nervosa, nucleus of the solitary tract, locus coeruleus, cerebellar cortex (granular layer), dorsal part of the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, substantia nigra, and myelencephalon. The intensity of AVT-ir staining was, in general, greater in males than in females. Comparison of AVT-ir distribution in A. carolinensis with those previously published for other reptilian species revealed species-specific differences in distribution of AVT.
1602368	Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that the analgesic and hyperthermic effects of morphine were found to be greater in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats than in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The enhanced response to morphine could not be explained on the basis of any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine in the serum. In order to determine the possible contribution of altered distribution of morphine in the central nervous system in the differences in the pharmacological response to morphine in the two strains, the time course of the distribution of morphine was determined in brain regions and spinal cord after its i.v. administration. SHR and WKY rats were injected with morphine (10 mg/kg). At various times (5, 30, 60, 120 and 360 min) after the injection of morphine, brain regions (hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, pons and medulla, striatum and amygdala) and spinal cord were collected. The level of morphine in the tissues was determined by using a highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay method. Five minutes after morphine injection, the concentration of morphine was the highest in the spinal cord. Among the brain regions, the highest concentration of morphine was in the hypothalamus and the lowest in the amygdala. In all the brain regions and spinal cord, the concentration of morphine was significantly higher in the SHR than in the WKY rats. Similar effects were observed at 30, 60 and 120 min after morphine injection. At 360 min, the hypothalamus, cortex and spinal cord of the SHR rats had higher concentrations of morphine than the WKY rats, but the other regions did not show differences in the morphine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1605733	Toluene concentrations in 9 brain regions of acutely exposed rats and that in 11 brain regions of a human case who inhaled toluene prior to death are described. After exposure to toluene by inhalation (2000 or 10,000 ppm) for 0.5 h or by oral dosing (400 mg/kg), rats were killed by decapitation 0.5 and 4 h after onset of inhalation and 2 and 10 h after oral ingestion. After each experimental condition the highest range of brain region/blood toluene concentration ratio (BBCR) was in the brain stem regions (2.85-3.22) such as the pons and medulla oblongata, the middle range (1.77-2.12) in the midbrain, thalamus, caudate-putamen, hypothalamus and cerebellum, and the lowest range (1.22-1.64) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These distribution patterns were quite constant. Toluene concentration in various brain regions were unevenly distributed and directly related blood levels. In a human case who had inhaled toluene vapor, the distribution among brain regions was relatively similar to that in rats, the highest concentration ratios being in the corpus callosum (BBCR: 2.66) and the lowest in the hippocampus (BBCR: 1.47).
1630603	The effects of a single or repeated administrations of morphine on the tissue levels of cholecystokinin-like material (CCKLM) and pre pro cholecystokinin mRNA (CCK mRNA) were examined in various brain and spinal cord regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, septum, substantia nigra, lumbar enlargement) in adult rats using a specific radioimmunoassay and 'Northern blot' analysis, respectively. Although a clear parallelism existed between the regional distribution of CCKLM (septum greater than cerebral cortex greater than or equal to hippocampus much greater than lumbar enlargement, dorsal zone greater than substantia nigra greater than lumbar enlargement, ventral zone much much greater than cerebellum) and that of CCK mRNA, some mismatch was found notably in the septum where CCK mRNA levels were less than in other regions except the cerebellum. Neither CCKLM nor CCK mRNA levels were altered one hour after an acute administration of morphine (5 mg/kg i.p.). Similarly, morphine addiction after a four-day treatment with this drug was not associated with any change in the tissue levels of CCKLM and CCK mRNA. These data indicate that the previously reported modulatory action of opioids on central CCKergic systems could occur without affecting the preproCCK gene transcription and the tissue peptide concentrations.
1641063	A procedure for labeling rat CNS proteins in vivo which is useful for behavioral and pharmacological studies has been developed. Intraventricular administration of 35S-methionine through bilateral indwelling cannulae provided reproducible and highly specific radiolabeling of proteins from frontal cortex (FC), parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex (OC), striatum (ST), septal nuclei (SN), amygdala (AM), hippocampus (HIP), thalamus (TH), brain stem (BS) and cerebellum (CB). Relative rates of synthesis of over 200 individual proteins were subsequently analyzed by 2DGE. Regional analysis demonstrated increased labeling of a protein of MW 28 kD and pI 6.4 in the hippocampus that was barely detectable in striatum of control rats. In heat-shocked animals, there was increased relative synthesis of the 74 kD Heat Shock Protein in both the septal nuclei and hippocampus.
1645376	The distribution of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) binding sites in the pigeon brain was examined by in vitro autoradiography on slide-mounted sections. A fully characterized monoiodinated form of VIP, which maintains the biological activity of the native peptide, was used throughout this study. The highest densities of binding sites were observed in the hyperstriatum dorsale, archistriatum, auditory field L of neostriatum, area corticoidea dorsolateralis and temporo-parieto-occipitalis, area parahippocampalis, tectum opticum, nucleus dorsomedialis anterior thalami, and in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus. Lower densities of specific binding occurred in the neostriatum, hyperstriatum ventrale and nucleus septi lateralis, dorsolateral area of the thalamus, and lateral and posteromedial hypothalamus. Very low to background levels of VIP binding were detected in the ectostriatum, paleostriatum primitivum, paleostriatum augmentatum, lobus parolfactorius, nucleus accumbens, most of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. The distribution of VIP-containing fibers and terminals was examined by indirect immunofluorescence using a polyclonal antibody against porcine VIP. Fibers and terminals were observed in the area corticoidea dorsolateralis, area parahippocampalis, hippocampus, hyperstriatum accessorium, hyperstriatum dorsale, archistriatum, tuberculum olfactorium, nuclei dorsolateralis and dorsomedialis of the thalamus, and throughout the hypothalamus and the median eminence. Long projecting fibers were visualized in the tractus septohippocampalis. In the brainstem VIP immunoreactive fibers and terminals were observed mainly in the substantia grisea centralis, fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, lemniscus lateralis, and in the area surrounding the nuclei of the 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves. The correlation between the distribution of VIP binding sites and immunoreactive fibers and terminals was assessed in a restricted number of regions. A qualitatively good matching was found in the area corticoidea dorsolateralis, hyperstriatum dorsale, hyperstriatum accessorium, nucleus septi lateralis, nuclei dorsomedialis and dorsolateralis thalami, and in some hypothalamic areas. A striking mismatch occurred in the hyperstriatum ventrale, neostriatum, tectum opticum (high to moderate density of binding sites but only few immunoreactive profiles), and in the tuberculum olfactorium, median eminence, and spinal cord (lower density of binding sites but abundant immunoreactive profiles). The paleostriatum, lobus parolfactorius, and ectostriatum were virtually devoid of both binding sites and immunoreactive profiles. The results are discussed in relation to the known actions of VIP in the rodent and avian brain and are compared with previous observations on the distribution of VIP binding sites in the central nervous system of other vertebrates.
1646974	The efferent projections of the periaqueductal gray in the rabbit have been described by anterograde tract-tracing techniques following deposits of tritiated leucine, or horseradish peroxidase, into circumscribed sites within dorsal, lateral or ventral periaqueductal gray. No attempts were made to place labels in the fourth, extremely narrow (medial), region immediately surrounding the aqueduct whose size and disposition did not lend itself to confined placements of label within it. These anatomically distinct regions, defined in Nissl-stained sections, corresponded to the same regions into which deposits of horseradish peroxidase were made in order for us to describe afferent projections to the periaqueductal gray. In this present study distinct ascending and descending fibre projections were found throughout the brain. Terminal labelling was detected in more than 80 sites, depending somewhat upon which of the three regions of the periaqueductal gray received the deposit. Therefore, differential projections with respect to both afferent and efferent connections of these three regions of the periaqueductal gray have now been established. Ventral deposits disclosed a more impressive system of ramifying, efferent fibres than did dorsal or lateral placements of labels. With ventral deposits, ascending fibres were found to follow two major pathways from periaqueductal gray. The periventricular bundle bifurcates at the level of the posterior commissure to form hypothalamic and thalamic components which distribute to the anterior pretectal region, lateral habenulae, and nuclei of the posterior commissure, the majority of the intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei, and to almost all of the hypothalamus. The other major ascending pathway from the periaqueductal gray takes a ventrolateral course from the deposit site through the reticular formation or, alternatively, through the deep and middle layers of the superior colliculus, to accumulate just medial to the medial geniculate body. This contingent of fibres travels more rostrally above the cerebral peduncle, distributing terminals to the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and parabigeminal nucleus before fanning out and turning rostrally to contribute terminals to ventral thalamus, subthalamus and zona incerta, then continuing on to supply amygdala, substantia innominata, lateral preoptic nucleus, the diagonal band of Broca and the lateral septal nucleus. Caudally directed fibres were also observed to follow two major routes. They either leave the periaqueductal gray dorsally and pass through the gray matter in the floor of the fourth ventricle towards the abducens nucleus and ventral medulla, or are directed ventrally after passing through either the inferior colliculus or parabrachial nucleus. These ventrally directed fibres merge just dorsal to the pons on the ventral surface of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1647785	A monoclonal antibody against benzodiazepines (21-7F9) was used to study the distribution of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain. Immunodensitometry in combination with image analysis were used for quantification. The results showed a ubiquitous distribution of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity throughout the brain. Very high levels of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity were found in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, in the primary olfactory cortex, in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus and in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb. High densities of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity were found in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cell layer of the olfactory tubercle, the granule layer of the dentate gyrus, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the mammillary bodies, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and superficial grey layer of superior colliculus. The substantia nigra pars compacta, the islands of Calleja and layers II, III, V and VI of the cerebral cortex had moderate levels of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity. Lower densities were found in the internal granular layer and the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in layers I and IV of the cerebral cortex, in the nucleus caudate-putamen and most of the thalamic nuclei. The lowest density of immunoreactivity was found in the globus pallidus, and the strata radiatum, oriens and lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus. The distribution of endogenous benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity was compared with the distribution of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor by using both immunocytochemistry and receptor autoradiography. Our studies have shown a clear mismatch between the localization of the benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity and the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors.
1648604	The immunohistochemical localization of P400/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor protein was studied in developing and adult mouse brain by using monoclonal antibodies. The developmental expression pattern of P400/InsP3 receptor protein differed among different classes of neurons. It was first detected in the somata of immature Purkinje cells at embryonic day 17, in the ventrolateral region of the posterior vermis in the cerebellum. Axonal immunoreactivity within the cerebellar nuclei was first present at postnatal day 3. Neurons in the retrosplenial cortex, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus expressed immunoreactivity earlier than other regions of the brain. In the adult brain, not only the Purkinje cell but also many other types of cells in many areas of the brain expressed P400/InsP3 receptor, though to a lesser extent. These included the neurons in the striatum, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens septi, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, precommissural hippocampus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebral cortex, pons, and certain hypothalamic nuclei. Forebrain cortical regions that receive afferents from the olfactory bulb, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, prepiriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala, exhibited distinct immunoreactivity, while olfactory bulb was almost devoid of staining. Immunoreactivity in the axonal pathways was also found in the limbic-hypothalamic pathways, strionigral projection, and part of the corpus callosum. Results of Western blot analysis and 3H-InsP3 binding assay were consistent with the qualitative regional differences of immunoreactivity demonstrated by immunohistochemical study. The location of InsP3 receptor in the brain correlates well with the InsP3 binding sites demonstrated by an autoradiographic study.
1650432	Endothelin binding sites in rat brain were mapped by quantitative in vitro autoradiography employing [125I]endothelin-1 as radioligand. [125I]Endothelin-1 bound with high affinity and specificity to rat cerebellar sections and was potently displaced by unlabelled endothelins (endothelin-1 greater than endothelin-2 = endothelin-3) and sarafotoxin 6B. The highest densities of endothelin binding sites were found in the cerebellum (especially Purkinje cell layer), choroid plexus and median eminence. High densities were found in the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, anterior hypothalamic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, mammillary nuclei and glomerular layer of olfactory bulb. Moderate densities were found in many thalamic nuclei, the pretectal region, interpeduncular nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, raphe nuclei, tegmental nuclei, olfactory ventricle, red nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, central gray, reticular nuclei, vestibular nuclei, oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, hypoglossal nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body and lateral cerebellar nucleus. Low but detectable densities of endothelin binding sites were found in medial geniculate nucleus, fields of Ammon's horn, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, anterior commissure, internal capsule, anterior pituitary, median preoptic nucleus, septohypothalamic nucleus, superior colliculus and area postrema. These patterns were completely abolished by 1 microM unlabelled endothelin-1, -2 and -3 and sarafotoxin S6B. Brain endothelin binding sites show high affinity for endothelin-1, -2 and -3 and sarafotoxin 6B with highest affinity for endothelin-1. Endothelin binding sites show a non-vascular pattern of distribution in the brain, suggesting that the peptide may have widespread functions as a modulator of neuronal function.
1650800	The expression of three beta subunit (beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3) mRNAs for gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor in the postnatal rat forebrain was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry with probes synthesized for the respective subunit mRNAs. The developmental expression of these subunit mRNAs conformed to one of three patterns. Pattern I was high expression of the mRNA at birth and a constant or increasing expression thereafter. In contrast, pattern II was no or very low expression of the mRNA at birth, with expression quickly increasing to reach the adult level in the early postnatal period. Pattern III was the transient expression of the subunit mRNA or else a marked decrease of its expression after a peak in the early postnatal period. On the basis of this classification, the expression of beta 3 subunit mRNA followed pattern I in most regions of the forebrain, such as the isocortex, the olfactory bulb and some of its related areas, the hippocampal formation, the amygdala, the septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the caudate-putamen, the nucleus accumbens, the globus pallidus, the ventral pallidum, and the hypothalamus. In some areas, such as the magnocellular preoptic nucleus, the thalamus, and the subthalamic nucleus, pattern III was seen for this subunit. However, none of the regions of the brain showed pattern II expression of beta 3 subunit mRNA. In contrast, the expression of beta 1 and beta 2 subunit mRNAs followed pattern II in most regions of the forebrain. These included the expression of beta 1 subunit mRNA in the isocortex, the olfactory bulb, the hippocampal formation, the amygdala, the septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus, and the expression of beta 2 subunit mRNA in the isocortex, the olfactory bulb and some of its related areas, the amygdala, the nucleus of the diagonal band, the caudate-putamen, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus. Pattern I was not found for beta 1 subunit mRNA, although it was seen in some areas for beta 2 subunit mRNA, such as the ventral pallidum, the globus pallidus, and the magnocellular preoptic nucleus. On the other hand, pattern III was followed by beta 1 subunit mRNA in the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, and the piriform cortex, and the same pattern for the beta 2 subunit was also found in the olfactory tubercle, the hippocampal formation, the septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the nucleus accumbens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1654536	Angiotensin converting enzyme is localized in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brain by in vitro autoradiography using the radiolabelled inhibitor, [125I]351A. This radioligand binds with high affinity and specificity to monkey cortical sections. Specific inhibitors of converting enzyme, lisinopril and perindoprilat complete for the radioligand binding to monkey cortex sections with inhibitory constants of 10 nM. High concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in most components of the basal ganglia including the caudate nucleus, putamen, the internal and external globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The distribution of converting enzyme in the caudate nucleus and putamen is heterogeneous, with prominent patches of higher activity. The patches in the caudate nucleus correspond closely with the acetylcholinesterase-poor striosomes. In the hypothalamus, very high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in the median eminence and the pituitary stalk and high concentrations occur in the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Moderate, diffuse binding is observed in the median preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area, and in the anterior, lateral, ventromedial, posterior and arcuate nuclei. In the circumventricular organs, the subcommissural and subfornical organs exhibit high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the pineal body display moderate enzyme activities whereas the area postrema is devoid of labelling. The interpeduncular nucleus and, in the hippocampal formation, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are also intensely labelled. High levels of angiotensin converting enzyme activity are also detected throughout the cerebral cortex with laminations of higher activity corresponding to cell dense layers of the cortex. Layered binding is also present in the cerebellar cortex, with the most intense labelling in the molecular layer. Moderate concentrations of converting enzyme also occur in the paraventricular, medial habenula, lateral habenula and central median nuclei of the thalamus, the amygdala, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial nucleus and dorsal tegmental nucleus. The dorsal vagal complex, inferior olivary nucleus and the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus all display high levels of binding. Moderate, diffuse labelling is found throughout the reticular region and is also present in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. Although the overall distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme in the monkey brain resembles that in the rat, there are some striking differences. These include the high levels of binding throughout the monkey cerebral cortex and in the interpeduncular and suprachiasmatic nuclei.
1656320	The localization of glycine receptors in the rat brain was examined by means of in situ hybridization histochemistry using an oligonucleotide probe to the sequence of the alpha 1 subunit. Strongly- or moderately-labeled neurons were found in the cranial nuclei, sensory nuclei such as the spinal trigeminal nucleus, principal trigeminal nucleus, gracile and cuneate nuclei, dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, superior olivary nucleus, medial and lateral trapezoid nuclei, lateral lemniscus and vestibular nuclei, red nucleus, parabrachial area, cerebellar nuclei, dorsal tegmental nucleus, reticular formation and parafascicular nucleus. This study thus demonstrated the localization of neurons which are regulated by glycine via strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in the rat brain.
1658088	The expression of nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) transcripts was investigated with in situ hybridization techniques in the CNS of chick embryos from 3 days of incubation (E3) to 14 days posthatch (P14). The time course and distribution of NGFR expression was compared with the development of the cholinergic phenotype. Cholinergic properties were assessed by immunolabeling for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity. NGFR transcripts are expressed transiently in the inner plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer of the retina (E4-P1), neostriatum and hippocampus (E18), infundibular hypothalamus (E7-18), spiriform complex (E9-15), layers 2, 3 (E9-18), and 10 (E11-18) of the optic tectum, nucleus mesencephalicus profundus, pars ventralis (E9-18), parvicellular isthmic nucleus (E7-P1), magnocellular isthmic nucleus (E9-E18), nucleus semilunaris (E7-18), isthmo-optic nucleus (E7-P14), rostral motor nuclei (E5-18), developing cerebellum (E7-15), internal granule cell layer (E11-18) and Purkinje cell layer (E15-P14) of the cerebellar cortex, and the inferior olivary nucleus (E9-15). A small number of neuronal populations with embryonic expression of NGFR remain strongly NGFR-positive in the posthatch animal:habenular nuclei (labeled after E5), nucleus subrotundus (after E9), mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (after E5), caudal parts of locus ceruleus and nucleus subceruleus (after E7), medullar reticular nuclei (after E11), and motor nuclei IX, X, and XII (after E9). The majority of neuronal populations with NGFR expression show cholinergic properties in development, and NGFR expression always precedes the onset of ChAT immunoreactivity. Postnatal expression of growth factor receptors is largely confined to neurons of the reticular type. NGFR expression in avian CNS nuclei differs from that in mammals. Early loss of NGFR expression in the cholinergic basal forebrain (which remains strongly NGFR positive in mammals) and persistent NGFR expression in parts of the avian locus ceruleus indicate changes of growth factor receptor expression and growth factor requirements in phylogeny. Knowledge of the time and distribution of NGFR expression in the chick embryo will facilitate the assessment of specific functions of NGF and NGF-like molecules in an embryonic model with easy access for experimental manipulations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1664039	The effects of chronic manganese (Mn) treatments (1 and 10 mg MnCl2.4H2O per ml of drinking water) from conception onwards on brain regional development of sodium-potassium-activated and magnesium-activated adenosine triphosphatases (Na-K-ATPase and Mg-ATPase) were studied. The activities of these enzymes were determined in hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons and medulla, striatum, midbrain and cerebral cortex (which included the hippocampus) of Mn-treated and age-matched control rats at 5 postnatal ages. Both ATPase activities doubled in most brain regions between day 5 and day 20 postnatal. In pons and medulla, striatum, midbrain, and cerebral cortex, adult levels of both enzymatic activities were attained by day 20 postnatal. Na-K-ATPase activities transiently increased in the midbrain (+25%) at day 12 with the lower Mn dose and in the cerebral cortex (+31%) at day 20 with the higher Mn dose. With the higher Mn dose only, Mg-ATPase activities were increased in the hypothalamus (+20%) at day 12 and in the pons and medulla (+22%) at day 20 but were decreased in the pons and medulla (-20%) at day 60. Thus, only transient changes in enzymatic activities were observed despite dose-dependent increases in the brain levels of Mn resulting from the Mn treatment. A hypothesis regarding the role of early but transient changes in brain metabolism in the pathogenesis of the initial psychotic symptoms in Mn intoxication was proposed and discussed in relation to several other observations of a similar nature.
1666016	The neuroanatomical localization of kappa opioid receptors in rat and guinea pig brain was determined by quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Our study shows striking differences in kappa 1 and kappa 2 receptor distributions both between species and within each species. In the rat brain, kappa 1 sites (labeled by [3H]U-69,593) are of low density and confined to a small number of structures. These include the claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, midline nuclear group of the thalamus, superficial grey layer of the superior colliculus, and central grey. kappa 2 sites (labeled by [3H]ethylketocyclazocine or [3H]bremazocine under conditions in which mu, delta, and kappa 1 binding was suppressed) are more widely distributed throughout all levels of rat brain. kappa 2 sites occur at high density in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, thalamus, and interpeduncular nuclei. In guinea pig brain, kappa 1 sites predominate and are of high density in layers I and VI of the neocortex, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and molecular layer of the cerebellum. As in rat brain, kappa 2 sites in guinea pig are more uniformly and widely distributed throughout the brain than are kappa 1 sites. The highest density of kappa 2 sites is in the dorsal parabrachial nucleus, interpeduncular nuclei, mammillary nuclei, and posterior thalamic nuclei. Results from this study demonstrate important interspecies differences in the distribution of kappa 1 and kappa 2 opioid receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1667606	The regional distribution of [3H]idazoxan and [3H]rauwolscine was studied autoradiographically in human brain. [3H]Idazoxan binds with high affinity to alpha 2 adrenoceptors as well as to non-adrenergic sites (NAIBS). [3H]Rauwolscine, besides binding to alpha 2 adrenoceptors, also binds to 5-HT1A receptors. Both radioligands labelled the same population of alpha 2 adrenoceptors, defined as the epinephrine-displaceable binding component. The highest densities of alpha 2 adrenoceptors occur in the leptomeninges, cerebral cortex and claustrum; lower densities were visualised in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, substantia nigra, cerebellum and medulla oblongata; no alpha 2 adrenoceptors were detected in amygdala and nucleus ruber. NAIBS were present in all the examined brain areas, with the highest densities found in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. The finding that certain brain regions, such as the amygdala, contained NAIBS but no detectable alpha 2 adrenoceptors, suggests that the binding sites are independent from each other. The regional distribution of 5-HT1A receptors labelled by [3H]rauwolscine is in agreement with previous studies using [3H]8-OH-DPAT.
1685933	Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) was injected into either the aortic depressor nerve or the vagus nerve in the rabbit. Four or 5 days after injection of virus, the rabbit brain was processed immunohistochemically to demonstrate viral antigen. After injection into the aortic nerve HSV1 positive cells were found principally ipsilaterally within the nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla oblongata, the spinal trigeminal complex, raphe nuclei, A5 area, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, ventrolateral hypothalamic area, paraventricular nucleus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and insular cortex. Double labeling studies indicated that approximately 85% of the virus-containing neurons in the ventrolateral medulla, and virtually all the HSV-positive neurons in the A5 area and locus coeruleus also contained tyrosine hydroxylase. In the raphe nuclei and parapyramidal region approximately 33% of virus-containing cells reacted positively with PH8 antibody, a marker for serotonin synthesis. After injection of HSV1 into the vagus nerve labeled cells were found in similar brain areas, with a more bilateral distribution. The HSV-positive neurons may be involved in the processing of baroreceptor-derived information.
1691463	This study provides a detailed report of the distribution and density of substance P-like immunoreactive fibres and terminals within the human infant medulla. Seven brains with no signs of macroscopic alteration fixed usually within 24-48 h after death were used. Free floating transverse sections (50-60 microns) were then immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against substance P using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Morphologically three types of substance P-like immunoreactive fibres were observed: those with small varicosities of less than 1 micron, those with medium varicosities of 1-2 microns and those with large varicosities of 2-4 microns. Very dense substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, parts of the gracile and cuneate fasciculi and the paracommissural subnucleus of the solitary nucleus; dense substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, commissural, medial, dorsal, dorsolateral ventral and ventrolateral subnuclei of the solitary nuclear complex, parasolitary nucleus, raphe obscurus, inferior olivary complex (medial, dorsal, dorsomedial nuclei) and ventrolateral part of the dorsal reticular nucleus; moderate substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the gelatinosus nucleus of the solitary tract, lateral reticular nucleus proper, intermediate reticular zone and parvocellular reticular nucleus; sparse substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the hypoglossal nucleus, retroambigual nucleus and much of the reticular formation (dorsal, parvocellular, ventral gigantocellular, dorsal paragigantocellular nuclei): and very sparse substance P-like immunoreactivity was present within the nucleus ambiguus, medial vestibular nucleus and parts of the reticular formation (ventral, medial, gigantocellular, ventral gigantocellular, dorsal paragigantocellular nuclei). Substance P-like immunoreactivity was absent in the area postrema, intercalated nucleus, gracile and cuneate nuclei, in the epiolivary, subtrigeminal and parvocellular divisions of the lateral reticular nucleus, spinal vestibular nucleus, and in the solitary and pyramidal tracts. In several regions the substance P-like immunoreactive fibres formed distinct pericellular arrays around the somata and dendrites of neurons (hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, retroambigual nucleus, intermediate reticular zone). The results indicate the high specificity of the localization of substance P in various structures of the brainstem and underline the presumed significance of this peptide in autonomic and sensorimotor functions of the brain.
1691464	Using the retrograde tracers horseradish peroxidase-wheatgerm agglutinin and gold particles conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin apo-horseradish peroxidase in combination with an antiserum against glutaraldehyde-fixed GABA, it was examined whether the pontine nuclei of the cat receive projections from GABA-like immunoreactive neurons in the brainstem, diencephalon, or deep cerebellar nuclei, contributing to the GABA-like immunoreactive fibre plexus previously demonstrated in the pontine nuclei [Brodal et al. (1988) Neuroscience 25, 27-45]. Following tracer injections that covered both the pontine nuclei and the reticular tegmental nucleus in two cats, it was found that 125 out of 1166 (10.7%) and 29 out of 294 (9.9%) retrogradely labelled neurons in the cerebellar nuclei were GABA-like immunoreactive. In the same two experiments only six out of 2029 (0.3%) and 10 out of 1398 (0.7%) retrogradely labelled neurons in the brainstem and diencephalon were GABA-like immunoreactive. Among the regions in the brainstem and diencephalon known to project to the pontine nuclei, double-labelled cells were seen in the reticular formation, the periaqueductal gray, and the nucleus praepositus hypoglossi, but not in the zona incerta or the anterior pretectal nucleus, regions that have been shown to contain glutamate decarboxylase-like immunoreactive neurons projecting to the pontine nuclei in the rat [Border et al. (1986) Brain Res. Bull. 17, 169-179]. In order to test whether this is due to species differences, the same experimental approach was used in the rat, and it was found that 54 out of 3249 (1.7%) retrogradely labelled neurons in the brainstem and diencephalon were double-labelled. Notably, in the zona incerta 2% of the retrogradely labelled cells were also GABA-like immunoreactive, and in the reticular formation there was a higher proportion of double-labelled cells than was found in the cat. Additional sources were identified, that may contribute to the GABA-like immunoreactive fibre plexus in the pontine nuclei of the rat. This, in conjunction with the previous finding that the pontine nuclei of the rat contain only very few putative GABAergic neurons [Border and Mihailoff (1985) Expl Brain Res. 59, 600-614; Brodal et al. (1988) Neuroscience 25, 27-45], lead to the suggestion that the GABA-like immunoreactive fibre plexus in the pontine nuclei of the rat is predominantly of extrinsic origin, possibly representing a mosaic of the terminal fields of several subcorticopontine projections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1691747	The ascending and descending projections of the parabrachial nuclear complex in the pigeon have been charted with autoradiographic and histochemical (WGA-HRP) techniques. The ascending projections originate from a group of subnuclei surrounding various components of the brachium conjunctivum, namely, the superficial lateral, dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventromedial subnuclei. The projections are predominantly ipsilateral and travel in the quintofrontal tract. They are primarily to the medial and lateral hypothalamus (including the periventricular nucleus and the strata cellulare internum and externum), certain dorsal thalamic nuclei, the nucleus of the pallial commissure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventral paleostriatum, the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus accumbens, and a dorsolateral nucleus of the posterior archistriatum. There are weaker or more diffuse projections to the rostral locus coeruleus (cell group A8), the compact portion of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, the central grey and intercollicular region, the ventral area of Tsai, the medial spiriform nucleus, the nucleus subrotundus, the anterior preoptic area, and the diagonal band of Broca. The parabrachial subnuclei have partially differential projections to these targets, some of which also receive projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract (Arends, Wild, and Zeigler: J. Comp. Neurol. 278:405-429, '88). Most of the targets, particularly those in the basal forebrain (viz., the periventricular nucleus and the strata cellulare internum and externum of the hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and its lateral extension into the ventral paleostriatum, which may be comparable with the substantia innominata), have reciprocal connections with the parabrachial and solitary tract subnuclei and therefore may be said to compose parts of a "visceral forebrain system" analogous to that described in the rat (Van der Kooy et al: J. Comp. Neurol. 224:1-24, '84). The descending projections to the lower brainstem arise in large part from a ventrolateral subnucleus that may be comparable with the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus of mammals. They are mainly to the ventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguus, and massively to the hypoglossal nucleus, particularly its tracheosyringeal portion. These projections are therefore likely to be importantly involved in the control of vocalization and respiration (Wild and Arends: Brain Res. 407:191-194, '87). Some of these results have been presented in abstract form (Wild, Arends, and Zeigler: Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 13:308, '87).
1694188	Characterization of the distribution of the peptide-degrading enzyme neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (E.C. 3.4.24.11; NEP; enkephalinase) in the rat brainstem was examined by means of a unique fluorescent histochemical method. Enzyme staining was completely blocked by three potent NEP inhibitors (thiorphan, phosphoramidon, and JHF-26) at a concentration of 50 nM, supporting the specificity of this method to visualize sites of NEP activity selectively. At all levels of the brainstem, NEP was localized to cell bodies, cell processes or terminal-like fields and was localized to more than 90 distinct nuclei or subnuclei. In the mesencephalon these included the central gray, cuneiform n., dorsal and lateral tegmental n., inferior colliculus, interpeduncular n., lateral and medial geniculate n., central linear raphe n., mesencephalic n. of the trigeminal nerve, mammillary nuclei, occulomotor n., red n., superior colliculus, ventral n. of the lateral lemniscus, substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area, and the zona incerta. In the pons, NEP staining was restricted to fewer regions or nuclei, including the dorsal and ventral cochlear n., facial n., motor trigeminal n., principal sensory trigeminal n., parabrachial nuclei, pontine n., the oral and caudal pontine reticular n., pontine olivary nuclei, several pontine tegmental nuclei, pontine raphe nuclei, and the trapezoid n. In the cerebellum, staining was localized largely to the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Scattered staining was observed in the molecular cell layer. The medulla contained extensive NEP staining localized to nuclei that included the ambiguous n., dorsal motor n. of the vagus, hypoglossal n., inferior olivary n., prepositus hypoglossus n., solitary tract n., nuclei of the spinal tract of the trigeminal n., and the lateral, medial, and superior vestibular nuclei. Nuclei of the medullary reticular formation that were also richly stained for NEP included the raphe magnus n., raphe obscurus n., raphe pallidus n., dorsal, lateral, and ventral reticular nuclei of the medulla, and the gigantocellular, lateral paragigantocellular, linear, paramedian and parvicellular reticular nuclei. The widespread distribution of NEP in the brainstem suggests the existence of a number of functional systems, including the pathways involved in the mechanisms of pain and analgesia, which are potential targets of NEP inhibitors. In most regions, the distribution of NEP closely overlapped with that reported for the enkephalins, and showed a more restricted overlap with the reported distribution of substance P.
1697208	The present study describes the differences and similarities between the connections of the presubiculum and parasubiculum based on retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments. The results demonstrate that both areas have several similar afferent connections, particularly those from subcortical areas such as the claustrum, diagonal band of Broca, anterior thalamus, nucleus reuniens, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. Both subicular areas also are innervated by axons originating in the ipsilateral and contralateral entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. In contrast to these similarities, most axons innervating the presubiculum originate in the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus, the claustrum, and the contralateral presubiculum. Conversely, the parasubiculum is innervated primarily by axons that originate in area CA1 of the hippocampus, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum. The major efferent projection from the presubiculum and parasubiculum courses bilaterally to the medial entorhinal cortex; however, the results of the present study confirm previous suggestions that presubicular axons terminate almost exclusively in layers I and III, whereas parasubicular axons innervate layer II. The presubiculum also projects to the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and the lateral ventral portion of the medial mammillary nucleus, whereas the parasubiculum projects prominently to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum, and the lateral dorsal segment of the medial mammillary nucleus. Thus despite some similarities, the major connections of presubiculum and parasubiculum are distinct from one another and distinct from the projections of the adjacent subiculum and postsubiculum. These results suggest that the subicular cortex is considerably more complex than previously envisioned and indicate that each segment may subserve a distinct role in the processing of information by the hippocampal formation.
1698835	The purpose of this study was to identify the basic pattern of interconnections between the cerebellar nuclei and hypothalamus in Macaca fascicularis. The distribution of retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely filled cerebellofugal axons in the hypothalamus of M. fascicularis was investigated after pressure injections of a horseradish peroxidase mixture (HRP + WGA-HRP) in the cerebellar nuclei. Following injections in the lateral, anterior, and posterior interposed cerebellar nuclei retrogradely labeled cells were present in the following areas (greatest to least concentration): lateral and dorsal hypothalamic areas, dorsomedial nucleus, griseum periventriculare hypothalami, supramammillary and tuberomammillary nuclei, posterior hypothalamic area, ventromedial nucleus and periventricular hypothalamus, around the medial mammillary nucleus, lateral mammillary nucleus, and infundibular nucleus. Cell labeling was bilateral with an ipsilateral preponderance. In these same experiments anterogradely labeled cerebellar efferent fibers terminated in the contralateral posterior, dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas, and the dorsomedial nucleus. In these regions retrogradely labeled hypothalamic cells were occasionally found in areas that also contained anterogradely filled cerebellar axons. This suggests a partial reciprocity in this system. In addition, sparse numbers of labeled cerebellar fibers recross in the hypothalamus to distribute to homologous areas ipsilateral to the injection site. Subsequent to an injection in the medial cerebellar nucleus (NM), cell labeling was present in more rostral hypothalamic levels including the lateral and dorsal hypothalamic areas, the dorsomedial nucleus, around or in fascicles of the column of the fornix, and in the periventricular hypothalamic area. Although no fastigiohypothalamic fibers were seen in this study, on the basis of information available from the literature it is likely that such a connection exists in primates. In summary, hypothalamic projections to NM originated mainly from rostral to midhypothalamic levels, whereas those projections to the lateral three cerebellar nuclei came from mid and more caudal levels. The existence of direct hypothalamic projections to cerebellar nuclei in M. fascicularis and of cerebellofugal projection to some hypothalamic centers indicates that circuitry is present through which the cerebellum may influence visceral functions. Furthermore, the fact that projections to NM versus the other cerebellar nuclei originate from somewhat different regions of the hypothalamus would suggest that the visceral functions modulated by each pathway is not the same.
1699638	The connections of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg) have been investigated using anterograde and retrograde lectin tracers with immunocytochemical detection. Inputs to LDTg were found from frontal cortex, diagonal band, preoptic areas, lateral hypothalamus, lateral mamillary nucleus, lateral habenula; the interpeduncular nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra and retrorubral fields; the medial terminal nucleus, interstitial nucleus, supraoculomotor central grey, medial pretectum, nucleus of the posterior commissure, paramedian pontine reticular formation, paraabducens and paratrochlear region; the parabrachial nuclei and nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Terminal labelling from PHA-L injections of LDTg was found in infralimbic, cingulate and hippocampal cortex, lateral septum, septofimbrial and triangular nuclei, horizontal limb of diagonal band and preoptic areas; in the anterior, mediodorsal, reuniens, centrolateral, parafascicular, paraventricular and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei, rostral reticular thalamic nucleus, and zona incerta; the lateral habenula and the lateral hypothalamus. A number of brainstem structures apparently associated with visual functions were also innervated, mainly the superior colliculus, medial pretectum, medial terminal nucleus, paramedian pontine reticular formation, inferior olive, supraoculomotor, paraabducens and supragenual regions, prepositus hypoglossi and nucleus of the posterior commissure. Also innervated were substantia nigra compacta, ventral tegmental area, interfascicular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, dorsal and medial raphe, pedunculopontine tegmental region, parabrachial nuclei, and nucleus of the tractus solitarius. These findings suggest the LDTg to be a highly differentiated part of the ascending "reticular activating" system, concerned not only with specific cortical and thalamic regions, especially those associated with the limbic system, but also with the basal ganglia, and visual (particularly oculomotor) mechanisms. Additional links with the habenula-interpeduncular system are discussed in this context.
1702107	The aim of the present study was to determine the brainstem afferents and the location of neurons giving rise to monoaminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic inputs to the cat trigeminal motor nucleus (TMN). This was done in colchicine treated animals by using a very sensitive double immunostaining technique with unconjugated cholera-toxin B subunit (CT) as a retrograde tracer. After CT injections in the TMN, retrogradely labeled neurons were most frequently seen bilaterally in the nuclei reticularis parvicellularis and dorsalis of the medulla oblongata, the alaminar spinal trigeminal nucleus (magnocellular division), and the adjacent pontine juxtatrigeminal region and in the ipsilateral mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. We further observed that inputs to the TMN arise from the medial medullary reticular formation (the nuclei retricularis magnocellularis and gigantocellularis), the principal bilateral sensory trigeminal nucleus, and the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum. In addition, the present study demonstrated that the TMN received 1) serotonergic afferents, mainly from the nuclei raphe obscurus, pallidus, and dorsalis; 2) catecholaminergic afferent projections originating exclusively in the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum, including the Kölliker-Fuse, parabrachialis lateralis, and locus subcoeruleus nuclei; further, that 3) methionin-enkephalin-like inputs were located principally in the medial medullary reticular formation (nuclei reticularis magnocellularis and gigantocellularis and nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis), in the caudal raphe nuclei (Rpa and Rob) and the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum; 4) substance P-like immunoreactive neurons projecting to the TMN were present in the caudal raphe and Edinger-Westphal nuclei; and 5) cholinergic afferents originated in the whole extent of the nuclei reticularis parvicellularis and dorsalis including an area located ventral to the nucleus of the solitary tract at the level of the obex. In the light of these anatomical data, the present report discusses the possible physiological involvement of TMN inputs in the generation of the trigeminal jaw-closer muscular atonia occurring during the periods of paradoxical sleep in the cat.
1705972	Fibers projecting from several levels of the spinal cord to the diencephalon and telencephalon were labeled anterogradely with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injected iontophoretically. Labeled fibers in the thalamus confirmed projections previously observed. In addition, many labeled fibers were seen in the hypothalamus and in telencephalic areas not generally recognized previously as receiving such projections. In the hypothalamus, these areas included the lateral hypothalamus (including the medial forebrain bundle), the posterior hypothalamic area, the dorsal hypothalamic area, the dorsomedial nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, the periventricular area, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the lateral and medial preoptic areas. In the telencephalon, areas with labeled fibers included the ventral pallidum, the globus pallidus, the substantia innominata, the basal nucleus of Meynert, the amygdala (central nucleus), the horizontal and vertical limbs of the diagonal band of Broca, the medial and lateral septal nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus accumbens, infralimbic cortex, and medial orbital cortex. These results suggest that somatosensory, possibly including visceral sensory, information is carried directly from the spinal cord to areas in the brain involved in autonomic regulation, motivation, emotion, attention, arousal, learning, memory, and sensory-motor integration. Many of these areas are associated with the limbic system.
1706735	The central projections of rat trigeminal primary afferent neurons to various "non-trigeminal" areas of the central nervous system were examined by labeling the fibers with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) transported anterogradely from the trigeminal ganglion. This technique produced a clear and comprehensive picture of trigeminal primary afferent connectivity that was in many ways superior to that which may be obtained by using degeneration, autoradiography, cobalt labeling, or HRP transganglionic transport techniques. Strong terminal labeling was observed in all four rostrocaudal subdivisions of the trigeminal brainstem nuclear complex, as well as in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord bilaterally, numerous brainstem nuclei, and in the cerebellum. Labeling in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord was very dense at C1, moderately dense at C2 and C3, and sparse at C4-C7. Numerous fibers crossed the midline in the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord and terminated in the contralateral pars caudalis and dorsal horn of the spinal cord from C1-C5. The latter axons terminated most heavily in the mandibular and ophthalmic regions of the contralateral side. Extremely dense terminal labeling was observed in the ipsilateral paratrigeminal nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract, moderate labeling was seen in the supratrigeminal nucleus and in the dorsal reticular formation, and small numbers of fibers were observed in the cuneate, trigeminal motor, lateral and superior vestibular nuclei, and in the cerebellum. The latter fibers entered the cerebellum in the superior cerebellar peduncle and projected to the posterior and anterior lobes as well as to the interposed and lateral deep cerebellar nuclei. Most projections in this study originated from fibers in the dorsal part of the spinal tract of V, suggesting a predominantly mandibular origin for these fibers. Projections from the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions, in contrast, were directed mainly to the cervical spinal cord bilaterally, to contralateral pars caudalis, and to certain areas of the reticular formation. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that somatosensory information from the head and face may be transmitted directly to widespread and functionally heterogeneous areas of the rat central nervous system, including the spinal cord dorsal horn, numerous brainstem nuclei, and the cerebellum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1711054	The projections of the deep cerebellar nuclei in the pigeon have been delineated using autoradiographic and histochemical (WGA-HRP) tracing techniques. A medial (CbM) and lateral (CbL) cerebellar nucleus are recognized and CbM may be further partitioned into internal, intermediate, and intercalate divisions. As in mammals, most extracerebellar projections of CbM travel in the fasciculus uncinatus (FU); the rest travel with those of CbL in the brachium conjunctivum (BC). In the pigeon, both of these pathways are bilaterally but primarily contralaterally projecting systems. FU is a predominantly descending tract, with terminations within (1) the vestibular complex, (2) a column of contiguous medial reticular nuclei from pontine to caudal medullary levels; (3) the plexus of Horsley portion of the parvicellular reticular formation, continuing through the nucleus centralis medullae oblongatae, pars dorsalis, into intermediate layer VII of the cervical spinal cord, down to cervical segment 8-9; (4) the lateral reticular nucleus and the paragigantocellular reticular nucleus; (5) the dorsal lamella of the inferior olive. Rostrally FU terminals are found in the locus ceruleus and dorsal subcerulean nucleus. Minimal FU projections are also seen to the motor trigeminal nucleus and the subnucleus oralis of the descending trigeminal system. A small projection from the intercalate division of CbM travels in BC and projects upon the midbrain central grey, the intercollicular nucleus, the lateral tectal periventricular grey, the stratum cellulare externum and, sparsely, upon the dorsolateral thalamus. The bulk of BC originates from the lateral cerebellar nucleus and consists of a massive ascending and a small descending branch. The ascending system projects upon the red nucleus and the dorsally adjacent interstitial nucleus of Cajal and midbrain central grey, the prerubral fields continuing into the stratum cellulare externum, the nucleus intercalatus thalami, the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, the medial spiriform nucleus, the nucleus principalis precommissuralis, the nucleus of the basal optic root, the nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars ventralis, the dorsolateral thalamus, including the dorsal intermediate posterior, and the dorsolateral intermediate and anterior nuclei. BC also contains axons from the infracerebellar nucleus, which projects upon the trochlear and the oculomotor nuclei. The descending branch of BC distributes to the papilioform nucleus, the medial pontine nucleus, the gigantocellular and paramedian reticular nuclei, and, minimally, the rostral portions of the medial column and ventral lamella of the inferior olive. Taken in conjunction with data on amphibia and reptiles the present findings suggest that the fundamental ground plan of vertebrate cerebellar organization involves a medial and lateral cerebellar nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1711859	Anterograde tracing studies were conducted in order to identify efferents from the arcuate nucleus, which contains the hypothalamic opiocortin neuronal pool. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) was stereotaxically iontophoresed into the arcuate nucleus and the terminal fields emanating from the labelled perikarya were identified immunocytochemically. PHA-L-immunoreactive (-ir) fibers were identified in nucleus accumbens, lateral septal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and lateral preoptic areas, anterior hypothalamus, amygdaloid complex, lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, zona incerta, dorsal hypothalamus, periventricular gray, medial thalamus and medial habenula. In the brainstem, arcuate terminals were identified in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), nucleus raphe pallidus, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars alpha, nucleus tractus solitarius and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Dual immunostaining was used to identify the neurochemical content of neurons in arcuate terminal fields in the brainstem. Arcuate fiber terminals established putative contacts with serotonergic neurons in the ventrolateral PAG, DRN and NRM and with noradrenergic neurons in periventricular gray, PAG and locus coeruleus. In the PAG, arcuate fibers terminated in areas with neurons immunoreactive to substance P, neurotensin, enkephalin and cholecystokinin (CCK) and putative contacts were identified with CCK-ir cells. This study provides neuroanatomical evidence that putative opiocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus influence a descending system which modulates nociception.
1713237	The topographic and laminar organization of entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex was investigated in the Macaca fascicularis monkey. Injections of 3H-amino acids were placed at various positions within the entorhinal cortex and the distribution of anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals within the other fields of the hippocampal formation was determined. Injections of the retrograde tracers Fast blue, Diamidino yellow, and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were also placed into the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex, and the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in the entorhinal cortex was plotted using a computer-aided digitizing system. The entorhinal cortex gave rise to projections that terminated in the subiculum, in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus, and in the dentate gyrus. Projections to the dentate gyrus, and fields CA3 and CA2 of the hippocampus, originated preferentially in layers II and VI of the entorhinal cortex whereas projections to CA1 and to the subiculum originated mainly in layers III and V. Anterograde tracing experiments demonstrated that all regions of the entorhinal cortex project to the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and to much of the radial extent of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA3 and CA2. While the terminal distributions of entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA2 were not as clearly laminated as in the rat, projections from rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex preferentially innervated the outer portion of the molecular layer and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, whereas more caudal levels of the entorhinal cortex projected relatively more heavily to the deeper portions of the entorhinal terminal zones. The entorhinal projection to the CA1 field of the hippocampus and to the subiculum followed a transverse rather than radial gradient of distribution. Rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex terminated most heavily at the border of CA1 and the subiculum. More caudal levels of the entorhinal cortex projected to progressively more distal portions of the subiculum (towards the presubiculum) and more proximal portions of CA1 (towards CA2). Lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex projected to caudal levels of the recipient fields and more medial parts of the entorhinal cortex projected to progressively more rostral portions of the fields.
1713925	Electrophysiological recording, together with anterograde and retrograde axonal tracers, was used to provide a comprehensive description of the origin and distribution of the olfactory input to the lateral hypothalamus. This input was much more substantial to the caudal part of the hypothalamus than to the rostral part and originates from several different areas of the olfactory cortex. Positive responses to electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb were found consistently in the postero-lateral hypothalamus, but only occasionally at more rostral levels. In agreement with this, injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) in the posterior half of the lateral hypothalamus labeled cells in four cortical areas that receive input from the olfactory bulb: the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex (in the deepest layer or ventral endopiriform nucleus), the olfactory tubercle (in the deep polymorphic layer), and the anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala. Injections of WGA-HRP in the anterolateral hypothalamus labeled cells only in the anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala. Anterograde axonal tracing confirmed these projections. Injections of 3H-leucine in the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, and the olfactory tubercle produced axonal label that was light and confined to the medial forebrain bundle in the rostral hypothalamus but was more substantial and extended throughout the lateral hypothalamic area caudally. Injections in the anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus labeled axons in the anterior hypothalamus and in the premammillary nuclei as well as in the posterolateral hypothalamic area. In addition, a projection was demonstrated to the nuclei gemini from the polymorphic zone deep to the olfactory tubercle. Injections of two fluorescent retrograde tracers into the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the posterolateral hypothalamus showed that cells projecting to both diencephalic sites were intermingled in all of the olfactory cortical areas except the anterior olfactory nucleus, where cells were labeled only from the hypothalamus. In the deep layer of the piriform cortex and in the anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus cells were also double labeled, indicating that they send collateral axons to both parts of the diencephalon.
1716270	On the basis of stimulation studies, it has been proposed that the infralimbic cortex (ILC), Brodmann area 25, may serve as an autonomic motor cortex. To explore this hypothesis, we have combined anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde tracing with wheat germ aggutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) to determine the efferent projections from the ILC. Axons exit the ILC in one of three efferent pathways. The dorsal pathway ascends through layers III and V to innervate the prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices. The lateral pathway courses through the nucleus accumbens to innervate the insular cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and parts of the piriform cortex. In addition, some fibers from the lateral pathway enter the corticospinal tract. The ventral pathway is by far the largest and innervates the thalamus (including the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the border zone between the paraventricular and medial dorsal nuclei, and the paratenial, reuniens, ventromedial, parafasicular, and subparafasicular nuclei), the hypothalamus (including the lateral hypothalamic and medial preoptic areas, and the suprachiasmatic, dorsomedial, and supramammillary nuclei), the amygdala (including the central, medial, and basomedial nuclei, and the periamygdaloid cortex) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The ventral efferent pathway also provides descending projections to autonomic cell groups of the brainstem and spinal cord including the periaqueductal gray matter, the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the dorsal motor vagal nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus, and the ventrolateral medulla, as well as lamina I and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. The ILC has extensive projections to central autonomic nuclei that may subserve a role in modulating visceral responses to emotional stimuli, such as stress.
1716594	Afferent connections of rat primary visual cortex (area 17 or V1 area) and the rostral and caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b were studied, by placing in each of the areas, small electrophoretic injections of enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or wheat germ agglutinated-HRP. The results indicate that: 1) each of the areas has a distinct pattern of distribution of afferent neurons in the ipsilateral visual thalamus - area 17 receives its principal thalamic input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b receive a major thalamic input from the lateral posterior nucleus and a minor input from the posterior nucleus, while the rostral parts of areas 18a and 18b receive a major input from the posterior nucleus, and a minor projection from the lateral posterior nucleus; 2) the rostral and caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b each receive an associational input from area 17; 3) the rostral parts of areas 18a and 18b each receive associational input from three different extrastriate regions, the caudal part of the same extrastriate area, and the rostral and caudal parts of the other extrastriate area, whereas the caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b receive associational inputs only from one or two extrastriate regions; 4) area 17, area 18b and rostral area 18a each receive a substantial associational input from lamina V of the caudal part of the frontal eye field (FEF) in the motor cortex; however the input from the FEF to caudal area 18a (if present) is very small; 5) The extrastriate areas studied receive associational input from the restrosplenial cingulate area 29d; however, the input from area 29d to area 17 appears to be very small. The distinct patterns of distribution of prosencephalic afferents suggest to us that multiple retinotopically organized areas described previously in the rat cortex (cf Montero 1981; Espinoza and Thomas 1983) represent functionally distinct areas.
1719037	The immunocytochemical distribution of galanin-containing perikarya and nerve terminals in the brain of Rana esculenta and Xenopus laevis was determined with antisera directed toward either porcine or rat galanin. The pattern of galanin-like immunoreactivity appeared to be identical with antisera directed toward either target antigen. The distribution of galanin-like immunoreactivity was similar in Rana esculenta and Xenopus laevis except for the absence of a distinct laminar distribution of immunoreactivity in the optic tectum of Xenopus laevis. Galanin-containing perikarya were located in all major subdivisions of the brain except the metencephalon. In the telencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were detected in the pars medialis of the amygdala and the preoptic area. In the diencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were detected in the caudal half of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the nucleus of the periventricular organ, the ventral hypothalamus, and the median eminence. In the mesencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were detected near the midline of the rostroventral tegmentum, in the torus semicircularis and, occasionally, in lamina A and layer 6 of the optic tectum. In the myelencephalon, labelled perikarya were detected only in the caudal half of the nucleus of the solitary tract. Immunoreactive nerve fibers of varying density were observed in all subdivisions of the brain with the densest accumulations of fibers occurring in the pars lateralis of the amygdala and the preoptic area. Dense accumulations of nerve fibers were also found in the lateral septum, the medial forebrain bundle, the periventricular region of the diencephalon, the ventral hypothalamus, the median eminence, the mesencephalic central gray, the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis, several laminae of the optic tectum, the interpeduncular nucleus, the isthmic nucleus, the central gray of the rhombencephalon, and the dorsolateral caudal medulla. The extensive system of galanin-containing perikarya and nerve fibers in the brain of representatives of two families of anurans showed many similarities to the distribution of galanin-containing perikarya and nerve fibers previously described for the mammalian brain.
1719042	A study was made of the cytoarchitecture of the lateral and medial frontal cortex in the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas). The frontal cortico-cortical connections of areas 46, 8, 6, and 4 were investigated by injection of wheat-germ agglutinine conjugated to horseradish peroxiase (WGA-HRP) into different regions of areas 46, 8, and 6. The lateral region of the frontal lobe of the baboon consists of broad areas of motor (area 4), premotor (area 6), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, each of which is further divided into subdivisions with distinct cytoarchitectural features: areas 4a, 4b, 4c; 6 a alpha, 6a beta, 6a gamma, and 6b beta; 8A and 8B; 45; 46 and 46ps; 9; 10; and 12. Although the frontal cortex of the baboon brain exhibits the same basic cytoarchitectural features as the frontal corticies of the cercopithecus (campbelli?) (Vogt and Vogt, '19) or the macaque (Walker, '40; Barbas and Pandya, '87, '89), the baboon frontal cortex is very different from that of the macaque and cercopithecus in terms of cytoarchitecture: (1) the baboon frontal cortex has an additional area, termed here "6a gamma", within area 6, which has cytoarchitectural characteristics that are intermediate between those of areas 6 and 8; (2) the aggregation of giant pyramidal cells (greater than 50 microns in diameter) is found only in area 4a in the baboon, whereas such aggregates are found in areas 4a and 4b and, occasionally, in area 4c in the macaque; and (3) area 46 of the prefrontal cortex of the baboon can be subdivided into the cortex that surrounds the principal sulcus (area 46) and the upper and lower banks of the principal sulcus (area 46ps). Retrogradely WGA-HRP labeled cells and anterogradely WGA-HRP labeled terminals coexisted in the frontal cortex in a columnar fashion, indicative of a reciprocity among the connections. The frontal cortico-cortical connections of areas 46, 8, 6, and 4 in the hamadryas baboon were organized as follows: (1) areas 46, 8, and 6 were connected to one another, (2) area 4 was connected only to area 6, and (3) these connections showed a gross ventrodorsal topography: the ventral regions of each of areas 46, 8, and 6 were connected more strongly to the ventral than the dorsal regions of the other areas; the dorsal regions of each of areas 46, 8, and 6 were connected more strongly to the dorsal than the ventral regions of the other areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1720179	Effects of ethanol consumption and intake of low-carbohydrate (low-CHO) diet on noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) contents in six brain regions of rats were investigated. 1) Change of DA neuron Ethanol-containing control diet (hypercaloric ethanol diet) did not affect DA content in any area of brain, but decreased HVA in cortex and hypothalamus and increased DOPAC and HVA in midbrain. Low-CHO diet increased DA content in striatum, DOPAC and HVA in midbrain, but decreased DOPAC in hippocampus and hypothalamus, and HVA in cortex, pons and medulla, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Ethanol-containing low-CHO diet (isocaloric ethanol diet) increased DA level in striatum, DOPAC and HVA in midbrain, but decreased HVA in cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus. These results suggest that i) hypercaloric ethanol diet has an opposite effect to carbohydrate on DA metabolism: hypercaloric ethanol diet and lowered carbohydrate intake per se enhance DA metabolism in midbrain, whereas inhibit it in cortex and hypothalamus, ii) lowered carbohydrate intake also declines DA metabolism in pons and medulla and hippocampus, whereas enhances DA synthesis in striatum, iii) the combined effect of ethanol and carbohydrate intake on DA metabolism is inhibited each other in the rats of isocaloric ethanol diet feeding, and this diet decreased DA metabolism in striatum. 2) Change of 5HT neuron Hypercaloric ethanol diet did not affect the contents of 5HT and 5HIAA in any region of brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1720266	The effects of allylnitrile (ALN), which induces a long-term dyskinesia in mice, on the metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were studied after a single administration. One day after injection, ALN produced a significant increase in the levels of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA): 5-HT in the brain cortex, medulla oblongata plus pons, hypothalamus and midbrain; 5-HIAA in the cortex, medulla oblongata plus pons, striatum, hypothalamus and midbrain; the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the medulla oblongata plus pons, striatum and midbrain; HVA in the cortex and midbrain. These changes were not seen 10 and 35 days after injection when the animals were showing behavioral abnormalities. The present findings suggest that changes in 5-HT and DA metabolism are involved in the appearance of the dyskinetic syndrome.
1720792	Conventional retrograde and orthograde axonal transport tract-tracing techniques were used in cats to explore the auditory decussations and commissures in the upper pons and midbrain. In all, 8 decussations differing either in origin or in contralateral termination were found. Three of the 8 decussations (from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus to the contralateral dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus to the contralateral inferior colliculus, from the sagulum to the contralateral sagulum) reach their targets via the commissure of Probst. The remaining 5 decussations (from the inferior colliculus to the contralateral inferior colliculus or medial geniculate, from the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus to the contralateral medial geniculate, from the sagulum to the contralateral inferior colliculus or medial geniculate) reach their targets via the commissure of the inferior colliculus. The results also suggest that the commissure of Probst is not a general avenue for decussating auditory fibers of the lateral lemniscus but is instead a specific avenue only for fibers from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and sagulum. The results also show that, in the cat at least, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus does not project beyond the inferior colliculus to either the superior colliculus or medial geniculate--the cells previously reported as doing so are probably those of the immediate neighbors of the dorsal nucleus, the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and sagulum.
1721116	The brainstem mossy-fiber projections to lobules VIa, VIb,c, VII and VIII of the cerebellar vermis were studied by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase in the rat. The distribution of labeled cells indicated that these lobules received major projections from topographically different locations of the basilar pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Lobules VIa and VIII received an additional strong projection from the lateral reticular nucleus. Moderate projections were found to reach lobule VIa from the raphe pontis and external cuneate nucleus; lobules VIb,c from the raphe pontis, lateral reticular nucleus, and a group of cells in the lateral tegmentum; lobule VII from the spinal vestibular nucleus and a lateral tegmental cell group; and lobule VIII from the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, nucleus intercalatus and Roller of the perihypoglossal nuclei, and the main cuneate nucleus. The quantitative and topographical differences in the origin of mossy fibers suggest that these lobules may subserve slightly different functions.
1721118	Recent cytoarchitectonic, histochemical and physiological studies have shown that the lateral part of area 6 (the premotor cortex) of macaque monkeys can be divided into at least two subregions, each of which is considered to play an important role in motor control. One lies in the dorsal aspect of the premotor cortex (PMd) medial to the spur of the arcuate sulcus, and the other in the ventral aspect of the premotor cortex (PMv) lateral to it. Since there is little information on the corticocortical inputs to the PMd, wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into both the PMd and PMv to study corticocortical inputs to these two regions, and the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells was compared. When WGA-HRP was injected into the region immediately lateral to the superior precentral sulcus within the PMd, retrogradely labeled neurons were found in area 6 lying in the mesial wall possibly corresponding to the supplementary motor area (SMA), areas 24 and 23 of the cingulate cortex, rostral region of area 4, and area 5 (area PEa). In contrast, when WGA-HRP was injected into the PMv immediately caudal to the arcuate sulcus and lateral to the spur of the arcuate sulcus, the labeled cells were found in area 7 (areas POa, PF, PFG), area 5 (area PEa), area PFop (secondary somatosensory area), SMA, the cingulate cortex (areas 24), caudal region of area 4 in the rostral bank of the central sulcus, and area 3a. It appears that the differences in the corticocortical inputs contribute to specialization of the PMd and PMv for their differential roles in motor control.
1721686	Central nervous system neurons which have access to the general circulation were identified by injecting the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold peripherally. Fluoro-Gold does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier but is taken up by nerve terminals which project to areas supplied by fenestrated capillaries or to the periphery. Fluoro-Gold-accumulating neurons were present in the following regions or cell groups of the central nervous system: diagonal band of Broca; medial preoptic area; organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis; subfornical organ; anterior periventricular area; paraventricular nucleus; arcuate nucleus; accessory magnocellular nuclei of the hypothalamus; motor neurons of cranial nerves III-VII, and IX-XII in the brainstem and spinal cord; autonomic ganglionic cells of cranial nerve III (Westphal-Edinger nucleus) in the mesencephalon and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord; sensory ganglia of the cranial nerve V (mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus); and the C1-C2 and A2 adrenergic cell groups in the medulla. In addition, Fluoro-Gold-accumulating neurons were seen in the sensory ganglia of cranial and spinal nerves. Retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold can be combined with immunocytochemistry to identify the chemical messengers within Fluoro-Gold-labeled perikarya. Although a large number of neurons are labeled in the central nervous system with Fluoro-Gold when it is administered peripherally, this technique in combination with immunocytochemistry can be a powerful tool to identify selected neuronal systems in the central nervous system.
1722132	The cellular distribution of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) immunoreactivity was examined in the rat brain from embryonic day 15 to maturity. IGF-I immunoreactivity was found in the perikarya of neurons distributed along the entire extension of the neuronal tube in all the embryonic ages studied (E15, E17, E19 and E21). In E21 animals, the majority of immunoreactive neurons was located in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, diencephalon, mesencephalic colliculi, trigeminal nuclei, trigeminal ganglion and in motoneurons of the brainstem. In 10- and 20-day-old rats, in addition to the above areas, IGF-I immunoreactivity was also observed in capillary walls, ependymal cells, choroid plexus, glial cells and most fiber paths. In postnatal ages, immunoreactivity in neuronal somas was mainly restricted to the cell nuclei. However, IGF-I immunoreactivity in the neuronal cytoplasm was observed in 20-day-old rats treated with colchicine while fiber paths and neuronal cell nuclei were negative in these animals. In the telencephalon of 20-day-old rats injected with colchicine, the most intense immunoreactive neurons were observed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, tenia tecta, hippocampus, islands of Calleja, septal nuclei, striatum, endopyriform nucleus and amygdala. Most diencephalic nuclei, the substantia nigra, the mesencephalic colliculi, Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and several nuclei in mesencephalon, pons and medulla oblongata were also immunoreactive. In adult rats injected with colchicine, IGF-I immunoreactivity was located in the same areas as in 20-day-old rats. The number of immunoreactive cells and the intensity of the staining was reduced in adult rats as compared to that found in young postnatal animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1726062	The efferent projections of the infralimbic region (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat were examined by using the anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). Major targets of the IL were found to include the agranular insular cortex, olfactory tubercle, perirhinal cortex, the whole amygdaloid complex, caudate putamen, accumbens nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, midline thalamic nuclei, the lateral preoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, medial mammillary nucleus, dorsal and posterior areas of the hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, central gray, interpeduncular nucleus, dorsal raphe, lateral parabrachial nucleus and locus coeruleus. Previously unreported projections of the IL to the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, anterior hypothalamic area and lateroanterior hypothalamic nucleus were observed. The density of labeled terminals was especially high in the agranular insular cortex, olfactory tubercle, medial division of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal hypothalamic area and the lateral division of the central amygdaloid nucleus. Several physiological and pharmacological studies have suggested that the IL functions as the 'visceral motor' cortex, involved in autonomic integration with behavioral and emotional events. The present investigation is the first comprehensive study of the IL efferent projections to support this concept.
1740548	Little is known about the immunohistochemistry of the nervous system in bats. This is particularly true of the nervus terminalis, which exerts strong influence on the reproductive system during ontogeny and in the adult. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was visualized immunocytochemically in the nervus terminalis and brain of juvenile and adult big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). The peripheral LHRH-immunoreactive (ir) cells and fibers (nervus terminalis) are dispersed along the basal surface of the forebrain from the olfactory bulbs to the prepiriform cortex and the interpeduncular fossa. A concentration of peripheral LHRH-ir perikarya and fibers was found at the caudalmost part of the olfactory bulbs, near the medioventral forebrain sulcus; obviously these cells mediate between the bulbs and the remaining forebrain. Within the central nervous system (CNS), LHRH-ir perikarya and fibers were distributed throughout the olfactory tubercle, diagonal band, preoptic area, suprachiasmatic and supraoptic nuclei, the bed nuclei of stria terminalis and stria medullaris, the anterior lateral and posterior hypothalamus, and the tuber cinereum. The highest concentration of cells was found within the arcuate nucleus. Fibers were most concentrated within the median eminence, infundibular stalk, and the medial habenula. The data obtained suggest that this distribution of LHRH immunoreactivity may be characteristic for microchiropteran (insectivorous) bats. The strong projections of LHRH-containing nuclei in the basal forebrain (including the arcuate nucleus) to the habenula, may indicate close functional contact between these brain areas via feedback loops, which could be important for the processing of thermal and other environmental stimuli correlated with hibernation.
1748734	Angiotensin II (Ang II) binding sites were localized in the thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, and pons of the human central nervous system by in vitro autoradiography, employing 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]angiotensin II as the radioligand. High-density binding occurs in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the interpeduncular nucleus and two of the raphe nuclei, the raphe magnus, and median raphe nucleus. Moderate densities occur in the caudate nucleus, putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, rostral linear nucleus, caudal linear nucleus, dorsal and paramedian raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, and region of the subcoeruleus, oral dorsal paramedian nucleus, and A5/periolivary region. Low levels occur in the region between the subthalamic nucleus and the zona incerta, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the central gray, the lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The high density of Ang II receptor binding in the substantia nigra occurs over pigmented, presumably dopaminergic, neurons. The binding in this site, and in the striatum, is not observed in any of the other species we have studied. It displays similar pharmacological characteristics to the Ang II receptor binding site in other regions of the human brain. Overall we demonstrate a discrete pattern of Ang II receptor binding sites in the human brain, which shows a high correlation with the distribution observed in other mammalian species.
1748742	The purpose of this study was to determine which reticulospinal projections need to be preserved to allow voluntary walking and to differentiate between those pathways descending within the ventrolateral funiculus versus the ventromedial funiculus. Retrogradely transported tracers (True Blue, Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow dihydrochloride, fluorescein-conjugated dextran-amines) were used alone as discrete funicular injections (4-5 microliters) into the lumbar cord (L1), or in conjunction with a more rostral subtotal lesion of the low thoracic cord, to determine the trajectories of brainstem-spinal projections in adult ducks and geese. No difference was found between the species. The major components of the ventromedial funiculus include projections from the medullary reticular formation, pontine reticular formation, raphe obscurus and pallidus, lateral vestibular nucleus, and interstitial nucleus, and to a minor extent from the locus coeruleus, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus periventricularis hypothalami. The components of the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) include projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus alatus, pontomedullary reticular formation, raphe pallidus, raphe magnus, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, lateral vestibular, and descending vestibular nuclei. The principal descending projections within the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) arose from the red nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, dorsal division of the caudal medullary reticular formation, and raphe magnus. The functional implications of the distribution of these descending pathways are discussed with regard to locomotion. Since birds were able to walk despite bilateral lesion of the DLF or VMF but were unable to walk following a bilateral lesion of the VLF, this suggests that medullary reticulospinal pathways coursing within the VLF are essential for the provision of locomotor drive.
1752858	The serotonergic neurons of the mammalian brain comprise one of the most expansive chemical systems known. The cell bodies are largely confined to the midline (raphe) region of the brain stem in two general clusters: a superior group that consists of the dorsal raphe nucleus (B-7 and B-6), median raphe nucleus (B-8 and B-5), caudal linear nucleus (rostral B-8), and supralemniscal nucleus (B-9), and an inferior group that consists of nucleus raphe obscurus (B-2), nucleus raphe pallidus (B-1), nucleus raphe magnus (B-3), ventral lateral medulla (B-1/B-3), and the area postrema. The axons from these cells project throughout the neuroaxis from the spinal cord to the olfactory bulb and from the cerebral cortex to the hypothalamus. The development of this giant system begins very early in gestation and is influenced by a variety of growth regulatory factors, including the astroglial protein S-100 beta. Evidence will be presented that the serotonergic system plays a major role in the maturation of the brain by interacting with the 5-HT1A receptors which are most dense during these early developmental periods. The 5-HT1A receptor is located on both neurons and astrocytes, and in the latter cells may serve to stimulate release of S-100 beta. The developmental role of 5-HT appears to become dormant as the brain matures, and during aging and Alzheimer's disease, 5-HT receptors are significantly depressed. However, specific damage to 5-HT fibers in the adult brain by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine produces a sharp fall in the levels of 5-HT which seems to reactivate the developmental signals in the brain. Not only are the serotonergic fibers encouraged to sprout and expand their territory, but the stimulation of the astrocytic growth factor by a 5-HT1A agonist is reinstated. The ability to recall developmental processes in the adult brain by interrupting the 5-HT fibers may provide important tools for understanding and treating the aged brain.
1761745	The efferent connections of different cytoarchitectonic areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the rhesus monkey with parieto-temporo-occipital cortex were investigated using autoradiographic methods. Four rostral-to-caudal subdivisions of cortex (area TPO) in the upper bank of the STS have distinct projection patterns. Rostral sectors (areas TPO-1 and -2) project to the rostral superior temporal gyrus (areas Ts1, Ts2, and Ts3), insula of the Sylvian fissure, and parahippocampal gyrus (perirhinal and prorhinal cortexes, areas TF, TH, and TL); caudal sectors (TPO-3 and -4) project to the caudal superior temporal gyrus (areas paAlt and Tpt), supratemporal plane (area paAc), circular sulcus of the Sylvian fissure (area reIt), as well as medial paralimbic (areas 23, 24, and retrosplenial cortex) and extrastriate (areas 18 and 19) cortexes. Area TPO-1 does not project to the parietal lobe; area TPO-2 projects to the inferior parietal lobule; area TPO-3 to the lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) (area POa); and area TPO-4 to medial parietal cortex (area PGm). Vision-related cortex (area TEa) in the rostral lower bank of the STS sends fibers to the rostral inferotemporal region (areas TE1, -2, and -3) and parahippocampal gyrus (perirhinal cortex, areas TF and TL). Visual zones in the caudal lower bank and depth of the sulcus (area OAa, or MT and FST) project to the caudal inferotemporal region (areas TE3 and TEO), lateral preoccipital region (area V4), and lower bank of the IPS (area POa). A zone in the rostral depth of the STS (area IPa) projects to the rostral inferotemporal region, parahippocampal gyrus, insula of the Sylvian fissure, parietal operculum, and lower rim of the IPS (area PG). STS projections to parieto-temporo-occipital cortex have "feedforward," "feedbackward," and "side-to-side" laminar patterns of termination similar to those of other cortical sensory systems. The differential connectivity supports the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the STS and suggests functional heterogeneity.
1761746	The neuronal distribution of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) was mapped in the rat brain. Argininosuccinate synthetase is one of the enzymes of the arginine metabolic pathway and catabolizes the synthesis of argininosuccinate from aspartate and citrulline. Since arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide, argininosuccinate synthetase may act as part of the nitric oxide producing pathway. Argininosuccinate is also suggested to have a messenger function in the nervous system. Therefore, the localization of ASS is of great interest. Polyclonal antisera against purified rat liver argininosuccinate synthetase revealed a characteristic distribution pattern of argininosuccinate synthetase-like immunoreactivity: (1) many neurons with strong argininosuccinate synthetase-like immunoreactivity were observed in the septal area, basal forebrain, anterior medial and premammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus, anterior and midline thalamic nuclei, dorsal endopiriform nucleus of the amygdala, basal nucleus of Meynert, subthalamic nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, raphe nuclei, nucleus ambiguus, and the area postrema, (2) neuropile staining was dense in the septal areas, hypothalamus, area postrema, nucleus of the solitary tract, and the laminae I and II of the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the spinal dorsal horn, (3) relay nuclei of the specific sensory systems such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and the ventral nuclei of the thalamus were devoid of argininosuccinate synthetase-like immunoreactivity, (4) no staining was seen in the large white matter structures such as the internal capsule, corpus callosum, and the anterior commissure, and (5) most of the neurons stained were small or medium in size and appeared to be interneurons. The results suggest that argininosuccinate synthetase affects the widely distributed, neuromodulatory system in the brain.
1770996	We studied the detailed distributions and morphology of structures immunoreactive to type B monoamine oxidase, and compared them with those stained by monoamine oxidase enzyme histochemistry in the brain of cats treated with or without colchicine. By means of the indirect immunohistochemical method in conjunction with type B monoamine oxidase monoclonal antibody, we demonstrated type B monoamine oxidase immunoreactivity in neuronal cell bodies, fibers and astroglial cells in the cat brain. As expected, the distribution of type B monoamine oxidase-immunoreactive cell bodies overlapped that of serotonin-containing ones in the lower brainstem and midbrain, as well as that of histaminergic ones in the posterior hypothalamus. We found novel cell groups containing type B monoamine oxidase in the areas described below. Intense type B monoamine oxidase-immunopositive and enzymatically active neurons, corresponding to liquor-contact ones, were discovered in the wall of the central canal of the spinomedullary junction. Weak immunoreactivity was identified in neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, parvocellular reticular formation and locus coeruleus complex, which have been reported to contain type A monoamine oxidase enzymatic activity. Type B monoamine oxidase-immunostaining in these structures was enhanced by treatment with colchicine. In addition, lightly immunostained cells were distinguished in the caudal portion of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, area of tuber cinereum, retrochiasmatic area, and rostral portion of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus after colchicine treatment. These cells also displayed monoamine oxidase activity; however, it was difficult to enzymatically characterize their nature due to its weak activity and sensitivity to inhibitors of both A and B. Distinct type B monoamine oxidase-immunoreactive fibers and terminal-like dots were abundant in the whole brain, particularly in the central gray, dorsal pontine tegmentum, interpeduncular and pontine nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, where dense innervations of serotonergic fibers have been reported. Their immunoreactive density increased after colchicine treatment, but monoamine oxidase enzymatic reaction did not. An intense immunoreactivity could be seen in many glial cells in parts of the brain including myelinated axon pathways. The densest accumulation of such labeled glial cells was found in the central gray, inferior olive, medial geniculate body, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area of Tsai, retrorubral area, hypothalamus, thalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In contrast, the striatum contained less numerous type B monoamine oxidase-immunoreactive and enzymatically active astroglial cells in comparison with the other structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1783685	Ascending projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) were examined in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The majority of labeled fibers from the DR ascended through the forebrain within the medial forebrain bundle. DR fibers were found to terminate heavily in several subcortical as well as cortical sites. The following subcortical nuclei receive dense projections from the DR: ventral regions of the midbrain central gray including the 'supraoculomotor central gray' region, the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra-pars compacta, midline and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus including the posterior paraventricular, the parafascicular, reuniens, rhomboid, intermediodorsal/mediodorsal, and central medial thalamic nuclei, the central, lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, posteromedial regions of the striatum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lateral septal nucleus, the lateral preoptic area, the substantia innominata, the magnocellular preoptic nucleus, the endopiriform nucleus, and the ventral pallidum. The following subcortical nuclei receive moderately dense projections from the DR: the median raphe nucleus, the midbrain reticular formation, the cuneiform/pedunculopontine tegmental area, the retrorubral nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus, the lateral hypothalamus, the paracentral and central lateral intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, the globus pallidus, the medial preoptic area, the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band nuclei, the claustrum, the nucleus accumbens, and the olfactory tubercle. The piriform, insular and frontal cortices receive dense projections from the DR; the occipital, entorhinal, perirhinal, frontal orbital, anterior cingulate, and infralimbic cortices, as well as the hippocampal formation, receive moderately dense projections from the DR. Some notable differences were observed in projections from the caudal DR and the rostral DR. For example, the hippocampal formation receives moderately dense projections from the caudal DR and essentially none from the rostral DR. On the other hand, virtually all neocortical regions receive significantly denser projections from the rostral than from the caudal DR. The present results demonstrate that dorsal raphe fibers project significantly throughout widespread regions of the midbrain and forebrain.
1787175	The postnatal ontogeny of cells expressing prepro-neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA (prepro-NT/NN mRNA) in the rat forebrain and midbrain was investigated by in situ hybridization histochemistry. According to the pattern of expression during development, the cells which express prepro-NT/NN mRNA can be roughly divided into 2 groups. In type I cells, prepro-NT/NN mRNA expression reaches a maximum in terms of content during the postnatal period. After this early peak, cells of this type express the same or less prepro-NT/NN mRNA, reaching a plateau at an adult level that still contains a high level of expression. In type II cells, prepro-NT/NN mRNA appears during the postnatal period, and the expression decreases dramatically after the first postnatal week, being almost undetectable by a few weeks after birth. Type I cells were observed in the following areas: the piriform cortex, field CA1 of Ammon's horn, subiculum, vertical, and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca, intermediate part of the lateral septal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, caudal part of the caudate putamen, medial, cortical, and central amygdaloid nuclei, ventral tegmental area, deep mesencephalic nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and oral part of the pontine reticular nucleus. Cells of type II were observed in the following areas: the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, rostral part of the caudate putamen, (anterior) cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex (posterior cingulate cortex).
1797870	A survey was made of the density of the cholinergic innervation of different parts of the brainstem of the rat and ferret. Sections of rat and ferret brainstems were stained for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity by using a sensitive immunocytochemical method. Adjacent sections were stained for acetylcholinesterase activity or Nissl substance. The density of the distribution of fine calibre, varicose ChAT-positive axons, assumed to represent cholinergic terminals, was categorised arbitrarily into high, medium, or low. A high density of ChAT-positive terminals was found in all or parts of these structures: interpeduncular nucleus, superficial grey layer of the superior colliculus (ferret), intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, lateral part of the central grey (rat), an area medial to the parabigeminal nucleus (rat), pontine nuclei, ventral tegmental nucleus (rat), midline pontine reticular formation, and an area ventral to the exit point of the 5th nerve (ferret). A medium density of ChAT-positive terminals was observed in all or parts of: the substantia nigra zona compacta (ferret), ventral tegmental area (ferret), superficial grey layer of the superior colliculus, intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus, lateral central grey, area medial to the parabigeminal nucleus, inferior colliculus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, ventral tegmental nucleus (ferret), pontine nuclei, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (ferret), midline pontine reticular formation, ventral cochlear nucleus, dorsal cochlear nucleus, lateral superior olive, spinal trigeminal nuclei, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus, paragigantocellular nucleus, and the dorsal column nuclei including the cuneate, external cuneate, and gracile nuclei. A low density of ChAT-positive terminals was seen throughout the remainder of the brainstem of the rat and ferret, but these terminals were absent from the medial superior olive, substantia nigra zona reticulata (rat), and the central part of the ferret lateral superior olive. A pericellular-like distribution of ChAT-positive terminals was observed in the ventral cochlear nucleus and in association with some of the cells of the nucleus of the mesencephalic tract of the trigeminal nerve. A climbing fibre type arrangement of ChAT-positive terminals was found in the substantia nigra zona compacta (ferret) and medial reticular formation. In general, the distribution of staining for AChE activity reflected that of the distribution of ChAT immunoreactivity in the brainstem, except in a few regions where there were also species differences in the distribution of ChAT-positive terminals, e.g., in the superficial grey layer of the superior colliculus and in the substantia nigra.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1798761	Recently, we have reported a marked rat lateralization in the T-maze choice. Embryonic rat tissue from neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala was transplanted into intact rat brains in various combinations: 1) neocortex and hypothalamus (Neo + Hyp); 2) hippocampus and amygdala (Hipp + Amyg); 3) neocortex and hippocampus (Neo + Hipp); and 4) hypothalamus and amygdala (Hyp + Amyg). Once under conditions in which reinforcement was equally qualitative and equally probable, rats in all groups chose the T-maze arm contralateral to the side of implantation. In a second set of experiments, rats were presented a choice between quality and probability of reinforcement. The right arm of the T-maze contained a cup of water 33% of the time (high-quality but low-probability reinforcement). The left sleeve contained a solution of 0.15% quinine in water 100% of the time (low quality but high probability of reinforcement). Rats that received Neo + Hyp transplants chose the T-maze arm that always contained a drink cup with water significantly more often than they chose the arm that always contained the drink cup with quinine solution. Rats that received Hipp + Amyg transplants chose the arm containing the drink cup with quinine solution much more often than the arm that sometimes contained a cup of water. Rats with transplanted Neo + Hyp generally were more active than rats with transplanted Hipp + Amyg. These data suggest that the behavior of rats can be affected by selective transplantation of different brain tissue.
1801930	Three rabbit polyclonal antisera, originally developed against neuromedin B and highly selective against ranatensin subfamily molecules, were used to study the distribution of neuromedin B-like immunoreactivity in the brain of Rana esculenta. Immunopositive cell bodies were observed in several brain regions, including medial and lateral septal nuclei, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, medial amygdala, ventral striatum, ventromedial and posterior thalamic nuclei, nucleus of the periventricular organ, posterior tuberculum, dorsal, lateral and ventral hypothalamic nuclei, optic tectum, mesencephalic tegmentum and central rhomboencephalic gray. A dense network of immunopositive fibers was also distributed in defined regions of the frog brain, i.e. in the medial pallium, septum, amygdala, ventral thalamus, preoptic area and posterior hypothalamus. The results of the present study, taken with available molecular biology data, indicate that the naturally occurring antigen is probably represented by a ranatensin/litorin-related antigen.
1817728	Early induction of the mRNAs encoding the c-Fos and c-Jun nuclear proteins was examined in rat brain by in situ hybridization at various timepoints following global forebrain ischemia by the method of four-vessel occlusion. All animals were subjected to 20 min of transient ischemia. This produced a pattern of proto-oncogene activation that was most intense in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus 30 min after ischemia, while the hilar cells in the dentate and the pyramidal cells of the CA3 region in the hippocampus showed a more delayed but robust expression of these immediate early genes at 1 h. The neurons of the CA1 region exhibited a more moderate hybridization signal at 1-2 h postischemia. Very little hybridization signal for either immediate early gene could be detected in animals perfused with fixative immediately following ischemia, suggesting that cellular energy levels may have to be restored to a certain level before efficient de novo mRNA synthesis can occur. In the cerebellum, a similar temporal pattern was observed: the granule cells exhibited a prompt but patchy expression of c-fos and c-jun that was followed by a delayed signal in the Purkinje cells. Without exception c-fos and c-jun appeared to be expressed in unison, although the time course of c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation and decay was different in various brain regions: invariably the cerebellum returned rapidly to its baseline with virtually no remaining signal at 3 h postischemia, while c-fos and c-jun activation in the hippocampus remained high at 3 h and returned to baseline by 6 h. Several other brain regions showed early production of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs, such as the medial habenula, piriform cortex, the amygdala, the centromedian, lateral posterior, paracentral, intermediodorsal and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus and the ventromedial and dorsal nuclei of the hypothalamus; in the brainstem, the trapezoid body and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus as well as the adrenergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (C1 group) and nucleus tractus solitarius (C2 group) regions displayed slightly less intense hybridization signals. In addition, the ependyma of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle showed a prompt albeit short-lived production of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs. Sham-operated animals as well as animals that had survived to one week postischemia showed either no or only trace levels of hybridization signal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1822725	The distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs) was mapped in 39 cortical areas of 11 brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whole hemisphere blocks were embedded in polyethylene glycol (Carbowax), sectioned coronally, and stained with thioflavin S and thionin. The densities of NFTs and NPs were assessed using a numerical rating scale for each area. Scores were grouped by type of cortex and by lobe for statistical analysis. Highly significant differences were obtained. For example, limbic periallocortex and allocortex had more NFTs than any other type of cortex. In descending order, the density of NFTs was as follows: periallocortex (area 28) greater than allocortex (subiculum/CA1 zones of hippocampal formation, area 51) greater than corticoid areas (accessory basal nucleus of amygdala, nucleus basalis of Meynert) greater than proisocortex (areas 11, 12, 24, 23, anterior insula, 38, 35) greater than nonprimary association cortex (32, 46, superior temporal sulcus, 40, 39, posterior parahippocampal cortex, 37, 36) greater than primary sensory association cortex (7, 18, 19, 22, 21, 20) greater than agranular cortex (44-5, 8, 6, 4) greater than primary sensory cortex (41-2, 3-1-2, 17). The laminar distribution of NFTs tended to be selective, involving primarily layers III and V of association areas and layers II and IV of limbic periallocortex. There were far more NFTs in both limbic and temporal lobes than in frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. In general, NPs were more evenly distributed throughout the cortex, with the exceptions of limbic periallocortex and allocortex, which had notably fewer NPs than other cortical areas. Temporal and occipital lobes had the highest NP densities, limbic and frontal lobes had the lowest, and parietal lobe was intermediate. No significant left-right hemispheric differences for NFT or NP densities were found across the population, and there was no relationship between duration of illness and densities of NFTs or NPs. The regional and laminar distribution of NFTs (and, to a lesser degree, that of NPs) suggests a consistent pattern of vulnerability within the cerebral cortices that seems correlated to the hierarchies of cortico-cortical connections. The higher-order association cortices, especially those in the anterior and ventromedial sectors of temporal lobe, are the most vulnerable, while other cortices appear less vulnerable to a degree commensurate with their connectional "distance" (i.e., synapses removed) from the limbic areas.
1829900	Previous studies from our laboratories have demonstrated a selective increase in stores of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the anterior hypothalamus of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) compared to NaCl-resistant Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls and have suggested that anterior hypothalamic ANP contributes to the pathogenesis of NaCl-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S by local inhibition of norepinephrine release. We have also observed blunting of cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreflex function in SHR-S compared to WKY. In the current study, ANP stores in 12 brain nuclei thought to participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including locus coeruleus (LC), A1/C1 area (A1/C1), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), medial preoptic nucleus (MPON), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN), lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LN), and posterior hypothalamic area (PHA), were compared in 10-week-old male SHR-S and WKY rats following 3 weeks of 1% v 8% NaCl feeding. Individual brain nuclei were obtained by the micropunch technique and ANP content of bilateral brain nuclei from individual rats was measured by radioimmunoassay. ANP content was significantly decreased in NTS and LC and elevated in AHA of SHR-S compared to WKY rats on either diet. Dietary NaCl supplementation was associated with increased ANP content in PVN of both strains. These alterations in ANP content in SHR-S may be related to the reduced release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals in AHA and to the presumed central defect in baroreceptor function.
1833662	A novel oligonucleotide probe was designed, characterized and utilized to study the distribution and modulation of the mRNA encoding the D2 dopamine receptor in the brain of the mouse. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, the highest levels of the D2 receptor mRNA were found in regions of the brain containing the cell bodies and the terminal projection fields of the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems. Particularly high levels of the D2 receptor mRNA were found in substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, caudate-putamen and olfactory tubercle. This distribution generally paralleled that of the D2 dopamine receptor. Some areas, not usually associated with dopaminergic systems, also contained significant levels of the D2 receptor mRNA signal. These areas included the hippocampus, certain thalamic nuclei, the inferior colliculus and the spinal trigeminal nucleus of the medulla and spinal cord. Lesioning the corpus striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine had little effect on the level of the D2 receptor mRNA in the striatum but greatly reduced the hybridization signal in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Similarly, lesioning the substantia nigra, nearly abolished the signal in the pars compacta but failed to substantially alter the D2 receptor mRNA signal in the striatum. These results suggest that the D2 receptor mRNA in the substantia nigra pars compacta was localized largely to dopaminergic cell bodies, the terminal projections of which lie in the striatum and codes for D2 autoreceptors and that the D2 receptor mRNA of the striatum is in non-dopaminergic cell bodies that are intrinsic to the striatum and probably codes for post-synaptic D2 receptors. Further, the evidence that lesions of striatum and substantia nigra induced with 6-hydroxydopamine greatly reduced the D2 receptor mRNA signal in the substantia nigra, without concomitantly increasing the D2 receptor mRNA in the striatum, suggests that the increase in dopamine receptor binding in the striatum that is ipsilateral to the lesion with 6-hydroxydopamine and the enhanced behavioral sensitivity to dopaminergic agonists, cannot be accounted for solely by an increase in D2 receptor mRNA.
1846041	Iodinated recombinant human nerve growth factor (125I-rhNGF) stimulated neurite formation in PC12 cell cultures with a half-maximal potency of 35-49 pg/ml, compared with 39-52 pg/ml for rhNGF. In quantitative ligand autoradiography, the in vitro equilibrium binding of 125I-rhNGF to brain sections showed a 10-fold regional variation in density and was saturable, reversible, and specifically displaced by up to 74% with rhNGF or murine NGF (muNGF). At equilibrium, 125I-rhNGF bound to these sites with high affinity (Kd 52-85 pM) and low capacity (Bmax less than or equal to 13.2 fmol/mg of protein). Calculation of 125I-rhNGF binding affinity by kinetic methods gave average Kd values of 24 and 31 pM. Computer-generated maps revealed binding in brain regions not identified previously with 125I-muNGF, including hippocampus; dentate gyrus; amygdala; paraventricular thalamus; frontal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate cortices; nucleus accumbens; olfactory tubercle; subiculum; pineal gland; and medial geniculate nucleus. NGF binding sites were distributed in a 2-fold increasing medial-lateral gradient in the caudate-putamen and a 2-fold lateral-medial gradient in the nucleus accumbens. 125I-rhNGF binding sites were also found in most areas labeled by 125I-muNGF, including the interpedunucular nucleus, cerebellum, forebrain cholinergic nuclei, caudoventral caudate-putamen, and trigeminal nerve nucleus. 125I-rhNGF binding sites were absent from areas replete with low-affinity NGF binding sites, including circumventricular organs, myelinated fiber bundles, and choroid plexus. The present analysis provides an anatomical differentiation of high-affinity 125I-rhNGF binding sites and greatly expands the number of brain structures that may respond to endogenous NGF or exogenously administered rhNGF.
1849520	The expression of mRNAs encoding different beta subunits (beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor in the rat brain was investigated by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Transcripts of each subunit showed region-specific localization. Some areas contained all three beta subunit mRNAs, while other areas showed marked differences in the location and level of expression of each subunit mRNA. The regions with strong to very strong labeling by the beta 3 probe were as follows: the olfactory bulb, the cortex, the caudate-putamen, the accumbens nucleus, the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the hippocampal formation, and some areas of the brainstem and spinal cord. Weak to moderate labeling was detected in the thalamus, superior and inferior colliculus, and many areas of the brainstem. The regions with strong to very strong labeling by the beta 2 probe were as follows: the olfactory bulb, the ventral pallidum, the globus pallidus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, the preoptic magnocellular nucleus, the thalamus, the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the cerebellum. Weak to moderate labeling was detected in the regions that showed strong expression of beta 3 subunit mRNA. Expression of beta 1 subunit mRNA was only weak to moderate compared to that of the beta 2 and beta 3 subunit mRNAs. The regions with moderate labeling by the beta 1 probe were the following: the cortex, the claustrum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminale, some nuclei of thalamus and amygdala, the hypothalamus, the hippocampal formation, the subiculum, the cerebellum, and several areas of the brainstem and spinal cord. Thus, our findings showed that the beta subunit mRNAs of the GABAA receptor were differentially expressed in the rat brain, perhaps indicating the existence of different subtypes of the GABAA receptor in different brain regions.
1851768	The present study examined the distributions of connexin43 mRNA and connexin32 mRNA in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. These connexins are the best studied gap junction proteins; connexin32 forms direct cell-cell channels in the liver, as does connexin43 in the heart. There was a differential distribution of cells containing connexin32 mRNA compared with the population of cells which contained connexin43 mRNA, thus implying a regional specificity in the expression of connexins in the CNS. Cells containing connexin43 mRNA were uniformly distributed throughout the gray matter of the neuraxis. Several areas had a higher concentration of cells that express connexin43, such as layer IA of the piriform cortex, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, the reticular part of the substantia nigra, lateral habenula, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, facial nucleus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and dorsal cochlear nucleus. The pattern of connexin43 hybridization and the morphology of connexin43 mRNA containing cells suggest that this gap junction forming protein is found predominantly in astrocytes. Connexin32 mRNA was detected in discrete cell groups of the gray matter that appeared to be neurons, including cells in layer 2 of the neocortex, layer II of the piriform cortex, pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, granule and polymorphic cell layers of the dentate gyrus, islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle, lateral thalamic nuclei, lateral habenula, and Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. A large population of cells in white matter tracts that were labelled with the connexin32 riboprobe appeared to be oligodendrocytes. These studies suggest that neurons and glial cells express connexin32 mRNA, but only astrocytes express connexin43 mRNA. Many of the areas in which connexin mRNAs were demonstrated have electrically coupled cells, morphologically distinct gap junction plaques, and/or have immunocytochemically identifiable connexin proteins. These results indicate that cells with mRNAs coding for intercellular channels have a widespread distribution in the mammalian CNS.
1856316	Descending supraspinal and propriospinal neurons projecting to the female rat sacrocaudal spinal cord, the portion of the spinal cord that innervates the tail, were identified following injection of Fluoro-Gold into the S1-Ca2 spinal cord segments. This study attempted to determine anatomical substrates for propriospinal and supraspinal control of the tail. Propriospinal neurons were identified throughout laminae V-VIII and X at all levels of the spinal cord. The greatest density of labeling was in the lumbar enlargement, followed by the cervical enlargement, with least in the thoracic spinal cord. Within a given cord level, labeling was greatest within the intermediate zone. In addition, other prominent spinal cord collections included neurons in 1) lamina V of the lumbar enlargement, 2) dorsal lamina X of the cervical enlargement, and 3) the lateral spinal nucleus within the cervical enlargement. Supraspinal cells were identified within raphe nuclei, reticular formation nuclei, dorsal column nuclei, vestibular nuclei, noradrenergic groups, the red nucleus, the periaqueductal gray, the hypothalamus, and the motor cortex. These data indicate that there are significant descending projections to the sacrocaudal spinal cord, with distributions similar to those of other cord levels. Functionally, important supraspinal and propriospinal influences on tail, pelvic viscera and limbs, such as with locomotion, balance, defense, micturition, defecation, and sexual functions, may be mediated by these connections.
1861774	The distribution of phenytoin-inducible cytochrome P450 in non-treated mouse brain and spinal cord was analysed immunohistochemically using polyclonal antibodies against phenytoin-induced mouse cerebral microsomal P450. This P450 protein was proved in Ouchterlony [Volk B. et al. (1988) Neurosci. Lett. 84, 219-224], Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses to be reactive to the specific antibodies and an IgG fraction raised against phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomal P450IIB1. The phenytoin-induced P450 is designated P450IIB1* because immunologically it is comparable with P450IIB1; however, it has not yet been analysed for other characteristics of this enzyme. Immunocytochemistry was performed on acetone-fixed serial cryosections of the whole brain using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system. Negative controls included incubations with preimmune serum of the immunized animal instead of the primary antibody and preabsorption of the antibody with the corresponding immunogen. The pattern of immunoreactive sites indicates that P450IIB1* is not distributed evenly throughout the CNS. It was found to be restricted to only some cellular populations. The most striking aspect of immunostaining was a predominant reactivity in the evolutionary old brain parts. Neuropil and neuronal staining was found in the spinal cord (motor neurons of the ventral horn), medulla oblongata (hypoglossal nuclei, magnocellular part of the lateral reticular nuclei), pons (trigeminal, facial, cochlear and pontine nuclei), cerebellum (granule cells), midbrain (dorsal raphe nucleus) and limbic lobe (hippocampal pyramidal cells). Neuropil reactivity alone appeared in cerebellar nuclei, midbrain, thalamus, basal ganglia, neopallium and olfactory brain. Generally, pia mater/arachnoid, ependyma, choroid plexus, vascular system and some astrocytic populations were found to be strongly P450IIB1* immunoreactive. In comparison with astroglia, which is characterized by glial fibrillary acidic protein-positiveness, the astrocytes, which are also P450IIB1* reactive, occurred only in subpial and subependymal layers, and in large fiber tracts of the spinal cord and brainstem, where they were attached to the vascular system. Otherwise, the glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes were not P450IIB1* immunoreactive in the cerebellar molecular layer (fibers of Bergmann glia), in remaining neuropils and in white matter areas.
1865005	Computer-assisted image analysis was used to map the regional distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive (GFAP-IR) astrocytes in the rat forebrain and mesencephalon. A complete survey of packing densities of GFAP-IR structures was performed. Computer maps revealed high values in the outer and inner layers of the cortex, some hippocampal and olfactory bulb layers, prepiriform cortex, dorsal part of the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, lateral septum, reticular thalamic nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, circumventricular organs, nuclei of the medial hypothalamus, substantia nigra, interpeduncular nucleus, and mamillary body. These correspond to regions of the embryonic pial and ventricular brain surfaces, which undergo developmental alterations including growth and various forms of internalization. From this we conclude that in the adult brain, astrocytes of high GFAP-IR are derivatives of surface-contact glia, whereas those located in areas having developed by the local thickening of the neural tube wall show reduced or no GFAP-IR.
1884716	Mutant Quaking mice (C57BL/6J) display convulsive tonic-clonic seizures that can be either spontaneous or triggered by manipulation of the animal or by auditory stimulation. Several abnormalities have been found (especially in the noradrenergic system) in the brainstem of this mutant strain. We first verified by electrophysiological recording that the cerebral cortex was not involved in the generation or in the development of these fits. Then we showed that tonic-clonic seizures similar to those obtained in the freely moving animal were triggered by low-threshold (LT, 5-50 microA) or high-threshold (HT, 55-150 microA) stimuli performed during head restraint. LT stimuli were mostly efficient in a number of ponto-bulbar and mesencephalic structures, including several reticular nuclei, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus subcoeruleus and the red nucleus, whereas HT stimuli were generally necessary to trigger fits by stimulating the nuclei pontis, the substantia nigra, the central gray area and the cerebellar nuclei. Seizures were also provoked at the diencephalic level with LT stimulation delivered in the medial thalamic area, the nucleus reticularis thalami and some subthalamic regions (zona incerta, H field of Forel). In contrast, no fits were obtained by stimulating the cerebellar cortex and the inferior colliculus, the ventral and lateral groups of thalamic nuclei or the telencephalic regions (hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, putamen and cerebral cortex), with the exception of the globus pallidus.
1893255	The sites of the rat brain in which intracerebral administration of carbachol (0.4 microgram/0.5 microliter) elevates the nociceptive threshold to thermic (tail-flick test) and mechanical (calibrated-pinch test) noxious stimuli were examined. An extensive mapping (510 sites) ranging from AP + 10.5 to AP-0.1 mm revealed that antinociception was obtained from 119 sites (23%) widely scattered in the brain, and reached structures distant from, or within the immediate vicinity of the ventricular system. The effects from most placement were demonstrated using the tail-flick test, whereas a smaller proportion (approximately 13%) of sites was effective in reducing the response to mechanical stimuli only. Structures containing sensitive sites include the dorsal raphe nucleus, lateral border of the superior cerebellar peduncle, caudal portion of the superior colliculus, medial geniculate body, habenular complex, amygdala, temporal pole of the ventral hippocampus, rostral aspect of the dorsal hippocampus, lateral septal area, and triangular nucleus of the septum. Analysis of the distribution of responsive sites indicated that they are poorly superposed to the known distribution of opiate-sensitive areas. Most of the structures found to be responsive to carbachol are also known to possess cholinergic receptors and to evoke antinociception following focal electrical stimulation. In various placements, particularly in limbic structures, microinjection of carbachol evoked jumping to mechanical noxious stimulation, hyperexcitability to non-noxious stimuli, convulsive reactions, and other less frequent reactions. On few occasions, however, these changes were accompanied by antinociception.
1903447	We have developed a high specific activity ligand for localization of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the brain. When brain sections were incubated with [125I]iodoglyburide (N-[2-[[[(cyclohexylamino)carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]ethyl]-5-125I-2- methoxybenzamide), the ligand bound to a single site with a KD of 495 pM and a maximum binding site density of 176 fmol/mg of tissue. Glyburide was the most potent inhibitor of specific [125I]iodoglyburide binding to rat forebrain sections whereas iodoglyburide and glipizide were slightly less potent. The binding was also sensitive to ATP which completely inhibited binding at concentrations of 10 mM. Autoradiographic localization of [125I]iodoglyburide binding indicated a broad distribution of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the brain. The highest levels of binding were seen in the globus pallidus and ventral pallidum followed by the septohippocampal nucleus, anterior pituitary, the CA2 and CA3 region of the hippocampus, ventral pallidum, the molecular layer of the cerebellum and substantia nigra zona reticulata. The hilus and dorsal subiculum of the hippocampus, molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, cerebral cortex, lateral olfactory tract nucleus, olfactory tubercle and the zona incerta contained relatively high levels of binding. A lower level of binding (approximately 3- to 4-fold) was found throughout the remainder of the brain. These results indicate that the ATP-sensitive potassium channel has a broad presence in the rat brain and that a few select brain regions are enriched in this subtype of neuronal potassium channels.
1913722	Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor binding was localized in rat adrenal gland, kidney, and brain by in vitro autoradiography using the antagonist analogue 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II and differentiated into type I (AT-1) and type II (AT-2) subtypes using unlabelled non-peptide antagonists specific for Ang II subtypes. AT-1 binding was determined as that remaining in the presence of an excess of the AT-2 antagonist, PD 123177 (10 microM), and AT-2 binding as that remaining in the presence of an excess of the AT-1 antagonist, DUP753 (10 microM). The reducing agent dithiothreitol decreased the binding to AT-1 receptors and enhanced the binding to AT-2 receptors. The rat adrenal gland contains both AT-1 and AT-2 receptors in the ratio of approximately 3:2 in the cortex and 1:9 in the medulla. By contrast, in the kidney only AT-1 receptors were evident in glomeruli, proximal tubule, and inner stripe of the outer medulla. In the brain, the pattern of Ang II receptor subtypes varies greatly from region to region. Many brain structures known to be involved in blood pressure regulation and fluid and electrolyte balance, such as circumventricular organs (including vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, subfornical organ, median eminence, and area postrema), median preoptic nucleus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and regions in the medulla oblongata involved in autonomic control (nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and intermediate reticular nucleus), contain exclusively AT-1 receptors. By contrast, locus coeruleus, lateral septal nuclei, superior colliculus, subthalamic nucleus, many nuclei of the thalamus, and nuclei of the inferior olive contain predominantly AT-2 receptors. The detailed binding characteristics of each subtype were determined by competition studies with a series of antagonists. The pharmacological specificity obtained in kidney, adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla, superior colliculus, and nucleus of the solitary tract produces specificity patterns which confirm the assignments of AT-1 and AT-2 receptors described above. The present study reveals important pharmacological heterogeneity of Ang II receptors in key target organs. The subtype-specific receptor mapping described here is relevant to the understanding of the role of angiotensin peptides in peripheral organs and in the central nervous system and is relevant to the actions of non-peptide Ang II receptor antagonists.
1914151	The present study provides a detailed anatomical description of estrogen target cells in the mouse forebrain and pituitary gland during the sexual imprinting stage of the brain. Six 2-day-old mice (3 males and 3 females) were s.c. injected with 16 alpha-[125I]iodo-11 beta-methoxy-17 beta-estradiol ([125I]MIE2) and two additional mice (one male and one female) were s.c. injected with 1000x unlabeled 17 beta-estradiol 1 h before [125I]MIE2 to check the specificity of estradiol binding. Two hours after injection the mice were decapitated, the brains dissected, frozen sectioned, and processed for thaw mount autoradiography. The highest intensity of nuclear labeling was observed in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area, amygdala and cortex entorhinalis. Strong labeling was present in the cerebral cortex and moderate to strong labeling in the lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and pituitary gland. Weak to moderate labeling was observed in the bulbus olfactorius, circumventricular organs, basal ganglia, ventral striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and pineal gland. No sex differences were observed in the intensity of labeling and distribution of the estrogen target sites. The topographic distributions of estrogen-concentrating cells in the hypothalamus of the 2-day-old mouse forebrain was similar to the adult pattern but differed prominently in the cerebral cortex, entorhinal cortex and thalamus: the cerebral cortex showed an extensive and intensive labeling, the intensity of labeling in the entorhinal cortex greatly exceeded that observed in the adult and the nucleus anterior medialis thalami was distinctly labeled.
1930749	Our study investigates the distribution of neurophysins (Nph), proteins that are part of the precursors for vasopressin and oxytocin, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the human brainstem by immunohistochemistry. Both peptides were found in discrete regions of the human hindbrain. Nph could be demonstrated exclusively in fibers and punctate perineural varicosities that were travelling within the mesencephalic central gray, substantia nigra, as well as locus coeruleus, medial longitudinal fascicle, raphe, nucleus of the solitary tract, lateral reticular nucleus and area postrema. A few varicosities were seen in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal tract and its continuation into the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord. In contrast to these observations. CGRP-immunoreactive fibers were found to be densest in the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In addition, fibers and varicosities could be demonstrated in numerous distinct brain regions, such as locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus, solitary tract, cuneate nucleus, raphe and periaqueductal gray. CGRP-immunoreactivity was also present in perikarya in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, as well as motor nuclei of cranial nerves, i.e., hypoglossal nucleus, ambiguous nucleus. Our results suggest that Nph-immunoreactivity in the human brainstem may be present predominantly within long fiber projections from hypothalamic neurosecretory nuclei, in analogy to data obtained from rodents, whereas CGRP may play a role in the branchiomotor system as well as in intrinsic or extrinsic projections involved in autonomic regulation and integration of sensory information.
1933285	The effect of morphine tolerance-dependence, protracted and naloxone-precipitated abstinence on the levels of beta-endorphin and methionine-enkephalin in discrete brain regions, spinal cord, pituitary gland and plasma was determined in the male Sprague-Dawley rats. Among the brain regions examined, the levels of beta-endorphin in descending order were: hypothalamus, amygdala, midbrain, hippocampus corpus striatum, pons and medulla and cortex. The levels of beta-endorphin in midbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary of morphine tolerant-dependent rats were decreased significantly. During protracted withdrawal beta-endorphin levels were decreased in amygdala, spinal cord and pituitary. During naloxone-precipitated abstinence beta-endorphin levels were increased in corpus striatum, midbrain and cortex. In addition, in naloxone-precipitated abstinence beta-endorphin levels were decreased in pituitary gland and hippocampus but increased in plasma. The levels of methionine-enkephalin in brain regions in decreasing order were: corpus striatum, pons and medulla, amygdala, hypothalamus, midbrain, hippocampus and cortex. The levels of methionine-enkephalin in pons and medulla, amygdala, hippocampus and pituitary gland were decreased in morphine tolerant-dependent rats. During protracted abstinence from morphine, methionine-enkephalin levels in spinal cord, amygdala, pons and medulla, midbrain, cortex, corpus striatum and pituitary gland were decreased. The levels of methionine-enkephalin in hypothalamus and corpus striatum of naloxone-precipitated abstinent rats were increased but were decreased in amygdala and pituitary gland. These results suggest that during morphine tolerance-dependence and during protracted abstinence beta-endorphin and methionine-enkephalin levels in discrete brain regions and pituitary gland are decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1939729	The localization of calretinin in the rat hindbrain was examined immunohistochemically with antiserum against calretinin purified from the guinea pig brain. Calretinin immunoreactivity was found within neuronal elements. The distribution of calretinin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers is presented in schematic drawings and summarized in a table. Major calretinin-immunoreactive neurons were found in the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, interpeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, superior and inferior colliculi, pontine nuclei, parabrachial nucleus, dorsal and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, cochlear nuclei, vestibular nuclei, medullary reticular nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, area postrema, substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and cerebellum. These results show that distinct calretinin-immunoreactive neurons are widely distributed in the rat hindbrain.
1954561	The functional projections from pressor sites in the subfornical organ (SFO) were identified using the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiographic method in urethane-anesthetized, sinoaortic-denervated rats. Autoradiographs of brain and spinal cord sections taken from rats whose SFO was continuously stimulated electrically for 45 min with stereotaxically placed monopolar electrodes (150 microA, 1.5-ms pulse duration, 15 Hz) following injection of tritiated 2-DG were compared with control rats that received intravenous infusions of pressor doses of phenylephrine to mimic the increase in arterial pressure observed during SFO stimulation. Comparisons were also made to autoradiographs from rats in which the ventral fornical commissure (CFV), just dorsal to the SFO, was electrically stimulated. The pressor responses during either electrical stimulation of the SFO or intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were similar in magnitude. On the other hand, stimulation of the CFV did not elicit a significant pressor response. Electrical stimulation of the SFO increased 2-DG uptake, in comparison to the phenylephrine-infused rats, in the nucleus triangularis, septofimbrial nucleus, lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal and ventral nucleus medianus (median preoptic nucleus), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, hippocampus, supraoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the intermediolateral nucleus of and central autonomic area of the thoracic spinal cord. In contrast, in rats whose CFV was stimulated, these nuclei did not demonstrate changes in 2-DG uptake compared with control animals that received pressor doses of phenylephrine. These data have demonstrated some of the components of the neural circuitry likely involved in mediating the pressor responses to stimulation of the SFO and the corrective responses to activation of the SFO by disturbances to circulatory and fluid balance homeostasis.
1955581	The localization of phosphatase inhibitor-1 was investigated in rat brain by use of immunocytochemistry. Studies were performed with an affinity purified IgG raised against purified rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-1. In rat brain tissue homogenates, this antibody reacted only with a 29 kDa protein corresponding to inhibitor-1. Immunocytochemical studies with this antibody revealed numerous immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers. The highest concentration of immunoreactive perikarya was observed in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens, and these appeared to be exclusively medium-sized neurons. Other areas containing substantial populations of immunoreactive neurons included the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, habenula, superior colliculus, claustrum, endopiriform nuclei, and neocortex. The distribution of terminals containing inhibitor-1 coincided with the distribution of terminal fields known to originate from the above regions. Thus, plexuses of immunoreactive axons were seen in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, paraventricular hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, CA3 region of the hippocampus, and interpeduncular nucleus. These results demonstrate that phosphatase inhibitor-1, a cyclic AMP-regulated inhibitor of phosphatase-1, is differentially distributed in the rat CNS. Given the widespread role of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in intracellular signal transduction, these results suggest that neurons containing high levels of inhibitor-1 may share common, hitherto unrecognized, properties in terms of neurotransmitter regulation and/or responsiveness.
1963256	A 45-year-old patient with Down's syndrome was autopsied. The brain, weighing 800 g, was small in size, and serial sections revealed generalized gyral atrophy and ventricular dilatation. In the gray matter, there was diffuse neuronal degeneration characterized by numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques and frequent amyloid angiopathy. Histochemical and electron microscopical analyses of these lesions showed no qualitative difference from those in Alzheimer's disease. A topographical study of NFTs showed that they were numerous in the limbic system and cerebral neocortex. Various numbers of NFTs were seen in the olfactory bulb, thalamus, medial geniculate body, innominate substance, putamen, caudate, pallidum, central gray, reticular formation, certain midline nuclei of the brainstem, substantia nigra, red nucleus and dorsal vagal nucleus. This distribution pattern was not different qualitatively from that in Alzheimer's disease, and such a similarity was especially evident in the olfactory bulb, where many tufted and mitral cells as well as anterior olfactory nucleus cells showed NFTs. These common features of brain pathology in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease may be due to a specific gene defect in both diseases.
1967574	The effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the morphology and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS) in cultured astrocytes prepared from various areas of newborn rat brain was studied. The brain was dissected in two ways, either the telencephalon (area A) and the diencephalon (area B) were dissected out of the brain (without olfactory bulbs, mesencephalon and cerebellum) or the brain was cut transversely into 3 parts (areas 1, 2 and 3). Area 1 (the anterior part) included the frontal cortex, the olfactory nuclei, the neostriatum, the accumbens nucleus and the septum; area 2 (the medial part) included the cortex, hippocampus, amygdale, thalamus and hypothalamus, and area 3 (the posterior part) included the occipital cortex, the posterior part of hippocampus and thalamus and the mamillary bodies. Essentially two different morphological aspects were observed. Most cells from areas A, 1 and 3, were flat, large, presented an irregular shape and were loosely arranged; cells from areas B and 2 were essentially polygonal in shape and closely apposed to each other. The various control cultures showed nearly the same immunostaining pattern for GFAP, but different patterns for GS. Most astroglial cells responded to bFGF and became fibrous. The GFAP immunoreaction was intense and localized in the cell bodies and processes of most cells from area A, but essentially in the processes for cells from areas 1 and 2. The immunoreactivity was weaker in cells from areas B and 3. GS-positive cells, heavily and weakly stained, were found in all treated cultures, and very strongly stained cells were located in certain zones of cultures from area A. But GS-negative cells were also seen in these treated cultures as well as in control cultures. Measurements of GS activities revealed no differences. These results indicate that astrocytes from different regions of the brain in primary culture show differences in their responsiveness to bFGF. The astroglial cells from the cerebral cortex and from the thalamus seem to present the highest and the lowest response to bFGF, respectively.
1970946	Using a double-immunostaining technique with cholera toxin (CT) as a retrograde tracer, the authors examined the cells of origin and the histochemical nature of lower brainstem afferents to the cat posterior hypothalamus. The posterior hypothalamus, in particular the lateral hypothalamic area, receives substantial afferent projections from: substantia nigra, peripeduncular nucleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, mesencephalic reticular formation, peribrachial region including the locus coeruleus complex, rostral raphe nuclei and the rostral part of the nucleus magnus. In addition, a moderate number of retrogradely labeled neurons was found in: Edinger-Westphal nucleus, nucleus reticularis pontis oralis, nucleus reticularis magnocellularis, caudal lateral bulbar reticular formation around the nucleus ambiguus and lateral reticular nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract. The posterior hypothalamus receives: 1) dopaminergic inputs from A8, A9 and A10 cell groups; 2) noradrenergic inputs from A6 and A7 pontine, as well as A1 and A2 bulbar cell groups; 3) adrenergic inputs from C1 cell group in the caudal medulla; 4) serotoninergic inputs from the rostral raphe nuclei (B6, B7 and B8 cell groups); 5) cholinergic inputs from the peribrachial region of the dorsal pontine tegmentum as well as from the nucleus reticularis magnocellularis of the medulla; 6) peptidergic inputs such as methionine-enkephalin, substance P, corticotropin-releasing factor and galanin that originate mainly in the mesencephalic periaqueductal grey, the dorsal raphe nucleus and the peribrachial region of the dorsal pontine tegmentum.
1976532	Immunohistochemical localization of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) was employed to reveal the anatomical organization of the A1 noradrenergic cell group in the caudal ventrolateral medulla oblongata of the rat. Subsequently, the supraspinal efferent axonal projections of A1 were investigated with a view to elucidating the anatomical substrates underlying its postulated function in central fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. Within the caudal medulla, DBH-positive/PNMT-negative (noradrenergic) neurons were observed extending bilaterally through the ventrolateral medullary reticular formation from upper cervical spinal cord levels to the level of the area postrema. At the rostral pole of A1, its neurons intermingled with PNMT-immunoreactive perikarya of the more rostrally situated C1 adrenergic cell group. Discrete injections of the anterogradely transported plant lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into A1 resulted in terminal labeling in a number of presumptive efferent target sites including the nucleus of the solitary tract, rostral ventrolateral medulla, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, Kolliker-Fuse nucleus, central grey, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, perifornical region, zona incerta, lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, supraoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Tissue sections adjacent to those reacted for PHA-L were processed immunohistochemically for DBH to determine if anterogradely labeled terminals were localized in regions that demonstrated appropriate immunoreactivity. The majority of regions in which PHA-L terminal labeling was present also exhibited moderate to intense DBH activity. These experiments provide neuroanatomical evidence for direct efferent pathways from the A1 noradrenergic cell group to a number of supraspinal sites that have been reliably implicated in the neural circuitry underlying the central regulation of fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. Furthermore, the results suggest a selective anatomical interrelation between A1 and sites in the basal forebrain and hypothalamus in which vasopressinergic neurons have been previously demonstrated. It is postulated that the noradrenergic A1 projections observed in this investigation represent the morphological substrate through which A1 exerts a significant influence on cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms.
1979430	The cellular localization of preprosomatostatin mRNA in the rat brain and sensory ganglia has been examined in detail using a newly developed highly sensitive non-radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry procedure. An alkaline phosphatase labelled anti-sense 30mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe was used for detection of somatostatin mRNA. This probe readily demonstrated somatostatin gene expression throughout the rat CNS with very high contrast and good cellular localization. As a result, we visualized numerous somatostatin mRNA-positive cells in many CNS areas which had previously not been shown to contain a mRNA signal. This method detected a number of somatostatin mRNA-positive cells, in the mitral cell layer of accessory olfactory bulb, the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb, the dorsal part of the lateral septum, superficial gray layer of superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, anterior ventral cochlear nucleus, granular layer and Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum, and substantia gelatinosa of medulla and spinal cord, all areas where signal detection using radiolabelled in situ probes has previously been rather difficult. The principle advantages of the present method include the very precise cellular resolution of signal, the rapid reaction time and low background. The sensitivity of the present method seems to be at least equivalent to most immunocytochemical procedures and more sensitive than most isotopic in situ hybridization methods.
1979436	To evaluate in a development context the effect of congenital hypothyroidism on concentrations of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (5HT) in selected brain areas of the ovine fetus, we studied the effect of thyroidectomy at three ages on the concentrations of these neurotransmitters and their major metabolites, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Fetuses underwent thyroidectomy at 90-95 or 105-115 d gestation (term = 147-150 d) or 1-5 d after birth. Approximately 25 d after thyroidectomy, at d 120-125 or 130-135 of gestation or 25-30 d after birth, respectively, the ewes were killed and fetal brains removed. Neurotransmitters and their metabolites were measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Thyroidectomy in the 2nd trimester increased 5HT in five brain areas: anterior hypothalamus, dorsal medial hypothalamus, pons, medulla, and cerebellum. Thyroidectomy in the 3rd trimester increased 5HT in the pons and medulla, increased norepinephrine in the dorsal medial hypothalamus and pons, and increased homovanillic acid in the posterior hypothalamus. Thyroidectomy in the newborn period decreased NE in the anterior hypothalamus, ventral medial hypothalamus, and midbrain, decreased 5-hydroxyindoleactic acid in the posterior hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, dorsal medial hypothalamus, and ventral medial hypothalamus, and decreased homovanillic acid in the dorsal medial hypothalamus and ventral medial hypothalamus. From these data we conclude the following: 1) Hypothyroidism causes changes in neurotransmitter concentrations only in selected brain areas of the ovine fetus, rather than causing generalized and similar changes in all brain areas; and 2) 5HT 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations are affected more often than the other neurotransmitters evaluated, perhaps because the 5HT neurotransmitter system is developing at these times.
2004621	Norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured in 15 discrete areas of the central nervous system of two types of genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs) and in nonepileptic controls. Both moderate-seizure (GEPR-3) and severe-seizure (GEPR-9) animals had extensive abnormalities in brain NE concentration. Deficits of equal magnitude in GEPR-3s and GEPR-9s were found in the spinal cord, midbrain minus the inferior colliculus, inferior colliculus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, occipital + parietal cortex, frontal cortex, and olfactory septum. Because both types of GEPRs share these deficits and share seizure susceptibility, we hypothesize that these areas are candidates for regulation of seizure susceptibility in GEPRs. In addition, because GEPR-9s have more severe seizures than GEPR-3s and because GEPR-9s had greater NE deficits in several brain areas (cerebellum, pons-medulla, thalamus, and possibly the temporal cortex and olfactory bulbs), we hypothesize that these areas may be important in regulation of seizure severity in GEPRs. All animals used in these experiments had been protected from seizure-provoking stimuli and were naive to seizures. Because the abnormalities in NE concentration were present in seizure-predisposed animals that were protected from seizures, we conclude that these abnormalities are important components of the seizure-predisposition characteristic of GEPRs and do not result from seizure experience.
2013650	The topographic organization of neostriatal connections was investigated by axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase, tritiated amino acids, or mixtures of both injected into the neostriatum of macaque monkeys. Striatal projections to pallidum and substantia nigra and the origin of projections to striatum from cerebral cortex and substantia nigra were examined. All striatal injections gave rise to projections to external and internal pallidum and to substantia nigra. Injections in caudate nucleus and in putamen both gave rise to substantial projections to pallidum and to substantia nigra, and the ratio of pallidal and nigral projections was generally similar. The striatopallidal projection showed prominent arborizations at right angles to the striatofugal pathway traversing the pallidum, forming in this manner terminal fields consisting of multiple bands or discs within a broad segment of the pallidum. Thus separate but neighboring regions of striatum appeared to have overlapping pallidal projection territories. In broad terms, rostral striatum projects to rostral pallidum, caudal striatum to caudal pallidum, and dorsal and ventral striatum, respectively, to dorsal and ventral pallidum. Inner (medial) and outer (lateral) putamen showed only subtle differences in pallidal projection patterns. The striatonigral projection from each injected area of striatum formed a longitudinal band extending over the entire length of the substantia nigra, with scattered, dense terminal fields occupying portions of pars compacta as well as pars reticularis. Rostral striatum projected to medial nigra and caudal striatum to lateral nigra. Terminal fields from ventral striatum were located somewhat more dorsally in the substantia nigra than those from dorsal striatum. Neighboring but separate regions of striatum appeared to have overlapping nigral projection territories, especially in caudal nigra. The nigrostriatal neurons projecting to an injected area of striatum generally were located in the same longitudinal band of the substantia nigra as the corresponding striatonigral projection. Labeled pars compacta neurons were often surrounded by a dense, labeled striatonigral terminal field, suggesting the existence of a striato-nigrostriatal loop. The rostromedial pars compacta contained labeled neuronal cell bodies in most cases, suggesting a widely divergent projection to striatum from this cell group. A slight tendency for preferential cell labeling rostrally in nigra with rostral striatal injection and caudally in nigra with caudal injections was noted. The preferred relationship of lateral nigra with caudal striatum and medial nigra with rostral striatum has implications for clinical expression of Parkinson's disease, which may vary with differential involvement of different nigral cell groups along the medial to lateral axis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2016418	The distribution of cells containing mRNA encoding cholecystokinin was studied in the rat central nervous system by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Cholecystokinin mRNA containing neurons were considerably more numerous than the cholecystokinin-like immunoreactive neurons detected by immunocytochemistry even after colchicine pretreatment and appeared to be heavily, moderately, or lightly labeled. Such neurons were present in the olfactory bulb, olfactory nuclei, layers II-III and V-VI of the cerebral cortex, amygdaloid nuclei, subiculum, hippocampus, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, several hypothalamic nuclei, most of the thalamic nuclei, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, interfascicularis nucleus, linearis rostralis, central gray, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, superior and inferior colliculi, parabrachial nucleus, reticular formation, raphe nuclei, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. This distribution partly confirmed and partly extended the previous immunohistochemical descriptions. Several brain areas such as the thalamus and the colliculi contain cholecystokinin mRNA but are devoid of perikarya exhibiting cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity. The cerebral cortex and the hippocampus present a far higher density of cholecystokinin mRNA containing cells, including pyramidal neurons, than of perikarya containing cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity. These results suggest that cholecystokinin or cholecystokinin-related peptides could have a functional role in numerous cerebral pathways including long projections such as cortical or thalamic projections.
2040725	The primary objective of this study is to identify the totality of input to the centromedian and parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamic nuclear complex. The subcortical projections upon the CM-Pf complex were studied in the cat with three different retrograde tracers. The tracers used were unconjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP), horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP), and rhodamine-labeled fluorescent latex microspheres (RFM). Numerous subcortical structures or substructures contained labeled neurons with all three tracing techniques. These labeled structures included the central nucleus of the amygdala; the entopeduncular nucleus; the globus pallidus; the reticular and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus; parts of the hypothalamus including the dorsal, lateral, and posterior hypothalamic areas and the ventromedial and parvicellular nuclei; the zona incerta and fields of Forel; parts of the substantia nigra including the pars reticularis and pars lateralis, and the retrorubral area; the pretectum; the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus; the periaqueductal gray; the dorsal nucleus of the raphe; portions of the reticular formation, including the mesencephalic, pontis oralis, pontis caudalis, gigantocellularis, ventralis, and lateralis reticular nuclei; the nucleus cuneiformis; the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum; the locus coeruleus; portions of the trigeminal complex, including the principal sensory and spinal nuclei; portions of the vestibular complex, including the lateral division of the superior nucleus and the medial nucleus; deep cerebellar nuclei, including the medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei; and lamina VII of the cervical spinal cord. Moreover, the WGA-HRP and rhodamine methods (known to be more sensitive than the HRP method) revealed several afferent sources not shown by HRP: the anterior hypothalamic area, ventral tegmental area, lateral division of the superior vestibular nucleus, nucleus interpositus, and the nucleus praepositus hypoglossi. Also, the rhodamine method revealed labeled neurons in laminae V and VI of the cervical spinal cord.
2046475	The binding of 3H-naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, to membranes of discrete brain regions and spinal cord of 10 week old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was determined. The brain regions examined were hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, midbrain and cortex. 3H-Naltrexone bound to membranes of brain regions and spinal cord at a single high affinity site with an apparent dissociation constant value of 3 nM. The highest density of 3H-naltrexone binding sites were in hippocampus and lowest in the cerebral cortex. The receptor density (Bmax value) and apparent dissociation constant (Kd value) values of 3H-naltrexone to bind to opiate receptors on the membranes of amygdala, hippocampus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, midbrain, cortex and spinal cord of WKY and SHR rats did not differ. The Bmax value of 3H-naltrexone binding to membranes of hypothalamus of SHR rats was 518% higher than WKY rats but the Kd values in the two strains did not differ. It is concluded that SHR rats have higher density of opiate receptors labeled with 3H-naltrexone in the hypothalamus only, in comparison with WKY rats, and that such a difference in the density of opiate receptors may be related to the elevated blood pressure in SHR rats.
2052491	Nicotine acts in CNS, but the pathways and mechanisms of its actions are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest an interaction between brain nicotinic receptors and endogenous opioid peptides. Acute administration of nicotine may alter enkephalin release without affecting brain enkephalin level. Tyr-Gly-Gly has been shown previously to be an extraneuronal metabolite of opioid peptides derived from proenkephalin A. Concentrations of Tyr-Gly-Gly in brain were used to provide an index of enkephalin release in vivo. Thus we examined the thesis that nicotine alters brain neuronal enkephalin release, by measuring Tyr-Gly-Gly levels in specific brain nuclei from rats treated with nicotine 0.3 mg/kg SC 10 min before decapitation. Of 30 brain regions investigated, acute nicotine increased Tyr-Gly-Gly immunoreactivity in nucleus accumbens and in lower brain stem areas including dorsal raphe, pontine reticular formation, gigantocellular reticular formation, locus coeruleus, sensory trigeminal nucleus and the caudal part of ventrolateral medulla oblongata. Concomitantly, nicotine produced a significant decrease in native Met-enkephalin in central amygdala, flocculo-nodular lobe of cerebellum, caudal part of the ventrolateral medulla and intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. It is probable that the effects of nicotine to increase Tyr-Gly-Gly and alter Met-enkephalin concentration are mediated by nicotine-induced release of enkephalin at these brain sites. Furthermore, some of the physiologic and pharmacologic effects of nicotine may be mediated by such enkephalin release.
2070257	The distribution of the dipeptide carnosine was studied in the brain of the crested newt, Triturus carnifex, with immunohistochemical methods. Carnosine-like immunoreactivity (IR) is present in the cell bodies and processes of several areas of the central nervous system: in the telencephalon (especially in the medial pallium), in the diencephalon (pineal organ, thalamus, and hypothalamus), in the mesencephalon (optic tectum and tegmentum), and in the rhombencephalon (cerebellum, raphe region, and octavolateralis area). Double-labelling experiments show that carnosine IR is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y IR in a few cells. Histochemical staining for heavy metals, the TIMM method, reveals that carnosine IR and TIMM labelling overlap in the medial pallium. These data indicate two primary conclusions: (a) In the crested newt brain, in contrast to those of mammals and birds, carnosine IR is not associated with glial cells but with neurons. Furthermore, carnosine is absent from the primary olfactory pathway in newts. (b) In the medial pallium of the crested newt, carnosine IR reliably identifies a population of neurons.
2078817	The cellular localization of transcripts for a new putative agonist-binding subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), alpha 5, was examined using in situ hybridization in the rat central nervous system (CNS), alpha 5 subunit mRNA was localized to a small number of regions when compared with two of the other known agonist-binding subunits, alpha 3 and alpha 4, alpha 5 mRNA is expressed at relatively high levels in neurons of the subiculum (pyramidal layer), presubiculum and parasubiculum (layers IV and VI), which are components of the hippocampal formation, in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area, in the interpeduncular nucleus, and in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Moderate hybridization signals were detected in neurons of the isocortex (layer VIb), anterior olfactory nucleus, trigeminal ganglion, superior olivary complex, nucleus of the solitary tract, and area postrema. No hybridization above background levels was seen in the amygdala, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, or cerebellum. These results suggest that the alpha 5 subunit differs from other known agonist-binding subunits in its distribution.
2086611	The goal of this study was to identify GABAergic input to the cat superior colliculus from neurons located in the caudal diencephalon, mesencephalon, pons and medulla. Cells efferent to the superior colliculus were labeled retrogradely with the tracer horseradish peroxidase, and an antibody to gamma-aminobutyric acid was used to label GABAergic neurons in the same sections. The results indicate that neurons in several distinct areas of the caudal diencephalon and brainstem are both immunocytochemically labeled for GABA and retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase. These areas include zona incerta, nucleus of the posterior commissure, anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei, nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, cuneiform nucleus, subcuneiform area, substantia nigra pars reticulata and pars lateralis, periparabigeminal area, external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, the area ventral to the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, mesencephalic reticular formation, dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, and the perihypoglossal nucleus. The role that such diverse inhibitory input to the superior colliculus might play, particularly in influencing eye movements, is discussed.
2086614	The interhemispheric connections of the cortical areas of the temporal lobe and some neighboring regions were investigated in monkeys (Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis) by anterograde autoradiographic tracing, following injection of radioactively labeled amino acids. The results revealed that the interhemispheric projections of the temporal lobe course through three interhemispheric commissures on their way to the opposite hemisphere. The anterior commissure receives fibers from virtually the entire temporal lobe, including the temporal pole, superior and inferior temporal gyri, and parahippocampal gyrus. Moreover, area 13 of the orbitofrontal cortex, the frontal and temporal subdivisions of the prepiriform cortex, and the cortical and deep nuclei of the amygdala also contribute fibers to the anterior commissure. The heaviest projections arise in the rostral third of the temporal isocortex. These projections become progressively lighter from more caudal regions. By contrast, the corpus callosum receives fibers from the caudal two-thirds of the temporal lobe, including the temporal pole, superior and inferior temporal gyri, and parahippocampal gyrus. The heaviest projections arise in the caudal third of the temporal lobe and cross primarily in the caudal third of the corpus callosum, including the splenium. Progressively lighter projections arise more rostrally. Fibers from proisocortical and isocortical areas of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus cross in the ventralmost part of the splenium (inferior forceps), whereas cortical areas lateral to the occipitotemporal sulcus give rise to fibers that cross in the caudal part of the body of the corpus callosum and dorsal splenium. The dorsal hippocampal commissure receives fibers exclusively from the parahippocampal gyrus. The fibers of the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, and, to a lesser extent, the anterior commissure are intimately associated with the ventricular system as they course through the white matter of the temporal lobe. The fields of origin of the anterior commissure and corpus callosum overlap extensively over the caudal two-thirds of the temporal lobe. The posterior parahippocampal gyrus is unique in that it gives rise to fibers that cross in all three commissures.
2105261	1. The effects of Adafenoxate (Adf), meclofenoxate (Mf) and citicholine (CCh) administered at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg for 7 days on the levels of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the frontal cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus of rats were studied. 2. Adafenoxate increased the NA level in the striatum and decreased it in the hypothalamus; it increased the DA level in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus and decreased it in the striatum; it increased the 5-HT level in the cerebral cortex and decreased it in the hippocampus. 3. Meclofenoxate decreased the NA level in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus; it increased the DA level in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and the 5-HT level in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus. 4. Citicholine increased the NA level in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus; it increased the DA level in the striatum and the 5-HT level in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. 5. An attempt is made to explain some similarities and differences in the behavioral effects of the drugs tested (and those observed in other studies) by the changes they induce in brain biogenic monoamines.
2111157	The activities of cytosolic sulphotransferase (ST) and microsomal glucuronyltransferase (GT) were measured with 1-naphthol as the substrate in three frontal cortex, three temporal cortex, one parietal cortex, one occipital cortex and two cerebellar cortex specimens from human brain. The average activity was 11.7 +/- 4.2 pmol/min/mg protein/(ST) and 26.8 +/- 13.6 pmol/min/mg protein (GT). The kinetics of ST were studied varying the concentration of 1-naphthol in five brain specimens (temporal cortex, temporal subcortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum cortex and frontal cortex) whereas those of GT were studied in a sample obtained by pooling the microsomal fractions from the following eight brain tissues: one frontal cortex, four temporal cortex, one parietal cortex and two cerebellar cortex specimens. The Km of the first and second enzyme was 1.55 +/- 0.47 microM (mean +/- s.d.) and 121 microM, respectively. The Vmax values were 13.70 +/- 8.16 (mean +/- s.d.) pmol/min/mg protein (ST) and 103 pmol/min/mg protein (GT). Vmax/Km was ten times higher for ST than GT. These data suggest that ST is the predominant pathway at low concentrations of 1-naphthol whereas at higher concentrations, GT becomes the predominant pathway.
2111893	The electrical activity of several hypothalamic sites, before and following cervical stimulation, was examined in an attempt to evaluate the central nervous system processes involved in the induction of pseudopregnancy in the rat. Cervical stimulation, resulting in pseudopregnancy, induced a sequence of neuronal changes at: 3.8, 4.4, 11.6, 20.1, 30.8, 44.5, 51.2, 51.7, 62.4, 85.1 and 111.5 min after stimulation in the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus and anterior hypothalamus, respectively. These results suggest that the preoptic region contains both the facilitatory neuronal mechanism and also an inhibitory system. The latter could tonically inhibit the expression of the nocturnal prolactin surge. We conclude that the sequence of neuronal events observed in various hypothalamic areas is in part responsible for the process which results in pseudopregnancy.
2123001	Concentrations of pro-thyrotropin-releasing hormone (pro-TRH) were studied in the brain of the Weaver ataxic mouse, the Purkinje cell degenerative mouse (pcd-ataxic mouse), the Staggerer ataxic mouse and the C3H mouse. The brain tissue was dissected into 7 parts, e.g., hypothalamus, cerebrum, thalamus, striatum, brain stem, cerebellum and cervical spinal cord. Pro-TRH concentrations in each part of the brain were measured by radioimmunoassay. Pro-TRH concentrations in the brain of Weaver ataxic mice, pcd-ataxic mice and Staggerer ataxic mice were significantly higher in the thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and cervical spinal cord. Pro-TRH concentrations in the hypothalamus, striatum and cerebrum of ataxic mice did not differ from those of controls. The elution profile of acetic acid extracted cerebellum of ataxic mice on Sephadex G-50 was identical to that of synthetic pro-TRH. These findings suggest that changes in pro-TRH concentrations in the brain may play a pathophysiological role in ataxic mice.
2124333	The effect of fenfluramine (20 mg/kg i.p.) was studied on the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) content in several brain structures and the ventral part of the lumbar spinal cord of the rat. The effect of fenfluramine on the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in some brain structures and the lumbar spinal cord was also examined. It was found that fenfluramine had no effect on the TRH level in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, occipital cortex, septum, nucleus accumbens and ventral part of the lumbar spinal cord, though the drug produced a profound depletion (by more than 60%) of 5-HT in the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, striatum and lumbar spinal cord. On the other hand, fenfluramine significantly increased the TRH content in the striatum, this effect was completely abolished by citalopram (20 mg/kg i.p.) or metergoline (10 mg/kg i.p.) Citalopram also prevented the fenfluramine-induced depletion of the striatal 5-HT. These results indicate a separate neuronal storage of TRH and 5-HT in the structures (ventral part of the lumbar spinal cord, nucleus accumbens, septum) in which the peptide and indoleamine coexist in 5-HT neurons. They also suggest that the fenfluramine-induced increase in the striatal TRH concentration is due to 5-HT release and stimulation of 5-HT receptors.
2125874	The efferent projections of septal nuclei from the brain areas relating to pain in the rat were studied with WGA-HRP and HRP methods. The results are obtained as follows: The septal areas project widely to some brain areas relating to pain, for instance, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, hypothalamus, habenular, amygdaloid complex, cingulate cortex and hippocampus ets, but the projections of medial septal nucleus, lateral septal nucleus and diagonal band nucleus are different. It is possible that these fiber projections are one of the morphological basis of septal nuclei for regulating pain.
2140897	The present studies establish that there are specific, significant decreases in the neuronal calcium-binding protein (28-kDa calbindin-D) gene expression in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases. The specificity of the changes observed in calbindin mRNA levels was tested by reprobing blots with calmodulin, cyclophilin, and B-actin cDNAs. Gross brain regions of the aging rat exhibited specific, significant decreases (60-80%) in calbindin mRNA and protein levels in the cerebellum, corpus striatum, and brain-stem region but not in the cerebral cortex or hippocampus. Discrete areas of the aging human brain exhibited significant decreases (50-88%) in calbindin protein and mRNA in the cerebellum, corpus striatum, and nucleus basalis but not in the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, locus ceruleus, or nucleus raphe dorsalis. Comparison of diseased human brain tissue with age- and sex-matched controls yielded significant decreases (60-88%) in calbindin protein and mRNA in the substantia nigra (Parkinson disease), in the corpus striatum (Huntington disease), in the nucleus basalis (Alzheimer disease), and in the hippocampus and nucleus raphe dorsalis (Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer diseases) but not in the cerebellum, neocortex, amygdala, or locus ceruleus. Since calbindin gene expression decreased specifically in brain areas known to be particularly affected in aging and in each of the neurodegenerative diseases, these findings suggest that decreased calbindin gene expression may lead to a failure of calcium buffering or intraneuronal calcium homeostasis, which contributes to calcium-mediated cytotoxic events during aging and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
2141990	5-HT (10 and 40 micrograms) and 8-OH-DPAT (1 and 5 micrograms) were locally applied into the dorsal or median raphe nuclei in awake, unrestrained, rats. All animals were also treated with the 5-HTP and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015, 100 mg kg-1 SC, 30 min before decapitation. 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT were administered 5 min before NSD-1015. The regional brain in vivo rate of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activity was estimated by measuring the accumulation of DOPA and 5-HTP. The following brain regions were sampled: neocortex, hippocampus, dorso-lateral neostriatum, ventro-medial neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, globus pallidus, septum and the amygdala. Compared to normal controls, there were small and inconsistent effects on forebrain 5-HTP accumulation by saline injections into the dorsal or the median raphe (an increase in 3 out of 36 experiments), whereas strong effects by the injection procedure were noted on forebrain DOPA accumulation (an increase in 15 out of 36 experiments). Injections of 5-HT (same effect by 10 or 40 micrograms) into the dorsal raphe, produced a decrease in 5-HTP accumulation in all forebrain areas except for the hippocampus and the septum, whereas no effects were seen in any area after median raphe injections. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT preferentially produced a decrease in forebrain 5-HTP accumulation after median raphe injections and less, but statistically significant effects by dorsal raphe injections. The 8-OH-DPAT injection into the median raphe primarily affected limbic forebrain areas (hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, ventro-medial neostriatum, amygdala and the septum). This dissociation of the effects of 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT on forebrain 5-HT synthesis after local application into the dorsal or the median raphe strongly supports the contention of heterogeniety in the brain 5-HT receptor population in terms of receptor subtypes and/or receptor regulation.
2158007	Nerve growth factor receptor, as recognized by the monoclonal antibody 192-IgG, was localized to multiple regions of the adult rat forebrain. Immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were seen in both sensory and motor regions which are known to contain cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons. Specifically, nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity was present in cells lining the olfactory ventricle, rostral portion of the lateral ventricle, in basal forebrain nuclei, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, zona incerta and hypothalamus. Immunoreactive cells which were situated subpially along the olfactory ventricle and anterior portions of the lateral ventricle, and in the arcuate nucleus resembled neuroglia but could not definitively identified at the light microscopic level. Animals pretreated with intracerebroventricular colchicine displayed significantly increased nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity in all previously positive neurons and particularly in the medial preoptic area and ventral premammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. In such animals, receptor immunoreactivity also appeared in previously non-immunoreactive cells of the hippocampal CA3 region and polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus as well as in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb. Nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive fibers and varicosities were seen in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, olivary pretectal nucleus and hypothalamus. In most regions, such fiber-like immunoreactive structures likely represented axon terminals, although in some areas, neuroglial or extracellular localizations could not be excluded. In this context, diffuse, non-fibrillar receptor immunoreactivity occurred in the lateral habenular nucleus and medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract. Furthermore, intense nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity occurred along certain regions of the pial surface on the ventral surface of the brain. The distribution of nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in multiple sensory and motor nuclei suggests wide-spread influences of nerve growth factor throughout the adult rat forebrain. There is a high degree of overlap with regions containing choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity. However, significant disparities exist suggesting that certain nerve growth factor receptor-containing non-cholinergic neurons of the rat forebrain may also be affected by nerve growth factor.
2158008	Multiple nuclei and fiber tracts in the adult rat brainstem and spinal cord were found to contain nerve growth factor receptor-related protein, as recognized by the monoclonal antibody 192-IgG. Both cholinergic and non-cholinergic sensory and motor regions demonstrated immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers. Nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive cells were seen in the mesencephalic nucleus of trigeminal nerve, superior colliculus, parabrachial, prepositus hypoglossal, raphe, dorsal and ventral cochlear, interstitial nucleus of the vestibular nerve, ambiguus and reticular nuclei, cerebellum and ventral spinal cord. Immunoreactive cells resembling neuroglia were distributed subpially along the superior colliculus. Intracerebroventricular injection of colchicine resulted in significantly increased nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity in all previously positive neurons and especially in certain neurons of the cochlear and ambiguus nuclei. It also resulted in the visualization of receptor immunoreactivity in certain neurons which were normally non-immunoreactive including cerebellar Purkinje cells, neurons of the central gray, locus coeruleus, facial, dorsal motor vagal and hypoglossal nuclei. In normal animals, nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive fibers and varicosities occurred in the trigeminal nerve nuclei, pontine, vestibular, parabrachial, facial, hypoglossal, dorsal motor vagal, solitary, gracile and cuneate nuclei and spinal cord. Although most fiber-like immunoreactive structures were probably axons and nerve terminals, neuroglial or extracellular localizations could not be excluded in some areas. For example, the medial nucleus of the inferior olive and most cerebellar nuclei contained diffuse non-fibrillar receptor immunoreactivity. The presence of nerve growth factor receptor-like immunoreactivity in cell bodies and fibers of several sensory and motor areas of the adult rat brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord suggests multifocal actions of nerve growth factor or a nerve growth factor-like substance. Although the degree of overlap between nerve growth factor receptor- and choline acetyltransferase-containing regions in the brainstem is not as great as in the forebrain, our findings suggest a potential influence of nerve growth factor or nerve growth factor-like substances on cholinergic systems outside the forebrain. Furthermore, the disparities which occur imply that non-cholinergic nerve growth factor receptor-containing neurons of the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord may be affected by such trophic substances.
2160047	The regional localization of mRNA coding for the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) has been studied in the human brain by in situ hybridization using a 32P-labelled synthetic oligonucleotide. Autoradiograms were quantified using computer-assisted microdensitometry. Positive hybridizing cells were seen in the neocortex, the claustrum, the hippocampus and the amygdala with the highest densities observed in the claustrum, some cortical layers and the CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. No significant hybridization signal was observed in the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum. The topographic distribution of neurons expressing CCK mRNA correlates well with that previously reported by immunocytochemistry or radioimmunoassay in brain areas such as the neocortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus. However, some discrepancies were also found, particularly in the basal ganglia, the midbrain, the thalamus and the hypothalamus. These results show that in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes together with a semiquantitative analysis can be used to map the distribution of cells expressing CCK mRNA in human postmortem materials.
2166757	The distribution of 125I-neurotensin binding sites was compared with that of acetylcholinesterase reactivity in the human basal forebrain by using combined light microscopic radioautography/histochemistry. High 125I-neurotensin binding densities were observed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, islands of Calleja, claustrum, olfactory tubercle, and central nucleus of the amygdala; lower levels were seen in the caudate, putamen, medial septum, diagonal band nucleus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert. Adjacent sections processed for cholinesterase histochemistry demonstrated a regional overlap between the distribution of labeled neurotensin binding sites and that of intense acetylcholinesterase staining in all of the above regions, except in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, claustrum, and central amygdaloid nucleus, where dense 125I-neurotensin labeling was detected over areas containing only weak to moderate cholinesterase staining. At higher magnification, 125I-neurotensin-labeled binding sites in the islands of Calleja, supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, medial septum, diagonal band nucleus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert were selectively associated with neuronal perikarya found to be cholinesterase-positive in adjacent sections. Moderate 125I-neurotensin binding was also apparent over the cholinesterase-reactive neuropil of these latter three regions. These data suggest that neurotensin (NT) may directly influence the activity of magnocellular cholinergic neurons in the human basal forebrain, and may be involved in the physiopathology of dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, in which these neurons have been shown to be affected.
2167417	The binding of [3H] DAMGO, a highly selective ligand for mu-opiate receptors, to membranes of discrete brain regions and spinal cord of 10 week old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was determined. The brain regions examined were hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, midbrain and cortex. [3H] DAMGO bound to membranes of brain regions and spinal cord at a single high affinity site. The receptor density (Bmax value) and apparent dissociation constant (Kd value) of [3H] DAMGO to bind to membranes of hippocampus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, cortex and spinal cord of WKY and SHR rats did not differ. The Bmax value of [3H] DAMGO in membranes of hypothalamus and midbrain of SHR rats was significantly higher than in WKY rats but the Kd values in the two strains did not differ. On the other hand, the Bmax value of [3H] DAMGO in membranes of amygdala of SHR rats was lower than that of WKY rats but the Kd values in the two strains were similar. It is concluded that SHR rats have higher density of mu-opiate receptors in hypothalamus and midbrain but lower density in amygdala in comparison with WKY rats, and that such differences in the distribution of mu-opiate receptors may be related to the elevated blood pressure in SHR rats.
2169952	The distribution of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) binding sites in the brain of several vertebrate species was examined by in vitro autoradiography on slide-mounted sections. This study included fish, frog, snake, pigeon, rat, mouse, guinea pig, cat and monkey brain. A fully characterized, monoiodinated form of vasoactive intestinal peptide (M-125I-VIP), which maintains the biological activity of the native peptide in the central nervous system (CNS), was used throughout the study. Among the lower vertebrate species, no significant specific binding was found in the fish brain, whereas in the frog and snake brain, specific VIP binding sites were observed, mainly in the telencephalon. In the pigeon brain, high densities of VIP binding sites were localized in the hyperstriatum, neostriatum, archistriatum, hippocampal area, dorsolateral cortical area and in the optic tectum. Ectostriatum and paleostriatum augmentatum displayed lower densities of specific binding. In mammals, the highest concentrations of VIP binding sites were observed in the rodent brain. In the rat, mouse and guinea pig brain, high densities were detected in the olfactory bulb, external layers of the cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus, midline thalamic nuclei, geniculate nuclei, some hypothalamic nuclei, superior colliculus and locus coeruleus. Intermediate densities were found in amygdala, caudate-putamen, septum and nucleus accumbens, CA1-CA3 fields of the hippocampus and central gray. The cerebellum of these species presented high densities of VIP binding sites, with species to species differences in their localization. The non-specific binding was, however, increased in the rodent cerebellum. Lower densities of VIP binding sites were observed in the cat and monkey CNS. In these two species, the non-specific binding was considerably higher than in the lower mammals brain. In the cat and monkey brain, as in the lower mammals, the highest densities were revealed in the neocortex, dentate gyrus, thalamic nuclei and some midbrain structures including substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. In all the species studied, the white matter was never labeled with M-125I-VIP. This study suggests that VIP binding sites appear relatively early in the evolution of the vertebrate CNS. The most important densities of specific VIP binding sites are observed in the pigeon and rodent brain, whereas the cat and monkey present a marked increase in non-specific binding. It is interesting to note that the distribution of VIP binding sites as revealed by autoradiography is quite conservative in terms of evolution and indicates an association, although non-exclusive, of VIP receptors with brain regions involved in the processing of specific sensory inputs.
2176984	The effect of chronic administration of morphine and its withdrawal on the characteristics of mu-opiate receptors was determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ligand used for characterizing the receptors was [3H][D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin ([3H]DAMGO). Rats were implanted s.c. under light ether anesthesia with six morphine pellets (each containing 75 mg of morphine free base). Rats serving as controls were implanted similarly with placebo pellets. Two sets of animals were used. In one group of rats, the pellets were left intact (tolerant-dependent) at the time of killing and in the other the pellets had been removed 18 h earlier (abstinent). The spinal cord and brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, corpus striatum, midbrain, pons and medulla, and cortex) were dissected. In morphine-abstinent rats, the binding of ligands of mu-opiate receptors to membranes of spinal cord and brain regions did not change. In non-abstinent morphine-tolerant-dependent rats, the binding of [3H]DAMGO to membranes of spinal cord, pons and medulla, and cerebral cortex was found to be decreased. These changes were due to decreases in the Bmax values rather than Kd values for the binding of [3H]DAMGO. The results clearly indicate that morphine-induced tolerance-dependence in the rat is associated with changes in the selected brain regions and spinal cord with mu-opiate receptors being down-regulated in spinal cord, pons and medulla, and cerebral cortex. It is concluded that tolerance to morphine in the rats may be due to down-regulation of central mu-opiate receptors. However, mu-opiate receptors are unaffected in morphine abstinence.
2189780	The present work describes the neuroanatomical distribution of the immunoreactive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (ir-LHRH) system in the brain of adult male and female, castrated male and developing Rana esculenta. No obvious sex differences in the distribution pattern of ir-LHRH were observed. Immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies are not contained within a single anatomically defined area of the brain. They are present as distinct groups in the olfactory bulbs, medial septal area, anterior preoptic area (APOA), retrochiasmatic area of the infundibulum, and interpeduncular nucleus-tegmentum area. Of the entire brain, the medial septal-APOA region exhibits the highest frequency of ir-LHRH cell bodies in both sexes. ir-LHRH fiber projections are present in the olfactory bulbs, medial septal area, APOA, floor of the diencephalon, subhabenular-periventricular area in the epithalamus, lateral suprachiasmatic area, ventrolateral infundibulum, median eminence, pars nervosa, optic tectum, interpeduncular nucleus-tegmentum area, and rhombencephalon grey. Castration seems to bear no effect on the pattern of ir-LHRH system in the frog brain. The influence of castration consisted in decreased intensity of the immunostaining and frequency of occurrence of the septal-APOA neuronal cell bodies. In median eminence, castration also induced a sensible decrease in the immunoreactivity, whereas in the pars nervosa of 50-day castrates ir-LHRH fibers totally disappeared. During ontogenesis, ir-LHRH elements first become evident in stage 31 tadpoles (beginning of metamorphic climax); LHRH immunoreaction is restricted to the cell bodies and fibers in the APOA and some fibers in the ventral hypothalamus and a few in median eminence. This condition remains unaltered until stage 33 when the tail is almost totally resorbed. The possible implications of the ir-LHRH-containing brain areas in the different aspects of reproduction in the frog are briefly discussed.
2209775	Neurodegenerative diseases may result from excessive stimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors by endogenous ligands. Because neuronal degeneration is associated with glial proliferation and hypertrophy, the degenerative changes throughout rat brain following the systemic administration of kainic acid (12 mg/kg) were mapped with quantitative autoradiography of [3H]PK 11195. This radioligand binds to a mitochondrial benzodiazepine binding site (MBBS) on microglia and astrocytes. Analysis of eight horizontal and four coronal brain levels revealed up to 16-fold increases in [3H]PK 11195 binding from 1 to 5 weeks but not 1 day after kainate injection. Increases in [3H]PK 11195 binding were predominantly in ventral limbic brain regions and olfactory projections to neocortical areas, with the olfactory cortex greater than subiculum/CA1 greater than anterior olfactory nucleus, medial thalamic nucleus, and piriform cortex greater than cingulate cortex and rostral hippocampus greater than dentate gyrus, septum, and amygdala greater than entorhinal cortex and temporal cortex. Little or no enhancement of [3H]PK 11195 binding was observed in numerous regions including the caudate-putamen, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, cerebellum, thalamic nuclei, choroid plexus, medulla, parietal or occipital cortex, or pons. A 2-fold greater extent of neurodegeneration was obtained in ventral portions of the olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex, and dentate gyrus compared with the dorsal portions of these structures. The pattern of increase in [3H]PK 11195 binding closely matched the patterns of neuronal degeneration reported following parenteral kainate injection. These findings strengthen the notion that quantitative autoradiography of [3H]PK 11195 is a valuable tool to quantify the extent of neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, the quantitative changes in [3H]PK 11195 binding in different limbic structures parallel their relative variation in neuropathology observed in Alzheimer's disease but not Huntington's chorea. These findings are in agreement with the idea that excessive stimulation of excitatory amino receptors may contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.
2222848	The involvement of aldehyde adducts in the etiology of alcoholism continues to be supported by a number of experimental findings. These metabolites are synthesized endogenously from a condensation reaction of a biogenic aldehyde with a catechol- or indole-amine and act in the brain to augment or suppress the drinking of ethyl alcohol. When given by the intracerebroventricular route in an animal which does not prefer alcohol, certain tetrahydro-isoquinolines and beta-carbolines can augment significantly the voluntary intake of alcohol even in aversive concentrations. This paper describes the historical background and current status of the "Multiple Metabolite" theory of alcoholism. The recent identification of anatomical structures in the limbic-midbrain, limbic-forebrain of the Sprague-Dawley rat, which mediate changes in the intake of alcohol induced by tetrahydropapaveroline (THP) is also described. When injected in a low dose of 25 ng in a specific site, over a 3-day period, THP induces persistent increases in the intake of alcohol even in aversive concentrations. These THP-reactive sites comprise the substantia nigra, reticular formation, medial lemniscus, zona incerta, medial forebrain bundle, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, lateral septal nucleus, preoptic area, stria terminalis, and rostral hippocampus. A higher dose of 250 ng THP microinjected at homologous loci tends to inhibit the rat's self-selection of alcohol or exert no effect on drinking. Morphological mapping of histologically identified sites sensitive to THP revealed a distinct "circuitry" of neuronal structures overlapping both dopaminergic and enkephalinergic pathways. This "circuit" extends from the tegmental-nigral area of the midbrain rostrally to structures within the limbic-forebrain. When a THP-reactive structure, the N. accumbens, was lesioned by either of two neurotoxins, 6-hydroxydopamine or 5.7-dihydroxytryptamine, the rats' preference for alcohol increased sharply. This suggests that impairment of transmitter release, denervation supersensitivity or other perturbation of receptor function within this and other structures play a part in the aberrant drinking of alcohol. It is envisaged that a dopamine-enkephalin link underlies the mechanism for the onset, maintenance and permanency of alcohol preference generated by an aldehyde adduct. Finally, the "Two-Channel, Brain Metabolite" theory of alcoholism proposes that the transitory presence of an endogenously formed aldehyde adduct within cells of the brain causes a permanent perturbation of normal receptor processes and transmitter activity within synapses of specific structures of the limbic system. This theory thus explains the nature of the rewarding properties of alcohol as well as its complex addictive liability which is physiologically irreversible.
2229489	The distribution of cholecystokinin (CCK)-immunoreactive nerve fibers and cell bodies was studied in the forebrain of control and colchicine-treated guinea pigs by using an antiserum directed against the carboxyterminus of CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) in the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Virtually all forebrain areas examined contained immunoreactive nerve fibers. A dense innervation was visualized in; neocortical layers II-III, piriform cortex, the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic area, a circumventricular organ-like structure located at the top of the third ventricle in the preoptic area, the subfornical organ, the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the posterior globus pallidus (containing labeled woolly fiber-like profiles), the ventromedial hypothalamus, the median eminence, and the premammillary nucleus. A moderately dense innervation was visualized elsewhere excepted in the septum and thalamus where labeled axons were comparatively few. Immunoreactive perikarya were abundant in: neocortex (especially layers II-III), piriform cortex, amygdala, the median preoptic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hypothalamic paraventricular (parvicellular part), arcuate, and dorsomedial (pars compacta) nuclei, the dorsal and perifornical hypothalamic areas, and throughout the thalamus. Areas also containing a moderate number of labeled cell bodies were the medial preoptic area, the globus pallidus, the caudate-putamen, and the periventromedial area in the hypothalamus. Immunostained perikarya were absent or only occasionally observed in the septum, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the magnocellular hypothalamoneurohypophyseal nuclei, and the ventral mesencephalon. In the adenohypophysis, corticomelanotrophs were labeled in both males and females, and thyrotrophs were labeled in females only. This distribution pattern of CCK-8 immunoreactivity is compared to those previously recorded in other mammals. This shows that very few features are peculiar to the the guinea pig. It is discussed whether some interspecific differences in immunostaining are real rather than methodological.
2243353	The 5-HT2 (serotonin) receptor has traditionally been labeled with antagonist radioligands such as [3H]ketanserin and [3H]spiperone, which label both agonist high-affinity (guanyl nucleotide-sensitive) and agonist low-affinity (guanyl nucleotide-insensitive) states of this receptor. The hallucinogen 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) is an agonist which labels the high-affinity guanyl nucleotide-sensitive state of brain 5-HT2 receptors selectively. In the present study, conditions for autoradiographic visualization of (+/-)-[125I]DOI-labeled 5-HT2 receptors were optimized and binding to slide-mounted sections was characterized with respect to pharmacology, guanyl nucleotide sensitivity and anatomical distribution. In slide-mounted rat brain sections (+/-)-[125I]DOI binding was saturable, of high affinity (KD approximately 4 nM) and displayed a pharmacologic profile typical of 5-HT2 receptors. Consistent with coupling of 5-HT2 receptors in the high-affinity state to a guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein, [125I]DOI binding was inhibited by guanyl nucleotides but not by adenosine triphosphate. Patterns of autoradiographic distribution of [125I]DOI binding to 5-HT2 receptors were similar to those seen with [3H]ketanserin- and [125I]-lysergic acid diethylamide-labeled 5-HT2 receptors. However, the density of 5-HT2 receptors labeled by the agonist [125I]DOI was markedly lower (30-50%) than that labeled by the antagonist [3H]ketanserin. High densities of [125I]DOI labeling were present in olfactory bulb, anterior regions of cerebral cortex (layer IV), claustrum, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, islands of Calleja, mammillary nuclei and inferior olive. Binding in hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus was generally sparse. Of note, choroid plexus, a site rich in 5-HT1c receptors had a high density of [125I]DOI binding sites but [3H]ketanserin binding in this region was low. Studies in which [125I]DOI binding to 5-HT2 receptors was blocked with spiperone revealed persisting robust [125I]DOI binding in choroid plexus, which was guanyl nucleotide-sensitive and displayed a pharmacologic profile consistent with its binding to 5-HT1c receptors. These studies suggest that [125I]DOI may be useful as a radiolabel for visualizing the agonist high-affinity state of 5-HT2 receptors and for visualizing 5-HT1c receptors.
2243599	Afferents to the median-paramedian raphe nuclear complex, which contains the B8 serotonergic cell group, were investigated in the rat with neuroanatomical and transmitter-selective retrograde labelling techniques. Injection of sensitive retrograde tracers, cholera toxin genoid or wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase into the median raphe resulted in labelling of neurons in a large number of brain regions. Projections from 26 of these regions are supported by available orthograde tracing data; the cingulate cortex, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial septum and diagonal band of Broca, ventral pallidum, medial and lateral preoptic areas, lateral hypothalamus, dorsomedial nucleus of hypothalamus, lateral habenula, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, central (periaqueductal) gray, and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus seem to represent major sources of afferents to the median-paramedian raphe complex. Retrogradely labelled cells were also observed in a number of regions for which anterograde tracing data are not available, including the perifornical hypothalamic nucleus, ventral premammillary nucleus, supramammillary and submammillothalamic nuclei and the B9 area. Possible excitatory amino acid afferents were identified with retrograde D-[3H]aspartate labelling. Microinjection of D-[3H]aspartate at a low concentration, 10(-4) M in 50 nl, resulted in retrograde labelling of a limited number of median raphe afferents. The most prominent labelling was observed in the lateral habenula and the interpeduncular nucleus, but retrogradely labelled cells were also noted in the medial and lateral preoptic areas, lateral and dorsal hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, and the pontine tegmentum. After injections of 10(-3) M D-[3H]aspartate selective labelling also appeared in more distant afferent regions, including cells in cingulate cortex, and in some regions located at shorter distances, such as the supramammillary nucleus. Injections of D-[3H]aspartate at high concentration, 10(-2) M, resulted in the appearance of weakly to moderately labelled cells in most afferent areas which were devoid of labelled cells after injections of lower concentrations, suggesting that this labelling may be non-specific. It was concluded that the median-paramedian raphe receives afferents from a large number of forebrain and hypothalamic regions, while relatively few brain stem regions project to this nuclear complex. The selectivity of retrograde labelling with D-[3H]aspartate was found to be concentration dependent, and it is suggested that the connections showing high affinity for D-[3H]aspartate may use excitatory amino acids as transmitters. Excitatory amino acid inputs from lateral habenula and interpeduncular nucleus may play predominant roles in the control of ascending serotonergic and non-serotonergic projections originating in the median and paramedian raphe nuclei.
2255400	Cholecystokinin binding sites were labeled with [3H]cholecystokinin-8, [125I]cholecystokinin-33, and [125I]cholecystokinin-8 in major structures of macaque basal ganglia by in vitro receptor autoradiography. Analysis of autoradiograms revealed areas of heavy cholecystokinin binding in the neostriatum and substantia nigra that were set off, often quite sharply, from the adjacent globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus where labeling was, by contrast, very light. Heavy label characterized the ventromedial and posterior parts of the caudate nucleus and adjacent putamen, binding was of moderate intensity in central areas of these regions, while, the dorsolateral margin of the head of the caudate and precommissural putamen, the dorsolateral one-third of the body of the caudate, and all but the most medial and ventral portions of the posterior putamen lateral to the pallidum were sparsely labeled. The pattern of cholecystokinin binding within the neostriatum was mottled; patches of reduced label stood out from the background of more prominent binding. However, those patches were only imperfectly correlated with the striosomal organization of both the caudate nucleus and putamen as revealed by acetylcholinesterase staining. Cholecystokinin binding in the substantia nigra was also intricately patterned. Moderately dense, vertically orientated bands of label were found in the dorsal one-third to half of the pars reticulata, providing a marked contrast to the near background levels in the ventral pars reticulata and overlying pars compacta. The present study shows that heavy cholecystokinin binding is confined to particular areas within the primate basal ganglia; the pattern of label within the substantia nigra and neostriatum can be linked to intrinsic and afferent connections of these structures. The confinement of binding sites to the dorsal pars reticulata suggests an association with dendrites of pars compacta neurons which invade this region; this interpretation is consistent with recent evidence of depletion of nigral cholecystokinin binding sites in macaques following chemical lesion of dopaminergic cells of the par compacta. In the neostriatum the distribution of binding shows overlap with its topographically organized corticostriatal innervation; portions of heavily labeled striatum coincide with regions innervated by association cortex of the frontal and temporal lobes, whereas regions of diminished binding correspond to areas innervated mainly by sensory and motor cortex. These latter findings suggest that cholecystokinin may have a particularly strong influence on cognitive aspects of striatal function.
2257479	The afferent connections of the striatum and the nucleus accumbens of the lizard Gekko gecko were studied with retrograde tracing by means of horseradish peroxidase and Fluoro-Gold and with anterograde tracing by means of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin. The striatum receives projections from the cortex, the dorsal ventricular ridge, the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, the globus pallidus, the anterior peduncular nucleus, the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, the area ventral to the substantia nigra, and the dorsal thalamus. The nucleus accumbens is projected upon by the cortex, the diagonal band, the ventral pallidum, the lateral preoptic area, the ventral tegmental area, and the dorsal thalamus. The source of the cortical projection to the striatum and the nucleus accumbens is a longitudinal zone in the dorsal cortex that, rostrally in the hemisphere, is located medially and, more caudally, in its middle one third. The medial and rostrolateral areas of the dorsal ventricular ridge each project to the striatum in a vertical zone. The fibers from the caudolateral area of the ridge end in two oblique bands located parallel to the border between the dorsal ventricular ridge and the striatum. The pathways from the mesencephalic tegmentum to the striatum and the nucleus accumbens show a medial to lateral topography. This is similar to the situation in birds, but contrary to that in mammals in which these pathways are extensively interconnected. The specific sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus were found to project not only to the dorsal ventricular ridge, but also, and in a topographical fashion, to the striatum. The dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, which innervates the dorsal ventricular ridge, has additional projections to the striatum and the nucleus accumbens. This projection pattern is similar to that of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei of birds and mammals.
2257480	The distribution of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)-immunoreactive (PNMTi) cell bodies and fibers in the brain of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by antibodies raised in rabbits against purified bovine adrenal PNMT. The PNMTi cell bodies were observed in the ventrolateral rhombencephalic tegmentum at the level of the obex. No immunoreactive perikarya were found in the nucleus of the solitary tract, the medial longitudinal fascicle or the hypothalamus. An extensive network of PNMTi fibers is present throughout the brain, extending rostrally as far as the olfactory peduncle. In the telecenphalon, moderate to dense plexuses of PNMTi fibers were observed in the medial part of the nucleus accumbens, the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, the caudoventral septal region and the central amygdaloid nucleus. In the diencephalon, the periventricular and lateral zones of the preoptic and hypothalamic areas, the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus contain many PNMTi fibers. Brainstem structures innervated by PNMTi fibers are the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the periaqueductal gray, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial region, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral region of the caudal brainstem. Although the brain of Gekko appears to lack PNMTi cells in areas comparable to the C2 and C3 cell groups in rats, the distribution of PNMTi fibers is nevertheless strikingly similar in both groups.
2272143	Histological changes that explain the mental symptoms of patients with myotonic dystrophy (MD) have not fully been demonstrated yet. Recently, the presence of Alzheimer's neurofibrillary changes (ANCs) in the brain have been reported in this disease. We studied the brain of a 61-year-old male with MD. The distribution of ANCs was investigated and mapped through careful histological examinations. The examinations disclosed that in MD, ANCs distributed along their preferential sites of the brain; a great number of ANCs were found in the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdaloid nucleus, fusiform gyrus, insula, and olfactory bulb, many in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, inferior temporal gyrus, hypothalamus, and brain stem, and a few in the cingulate, frontal and temporal gyri, neostriatum, and mammillary body. In the brain stem, ANCs were seen in the central gray, oculomotor nucleus, linear nucleus, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, superior central nucleus, retriculotegmental nucleus, and reticular formation. From this result and the previous reports by others, it may be suggested that the presence of ANCs concentrated mostly in the limbic system is a regular and significant histological finding in the brain in MD. Therefore, this limbic lesion must be related to some of the mental symptoms unique to MD. In addition, diffuse and considerable neuronal atrophy and gliosis in the thalami in the absence of ANCs also may have played a causative role in some of the mental symptoms of the present case. Besides the more concentrated occurrence of ANCs within the limbic system, the minimal presence of senile plaques in the CNS may differentiate the brain in MD from that in Alzheimer-type dementia.
2289149	The regional distribution of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was examined in the tissue and extracellular compartment of rat brain. The tissue content of IGF-I was the highest in the pituitary gland, followed by the olfactory bulb, upper brainstem, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus, lower brainstem, and cerebral cortex. The extracellular concentration was studied by intracerebral microdialysis technique, and the highest content was found in the hippocampus, followed by the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cerebellum, striatum, and cerebral cortex. The tissue and extracellular contents were significantly correlated in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cerebellum, striatum, and cerebral cortex. IGF-I might act by paracrine and/or autocrine regulatory mechanisms in these regions.
2289174	The afferent and efferent connections of the cerebellar interpositus complex were studied in a capuchin monkey (Cebus apella) that had received a transcannular horseradish peroxidase implant into the caudal portion of the anterior interpositus nucleus and posterior interpositus nucleus. While the heaviest anterogradely labeled ascending projections were observed to the contralateral ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, pars oralis (VPLo), efferent projections were also observed to the contralateral ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VLc) and central lateral (CL) nucleus of the thalamic intralaminar complex, magnocellular (and to a lesser extent parvicellular) red nucleus, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, zona incerta, nucleus of the posterior commissure, lateral intermediate layer and deep layer of the superior colliculus, dorsolateral periaqueductal gray, contralateral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and basilar pontine nuclei (especially dorsal and peduncular), and dorsal (DAO) and medial (MAO) accessory olivary nuclei, ipsilateral lateral (external) cuneate nucleus (LCN) and lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), and to a lesser extent the caudal medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) and caudal nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH), and dorsal medullary raphe. The heaviest retrograde labeling was corticonuclear Purkinje cells in the paramedian cerebellar cortex lateral to the vermis of lobules IV-VIII. Otherwise, retrogradely labeled sources of afferents were predominantly contralateral in the dorsal, dorsomedial, paramedian, and peduncular sectors of the basilar pons, NRTP, and dorsal accessory (DAO) and medial accessory (MAO) of olivary nuclei, but were predominantly ipsilateral in the LCN, LRN, and in the medullary reticular formation along the roots of the hypoglossal (XII) cranial nerve. It appeared that the connections with the contralateral dorsal basilar pons, NRTP, DAO and MAO, and ipsilateral LCN and LRN are reciprocal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2293086	The expression of the protein product encoded by the Krox-24 gene was investigated immunocytochemically in the central nervous system of adult rats. Immunoreactivity (IR) of the KROX-24 protein which is a nuclear transacting transcription factor, showed a pattern of nuclear staining. Basal KROX-24-IR was visible in the superficial layers of spinal dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus, and in many areas of the brain including the cerebellum, nucleus raphe magnus, colliculi, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, geniculate nuclei, caudate putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus, olfactory tubercle and cerebral cortex. Electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve A- and C-fibers, but not of A alpha- and A beta-fibers alone, induced transient expression of KROX-24 in numerous spinal neurons in the termination area of the stimulated nerve. One hour following the onset of this stimulation of the sciatic nerve the distribution of KROX-24-IR was investigated in the brain and compared to untreated rats. In stimulated animals, the KROX-24-IR was induced in many areas including the lateral reticular nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, amygdala and lateral habenular nucleus.
2303021	Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was examined in an El mouse during an entire seizure (tonic-clonic convulsions and recovery), and during the recovery period only. LCGU was measured quantitatively in 18 structures. In the whole-seizure group, the parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, dentate gyrus, ventral thalamus and cerebellar nuclei showed a significant increase in the uptake of 2-DG. In the recovery-period group, compared with the control group, a relative increase was found in the frontal, temporal and occipital cortex, amygdala, substantia grisea centralis mesencephali, cerebellar nuclei and caudate putamen, as well as the parietal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus and dentate gyrus. To summarize, the hyperactivity in the parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdala and cerebellar nuclei continued throughout the convulsive and recovery periods.
2312784	Acetylcholine (ACh) plays a major role in central autonomic regulation, including the control of arterial blood pressure (AP). Previously unknown neuroanatomic substrates of cholinergic-autonomic control were mapped in this study. Cholinergic perikarya and bouton-like varicosities were localized by an immunocytochemical method employing a monoclonal antiserum against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme synthesizing ACh. In the forebrain, bouton-like varicosities and/or perikarya were detected in the septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala (in particular, autonomic projection areas AP1 and AP2 bordering the central subnucleus), hypothalamus (rostrolateral/innominata transitional area, perifornical, dorsal, incertal, caudolateral, posterior [PHN], subparafascicular, supramammillary and mammillary nuclei). Few or no punctate varicosities were labeled in the paraventricular (PVN) or supraoptic (SON) hypothalamic nuclei. In the mid- and hindbrain, immunoreactive cells and processes were present in the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial complex (PBC), a periceruleal zone avoiding the locus ceruleus (LC), pontine micturition field, pontomedullary raphe, paramedian reticular formation and periventricular gray, A5 area, lateral tegmental field, nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), nucleus commissuralis, nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis (RVL), and the ventral medullary surface (VMS). In the PBC, immunoreactive varicosities identified areas previously unexplored for cholinergic autonomic responsivity (superior, internal, dorsal, and central divisions of the lateral subnucleus, nucleus of Koelliker-Fuse and the medial subnucleus). In the NTS, previously undescribed ChAT-immunolabeled cells and processes were concentrated at intermediate and subpostremal levels and distributed viscerotopically in areas receiving primary cardiopulmonary afferents. In the nucleus RVL, cholinergic perikarya were in proximity to the VMS and medial to adrenergic cell bodies of the C1 area. Punctate varicosities of unknown origin and dendrites extending ventrally from the nucleus ambiguus overlapped the C1 area and immediate surround of RVL. In conclusion: 1) Cholinergic perikarya and putative terminal fields, overlap structures that are rich in cholinoreceptors and express autonomic, neuroendocrine, or behavioral responsivity to central cholinergic stimulation (PHN, NTS, RVL). The role of ACh in most immunolabeled areas, however, has yet to be determined. Overall, these data support the concept that cholinergic agents act at multiple sites in the CNS and with topographic specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2313304	A quantitative study has been made of the number of neurofibrillary tangles and of the choline acetyltransferase activity in several sites in the cerebral hemispheres of eight patients who had had Alzheimer's disease. The neurofibrillary tangles were maximal in structures in the medial temporal lobe (uncus, amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus), severe in the neocortex on the lateral surface of the temporal lobe, moderate in the "association cortex" of the parietal and frontal lobes and minimal in primary somatic and visual sensory areas. There was a significant decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity in almost all areas, and the means of the percentage decreases for the different groups of areas correlate well with the counts of the neurofibrillary tangles. These results support the hypothesis that the pathological process in Alzheimer's disease may spread along a sequence of corticocortical connections between the main sensory areas and the hippocampal formation. The disease process may also spread along the reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the neocortex because the numbers of tangles in different areas of the neocortex closely parallel the density of their connections and the amygdala.
2319009	Postnatal developmental changes of preproenkephalin (PPE) gene expression in rat brainstem neurons were studied by in situ hybridization histochemistry. On the basis of PPE mRNA expression, brainstem neurons were categorized into three types: 1) type I neurons were characterized by constant or increasing expression of PPE mRNA during postnatal development; 2) type II neurons started to express PPE mRNA several days after birth and continued to do so thereafter; and 3) type III neurons showed transient expression of PPE mRNA or stopped expressing the mRNA during early postnatal development. Type I PPE neurons were observed in diverse brainstem structures including the mesencephalic and pontine central gray matter, various reticular and raphe nuclei, the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, the interpeduncular nucleus, the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei of Gudden, the sphenoid nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, Barrington's nucleus, the parabrachial region, the lateral lemniscus and its related nuclei, the trapezoid nucleus, the rostral and ventromedial periolivary nuclei, the mesencephalic trigeminal and principal sensory trigeminal nuclei, the locus coeruleus, the subcoeruleus nucleus, the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, the medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei, the Roller nucleus, and the intermedius nucleus of the medulla. Type II PPE neurons were found in the superior colliculus, the inferior colliculus, the central part of the dorsal tegmental nucleus, and as Golgi neurons in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Type III PPE neurons were located in the substantia nigra, the red nucleus, the superior olive, the motor trigeminal nucleus, the facial nucleus, the inferior olive, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the hypoglossal nucleus. Such region-specific expression of the PPE gene during postnatal ontogeny suggests that rat brainstem PPE neurons may be involved in a variety of developmental events, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.
2324335	The distribution of cells that express mRNA encoding the androgen (AR) and estrogen (ER) receptors was examined in adult male and female rats by using in situ hybridization. Specific labeling appeared to be largely, if not entirely, localized to neurons. AR and ER mRNA-containing neurons were widely distributed in the rat brain, with the greatest densities of cells in the hypothalamus, and in regions of the telencephalon that provide strong inputs in the medial preoptic and ventromedial nuclei, each of which is thought to play a key role in mediating the hormonal control of copulatory behavior, as well as in the lateral septal nucleus, the medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, the amygdalohippocampal area, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Heavily labeled ER mRNA-containing cells were found in regions known to be involved in the neural control of gonadotropin release, such as the anteroventral periventricular and the arcuate nuclei, but only a moderate density of labeling for AR mRNA was found over these nuclei. In addition, clearly labeled cells were found in regions with widespread connections throughout the brain, including the lateral hypothalamus, intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and deep layers of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that AR and ER may modulate a wide variety of neural functions. Each part of Ammon's horn contained AR mRNA-containing cells, as did both parts of the subiculum, but ER mRNA appeared to be less abundant in the hippocampal formation. Moreover, AR and ER mRNA-containing cells were also found in olfactory regions of the cortex and in both the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. AR and ER may modulate nonolfactory sensory information as well since labeled cells were found in regions involved in the central relay of somatosensory information, including the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the ventral thalamic nuclear group, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Furthermore, heavily labeled AR mRNA-containing cells were found in the vestibular nuclei, the cochlear nuclei, the medial geniculate nucleus, and the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, which suggests that androgens may alter the central relay of vestibular and auditory information as well. However, of all the regions involved in sensory processing, the heaviest labeling for AR and ER mRNA was found in areas that relay visceral sensory information such as the nucleus of the solitary tract, the area postrema, and the subfornical organ. We did not detect ER mRNA in brainstem somatic motoneurons, but clearly labeled AR mRNA-containing cells were found in motor nuclei associated with the fifth, seventh, tenth, and twelfth cranial nerves. Similarly, spinal motoneurons contained AR but not ER mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2328842	In a previous study using chick/quail chimeric embryos with homotopic transplants (Martinez & Alvarado-Mallart, 1989b), we have delimited in the 2-day-old avian embryo the areas of the neural tube giving rise to optic tectum and mesencephalic grissea as well as to isthmic grissea and cerebellum: respectively, "mesencephalic" and "metencephalic" alar plates. To investigate the determination or the competence of these areas, portions of these germinative neuroepithelia from a quail embryo were transplanted in substitution for other areas of the chick neural tube. The analysis of the chimeric brains was done by comparing alternating transverse sections stained for cytoarchitecture and with two different techniques to recognize transplanted versus host cells: either the Feulgen and Rossenbeck DNA histochemical reaction and/or immunohistochemical methods with a monoclonal antibody recognizing quail but not chick cells. The eventual visual innervation of the quail graft was analyzed in many cases by injecting anterograde axonal tracers in the eye contralateral to the graft. The results are as follows: (1) caudal metencephalon transferred to mesencephalon maintained in all cases its presumptive cerebellar phenotype, whereas (2) rostral metencephalon transferred to mesencephalon changed its fate to a tectal phenotype but maintained its cerebellar fate when transferred to diencephalon; (3) caudal mesencephalon maintained its tectal fate in 65% of the cases when transferred to diencephalon, whereas (4) rostral mesencephalon transferred to a cerebellar domain changed its fate and became influenced by the surrounding structures in all cases, but only in 85% of the cases when it was transplanted to diencephalon; (5) the in situ host diencephalon, isolated from its normal environment by a mesencephalic graft, is competent to change its fate and express a mesencephalic phenotype. These results demonstrate that at least some regions of the germinative neuroepithelium from either metencephalon, mesencephalon, and diencephalon are still pluripotent in the 2-day-old avian embryo and that their fate seems to be under the influence of the surrounding structures. Rostral mesencephalon and rostral metencephalon have been more easily influenced by environmental factors than their caudal counterparts, suggesting that regions providing instructive positional factors exist within the 2-day-old germinative neuroepithelium. These regions might play an important role in the determination of the various segments of the neural tube.
2333150	Similarities in cellular morphology, afferentation, efferentation, and neurotransmitter content between the internal and external parts of the pallidum and the substantia nigra pars reticulata have long been noted. Here we present evidence that the globus pallidus, entopedunucular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata are more closely related to each other antigenically than to any other anatomical subdivision in the murine central nervous system. In a monoclonal antibody library composed of 20 distinctive lines selected from 300 hybridomas screened immunohistochemically on mouse brain sagittal sections we found two antibodies whose staining patterns distinguish the pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata from all other brain gray matter regions but stain these two divisions similarly. One monoclonal antibody, F1-134, stains all brain gray matter regions moderately but gives intense staining of the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata only. Another monoclonal antibody, F1-20, stains different brain gray matter regions to varying degrees but shows a complete and exclusive exclusion of staining from the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. These results support the tripartite pallidum hypothesis. This study also provides an example of how the monoclonal antibody library strategy can be applied to general problems of brain organization.
2341628	The present study was undertaken to establish the precise anatomical relationship of the subthalamic nucleus (STh) with limbic lobe-afferented parts of the basal ganglia in the rat. The anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), injected in the STh, the globus pallidus, the ventral pallidum, the ventral striatum, and the parafascicular thalamic nucleus, and the retrograde tracers Fluoro-Gold (FG) and cholera toxin B (CTb), injected in the globus pallidus, the ventral pallidum, the ventral striatum, and the ventral mesencephalon, were used for this purpose. The results of these tracing experiments confirm the general notion of reciprocal connections between the STh and pallidal areas. Thus the dorsomedial part of the STh is connected with the subcommisural ventral pallidum, whereas a more ventral and lateral part of the medial STh is related to the medial globus pallidus. The lateral hypothalamic area, directly adjacent to the STh, containing neurons with a morphology quite similar to those in the STh, projects to parts of the ventral pallidum related to the olfactory tubercle. The reciprocal projection from this pallidal area to subthalamic regions appears to be very sparse. The medial STh sends strong projections to the medial part of the entopeduncular nucleus and the adjacent lateral hypothalamic area. Sparser projections from the medial STh reach the rostral and medial part of the caudate-putamen and the nucleus accumbens. The nucleus accumbens sends a very sparse projection back to the medial STh. The projections of the medial STh to the ventral mesencephalon appear also to be topographically organized. The lateral hypothalamus and a few cells in the most medial part of the STh project to the ventral tegmental area, whereas progressively more lateral parts of the ventral mesencephalon, in particular the substantia nigra, receive input from successively more lateral and caudal parts of the STh. In addition, a number of STh fibers reach the midbrain extrapyramidal area. The lateral part of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus projects to the lateral part of the STh, whereas parafascicular neurons medial to the fasciculus retroflexus project to the dorsomedial portion of the STh. The medial part of the STh and the adjacent lateral hypothalamus are intimately connected with limbic parts of the basal ganglia in a way similar and parallel to the connections of the lateral STh with motor-related parts of the basal ganglia. These findings suggest a role for the STh in nonmotor functions of the basal ganglia.
2351059	We have examined neuronal differentiation and the formation of axon tracts in the embryonic forebrain and midbrain of the zebrafish, between 1 and 2 days postfertilisation. Axons were visualised with three techniques; immunocytochemistry (using HNK-1 and antiacetylated tubulin antibodies) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelling in whole-mounted brains, and transmission electron microscopy. Differentiation was monitored by histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). These independent methods demonstrated that a simple grid of tracts and commissures forms the initial axon scaffold of the brain. At 1 day, the olfactory nerve, four commissures, their associated tracts and three other non-commissural tracts are present. By 2 days, these tracts and commissures have all greatly enlarged and, in addition, the optic nerve and tract, and three new commissures and their associated tracts have been added. Small applications of HRP at various sites revealed the origins and projections of some of these earliest axons. Retrogradely labelled cell bodies originated from regions that were also positive for AChE activity. At 1 day, HRP-labelled axons were traced: (1) from the olfactory placode through the olfactory nerve to the dorsal telencephalon; (2) from the telencephalon into the tract of the anterior commissure and also to the postoptic region of the diencephalon; (3) from the hindbrain through the ventral midbrain and diencephalon to the postoptic commissure; (4) from the dorsal diencephalon (in or near the epiphysis) to the tract of the postoptic commissure; (5) from ventral and rostral midbrain through the posterior commissure. Three new projections were demonstrated at 2 days: (1) from the retina through the tract of the postoptic commissure to the tectum; (2) from the telencephalon to the contralateral diencephalon; and (3) from the telencephalon to the ventral flexure. These results show that at 1 day, the zebrafish brain is impressively simple, with a few small, well-separated tracts but by 2 days the brain is already considerably more complex. Most of the additional axons added onto pre-existent tracts rather than pioneered new ones supporting the notion that other axons play a crucial role in the guidance of early central nervous system (CNS) axons.
2357956	Of 204 patients who underwent a selective amygdalohippocampectomy at our hospital, we studied 30 in whom special pre- and postoperative MR imaging was carried out and who were followed up for at least 1 year postoperatively. We measured the total size of the resection and the extent to which the following specific mediobasal temporal lobe structures had been removed: amygdala, hippocampus, pes hippocampi, dentate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, uncus and subiculum. Postoperative seizure control was correlated with the overall size of the resection as well as with the resection scores of the above mentioned limbic subcompartments. The mean size of the removed tissue was 7.2 cm3 (range: 2.1-17.7). The mean resection scores of the limbic subcompartments (in percentages) are: amygdala 92%, hippocampus 46%, pes hippocampi 92%, dentate gyrus 45%, parahippocampal gyrus 32%, uncus 92%, subiculum 40%. Although a small resection did not exclude a good outcome, the general tendency was that a better outcome was obtained from a larger resection. With regard to the resection scores of the limbic subcompartments, a positive correlation emerged between good postoperative outcome and the radicality of the removal of the parahippocampal gyrus (and the subiculum, which has been evaluated separately). These findings support our previously formulated amplifier hypothesis for the parahippocampal gyrus.
2358531	In order to study the morphological substrate of possible thalamic influence on the cells of origin and area of termination of the projection from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal formation, we examined the pathways, terminal distribution, and ultrastructure of the innervation of the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal region by the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (NRT). We employed anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). Injections of PHA-L in the NRT produce fiber and terminal labeling in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of field CA1 of the hippocampus, the molecular layer of the subiculum, layers I and III/IV of the dorsal subdivision of the lateral entorhinal area (DLEA), and layers I and III-VI of the ventral lateral (VLEA) and medial (MEA) divisions of the entorhinal cortex. Terminal labeling is most dense in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of field CA1, the molecular layer of the ventral part of the subiculum, MEA, and layer I of the perirhinal cortex. In layer I of the caudal part of DLEA and in MEA, terminal labeling is present in clusters. Injections in the rostral half of the NRT produce the same distribution in the hippocampal region as those in the caudal half of the NRT, although the projections from the rostral half of the NRT are much stronger. A topographical organization is present in the projections from the head of the NRT, so that the dorsal part projects predominantly to dorsal parts of field CA1 and the subiculum and to lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex, whereas the ventral part projects in greatest volume to ventral parts of field CA1 and the subiculum and to medial parts of the entorhinal cortex. The distribution of the reuniens fibers coursing in the cingulate bundle was determined by comparing cases with and without transections of this bundle. The fibers carried by the cingulate bundle exclusively innervate field CA1 of the hippocampus, the dorsal part of the subiculum, and the presubiculum and parasubiculum. They participate in the innervation of the ventral part of the subiculum and MEA. Electron microscopy was used to visualize the axon terminals of PHA-L-labeled reuniens fibers. These terminals possess spherical synaptic vesicles and form asymmetric synaptic contacts with dendritic spines or with thin shafts of spinous dendrites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2358547	Capsaicin is a neurotoxin known for its ability to cause degeneration of small unmyelinated primary sensory neurons in both spinal and cranial nerves. Although lower motor neurons do not degenerate following capsaicin treatment, the extent to which capsaicin may damage neurons in the brain has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study examines the effects of systemic capsaicin (50-150 mg/kg) on the central nervous system of 10-day-old rats. Rat pups were injected with capsaicin or the injection vehicle and sacrificed 6 hours-10 days later. Brains, spinal cords, and retinas were stained with cupric silver to label degenerating neurons. As previously reported for capsaicin-treated rats, degenerating nerve terminals were present in areas receiving primary afferent input: the spinal cord dorsal horn, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and area postrema. However, degenerating terminals were also present in areas not known to receive primary sensory innervation: the inferior olivary nucleus, sphenoid nucleus, medial and olivary pretectal nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, interfascicular nucleus, caudal linear, dorsal, median, and paramedian raphe nuclei, supramammillary area, lateral habenula, ventrolateral geniculate nucleus, ventral reuniens nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic and preoptic areas, suprachiasmatic nucleus, septohypothalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septal nucleus, accumbens shell, olfactory bulb, and retina. Some areas where capsaicin caused degeneration in rat pups do not appear to be capsaicin-sensitive in adult rats. Results indicate that (1) capsaicin's neurotoxicity is not limited to primary sensory neurons and (2) developmental factors may alter the capsaicin sensitivity of some neuronal projections within the brain.
2366393	The regional distribution of toluene in the brain and its effects on the brain catecholamine levels in rats is reported. Separate sets of rats were exposed to the toluene via inhalation, at 1,500 ppm and at 10,000 ppm respectively, and via an ingestion (400 mg/kg). Given these three exposure conditions, the values of brain/blood toluene ratios were found to be the highest in the brain stem areas (2.85-3.22) such as the pons and medulla oblongata, in the middle range in the midbrain, the thalamus, the caudate-putamen, the hypothalamus and the cerebellum (1.77-2.12), and in the lowest ranges in the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (1.22-1.64). The values of the partition coefficient of toluene in the brain regions and in the blood of rats examined in vitro were also the highest in the brain stem and the lowest in the cerebral cortex. The highest values of brain/blood toluene and partition coefficients of toluene in the brain regions and blood were obtained in the lipid-rich regions. These results suggest that toluene, which has a high lipid solubility and no protein binding capability, distributes according to lipid contents of the brain. The inhalation of toluene (1,500 ppm and 10,000 ppm) caused decreases in the noradrenaline (NA) levels in the dorsal part of rat pons, rich in locus coeruleus, and in the dopamine (DA) levels in the hypothalamus and ventral part of the rat midbrain, rich in substantia nigra.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2372234	The effect of crotononitrile (4.22 mmol/kg, CRN) or 2-pentenenitrile (2.00 mmol/kg, 2-PN), which exhibit long-term dyskinesia, was examined on the metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in five brain regions of mice 1, 5, 12 and 35 days after dosing with CRN or 2-PN or vehicle (0.1 ml/25 g). One day after injection, CRN increased the level of the following substances and the ratio of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT: 5-HT in medulla oblongata plus pons (144% of control); 5-HIAA in cortex (162%), striatum (166%), medulla oblongata plus pons (212%), hypothalamus (146%) and mid-brain (167%); 5-HIAA/5-HT in medulla oblongata plus pons (148%) and midbrain (133%). The changes caused by 2-PN were as follows: DA levels in cortex (176% of control, 35 days after dosing); HVA levels in striatum (136%, 1 day); 5-HT levels in hypothalamus (141%, 35 days); 5-HIAA levels in striatum (150%, 1 day), medulla oblongata plus pons (159%, 1 day) and midbrain (146%, 1 day); 5-HIAA/5-HT in striatum (153%, 1 day) and midbrain (134%, 1 day). The results suggest that changes in the 5-HT system are involved in the appearance of the dyskinetic syndrome which was seen in mice 1-2 days after dosing with CRN or 2-PN.
2381516	The regional distribution and cellular localization of mRNA coding for the serotonin 1C receptor were investigated in tissue sections of mouse and rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Several 32P-labelled riboprobes derived from mouse genomic clones were used. The serotonin 1C receptor binding sites were visualized autoradiographically and quantified using [3H]mesulergine as ligand, in the presence of spiperone to block serotonin 1C receptors. Strong hybridization signal was observed in the choroid plexus of all brain ventricles. High levels of hybridization were also seen in the anterior olfactory nucleus, pyriform cortex, amygdala, some thalamic nuclei, especially the lateral habenula, the CA3 area of the hippocampal formation, the cingulate cortex, some components of the basal ganglia and associated areas, particularly the nucleus subthalamicus and the substantia nigra. The midbrain and brainstem showed moderate levels of hybridization. The distribution of the serotonin 1C receptor mRNA corresponded well to that of the serotonin 1C receptors. The highest levels of serotonin 1C receptor binding were observed in the choroid plexus. In addition, significant levels of the serotonin 1C receptor binding were seen in the anterior olfactory nucleus, pyriform cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral aspects of the striatum, paratenial and paracentral thalamic nuclei, amygdaloid body and substantia nigra pars reticulata. The cingulate and retrosplenial cortices as well as the caudal aspects of the hippocampus (CA3) were also labelled. Binding in brainstem and medulla was low and homogeneously distributed. No significant binding was seen in the habenular and subthalamic nuclei. Similar findings were obtained in rat brain. These results demonstrate that, in addition to their enrichment in the choroid plexus, the serotonin 1C receptor mRNA and binding sites are heterogeneously distributed in the rodent brain and thus could be involved in the regulation of many different brain functions. The combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry with receptor autoradiography opens the possibility of examining the regulation of the serotonin 1C receptor synthesis after pharmacological or physiological alterations.
2383379	Young rats subjected to bilateral brain lesions were subsequently tested for acquisition of eight puzzle-box problems. Lesions to 12 of the 37 brain sites investigated (anterior pretectal area, subthalamus, posterolateral hypothalamus, frontocingulate cortex, anterior thalamus, mediodorsal thalamus, ventromedial thalamus, parafascicular nucleus, mamillary bodies, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and ventromedial hypothalamus) retarded puzzle-box learning. This study, combined with earlier investigation of 11 additional brain sites, show that 21 of the 48 total brain structures are involved in motor skill learning. These findings suggest that motor skill learning requires the integrity of a nonspecific mechanism and several specific mechanisms, such as vestibular-proprioceptive-kinesthetic discrimination mechanism and probably also response flexibility, visuospatial attentional, visual discrimination and place learning mechanisms.
2388090	Carboxypeptidase E (CPE), also referred to as enkephalin convertase or carboxypeptidase H (EC 3.4.17.10), is present in neurotransmitter secretory granules and can remove C-terminal basic residues following endopeptidase cleavage during peptide processing. Using in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes, we have mapped the localization of CPE mRNA in the rat brain. Specificity for CPE was confirmed by control experiments, which included production of identical patterns hybridization with 3 different antisense oligonucleotide probes, loss of label with RNase pretreatment of sections or co-incubation with excess unlabeled probe, and lack of labeling with sense orientation probes. In addition, the regional distribution of CPE mRNA by Northern blot analysis corresponded with distribution of labeling by in situ hybridization. The highest levels of CPE mRNA were found to be present in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the pituitary anterior and intermediate lobes, the ependymal cells of the lateral ventricle, the endopiriform nucleus, the basolateral amygdala, the supraoptic nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus. Intermediate levels were present in the thalamus, medial geniculate nucleus, lateral septal nucleus, piriform and entorhinal cortex, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, cerebellar cortex, pontine nuclei, and inferior olive. The lowest levels were found in the hippocampal granule cell layer, lateral hypothalamus, globus pallidus, and brain stem reticular formation. Ibotenic acid lesions of the hippocampus eliminated the majority of the label, which had been present over pyramidal cells, though labeling was increased over areas of reactive gliosis, suggesting that activated astrocytes can also synthesize CPE mRNA. In general, the localization of CPE mRNA in the rat brain corresponded to the distribution of enkephalin and other peptide neurotransmitter-synthesizing neurons, though CPE mRNA was also present in neurons that do not secrete known peptides and in reactive glia. The widespread yet specific localization of CPE mRNA in the rat brain suggests it may be an excellent marker for peptide synthesizing cells in the CNS.
2388928	Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 170 and 204 g and maintained under controlled lighting and temperature conditions were used in this experiment. One group of animals was treated with 30 mg/kg of cocaine hydrochloride and the other group with saline. Rats were decapitated 20 min after cocaine injection and their brains were removed and the different regions including the medulla, pons, midbrain, cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and the cortex were dissected. All brain regions were assayed for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. The results obtained indicated that the administration of cocaine was associated with significant increases (p less than 0.01) in AChE activity in the medulla, pons, midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, and also in the hippocampus (p less than 0.05). A significant decrease in ChAT activity was found in the pons (p less than 0.01), hypothalamus, and thalamus (p less than 0.05), while a significant increase in ChAT activity was found in the cortex (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that the changes in general activity followed by stereotypic behavior may be related to the changes in the levels of cholinergic enzymes in specific brain regions.
2411407	The distribution of substance P-immunoreactivity (SP-IR) in the brainstem and spinal cord of normal and colchicine-pretreated cats was analysed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique. Numerous SP-IR fibers are present in the nucleus solitarius, nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi and nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, various parts of the formatio reticularis, substantia grisea centralis mesencephali, locus coeruleus and nucleus parabrachialis. SP-IR perikarya occur in the substantiae gelatinosa and intermedia of the spinal cord, the nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini-pars caudalis, the nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi, and the nucleus solitarius, as well as in the adjacent formatio reticularis and the medullary nuclei of the raphe. In addition, SP-IR cell bodies are located in the nuclei raphe magnus and incertus, ventral and dorsal to the nucleus tegmentalis dorsalis (Gudden), nucleus raphe dorsalis, substantia grisea centralis mensencephali, locus coeruleus, nucleus parabrachialis and colliculus superior. The results indicate that SP-IR neurons may be involved in the regulation of cardiovascular functions both at the central and peripheral level. A peripheral afferent portion seems to terminate in the nucleus solitarius and an efferent part is postulated to originate from the nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi and from the area of the nuclei retroambiguus, ambiguus and retrofacialis.
2411584	Anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase - wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) was used to examine the effect of unilateral neonatal ablation of the sensorimotor cortex on the remaining corticofugal projections to the midbrain in the rat. In unlesioned animals, the sensorimotor cortical efferents to the midbrain were entirely ipsilateral, terminal labeling being evident in the red nucleus, the midbrain reticular formation, the periaqueductal gray, the intermediate gray layer of the superior colliculus, the nucleus parafascicularis prerubralis and the perilemniscal area. Corticorubral fibers were seen to reach the midbrain through the thalamus or the cerebral peduncle. In the red nucleus, terminal labeling was essentially restricted to the parvocellular region. In neonatally lesioned adults, aberrant corticofugal fibers crossed the midline to terminate in the contralateral red nucleus, the midbrain reticular formation, the periaqueductal gray, the nucleus parafascicularis prerubralis and the intermediate gray layer of the superior colliculus. The aberrant projections maintained the topographic specificity of the normal ipsilateral projections. This was most evident in the corticorubral projection, where the aberrant contralateral fibers terminated in the parvocellular area of the red nucleus.
2411587	Cholecystokinin (CCK)-like immunoreactive neurons have been reported to be widely distributed throughout both the neo- and allocortices. In the present study, we were interested in determining whether these cortical CCK neurons have long projections using the double-labeling technique of fluorescence retrograde tracing combined with immunofluorescence for CCK. The distribution of CCK immunoreactive perikarya and fibers was plotted throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the cerebral cortex in both untreated and colchicine-treated albino rats. In the double-labeling experiments, the animals received injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers into cortical, limbic, striatal or thalamic structures, followed one to two days later by colchicine treatment. Brains were subsequently processed for indirect immunofluorescence for CCK-octapeptide and fluorescent dye localization. It was found that 1) a small number of prefrontal cortical CCK neurons were double-labeled with both fluorescent dye and immunofluorescence for CCK after dye injection into midline thalamus, 2) only rarely were cortical CCK neurons double-labeled with injection of tracers into cortex, striatum, or other subcortical structures, 3) numerous midbrain CCK neurons were double-labeled after dye injection into prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. and 4) colchicine or cannula injection damage to cortical forebrain tracts (corpus callosum, internal capsule, external capsule, anterior commissure) resulted in the appearance of numerous CCK immunoreactive fibers not normally seen in the undamaged tracts. Although the possibility remains that cortical CCK neurons may be refractory to transport of retrograde tracers, these results suggest that CCK-like immunoreactive neurons of the rat cerebral cortex are predominantly local circuit neurons and that only minor cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical CCK-containing projections exist.
2415952	Using an antiserum generated in rabbits against synthetic galanin (GA) and the indirect immunofluorescence method, the distribution of GA-like immunoreactive cell bodies and nerve fibers was studied in the rat central nervous system (CNS) and a detailed stereotaxic atlas of GA-like neurons was prepared. GA-like immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the rat CNS. Appreciable numbers of GA-positive cell bodies were observed in the rostral cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis, the caudate, medial preoptic, preoptic periventricular, and preoptic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the medial forebrain bundle, the supraoptic, the hypothalamic periventricular, the paraventricular, the arcuate, dorsomedial, perifornical, thalamic periventricular, anterior dorsal and lateral thalamic nuclei, medial and central amygdaloid nuclei, dorsal and ventral premamillary nuclei, at the base of the hypothalamus, in the central gray matter, the hippocampus, the dorsal and caudoventral raphe nuclei, the interpeduncular nucleus, the locus coeruleus, ventral parabrachial, solitarii and commissuralis nuclei, in the A1, C1 and A4 catechaolamine areas, the posterior area postrema and the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. Fibers were generally seen where cell bodies were observed. Very dense fiber bundles were noted in the septohypothalamic tract, the preoptic area, in the hypothalamus, the habenula and the thalamic periventricular nucleus, in the ventral hippocampus, parts of the reticular formation, in the locus coeruleus, the dorsal parabrachial area, the nucleus and tract of the spinal trigeminal area and the substantia gelatinosa, the superficial layers of the spinal cord and the posterior lobe of the pituitary. The localization of the GA-like immunoreactivity in the locus coeruleus suggests a partial coexistence with catecholaminergic neurons as well as a possible involvement of the GA-like peptide in a neuroregulatory role.
2416571	Triethyltin (TET) salt intoxication provokes a myelinic vacuolisation associated with a white matter cerebral edema. The central nervous system disturbances accompanying these phenomena (Na-K-ATPase activity, neurological symptoms, water and sodium cerebral content) can be counteracted by drugs used in age-related brain failure; consequently, TET intoxication could be suggested as an experimental model for studying the aging process. The aim of the present study is to follow-up the biogenic amine concentrations in different brain areas of TET treated rats, knowing that modifications of cerebral amines exist throughout the aging process. The following results are obtained: the cerebral water content of the TET treated rats is significantly increased, confirming the existence of a brain edema. Monoamine concentrations are significantly decreased, specifically noradrenaline (in hypothalamus, mesencephalon, cerebellum); serotonin (in striatum, hypothalamus, mesencephalon); dopamine only in hypothalamus; these are accompanied by an increase of the metabolites 5 HIAA (in striatum and mesencephalon) and HVA (striatum). These modifications are compared to those occurring in physiological aging, and hypothetical mechanisms are reviewed. We conclude that TET intoxication must not be considered as a pathophysiological model of brain aging, but may be considered as a useful pharmacological tool for studying experimental drugs liable to counteract brain age-induced disturbances.
2418858	Case S.S. 59 years of age, male. At the age of 25, he had admitted to sanatorium for 7 years because of pulmonary tuberculosis. After his discharge, at the age of 45, he had started complaining of depressive mood or the idea of suicide and admitted to a mental hospital. Psychiatric diagnosis was depression and slight mental retardation. Shortly after, his depressive mood was improved, but his hypochondriac attitude was unchanged. No tendency toward dementia was proven. At the age of 54, he became enable to walk. Neurologically, pyramidal and some sort of extrapyramidal signs, dysarthria, disturbance of swallowing, fecal and urinary incontinence became apparent. Laboratory data showed scarcely any abnormality. At the age of 59, he died of bronchopneumonia. Neuropathologically, moderate degeneration of dentate nucleus, slight degeneration of pyramidal tract from medulla oblongata to spinal cord, striatum, substantia nigra were found. Neither senile plaques nor neurofibrillary changes could be seen throughout central nervous system. The most important finding is the presence of peculiar acidophilic bodies. They are round or oval, 10 approximately 20 mu in diameter and distributed in dentate nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, central grey of midbrain, superior colliculus, putamen, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, Zona incerta, hypothalamus, Locus coeruleus, reticular formation of midbrain and pons, pontine nucleus, raphe nucleus, vestibular nucleus, inferior olive in order of number of the bodies. These bodies are scattered in so-called ground substance, and have no relations to any cell bodies or cell processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2419370	The intranuclear organization of divergently projecting neurons of the midbrain raphe in the rat was studied by using double retrograde axonal tracing. Paired injections of the tracers N-[acetyl-3H] WGA and horseradish peroxidase were made within known projection targets of the midbrain raphe (caudate-putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and locus coeruleus). After injections of either tracer in the aforementioned targets, retrograde labeled neurons were found mainly ipsilaterally and within midline portions of the dorsal raphe nucleus, its caudal B6 portion, and within the linear and superior central nuclei of the median raphe complex. There are discrete intranuclear distributions of raphe neurons that project to these forebrain and brainstem sites, and there is an overall rostrocaudal topographic order within the raphe with neurons projecting to the neostriatum, amygdala, and substantia nigra residing most rostrally and neurons projecting to the hippocampus and/or locus coeruleus occupying caudal portions of the B6 and superior central nuclei. Such distributions of projection neurons suggest the existence of an "encephalotopic" intranuclear organization within the raphe; that is, each central nervous system structure that receives midbrain raphe projections has its own unique representation within a topographically distinct portion of one or more of the raphe subgroups. These findings suggest an overall functional organization within the midbrain raphe nuclear complex whereby rostral portions are associated with the basal ganglia and related nuclei, and caudal portions relate to the limbic system. An intermediate representation of amygdala-projecting raphe neurons functionally conjoins the two. Collateralized neurons are found within complex zones of overlap in the topographically organized distributions of raphe neurons projecting to functionally related structures.
2422224	The afferent-efferent connections of the pigeon dorsomedial forebrain, which is composed of the "hippocampus" (Hp) and "parahippocampus" (APH), presumed homologues of the mammalian hippocampal complex, were studied. Afferent projections were identified by wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and efferent projections were identified by 3H-proline and WGA-HRP. In addition to identified intrinsic connections within Hp and APH, both Hp and APH were found to be in receipt of ipsilateral forebrain afferents from each other, the hyperstriatum accessorium, nucleus of the diagonal band, nucleus taeniae, and area corticoidea dorsolateralis. Only Hp received input from the contralateral Hp while only APH received input from the ipsilateral hyperstriatum dorsale and archistriatum, pars ventralis. Both Hp and APH received ipsilateral diencephalic afferents from the nucleus mamillaris lateralis, stratum cellulare internum, nucleus lateralis hypothalami, and nucleus paramedianus internus thalami. Only APH received bilateral input from the nucleus superficialis parvicellularis (this nucleus may send a small projection to Hp) and nucleus dorsolateralis anterior thalami, pars medialis, and an ipsilateral projection from the nucleus subrotundus. Brainstem afferents to Hp and APH included ipsilateral projections from the area ventralis (Tsai) nucleus reticularis pontis oralis, nucleus raphes, nucleus subceruleus dorsalis, and nucleus centralis superior of Bechterew, and bilateral projections from the nucleus linearis caudalis and locus ceruleus, of which the nucleus subceruleus dorsalis, nucleus centralis superior of Bechterew, and locus ceruleus projected to APH only. Forebrain efferents from both Hp and APH were found to project ipsilaterally to the septum, the area of the fasciculus diagonalis Brocae, nucleus taeniae, and area corticoidea dorsolateralis. Only Hp appeared to send efferents to the contralateral septum and Hp, while only APH sent efferents to the hyperstriatum dorsale and the archistriatum. A hypothalamic projection from Hp and APH was found to partially terminate near the nucleus mamillaris lateralis. At the level of pathway connections, the results demonstrate a striking similarity between the avian dorsomedial forebrain and the dorsomedial cortex of reptiles and the mammalian hippocampus.
2423564	Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and amino acid autoradiography were used in pigeon to determine the trajectories and projection patterns of neurons within the locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus nuclei upon the cerebral hemispheres. The specific cell groups investigated include the locus coeruleus (LoC), nucleus subcoeruleus dorsalis, and nucleus subcoeruleus ventralis. Efferents from each of these nuclei ascend to the telencephalon via the medial and lateral forebrain bundles, ansa lenticularis, and the quintofrontal and occipitomesencephalic tracts. A separate dorsally situated bundle derived from LoC neurons reaches many dorsal thalamic nuclei. The telencephalic projections of the LoC and subcoeruleus nuclei are bilateral and symmetrical, although projections to the contralateral hemisphere are sparse. Crossing fibers project to contralateral targets primarily via the dorsal supraoptic decussation and along the dorsal and ventral margins of the anterior commissure. Within the telencephalon, the following neural structures receive input from neurons in the LoC and subcoeruleus cell groups: the paleostriatal complex including the paleostriatum augmentatum and lobus parolfactorius, septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus and parahippocampal area, nucleus taeniae, dorsal archistriatum, lateral neostriatum, hyperstriatum dorsale, hyperstriatum ventrale, and preoptic area. Large portions of the cerebral hemispheres including the hyperstriatum accessorium, much of the neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale, and all but the dorsal portion of the archistriatum receive little or no input from either the locus coeruleus or subcoeruleus cell groups. This is apparently different from the condition in mammals in which virtually all cortical fields receive input from neurons within the LoC. Moreover, the pattern of projections of the subcoeruleus nuclei upon telencephalic fields described here as well as recent histochemical data suggest that these cell groups are comparable to the lateral tegmental (A8) cell group of mammals rather than to the mammalian subcoeruleus nuclei.
2423918	The normal morphology, efferent projections and possible neurotransmitter content of neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (caudal magnocellular nuclei of Bleier et al.) [Bleier, Cohn and Siggelkow (1979) In Anatomy of the Hypothalamus, Vol. 1, pp. 137-220] have been examined in the adult male rat. In Nissl-stained sections, the nucleus can be divided into a dorsomedial, ventral and diffuse part, each of which consists of large, darkly stained neurons cradling the mammillary body. The ventral part is by far the largest and consists of some 2500 neurons on each side of the brain. Immunohistochemical studies indicate that a majority of the large neurons in all three parts of the nucleus stain with antisera against glutamate decarboxylase and [Met]enkephalyl-Arg6-Phe7 heptapeptide and that a smaller subset of these neurons (about 10%) also stain with an antiserum against substance P. Single injections of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were made into 18 different sites in 86 animals and the results indicate that all three parts of the tuberomammillary nucleus on one side of the brain send fibers to or through various parts of the neocortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, superior colliculus and cerebellum on both sides of the brain and that the projection neurons are not organized in a highly topographic way. Injections of two different fluorescent tracers in the same animal indicate that individual neurons in the nucleus may give rise to both ascending and descending projections, as well as projections to widely divergent parts of the forebrain. Together with previous results, this evidence suggests that the tuberomammillary nucleus has widespread projections to the numerous brain structure located in the forebrain and in the caudal medulla (it may not project to the spinal cord), and that its axons may release a mixture of neuroactive substances including gamma-amino butyrate and several peptides. Although its functional significance remains to be investigated, morphological evidence suggests that the tuberomammillary nucleus may constitute one of a series of neurotransmitter-specific cell groups in the brainstem and basal forebrain with diffuse efferent projections that may be involved in the modulation of attention or behavioral state, rather than the processing of specific sensory or motor information.
2424946	We examined the afferent projections to the subnuclei of the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the rat by means of retrograde and anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). We observed locations of retrogradely labeled cells following injections of WGA-HRP into the IPN, and distributions of anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals within the IPN following injections into the areas that contain cells of origin of afferents. Results of the retrograde and anterograde experiments have clarified the detailed organization of the IPN afferents. A part of the nucleus incertus, located dorsomedial to the dorsal tegmental nucleus, projects to the contralateral half of the rostral subnucleus of the IPN; the pars caudalis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus projects sparsely to the rostral lateral, dorsal lateral, lateral, caudal, and apical subnuclei predominantly contralaterally; the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, to most of the subnuclei predominantly contralaterally; the ventromedial central gray rostral to the dorsal tegmental nucleus and lateral to the dorsal raphe nucleus projects to the rostral lateral and dorsal lateral subnuclei predominantly contralaterally; the median raphe nucleus, substantially to all subnuclei; the medial habenular nucleus, in a topographic manner, to the rostral, central, and intermediate subnuclei, to the rostral lateral and lateral subnuclei predominantly ipsilaterally, and to the dorsal lateral subnucleus predominantly contralaterally; the supramammillary nucleus and areas around the origin of the mammillothalamic tract and near the third ventricle project sparsely to the ventral part of the rostral subnucleus and to the central, lateral, caudal and apical subnuclei; the nucleus of the diagonal band, sparsely to the rostral, central, dorsal lateral, caudal, and apical subnuclei. These differential projections of the afferents to the subnuclei of the IPN may reflect its complex functions within the limbic midbrain circuit.
2424949	The localization of galanin (GAL) immunoreactive (IR) neuronal structures in the rat central nervous system has been investigated by using the indirect immunofluorescence technique. GAL-IR structures were seen in high concentrations in the hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Less extensive systems were detected in the telencephalon, thalamus, mesencephalon, and pons, while virtually no GAL-positive structures were seen in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum. Major populations of cell bodies staining for GAL-like material were seen in many areas. In the telencephalon somata were revealed in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, in the nucleus of the diagonal band, medial septum, and in the medial aspects of the central amygdaloid nucleus, and in small numbers in cortical areas. The anterodorsal and periventricular nuclei of the thalamus contained positive cell bodies. In the hypothalamus GAL-IR somata were seen in the medial and lateral preoptic nuclei, arcuate nucleus, periventricular nucleus, in the dorsomedial nucleus, in the medial forebrain bundle area, in the tubular, caudal, accessory, supraoptic, and paraventricular magnocellular nuclei and lateral to the mammillary recess. The dorsal raphe nucleus hosted a large number of GAL-positive somata. Locus coeruleus of the pons contained a large number of GAL-IR perikarya. In the medulla oblongata positive somata were found in the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and in the ventral lateral area just rostral to area postrema. Small cell bodies were detected in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at all levels and in lamina X at lumbar levels. Analysis of GAL-positive fibers in the telencephalon revealed highly or medium-dense networks in the lateral septal nucleus, in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and in the central and medial amygdaloid nuclei. Positive fibers were found in the thalamus in and around the periventricular nucleus as well as in the lateral habenular nucleus and extending in a lateral, caudal direction from the third ventricle and fasciculus retroflexus to the lateral tip of the medial lemniscus. In the hypothalamus the external layer of the median eminence contained a very dense fiber network. Dense or medium-dense GAL-IR networks were detected in the periventricular nucleus, throughout the medial and lateral preoptic areas, in the medial forebrain bundle area, in the dorsomedial nucleus, and lateral to the mammillary recess. In the pons GAL-IR fibers were seen in the parabrachial nuclei, dorsal to the superior olive, and in the periaqueductal central gray.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2425289	A two-color fluorescence method is described for demonstrating immunohistochemically the anterogradely transported plant lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL, fluorescein isothiocyanate label) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, rhodamine label) on the same rat brain section. Application of this method to the study of projection neurons in the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, the substantia innominata and nucleus basalis revealed that both cholinergic and non-cholinergic pathways followed similar trajectories to their targets. These included: projections from the vertical, and, to a lesser extent, horizontal limb of the diagonal band coursing through the dorsal fornix, alveus and fimbria to the hippocampus; fibers from the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band traveling anteriorly to the anterior olfactory nucleus, posterolaterally to the entorhinal cortex, and anterodorsally into the cingulum to the cingulate and retrosplenial, and, in some cases, the frontal and occipital cortices; projections, mostly non-cholinergic, from the substantia innominata traveling laterally to the piriform cortex and amygdala, and anteriorly to the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory bulb; and fibers from cells in the nucleus basalis coursing dorsally to the frontal and parietal cortices or laterally to the basolateral amygdala and piriform, insular and temporal cortices. Some axon terminations ended at right angles to the parent axon shaft in short protuberances resembling terminal boutons.
2426591	We examined histologically and biochemically the brains of two patients with generalized childhood-onset dystonia musculorum deformans. We found no important histologic changes in the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, higher brain-stem nuclei, locus ceruleus, or raphe nuclei. Similarly, the activity of choline acetyltransferase and the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamic acid in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia were within the control range. In contrast, the norepinephrine concentrations were markedly and consistently decreased in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus, mamillary body, subthalamic nucleus, and locus ceruleus. The serotonin level was subnormal in the dorsal raphe nucleus, as was the dopamine level in the nucleus accumbens and, in one of the two cases, in the striatum. Elevated concentrations of norepinephrine were found in the septum, thalamus, colliculi, red nucleus, and dorsal raphe nucleus; of serotonin, in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and locus ceruleus; and of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and nuclei raphe centralis inferior and obscurus. The level of homovanillic acid showed little consistent change in the regions examined. We conclude that some of these monoamine changes, especially the pronounced apparent disturbance of noradrenergic brain mechanisms, may represent a basic neurochemical abnormality in dystonia musculorum deformans and may thus be relevant to the pathoneurophysiology and treatment of this disorder.
2428439	Using cobalt-enhanced immunohistochemistry, the tracing of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and experimental manipulations, a widespread localization of corticotropin-releasing factor-like immunoreactive (CRFI) structures in the rat amygdaloid complex, and CRFI-containing pathways from the amygdala to the lower brainstem, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bst) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) have been demonstrated. By means of cobalt-enhanced immunohistochemistry, CRFI cells were detected in almost all the regions of the amygdala, including the central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (B1), intra-amygdaloid bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Abst), medial amygdaloid nucleus (Me), amygdalohippocampal area (Ahi), posterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus (Aco), lateral amygdaloid nucleus (La), anterior amygdaloid area (AAA) and basomedial amygdaloid nucleus (Bm). Neural processes with CRFI were found in all of the above areas. The greatest density of CRFI fibres was observed in the Ce, the Me and Ahi. Unilateral lesions located in the Ce and adjacent areas caused an ipsilateral decrease in CRFI fibre number in the lateral hypothalamic area (LH), mesencephalic reticular formation (RF), dorsal (Dpb) and ventral (Vpb) parabrachial nuclei, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (MeV) and in the lateral division of the bst (bstl). In addition, ipsilateral CRFI fibres decreased in number in the core and shell of the VMH after unilateral lesions of the corticomedial amygdala (CoM) and ventral subiculum (S). These findings suggest that the CRFI cells in the Ce and adjacent areas innervate the Dpb, Vpb and MeV through the LH and RF; the CRFI fibres in the bstl are supplied by the Ce and adjacent areas; and the CoM and S give rise to the CRFI fibres to the VMH. The distribution of retrogradely transported HRP has confirmed these projections. Furthermore, combined HRP and immunohistochemical staining has demonstrated double labeled cells in the Ce following HRP injection into the Dpb, Vpb, MeV and bstl. This provides direct evidence for the amygdalofugal CRF-containing projections to the lower brainstem and bstl. Double-labeled cells were not seen in the CoM and S after HRP injection into the VMH.
2428777	The high sensitivity of the magnesium-dithizonate silver-dithizonate (MDSD) staining procedure makes this method very suitable for the histochemical localization of copper in different regions of the central nervous system of adult rats. In the telencephalon (bulbus olfactorius, nucleus caudatus-putamen, septum pellucidum and area dentata), diencephalon (nucleus habenulae medialis, nuclei of the hypothalamus in the vicinity of the third ventricle, and corpus mamillare), mesencephalon (substantia nigra), cerebellum (mainly in the nodulus), pons (locus coeruleus, nucleus vestibularis), medulla oblongata (nucleus tractus solitarii) and spinal cord, the glial cells exhibit specific copper staining. The glial cells of some circumventricular organs (e.g. the subfornical organ) are also stained using the MDSD method. The significant staining observed in white-matter glial cells (e.g. in the corpus callosum, cerebellum and spinal cord) further indicates the very high sensitivity of this method. In glial cells of the same regions, the presence of copper can likewise be demonstrated using the modified sulphide silver method. On the basis of the present histochemical results, it is suggested that copper may play an important role in the normal physiological functioning of glial cells and also, via glial-neuron interactions, in neuronal processes.
2429232	The distribution of substance P-like and [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies, fibers and terminal structures in the brain stem and spinal cord of a lizard, Varanus exanthematicus, was studied with the indirect immunofluorescence technique, using antibodies to these peptides. Substance P-like immunoreactive cell bodies were found in the hypothalamus, in a periventricular cell group in the rostral mesencephalon, in the interpeduncular nucleus, in and ventral to the descending nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, in and directly ventral to the nucleus of the solitary tract, scattered in the brain stem reticular formation and in the trigeminal and spinal ganglia. A rather widespread distribution of substance P-like immunoreactivity was found in the brain stem and spinal cord, mainly concentrated in striatotegmental projections related to visceral and/or taste information (nucleus of the solitary tract, parabrachial region), in the descending nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (areas I and II). In the spinal cord also around the central canal (area X and adjacent parts of area V-VI) a distinct substance P innervation was found. The ventral horn receives only a very sparse substance P innervation. The distribution of [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin in the brain stem and spinal cord of Varanus exanthematicus is less impressive than that of substance P. Enkephalinergic cell bodies were found particularly in the caudal hypothalamus. Small populations of enkephalinergic cell bodies were found in the vestibular nuclear complex, in the nucleus of the solitary tract, in and around the descending nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and throughout the rhombencephalic reticular formation. Enkephalins are likely to be present in efferent projections of the striatum, in projections related to taste and/or visceral information (nucleus of the solitary tract, parabrachial region) and in descending pathways to the spinal cord. Enkephalinergic fibers are present in the lateral funiculus and enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies are found in the reticular formation, particularly the inferior reticular nucleus which is known to project to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord enkephalinergic terminal structures were found especially in the superficial layer of the dorsal horn (areas I and II) and around the central canal. The ventral horn including the motoneuron area receives only a relatively sparse enkephalinergic innervation.
2431009	The organization of subcortical inputs to the parahippocampal cortex, which in the present study in the cat is considered to comprise the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, was studied by using retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques. The results of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP), HRP conjugated with wheat germ agglutinine (WGA-HRP), Fast Blue (FB) or Nuclear Yellow (NY] injections indicate that the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices receive inputs from the magnocellular basal forebrain and from distinct portions of the amygdaloid complex, the claustrum, and the thalamus. The two cortices are further projected upon by fibers from the supramamillary region of the hypothalamus, the ventral tegmental area of the mesencephalon, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the nucleus centralis superior, and the locus coeruleus. The entorhinal cortex, in addition, receives projections from the medial septum. As regards the projections from the amygdaloid complex, it was observed that the entorhinal cortex receives its heaviest input from the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, whereas the perirhinal cortex receives a strong projection from the lateral nucleus and a weaker projection from the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala. Of the thalamic nuclei that project to the parahippocampal cortex, the nucleus reuniens is only connected with the entorhinal cortex, while fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus and the lateral posterior nucleus terminate in the perirhinal cortex. Injections of tritiated amino acid (3H-leucine) were placed in the medial septum, the dorsal and ventral claustrum, the basolateral and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei, and the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus. The results of these experiments demonstrate that, with the exception of the claustrum, these subcortical areas project mainly to the superficial layers I-III and the lamina dissecans of the parahippocampal cortex, and to a lesser degree to the deep layers V and VI.
2432101	The ascending projections of cholinergic neurons in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (TLD) were investigated in the rat by using Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) anterograde tracing techniques. Two ascending pathways were identified after iontophoretic injections of PHA-L into the TLD. A long projection system courses through the dorsomedial tegmentum, caudal diencephalon, medial forebrain bundle, and diagonal band. Different branches of this system innervate the midbrain (superior colliculus, interstitial magnocellular nucleus of the posterior commissure, and anterior pretectal nucleus), the diencephalon (lateral habenular nucleus, parafascicular, anteroventral, anterodorsal, mediodorsal, and intralaminar thalamic nuclei), and the telencephalon (lateral septum and medial prefrontal cortex). The second system is shorter and more diffuse and innervates the median raphe, interpeduncular, and lateral mammillary nuclei. Retrograde tracing with WGA-HRP, combined with choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry, revealed that most of the TLD projections to the tectum, pretectum, thalamus, lateral septum, and medial prefrontal cortex are cholinergic. Afferents to the TLD were studied by anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Injection of tracers into the TLD retrogradely labelled neurons bilaterally in the midbrain reticular formation, the periaqueductal gray, the medial preoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the perifornical and lateral hypothalamic areas. Retrogradely labelled cells were also located bilaterally in the premammillary nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, zona incerta, and lateral habenular nucleus. In the telencephalon, the nucleus of the diagonal band and the medial prefrontal cortex contained retrogradely labelled neurons ipsilateral to the TLD injection site. The projections of the medial prefrontal cortex, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the lateral habenular nucleus to the TLD were confirmed in anterograde tracing studies. These findings indicate that the TLD gives rise to several ascending cholinergic projections that innervate diverse regions of the forebrain. Afferents to the TLD arise in hypothalamic and limbic forebrain regions, some of which appear to have reciprocal connections with the TLD. The latter include the lateral habenular nucleus and medial prefrontal cortex.
2436195	Galanin (GAL) binding sites in coronal sections of the rat brain were demonstrated using autoradiographic methods. Scatchard analysis of 125I-GAL binding to slide-mounted tissue sections revealed saturable binding to a single class of receptors with a Kd of approximately 0.2 nM. 125I-GAL binding sites were demonstrated throughout the rat central nervous system. Dense binding was observed in the following areas: prefrontal cortex, the anterior nuclei of the olfactory bulb, several nuclei of the amygdaloid complex, the dorsal septal area, dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventral pallidum, the internal medullary laminae of the thalamus, medial pretectal nucleus, nucleus of the medial optic tract, borderline area of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus adjacent to the spinal trigeminal tract, the substantia gelatinosa and the superficial layers of the dorsal spinal cord. Moderate binding was observed in the piriform, periamygdaloid, entorhinal, insular cortex and the subiculum, the nucleus accumbens, medial forebrain bundle, anterior hypothalamic, ventromedial, dorsal premamillary, lateral and periventricular thalamic nuclei, the subzona incerta, Forel's field H1 and H2, periventricular gray matter, medial and superficial gray strata of the superior colliculus, dorsal parts of the central gray, peripeduncular area, the interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra zona compacta, ventral tegmental area, the dorsal and ventral parabrachial and parvocellular reticular nuclei. The preponderance of GAL-binding in somatosensory as well as in limbic areas suggests a possible involvement of GAL in a variety of brain functions.
2439552	Efferent projections of rat subthalamic nucleus were studied by use of the axonal transport of phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), and the results were analyzed with light and electron microscopes. PHA-L injections in the subthalamic nucleus (STH) resulted in heavy labeling of fiber plexus with en passant boutons and terminals in the pallidal complex, i.e., the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), the globus pallidus (GP) and the ventral pallidum (VP), and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR). Labeling in GP was characterized by two distinct bands of labeled terminals oriented dorsoventrally, whereas labeling in SNR was patchy. STH efferents to the pallidum and SNR displayed a mediolateral topographic organization. With regard to dorsoventral organization, projections to GP were inverted, but those to SNR were not. There were moderate projections to the neostriatum and sparse projections to the frontal cortex, substantia innominata, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, ventral part of the central gray matter including the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation. PHA-L injections in the zona incerta and the lateral hypothalamic area resulted in fiber and terminal labelings in many structures, including the basal forebrain, EP, SNC, and other brainstem areas that overlap with some of the terminal sites of STH projections. Ultrastructural observations of PHA-L labeled processes in GP and SNR revealed that STH terminals in both structures contained small pleomorphic vesicles and formed asymmetrical contacts. These contacts were mainly on dendritic shafts, but some were on somata. It also was observed that the myelinated axons of STH neurons lost their myelin after reaching their target areas and the synaptic boutons arose from relatively thin unmyelinated axons.
2439943	The afferent connections of the nuclei reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis were studied experimentally in the rat by the aid of either free horseradish peroxidase or horseradish peroxidase conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin used as retrograde tracers. The results suggest that the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis receives its main input from the zona incerta and field H1 of Forel, the superior colliculus, the central gray substance, and the mesencephalic and magnocellular pontomedullary districts of the reticular formation. Many other structures seem to represent modest additional sources of projections to the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis; these structures include numerous cortical territories, the nucleus basalis, the central amygdaloid nucleus, hypothalamic districts, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the substantia nigra, the cuneiform, the accessory oculomotor and the deep cerebellar nuclei, trigeminal, parabrachial and vestibular sensory cell groups, the nuclei raphe dorsalis and magnus, the locus coeruleus, the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus, and the spinal cord. While the afferentation of the rostral portion of the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis appears to conform to the general pattern outlined above, some deviations from that pattern emerge when the innervation of the caudal district of the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis is considered; the most striking of these differences is the fact that both spinal and cerebellar inputs seem to distribute much more heavily to the referred caudal district than to the remaining magnocellular pontine reticular formation. The present results may contribute to the elucidation of the anatomical substrate of the functionally demonstrated involvement of the nuclei reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis in several domains that include the regulation of the sleep-waking cycle and cortical arousal, somatic motor mechanisms and nociceptive behavior.
2445443	Transcannular microinjections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) in adult cats to determine the origin of the principal sources of inputs to this important preoculomotor center for the production of saccadic eye movements. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed in numerous oculomotor-related structures, including the prerubral field (rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus), nucleus of Darkschewitsch, nucleus of the posterior commissure, deep superior colliculus, supraoculomotor ventral periaqueductal gray, contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation, pontine raphe and dorsal medial pontine tegmentum medial to the abducens nucleus (purported to contain omnipause neurons), cell group Y, and the perihypoglossal complex (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi). Other sources of afferents to the region included the zona incerta, lateral and medial habenular nuclei, medial hypothalamus, medial mammillary nucleus, nucleus cuneiformis, medial medullary reticular formation, and the medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei. The results are discussed in terms of the potential influence of these nuclei on the control of eye movement.
2449477	Brainstem afferents to the magnocellular basal forebrain were studied by using tract tracing, immunohistochemistry and extracellular recordings in the rat. WGA-HRP injections into the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and the magnocellular preoptic area (MgPA) retrogradely labelled many neurons in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area. Areas with moderate numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons included the median raphe nucleus, and area lateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the pons, the locus ceruleus, and the medial parabrachial nucleus. A few labelled neurons were seen in the substantia nigra pars compacta, mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation, a midline area in the pontine central gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, raphe magnus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and ventrolateral medulla. A similar but not identical distribution of labelled neurons was seen following WGA-HRP injections into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. The possible neurotransmitter content of some of these afferents to the HDB/MgPA was examined by combining retrograde Fluoro-Gold labelling and immunofluorescence. In the mesopontine tegmentum, many retrogradely labelled neurons were immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase. In the dorsal raphe nucleus, some retrogradely labelled neurons were positive for serotonin and some for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH); however, the majority of retrogradely labelled neurons in this region were not immunoreactive for either marker. The ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and locus ceruleus contained retrogradely labelled neurons which were also immunoreactive for TH. Of the retrogradely labelled neurons occasionally observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and ventrolateral medulla, some were immunoreactive for either TH or phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase. To characterize functionally some of these brainstem afferents, extracellular recordings were made from antidromically identified cortically projecting neurons, mostly located in the HDB and MgPA. In agreement with most previous studies, about half (48%) of these neurons were spontaneously active. Electrical stimulation in the vicinity of the pedunculopontine tegmental and dorsal raphe nuclei elicited either excitatory or inhibitory responses in 21% (13/62) of the cortically projecting neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2451686	The neuronal connections of the cerebellar corpus in the guitarfish Platyrhinoidis triseriata were investigated by WGA-HRP injections and extracellular recording of sensory evoked electrical activity. Injections of WGA-HRP into the corpus resulted in retrograde labeling of the following cell groups bilaterally: pretectal and accessory optic nuclei, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, nucleus ruber, oculomotor and possibly trochlear nucleus, central (periaqueductal) gray, nucleus H, reticular formation of the midbrain, cerebellar nucleus, caudal part of nucleus F, tentatively locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus field, octaval and trigeminal nuclei, intermediate octavolateralis nucleus, medial inferior reticular formation, lateral reticular nucleus, and spinal cord. Unilaterally labeled cells were seen in the contralateral inferior olive, which was found to project in sagittal zones onto the molecular layer of the corpus. Terminal fields of efferent Purkinje cell axons were labeled over the ipsilateral cerebellar nucleus exclusively. Purkinje cells in different parts of the corpus project topographically onto subdivisions of the nucleus. Mapping of evoked electrical multiple unit activity recorded from the granule cell layer of the corpus shows separate visual and tactile areas, mostly confined to the anterior and posterior lobes, respectively. Granule cells within the tactile area also responded to lateral line stimuli and, at two distinct medial locations in the caudal and rostral parts of the posterior lobe, to weak electric field stimulation in the bath. The body surface is somatotopically represented in the tactile area, but discontinuities in the map might indicate that the somatotopy is "fractured".
2454970	Anterograde tracers (tritiated leucine, proline, fucose; WGA-HRP) were injected into sites within the frontal eye fields (FEF) of nine macaque monkeys. Low thresholds (less than or equal to 50 microA) for electrically evoking saccadic eye movements were used to locate injection sites in four monkeys. Cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at the injection site. Dorsomedial prearcuate injection sites where large saccades were elicited were classified as lFEF cases, whereas ventrolateral prearcuate sites where small saccades were evoked were designated sFEF cases. One control case was injected in the medial postarcuate area 6. We found five descending fiber bundles from FEF; fibers to the striatum, which enter the caudate nucleus at or just rostral to the genu of the internal capsule; fibers to the claustrum, which travel in the external capsule; and transthalamic, subthalamic, and pedunculopontine fibers. Our results indicate that transthalamic and subthalamic pathways supply all terminal sites in the thalamus, subthalamus, and tegmentum of the midbrain and pons, whereas pedunculopontine fibers appear to terminate in the pontine and reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus exclusively. Frontal eye field terminal fields in the striatum were topographically organized: lFEF projections terminated dorsal and rostral to sFEF projections. Thus, lFEF terminal fields were located centrally in the head and body of the caudate nucleus and a small dorsomedial portion of the putamen, whereas sFEF terminal fields were located in ventrolateral parts of the caudate body and ventromedial parts of the putamen. In the claustrum, lFEF projections terminated dorsal and rostral to sFEF projections. Projections from FEF terminated in ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus without a clear topography. By comparison, terminal fields from medial postarcuate area 6 were located more caudally and laterally in the striatum and claustrum than projections from FEF, and more centrally in the subthalamic nucleus. In the thalamus, FEF terminal patches in some thalamic nuclei were also topographically organized. Projections from lFEF terminated in dorsal area X, dorsolateral medial dorsal nucleus, pars parvicellularis (MDpc), and the caudal pole of MDpc, whereas projections from sFEF terminated in ventral area X, medial dorsal nucleus, pars multiformis, and caudal medial dorsal nucleus pars densocellularis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2455773	The concentrations of catecholamine and indoleamine metabolites were measured in intact and adrenalectomized mice to determine whether adrenal hormones mediate or modulate the stress-induced responses. Thirty minutes of footshock resulted in significant increases of the ratios of the dopamine (DA) catabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), to DA in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem, and of homovanillic (HVA)/DA ratios in nucleus accumbens, striatum, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Ratios of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol to norepinephrine (NE) were also increased in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, septum, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and brainstem. The concentration of NE was decreased in amygdala. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) ratios and free tryptophan were also increased in every brain region. Very similar data were obtained from mice restrained for 30 min. Adrenalectomy resulted in increased HVA/DA ratios in prefrontal cortex and striatum, and 5-HIAA/5-HT in septum. The stress-related changes were largely similar in adrenalectomized mice. Significant interactions between adrenalectomy and footshock treatment occurred in prefrontal cortical DOPAC/DA and hypothalamic NE which was depleted only in adrenalectomized mice, suggesting tendencies for these measures to be more responsive in adrenalectomized mice. Corticosterone administration (0.5-2.0 mg/kg s.c.) which resulted in plasma concentrations in the physiological range did not alter the concentrations of the cerebral metabolites measured in any region. We conclude that adrenal hormones do not mediate cerebral catecholamine or indoleamine metabolism in stress, although adrenalectomy may affect HVA and 5-HIAA metabolism, and there was a tendency for catecholamines to be more sensitive to stress in adrenalectomized animals.
2457050	The connections of the superior colliculus (SC) of the ground squirrel Spermophilus tridecemlineatus were studied with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method. Multiple pressure injections of HRP served to define the total pattern of SC projections while iontophoretic injections allowed differentiation of connections of the deep and superficial layers and determination of topographic relations of SC with its associated nuclei. The deep laminae were mainly connected with auditory, somatosensory and reticular regions of the brain, including the inferior colliculus, zona incerta, substantia nigra, mesencephalic central grey, pontine nuclei, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, thalamic reticular nucleus, raphe nuclei, lateral vestibular nucleus, the lateral superficial reticular formation of the medulla, the mesencephalic reticular formation, nucleus gracilis and the cervical spinal cord. The superficial laminae were connected with visual system structures. They were reciprocally connected with the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei, the pretectum, nucleus lateralis posterior (LP), the parabigeminal nucleus and the contralateral SC. Connections between the SC and the dorsal lateral geniculate were topologic. LP was found to consist of three divisions: rostrolateral, rostromedial and caudal. SC was interconnected with the rostrolateral and caudal divisions. The connections between the SC and the rostrolateral division were topologic; those with the caudal division were not. The connections of the deep collicular layers in ground squirrels were similar to those which have been reported for cats and monkeys. The connections of the superficial laminae were more extensive than has been reported in other species. These elaborate interconnections indicate extensive interaction between primary retinal projection nuclei in the processing of visual information.
2458546	Trimethyltin is a neurotoxicant which produces a distinct pattern of neuronal cell death following peripheral administration of a single dose (8 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. The cupric-silver degeneration stain was used to produce an atlas documenting the distribution and time course of trimethyltin-induced neuronal damage in adult, male Long-Evans rats. Animals were examined at survival times of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 18 days after intoxication. The earliest degeneration was observed at day 1 in the intermediate and ventral divisions of the lateral septal nucleus, followed by development of degeneration on days 2-4 in neuron populations including the septohippocampal nucleus, septohypothalamic nucleus, anterior olfactory nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, endopiriform nucleus, parafascicular nucleus, superior colliculus, interstitial nucleus of the posterior commissure, inferior colliculus, pontine nuclei, raphe nuclei, pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, the caudal aspect of nucleus tractus solitarius, dorsal vagal motor nucleus, granule cells in the dentate gyrus, pyramidal cells in CA fields of the hippocampus, and of neurons in the subiculum, pyriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and neocortex (mainly layer Vb and VI). This was followed by degenerative changes on days 5-7 in other structures, including the amygdaloid nuclei, the ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial thalamic nuclei and the periaqueductal gray. The distribution of terminal degeneration from these neurons indicate that specific pools of cells are affected in each structure, and the time course suggests somatofugal degeneration. The trimethyltin damage was also assessed with immunocytochemical visualization of a neuronotypic protein, protein-O-carboxyl methyltransferase and a radioimmunoassay for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Protein-O-carboxyl methyltransferase immunoreactivity was altered in neuronal populations damaged by trimethyltin, but did not appear to be either as sensitive or selective an assay of neuronal damage as the silver stain, especially at short survival times. Glial fibrillary acidic proteins were dramatically elevated 21 days after trimethyltin intoxication, particularly in areas of extensive damage. These studies revealed advantages and problems encountered in the use of each technique in assessing neurotoxic effects, forming a basis for discussion of the relative merits of using a battery of specific molecular probes for neurotoxicity evaluations.
2460196	Atriopeptin (AP) is a peptide hormone synthesized and secreted by the atria of the heart that participates in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. AP-like materials have been detected immunologically in neurons in the central nervous system of the rat. In this study, we have used a solution hybridization-nuclease protection assay to determine whether the brain of the rat contains RNA coding preproatriopeptin, the atrial biosynthetic precursor of AP, and to study the regional distribution of preproatriopeptin mRNA in the brain. We have found that the brain contains mRNA identical to the atrial messenger RNA for preproatriopeptin. AP mRNA is differentially distributed in the brain; the highest concentration was found in the hypothalamus, followed by the cortex and septum, hippocampus, midbrain, spinal cord, olfactory bulb, striatum, and pons and medulla. Very low levels were found in the cerebellum, while no detectable AP mRNA was observed in retina, anterior pituitary, or rat liver. The presence of AP mRNA in the brain demonstrates that neurons have the capacity to synthesize preproatriopeptin identical to that produced in the heart. Bioactive peptides produced from this precursor may be endogenous central neuromodulators as well as a circulating hormone.
2461393	The embryonic development of substance P (SP) in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice has been studied with the use of peroxidase antiperoxidase (PAP) immunocytochemistry. Immature SP-positive cells initially appear at embryonic day 12 (E12) in the epithalamus and in a column of cells extending from the myelencephalon throughout the length of the neural tube. By E13, SP-positive cells appear in the amygdaloid nuclear complex, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and in the caudal medulla. Fibers are first detected in the stria terminalis at this age. Over the next 48 hours, a plethora of SP-positive cells appears throughout the CNS, notably in the septal area, diagonal band nucleus, piriform cortex, accumbens nucleus, hypothalamus, rostral striatum, superior and inferior colliculi, intercollicular nucleus, substantia nigra, interpeduncular nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, and the nucleus of the tractus solitarii. Subsequently, SP-positive neurons and fibers increase in number and staining intensity except in the medullary raphe where the apparent number of SP-positive neurons decreases after E16. Whereas the pattern of SP staining is quite similar in mice and rats, the time of initial detection of SP-like immunoreactivity in specific nuclei is 1-4 days earlier in mice than that reported in rats with different antisera.
2461971	The corticocortical connections between the arcuate area (Walker's areas 8A and 45 or Brodmann's area 8) and the premotor and supplementary motor areas (Vogts' area 6) in the brain of the macaque monkey were studied microscopically with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), which was injected into Brodmann's area 8 primarily to elucidate the projections of area 8 into area 6. In addition, in the same material, the pattern of connections between the arcuate area and area 46 of the prefrontal cortex was studied. On the basis of the findings of the present study, an anatomical cortical hierarchy for areas 8, 6, and 46 is discussed. Anterogradely labeled axon terminals and retrogradely labeled cells appeared in the premotor area, in the supplementary motor area, and in area 46 on the side of injection; sites containing labeled axon terminals also contained labeled cells. In other words, the examined connections were reciprocal. In the labeled areas, labeled terminals and cells coexisted, and most formed radial columns. However, no labeling of cells and terminals was seen in the motor area (Brodmann's area 4). After injection of WGA-HRP into area 8A, labeled terminals and cells appeared predominantly in the superior premotor area (a region of the premotor area above the arcuate spur, Vogt and Vogt's upper areas 6a alpha and 6a beta), forming one, two, or three bands of label in the anteroposterior direction, whereas labeling occurred to a lesser extent in the inferior premotor area (a region of the premotor area below the arcuate spur, Vogt and Vogt's areas 4c, lower 6a alpha and 6b). In contrast, injection of WGA-HRP into area 45 resulted in the predominant labeling of the inferior premotor area with scant labeling in the superior premotor area. In the premotor area, labeled terminals were distributed over the entire cortical depth, although few were found in the lower half of layer III, and labeled cells were distributed mainly in layer III. In area 46 of the banks of the principal sulcus in the prefrontal cortex, labeled terminals were distributed in all cortical layers or over the entire cortical depth with a lower concentration in layer IV; labeled cells were found mostly in layers III and V, with a relatively high density in layer V.
2461972	The afferent connections of the substantia innominata (SI) in the rat were determined employing the anterograde axonal transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and the retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), in combination with histochemical procedures to characterize the neuropil of the SI and identify cholinergic cells. Both neurochemical and connectional data establish that the SI is organized into a dorsal and a ventral division. Each of these divisions is strongly affiliated with a different region of the amygdala, and, together with its amygdalar affiliate, forms part of one of two largely distinct constellations of interconnected forebrain and brainstem cell groups. The dorsal SI receives selective innervation from the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, the fundus of the striatum, distinctive perifornical and caudolateral zones of the lateral hypothalamus, and caudal brainstem structures including the dorsal raphe nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Projections preferentially directed to the ventral SI arise from the medial part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the rostral two-thirds of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, a large region of the rat amygdala that lies ventral to the central nucleus, the medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus, medialmost lateral hypothalamus, and the ventromedial hypothalamus. Both SI divisions appear to receive afferents from the dorsomedial and posterior hypothalamus, supramammillary region, ventral tegmental area, and the peripeduncular area of the midbrain. Projections to the SI whose selectivity was not determined originate from medial prefrontal, insular, perirhinal, and entorhinal cortex and from midline thalamic nuclei. Findings from both PHA-L and WGA-HRP experiments additionally indicate that cell groups preferentially innervating a single SI division maintain numerous projections to one another, thus forming a tightly linked assembly of structures. In the rat, cholinergic neurons that are scattered throughout the SI and in parts of the globus pallidus make up a cell population equivalent to the primate basal nucleus of Meynert (Mesulam et al.: Neuroscience 10:1185-1201, '83). PHA-L-filled axons, labelled from lectin deposits in the dorsal raphe nucleus, peripeduncular area, ventral tegmental area, or caudomedial hypothalamus were occasionally seen to approach individual cholinergic neurons int he SI, and to contact the surface of such cells with axonal varicosities (putative synaptic boutons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2463275	The projections to the frontal cortex that originate from the various areas of the superior temporal region of the rhesus monkey were investigated with the autoradiographic technique. The results demonstrated that the rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus (areas Pro, Ts1, and Ts2) projects to the proisocortical areas of the orbital and medial frontal cortex, as well as to the nearby orbital areas 13, 12, and 11, and to medial areas 9, 10, and 14. These fibers travel to the frontal lobe as part of the uncinate fascicle. The middle part of the superior temporal gyrus (areas Ts3 and paAlt) projects predominantly to the lateral frontal cortex (areas 12, upper 46, and 9) and to the dorsal aspect of the medial frontal lobe (areas 9 and 10). Only a small number of these fibers terminated within the orbitofrontal cortex. The temporofrontal fibers originating from the middle part of the superior temporal gyrus occupy the lower portion of the extreme capsule and lie just dorsal to the fibers of the uncinate fascicle. The posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus projects to the lateral frontal cortex (area 46, dorsal area 8, and the rostralmost part of dorsal area 6). Some of the fibers from the posterior superior temporal gyrus run initially through the extreme capsule and then cross the claustrum as they ascend to enter the external capsule before continuing their course to the frontal lobe. A larger group of fibers curves round the caudalmost Sylvian fissure and travels to the frontal cortex occupying a position just above and medial to the upper branch of the circular sulcus. This latter pathway constitutes a part of the classically described arcuate fasciculus.
2464938	To clarify the distribution, morphology, and density of amyloid deposits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), tissue sections from various areas of the central nervous system of 14 patients with AD and from 20 nondemented aged controls were investigated immunohistochemically using anti-beta protein antiserum. beta-protein amyloid deposits were present not only in the cores of the senile plaques and in the vascular wall (amyloid angiopathy), but also in various sized plaque-shaped fibrillary, perivascular, subpial, and subependymal deposits. Amyloid deposits were found mainly in the cerebral cortex in nondemented controls, while in AD they were distributed widely in the regions that were not affected in nondemented controls. The positivity of amyloid deposits in AD was 100% in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate nucleus, claustrum, hypothalamus, nucleus basalis of Meynert, and cerebellar cortex. Putamen and brain-stem nuclei were affected frequently, and the spinal cord, dentate nucleus, and globus pallidus were sometimes (less than 50%) affected. This result provides an evidence that Alzheimer's disease is a beta-protein amyloidosis of the central nervous system. An assessment of the distribution of amyloid deposits should prove to be useful for the histopathologic diagnosis of AD.
2468162	mRNAs for isozymes of phospholipase C (PLC) were localized in rat brain by in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes for PLC isozymes I, II, and III of Rhee's group [Suh, P.-G., Ryu, S. H., Moon, K. H., Suh, H. W. & Rhee, S. G. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5419-5423 and (1988) Cell 54, 161-169], and isozyme I of Bennett and Crooke [Bennett, C. F., Balcarek, J. M., Varrichio, A. & Crooke, S. T. (1988) Nature (London) 334, 268-270], which we designate PLC-A. The isozymes displayed different localizations. PLC-A mRNA was highest in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, choroid plexus, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei, rostral raphe nuclei, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. PLC-I was highest in the internal granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, reticular nucleus of thalamus, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and granule cell layer of the cerebellum. PLC-II had a more widespread distribution, with relatively high levels in the internal granular layer of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells. PLC-III label was low throughout the brain. These distributions suggest selective coupling of individual PLC isozymes with particular postsynaptic receptors. PLC-A may be preferentially associated with 5-hydroxytryptamine 1C receptors, vasopressin V1 receptors, and a subtype of glutamate receptors. PLC-I may be linked to muscarinic m1 and m3 receptors as well as other receptors. The distribution of PLC-II mRNA resembles that of src protooncogene, with which it displays sequence homology.
2469525	Magnocellular regions of the basal forebrain contain cholinergic neurons that project to the cerebral cortex. Neurons in the same basal forebrain regions innervate the brainstem. The present study investigated whether these brainstem projecting neurons are cholinergic, project also to the cortex, and share similar physiological properties as cortically projecting neurons. Data with retrograde tracing from various regions of the pons, medulla, and cortex combined with choline acetyltransferase immunofluorescence indicated that: 1) brainstem projecting neurons are usually segregated from cortically projecting and/or cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, 2) virtually no brainstem projecting neurons in the basal forebrain are cholinergic, and 3) only rarely do basal forebrain neurons have axon collaterals that project to both cortex and brainstem. Extracellular recordings from basal forebrain neurons confirmed the paucity of axonal collateralization and the topographic segregation between cortically and brainstem projecting basal forebrain neurons, and, in addition, showed that brainstem projecting neurons have a slower mean conduction velocity than cortically projecting neurons. These observations suggest that basal forebrain neurons projecting to the brainstem (pons, medulla) and the cortex represent separate cell populations in terms of projections, neurotransmitter content, distribution, and physiological properties.
2472578	The detailed organization of the corticostriate projection has been investigated in the brain of the rat using the technique of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase following the placement of small, iontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to lectin throughout all major regions of the striatum (caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). The results demonstrate that all major regions of the cerebral cortex project to the striatum on both sides of the brain with an ipsilateral predominance. The cells of origin of both the ipsilateral and contralateral corticostriate projections lie mainly in lamina V (especially lamina Va) with very small numbers in lamina III of the neocortex and mesocortex, and in the deep laminae of the allocortex. The results show that each striatal locus receives inputs from several cortical regions, i.e. there is extensive overlap in the corticostriate projection, and that, in general terms, each cortical region projects onto a longitudinally oriented region of the striatum. In particular, the major subdivisions of the cerebral cortex--the neocortex, mesocortex and allocortex--project onto defined but partially overlapping regions of the striatum: the neocortex projects to the caudate-putamen; the mesocortex projects mainly to the medial and ventral regions of the caudate-putamen but also to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumens and olfactory tubercle); and the allocortex projects mainly to the ventral striatum but also to the medial and ventral parts of the caudate-putamen. Within each of these major projection systems there is a further organization, with the constituent parts of each major cortical region projecting to smaller longitudinal components of the major projection fields. Each neocortical area projects to a longitudinal region of the dorsal striatum (caudate-putamen): the sensory and motor areas project topographically onto the dorsolateral striatum such that the rostral sensorimotor cortex (head areas) projects to central and ventral regions and the more caudal sensorimotor cortex (limb areas) projects to dorsal regions of the dorsolateral striatum; the visual area projects to the dorsomedial striatum; and the auditory area projects to the medial striatum. Each mesocortical area projects to a longitudinal area of the striatum: the most posteromedial mesocortex (the retrosplenial area) projects to the dorsomedial striatum; more anterior and lateral parts of the mesocortex project to more ventral parts of the striatum: and the most lateral mesocortex (the agranular insular and perirhinal areas) project to the ventrolateral striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2473416	The metallopeptidase enkephalinase known to participate in the inactivation of endogenous enkephalins and, possibly, other neuropeptides such as tachykinins, was visualized by autoradiography using a [125I]iodinated monoclonal antibody. A detailed mapping of the enzyme in rat brain and spinal cord was established on 10-micron serial sections prepared in a frontal plane as well as a few sections in a sagittal plane. On adjacent sections, and for the purpose of comparison, substance P-like and enkephalin-like immunoreactivities were also visualized by autoradiography using a 125I-monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody detected by a secondary 125I-anti-rabbit antibody respectively. Histological structures were identified on adjacent Nissl-stained sections. Using the highly sensitive 125I-probe, enkephalinase immunoreactivity was found to be distributed in a markedly heterogeneous manner in all areas of the central nervous system. Immunoreactivity was undetectable in white matter areas, for example the corpus callosum or fornix, and had a laminar pattern in, for example, the cerebral cortex or hippocampal formation. Hence, although immunodetection was not performed at the cellular level, a major neuronal localization of the peptidase is suggested. The latter is consistent with the detection of a strong immunoreactivity in a pathway linking the striatum to the globus pallidum, the entopeduncular nucleus and the substantia nigra, as well as with a series of biochemical and lesion data. The strong immunoreactivity also present in choroid plexuses and ependymal cells as well as in the intermediate lobe and in scattered cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary suggests that populations of glial and endocrine cells also express the peptidase. The highest density of enkephalinase immunoreactivity was observed in basal ganglia and limbic areas (caudate putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercles) as well as in areas involved in pain control mechanisms (superficial layers of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve or of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord) which also display the highest immunoreactivities for both enkephalins and substance P (except in globus pallidus for the latter). These localizations account for the opioid-like analgesic and motor effects of enkephalinase inhibitors inasmuch as a selective or predominant participation of the peptidase in enkephalin inactivation is assumed. A number of other areas appear richly endowed in both enkephalinase and enkephalins whereas substance P is hardly detectable. This is particularly the case for the olfactory bulb, bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, the cerebellum (where enkephalinase mainly occurs in the molecular layer) and the hippocampal formation (namely in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2476837	The effects of chronic clomipramine administration (15 mg/kg daily for 23 days) on changes in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and noradrenaline (NA) induced by chronic stress have been studied in the rat brain. Chronic stress increased 5-HT in midbrain, pons and hippocampus, 5-HIAA in frontal cortex, midbrain, pons and hippocampus, and NA in midbrain and striatum. Chronic clomipramine significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT in most regions. In hypothalamus, hippocampus and perhaps in frontal cortex this effect possibly reflects decreased synthesis caused by an action on presynaptic 5-HT receptors. However, in midbrain, pons and striatum decreased 5-HT could not be attributed to a decrease in its synthesis since 5-HIAA also increased. This drug treatment also reduced NA in all regions except the striatum. Nevertheless, conclusions on NA synthesis or turnover cannot be drawn since only NA levels were measured. When administered concurrently, chronic clomipramine prevented the increases in 5-HT, 5-HIAA and NA produced by chronic stress. These results are in good accordance with previous findings showing that chronic antidepressant treatment also prevented behavioural disturbances induced by chronic stress.
2477403	To determine the locations of neurons in the rat brain expressing substance P and neurokinin A mRNA, we performed in situ hybridization with a radiolabeled cRNA probe that was complementary to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-preprotachykinin mRNA. Several types of controls indicated specificity of the labeling. Brain regions containing many labeled neurons include the anterior olfactory nucleus, layer II of the olfactory tubercle, the islands of Calleja, the nucleus accumbens, the caudate-putamen, portions of the amygdala and hypothalamus, the medial habenular nucleus, nuclei of the pontine tegmentum, several raphe nuclei, several portions of the reticular formation, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Less frequent labeled neurons were also found in many other regions of the brain. These results extend many previous immunocytochemical studies of the locations of neurons containing immunoreactive substance P, neurokinin A, and neuropeptide K.
2478160	The distribution of specific binding sites for the peptide galanin was studied in the monkey brain by using 125I-galanin and the method of quantitative in vitro autoradiography. The binding to tissue sections was found to be rapid, reversible and saturable with a calculated Bmax of around 13 fmol mg-1 tissue in cortical regions and a KD ranging between 0.39 and 0.22 nM in different brain regions. Specifically bound 125I-galanin was detected in a number of brain regions throughout the rostrocaudal axis of the monkey brain. More specifically, the majority of the 125I-galanin binding sites were present in the basal forebrain (e.g. olfactory tubercle, lateral septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, substantia innominata and the basal nucleus of Meynert), the amygdala (e.g. the lateral, medial accessory and central nuclei), the amygdala-hippocampal area, hypothalamus (e.g. the anterior hypothalamic area, the ventro-medial hypothalamus and the zona incerta), as well as in certain brain stem cell groups such as the substantia nigra (pars compacta), locus coeruleus, central grey substance, parabrachial nucleus, sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve and the dorsal vagal complex. In the neocortex, highest binding density occurred in layer 4 of all neocortical fields, except in the visual cortex where the highest densities occurred in layers 4cb, 5a and 6. Major fibre tracts such as the fimbria and the stria terminalis also contained high densities of 125I-galanin binding sites. Areas poor in, or lacking, specific 125I-galanin binding sites included the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the mammillary bodies, the cerebellum, and the reticular formation of the brain stem. The pattern of galanin receptor distribution in the monkey brain reported here closely resembles that observed for galanin receptors and galanin-immunoreactive preterminal processes described previously in the rat brain. An exception, however, was neocortex, where in the rat neither 125I-galanin binding nor galanin-positive fibres have been observed. The present findings may indicate a close association between galanin receptors and nerve terminals containing galanin immunoreactivity in the monkey brain and implies important role(s) for galanin in neurotransmission in the monkey central nervous system.
2480174	Corticoreticular fiber systems were examined in adult albino and hooded rats using anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and anterograde degeneration. WGA-HRP injections were made stereotactically into the medial prefrontal cortex, the medial agranular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the face motor cortex, the forelimb motor cortex, the trunk-hindlimb motor cortex, the face somatosensory cortex, the primary auditory cortex, the secondary visual cortex and the primary visual cortex. With exception of the cingulate cortex (which is relatively inaccessible to lesioning methods) and the primary visual cortex, electrocautery lesions were made into these same cortical areas. The precise locations of cortical injection/lesion sites were corroborated on the basis of cortical cytoarchitectonic criteria, patterns of retrograde and anterograde thalamic labeling, and patterns of anterograde labeling in non-reticular brainstem nuclei such as the red nucleus, trigeminal nuclei and dorsal column nuclei. The heaviest corticoreticular projections arise from the medial agranular cortex. The medial prefrontal cortex also gives rise to consistently strong corticoreticular projections. The anterior cingulate cortex sends robust corticoreticular projections to the upper brainstem but relatively weak projections to the lower brainstem. With respect to the primary motor cortex, the face area gives rise to the densest corticoreticular projections, rivaling those emanating from the medial agranular cortex. The trunk-hindlimb area gives rise to substantial corticoreticular projections, but those originating from the forelimb area are modest and directed chiefly to midbrain and medullary levels. The face area of the somatosensory cortex gives rise to rather weak corticoreticular projections, while those arising from the primary auditory cortex are fewer still. Descending projections from the secondary visual cortex are sparse, with labeled terminals occurring in a few pontine and medullary reticular nuclei. Only one brainstem reticular nucleus (nucleus cuneiformis) was found to receive projections from the primary visual cortex, and this input was extremely sparse. Corticoreticular projections to the upper brainstem terminate predominantly ipsilateral to the cortical injection site, whereas medullary corticoreticular projections distribute bilaterally. Corticoreticular fibers from the medial agranular, face motor and trunk-hindlimb motor cortex terminate heavily in somatomotor brainstem reticular nuclei such as the pontis oralis, the pontis caudalis and the gigantocellularis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2480456	The effects of single and repeated electroconvulsive treatments (ECTs) on brain regional distribution of substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurotensin (NT), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and galanin (GAL) were studied in the rat. Rats were divided into four groups receiving one of the following treatments: one ECT, one sham ECT, six ECTs, or six sham ECTs. After sacrifice by focused microwave irradiation, brains were dissected into frontal cortex, striatum, occipital cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pituitary sections. Peptides were extracted by boiling the tissues in 1 mol/l acetic acid and measured in extract aliquots by specific radioimmunoassays. Marked regional differences (P = .0005) were found for each of the peptides measured. The highest concentrations of SP and NKA were found in the hypothalamus and, in descending order, in striatum, pituitary, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, and hippocampus. For NT, the highest level was found in the hypothalamus and, in descending order, in pituitary, striatum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and occipital cortex. The highest VIP concentrations were measured in frontal and occipital cortex, followed by pituitary, hypothalamus, striatum, and hippocampus. The highest NPY and GAL concentrations were found in the hypothalamus and the pituitary; in frontal and occipital cortex, as well as in the striatum and hippocampus, the peptides levels were rather evenly distributed. Repeated handling (stress?) decreased both NT and GAL in frontal (P = .05 and .04) and occipital cortex (P = .09 and .07). ECT, one or six treatments, had no effect on SP, NKA, NT, VIP, or GAL concentrations in different brain regions. However, an increase in NPY concentrations in hippocampus (six sham ECTs vs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2484235	Seven different metals (iron, copper, zinc, calcium, manganese, lead, and cadmium) were studied in eight different brain regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, medulla oblongata, and pons) of weaned rats (21-d-old) maintained on an iron-deficient (18-20 mg iron/kg) diet for 8 wk. Iron was found to decrease in all the brain regions, except medulla oblongata and pons, in comparison to their respective levels in control rats, receiving an iron-sufficient (390 mg iron/kg) diet. Brain regions showed different susceptibility toward iron deficiency-induced alterations in the levels of various metals, such as zinc, was found to increase in hippocampus (19%, p less than 0.05) and midbrain (16%, p less than 0.05), copper in cerebral cortex (18%, p less than 0.05) and corpus striatum (16% p less than 0.05), calcium in corpus striatum (22%, p less than 0.01) and hypothalamus (17%, p less than 0.02), and manganese in hypothalamus (18%, p less than 0.05) only. Toxic metals lead and cadmium also increased in cerebellum (19%, p less than 0.05) and hippocampus (17%, p less than 0.05) regions, respectively. Apart from these changes, liver (64%, p less than 0.001) and brain (19%, p less than 0.01) nonheme iron contents were found to decrease significantly, but body, liver, and brain weights, packed cell volume, and hemoglobin content remained unaltered in these experimental rats. Rehabilitation of iron-deficient rats with an iron-sufficient diet for 2 wk recovered the values of zinc in both the hippocampus and mid-brain regions and calcium in the hypothalamus region only. Liver nonheme iron improved significantly; however, no remarkable effect was noticed in brain nonheme iron following rehabilitation. It may be concluded that latent iron deficiency produced alterations in various metal levels in different brain regions, and corpus striatum was found to be the most vulnerable region for such changes. It is also evident that brain regions were resistant for any recovery in their altered metallic levels in response to rehabilitation for 2 wk.
2502564	Collateral axonal branching from the medial or lateral mammillary nuclei to the anterior thalamus, Gudden's tegmental nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and the medial pontine nucleus was studied using the fluorescent retrograde double-labeling method. One day after injection of Fast Blue into the anterior thalamic nuclei or Gudden's tegmental nuclei, Nuclear Yellow was injected into Gudden's tegmental nuclei or the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and the medial pontine nucleus. Following 1 day survival, single- and double-labeled neurons were examined in the mammillary nuclei. The lateral mammillary nucleus contains neurons whose collateral fibers project to both the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden and the ipsilateral or contralateral anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, to both the medial pontine nucleus and the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, and to both the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden and the medial pontine nucleus. The pars medianus and pars medialis of the medial mammillary nucleus contain neurons whose collateral fibers project to both the anteromedial thalamic nucleus and the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, to both the anteromedial thalamic nucleus and the medial part of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and to both the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden and the medial part of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. The dorsal half of the pars posterior of the medial mammillary nucleus contains a few neurons whose collateral fibers project to both the anteromedial thalamic nucleus and the rostral part of the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, and to both the caudal part of the anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the rostral part of the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, while the pars lateralis of the medial mammillary nucleus contains no double-labeled neurons and projects only to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus.
2512020	The afferent connections of septal nuclei from the brain areas relating to pain in the rat were studied with HRP, WGA-HRP and CB-HRP methods. Some brain areas relating to pain, for instance, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, lateral habenular nucleus, amygdaloid complex, hippocampus and cingulate cortex, project to medial septal nucleus, lateral nucleus and diagonal band nucleus. The many areas relating to acupuncture analgesia project to septal nuclei, it is possible that the septal nuclei participate in regulating pain in the central nervous system.
2528968	The distribution of dopamine type 1 (D-1) and dopamine type 2 (D-2) receptors in the brain have been compared as assessed by the technique of autoradiography after labelling with highly selective ligands. D-1 receptors, as evidenced by the specific binding of [3H]R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-IH-3-benzazepine -7- ol (SCH 23390), were found in high concentrations in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle and the zona reticulata of the substantia nigra. A similar but distinct distribution was seen for [3H]sulpiride, a ligand which is highly selective for D-2 receptors. Like [3H]SCH 23390, this ligand also labelled the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, islands of Calleja and the olfactory tubercle; however, only a very low density of D-2 receptors could be found in the zona reticulata of the substantia nigra, while a greater degree of binding was present in the zona compacta. Additional brain areas which contained D-1 but not D-2 receptors included the cerebral cortex, accessory olfactory nucleus, amygdala, thalamus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, choroid plexus, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, zona incerta, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and the dentate gyrus. D-2 receptors were also found in areas which appeared to contain only low amounts of D-1 receptors such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus, habenula, stratum lacunosum moleculare of the hippocampus, intermediate lobe of the pituitary, lateral mammillary nucleus, periaqueductal gray, inferior colliculus, nodulus of the cerebellum and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The results show the precise localization of dopamine receptors throughout the brain and provide a means of direct comparison between the distribution of dopamine receptor subtypes. These subtypes are pharmacologically and anatomically distinct entities and their comparison indicates areas where additional biochemical and neuroanatomical studies may be performed to elucidate the roles for these receptor subtypes in the central nervous system.
2535662	Origin, course and distribution of the cerebellar arteries and of their branches are described. Anatomical drawings of the territory of these arteries are presented. They are based on a neuropathological study of 64 cases of cerebellar infarctions, the detailed study of which is reported elsewhere. The superior cerebellar artery (SCA) supplies a small brain stem territory, located on the dorsal tegmentum and the tectum of the upper part of the pons. The superior part of the cerebellum supplied by this artery includes the following lobules: lobulus anterior, lobulus simplex, lobulus semilunaris superior, and, in the vermis, lobulus centralis, culmen and clivus. The dentate nucleus belongs to this territory. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) irrigates a ponto-cerebellar territory. It usually supplies the lateral territory of the lower part of the pons, the middle cerebellar peduncle, the flocculus and the neighbouring lobules of cerebellum. When the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is hypoplastic, AICA takes over the territory usually supplied by the lateral branch of the PICA. The PICA always gives rami to the group of arteries supplying the dorsal medullary territory, but rarely participates to the supply of the lateral medullary territory. It supplies the lobulus semilunaris inferior, the lobulus gracilis, the lobulus biventer, the tonsilla cerebelli, and, in the vermis, the clivus, the tuber, the pyramis, the uvula and the nodulus. PICA never supplies the dentate nucleus. The flocculo-nodular lobe is usually supplied by 2 arteries: the flocculus is supplied by the AICA and the nodulus is supplied by the PICA.
2538203	The [1-14C]-2-deoxyglucose technique was employed to evaluate the regional pattern of alterations in glucose utilization in the rat brain, pituitary and spinal cord induced by the selective kappa-opioid agonist U-50,488H (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N[2-(1-pyrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide). Within the dose range used (0.5-5 mg/kg), U-50,488H produced a dose-dependent attenuation of nociceptive thresholds and a place aversion in the place conditioning test, allowing for a correlation of the regional pattern of changes in glucose utilization with certain behavioral responses. The regional changes in glucose utilization induced by U-50,488H in the brain were most pronounced in components of the limbic forebrain circuit such as the anterior thalamic nuclei, mammillary body, frontal cortex, lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens and lateral habenular nucleus as well as in the brainstem tegmental nuclei and the dorsal and median raphe nucleus (components of the limbic midbrain area). Glucose utilization was decreased in the frontal cortex and increased in the other regions. An increase in glucose utilization also was observed in the central gray pons. Increases in glucose utilization in the pituitary were restricted to the intermediate lobe. In the lumbar part of the spinal cord, glucose metabolism was enhanced in the region around the central canal and in the ventral horn. The changes in glucose metabolism observed in these structures suggest that the aversive (dysphoric) effects of U-50,488H may be due to the altered activity of the limbic structures of the forebrain and midbrain which have been implicated in emotional and affective processes. The increased activity in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary, furthermore, might reflect a stress component in the effects of this drug. Since the dorsal raphe nucleus and the region of the central gray pons have been implicated in both analgesia and pain processes a supraspinal site of antinociceptive action of U-50,488H, in addition to a spinal site of action, must be considered.
2539932	A case of Pick's disease with the onset at 51 years old and a 15-year clinical course was studied. The brain, weighing 740 g, showed striking atrophy limited to the frontal and temporal lobes and inferior parietal lobules of both sides. The topographic distribution of Pick bodies (PBs) was investigated; PBs were present most densely in the amygdaloid, hippocampus, innominate substance, posterior cingulate and insula, inferior parietal lobule, posterior inferior temporal gyrus, and fusiform and lingular gyri. They were present less densely in the anterior frontal and temporal gyri, occipital gyri, caudate, hypothalamus, claustrum, putamen, pallidum, and olfactory bulbs and tubercles. Their presence was sparse in the pre- and post central gyri and superior parietal lobule. The calcarine and cerebellum were spared. The tectum and central grey of the midbrain, red nuclei, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, superior central nuclei, tegmental reticular nuclei, pontine nuclei, dorsal vagal nuclei, and arcuate nuclei, were also severely affected. This distribution pattern of PBs was very similar to that of Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, except for the pontine and arcuate nuclei. Electron microscopy of PBs disclosed two component fibrils: smooth-surfaced straight tubular filaments with a diameter of 15nm +/- 3 and no periodic constrictions, and long-period (160nm) constricted fibrils. The morphology of these two fibrils of PBs, respectively resembled the straight filaments and paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles.
2540275	The regional distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunoreactivity and receptor binding was studied in the porcine CNS. The highest amounts of immunoreactive NPY were found in the hypothalamus, septum pellucidum, gyrus cinguli, cortex frontalis, parietalis, and piriformis, corpus amygdaloideum, and bulbus olfactorius (200-1,000 pmol/g wet weight). In the cortex temporalis and occipitalis, striatum, hippocampus, tractus olfactorius, corpus mamillare, thalamus, and globus pallidus, the NPY content was 50-200 pmol/g wet weight, whereas the striatum, colliculi, substantia nigra, cerebellum, pons, medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis contained less than 50 pmol/g wet weight. The receptor binding of NPY was highest in the hippocampus, corpus fornicis, corpus amygdaloideum, nucleus accumbens, and neurohypophysis, with a range of 1.0-5.87 pmol/mg of protein. Intermediate binding (0.5-1.0 pmol/mg of protein) was found in the septum pellucidum, columna fornicis, corpus mamillare, cortex piriformis, gyrus cinguli, striatum, substantia grisea centralis, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. In the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, corpus pineale, colliculi, corpus geniculatum mediale, nucleus ruber, pons, medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis, receptor binding of NPY was detectable but less than 0.5 pmol/mg of protein. No binding was observed in the bulbus and tractus olfactorius and adenohypophysis. In conclusion, immunoreactive NPY and its receptors are widespread in the porcine CNS, with predominant location in the limbic system, olfactory system, hypothalamoneurohypophysial tract, corpus striatum, and cerebral cortex.
2541863	The localization of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AdR) in the rat brain was examined immunocytochemically with antibody against affinity-purified beta 2-receptors. This antibody was confirmed to cross-react with beta 1-AdR. beta-AdR were widely but unevenly distributed in the rat brain. In the forebrain and diencephalon, cells with beta-AdR were abundant in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and various hypothalamic nuclei other than the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Few or no cells with beta-AdR were found in the thalamus except in the lateral and medial geniculate nucleus, habenular nucleus and paraventricular thalamic nucleus. The striatum, globus pallidus, and accumbens nucleus also contained few beta-AdR. In the lower brainstem, areas related to auditory function, such as the inferior colliculus, the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the cochlear nuclei, as well as areas related to cerebellar function, such as the reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons, the pontine nuclei, the lateral reticular nucleus and the inferior olive, were rich in beta-AdR. Considerable immunoreactivity was also found in the parabrachial nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract.
2545841	Little is known of the neural sites of action for the pineal hormone, melatonin. Thus, we developed an in vitro autoradiographic method using 125I-labeled melatonin (I-MEL) to study putative melatonin receptors in rodent brain. We first determined optimal in vitro labeling conditions for autoradiographic detection of I-MEL binding sites in rat median eminence, the most intensely labeled area in the rat brain. We then assessed the pharmacologic and kinetic properties of I-MEL binding sites in rat median eminence by quantitative autoradiography. These sites have high affinity for I-MEL (equilibrium dissociation constant = 43 pM). I-MEL binding was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of melatonin or 6-chloromelatonin, but was not inhibited by serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine (100 microM). These results suggest that I-MEL binding sites identified by in vitro autoradiography represent specific, high-affinity melatonin receptors. Studies of the distribution of I-MEL binding in rat, Syrian hamster, and Djungarian hamster brain confirm that the median eminence and suprachiasmatic nucleus are major sites of I-MEL binding in rodent brain; other brain areas labeled in one or more of these species were the thalamus (paraventricular, anteroventral, and reuniens nuclei, nucleus of the stria medullaris, and medial part of the lateral habenular nucleus), hypothalamus (dorsomedial nucleus), subiculum, and area postrema. The presence of putative melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and median eminence of these rodent species suggests that these brain regions are important loci for melatonin effects on circadian rhythms and reproduction.
2553203	The effects upon cerebral glucose utilisation of (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, receptor antagonist) and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) were examined in conscious, lightly restrained rats. Cerebral glucose utilisation was assessed quantitatively in 74 brain regions with [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. The intravenous (i.v.) administration of MK-801 (0.05-5 mg/kg) induced heterogeneous patterns of altered cerebral glucose utilisation with statistically significant increases being observed in 21 brain areas and statistically significant decrease in 8 brain regions. Pronounced dose-related increases in glucose use were observed after MK-801 in the subicular complex, hippocampus molecular layer, dentate gyrus, limbic system (posterior cingulate cortex; mamillary body; anteroventral thalamic nucleus), olfactory areas and substantia nigra (pars reticulata). Glucose use in the neocortex and inferior colliculus was particularly sensitive to reduction by MK-801 administration. The pattern of altered glucose use after administration of CPP (3-30 mg/kg, i.v.) differed markedly from that observed after MK-801 treatment. Statistically significant increases in glucose use after CPP were noted in 11 brain areas and statistically significant decreases in 5 of the regions examined. Regions in which increases were noted after CPP included hippocampus molecular layer, olfactory areas, cochlear nucleus, vestibular nucleus, cerebellar nucleus, superior olives and substantia nigra (pars reticulata). These data indicate that widespread, anatomically organised alterations in cerebral function are associated with the administration of NMDA receptor antagonists despite the minor role normally ascribed to these receptors in conventional fast synaptic transmission. The distinct patterns of response to competitive and non-competitive antagonists may be a reflection of the differential responses of the two modes of receptor blockade to increased glutaminergic transmission.
2553282	The endogenous opioid peptides, the opiate receptors and several related behaviours, like opioid-mediated analgesia, show daily variations in different animal species including rats. The attempt to correlate the daily rhythm of opiate receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) to opiate related rhythmic phenomena requires an experimental approach with a high anatomical resolution, as the opioid distribution is very heterogeneous. In this paper we present the study of daily variations of 3H-naloxone binding sites in the different regions of the adult male rat brain, performed by means of quantitative autoradiography. Five rats are sacrificed at each investigated time of the day (0200, 0600, 1000, 1400, 1800 and 2200). The ligant is 3H-naloxone (4 nM), the quantification is performed by means of densitometric procedures (image analyzer Tesak VDC 501, computer Digital PDP 11, 3H-microscale). The statistical analysis is performed according to the single Cosinor method and the one-way analysis of variance followed by the multiple range test of Duncan. We analysed 33 different regions of the rat CNS, and the daily variations of opiate receptors are regionally selective. A circadian rhythm is found in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampal cortex, periventricular, medial, ventral, reticular and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, rhomboid, gelatinosus and rheuniens nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, grey substance of the pons, reticular formation of medulla oblongata, inferior olivary complex, medial part of the nucleus of the solitary tract and nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. An ultradian rhythm is found in the medial and lateral preoptic areas, in the medial hypothalamus, in the medial and in the lateral nuclei of habenula. No significant variations during 24 hr according to the Cosinor analysis are found in the dorsal and lateral cerebral cortex, striatum, globus pallidus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, septal nuclei, lateral nucleus of the thalamus, cochlear nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, lateral and caudal parts, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, XII and IX nerve nuclei. The amplitude of the daily variations observed ranges from 10 to 40%. Our results demonstrate the high anatomical selectivity of the daily modifications of 3H-naloxone binding sites in the rat CNS. They also indicate that quantitative autoradiography is a suitable and sensitive technique for these studies.
2555740	The distribution of [125I]omega-conotoxin GVIA binding sites, the putative voltage-sensitive calcium channels, was studied by an autoradiographic method in the rat brain. The toxin binding sites were distributed throughout the brain in a highly heterogeneous manner. The highest density of the binding sites was observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdaloid complex, substantia nigra, caudate putamen, superior colliculus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and the dorsal horn of the cervical spine. The glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex, and posterior lobe of the hypophysis showed intermediate density but the density was higher than in the surrounding areas. The globus pallidus, thalamic areas, inferior olive, and pontine nuclei showed low density, while no binding sites were observed in the white matter tract regions such as the internal and external capsule, corpus callosum, fimbria of the hippocampus, fornix, stria medullaris of the thalamus, and fasciculus retroflexus. This distribution of omega-conotoxin binding sites indicates that the toxin binding sites are localized in those areas of the brain enriched in synaptic connections. This distribution pattern resembles that reported for voltage-sensitive sodium channels but it differs from that of the binding sites of dihydropyridines and verapamil. These results suggest that omega-conotoxin recognizes different molecules from organic calcium channel antagonist binding sites and that omega-conotoxin-sensitive voltage-sensitive calcium channels are concentrated in the synaptic zones and play a key role in the excitation-secretion coupling of neurotransmitters.
2557515	The experiments to be described have been designed in order to: (a) provide new information on the concentrations of opioid kappa receptors in different regions of the brain of the male rats; and (b) to analyze whether the density of brain kappa receptors might be modified by the process of aging. The concentration of kappa receptors was investigated in the hypothalamus, amygdala, mesencephalon, corpus striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, frontal poles, anterior and posterior cortex collected from male rats of 2 and 19 months of age. 3H-bremazocine (BRZ) was used as the ligand of kappa receptors, after protection of mu and delta receptors respectively with dihydromorphine and d-ala-d-leu-enkephalin. The results obtained show that: (1) in young male rats, the number of kappa opioid receptors is different in the various brain areas examined: the hypothalamus and the striatum have a concentration of kappa binding sites which is significantly higher than that found in the mesencephalon and in the amygdala; much lower concentrations of kappa binding sites have been found in the thalamus, the frontal poles, the hippocampus, the anterior and posterior cerebral cortex. (2) Aging exerts little influence on the number of kappa receptors in the majority of the brain structures considered. However in the amygdala and in the thalamus the number of kappa receptors was increased in old animals. To the authors' knowledge, the data here presented are the first ones which suggest that age may increase rather than decrease the number of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.
2558803	1. Specific 125I-labeled insulin-like growth factor-I [( 125I] IGF-I) binding sites in the rat forebrain and pituitary gland were investigated using quantitative receptor autoradiography. 2. High densities of [125I]IGF-I binding sites were present in the olfactory nerve layer, olfactory glomerular layer, choroid plexus, CA3 and CA4 of the hippocampus, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, and endopiriform nucleus. Moderate to high binding densities were found in the cerebral cortex (II, VI), bed nucleus stria terminalis, accumbens nucleus, lateral septum, median preoptic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and ventroposterior thalamic nucleus. In the circumventricular organs, subfornical organ, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, and median eminence, the binding sites were numerous. High densities of [125I]IGF-I binding sites were also observed in the anterior pituitary gland. 3. In kinetic experiments, [125I]IGF-I binding sites in the olfactory glomerular layer, choroid plexus, median eminence, and anterior pituitary gland were found to be single and of a high affinity. 4. Noteworthy was the difference in the potency of insulin in inhibiting the binding among the areas examined, a finding which suggests heterogeneity of IGF-I receptors. 5. The possibility that IGF-I plays the role of a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in the central nervous system warrants further investigation.
2578663	Binding sites for synthetic human 125I-labeled calcitonin gene-related peptide (125I-CGRP) have been demonstrated in membranes of the human nervous system. Binding was high in the cerebellar cortex (1.35 +/- 0.27 fmol/mg of tissue; mean +/- SEM), spinal cord (1.06 +/- 0.27 to 1.27 +/- 0.23 fmol/mg), and nucleus dentatus (1.02 +/- 0.15 fmol/mg), intermediate in the inferior colliculus (0.80 +/- 0.14 fmol/mg) and substantia nigra (0.75 +/- 0.14 fmol/mg), low in the neocortex, globus pallidus, nucleus caudatus, hippocampus, amygdala, superior colliculus, thalamus, and hypothalamus (0.15-0.32 fmol/mg), and negligible in spinal and sympathetic ganglia and pituitary (less than 0.04 fmol/mg). Autoradiography showed distinct 125I-CGRP binding over the molecular and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellar cortex and over the substantia gelatinosa posterior of the spinal cord. The highest levels of CGRP-like components were recognized in the dorsal part of the spinal cord and the pituitary gland. In the ventral part of the spinal cord as well as in the pituitary and thyroid glands, CGRP values were higher when measured by radioreceptorassay as compared to RIA, indicating that at least two CGRP-like components are present. The predominant CGRP-like peak on HPLC had the retention time of synthetic human CGRP. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of a dense plexus of CGRP immunoreactive nerve fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
2581653	The binding of [125I]physalaemin to rat brain slices was investigated. Radiolabeled physalaemin bound with high affinity (Kd = 0.3 nM) to a single class of sites (Bmax = 22 fmol/mg protein). Kinetic studies indicated that binding was time-dependent and all specific binding was reversible. Pharmacology studies indicated that specific [125I]physalaemin binding was inhibited by structurally related peptides such as substance P and eledoisin. Biochemical studies indicated that specific binding of radiolabeled physalaemin was greatly reduced if the brain slices were pretreated with heat, trypsin or N-ethyl maleimide. Autoradiographic studies indicated that the [125I]physalaemin binding sites were discretely distributed throughout the brain. Highest grain densities were present in the olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus, amygdala, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, subiculum, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarii and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Moderate grain densities were present in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, pyriform cortex, striatum, hippocampus, inferior colliculus and central gray of the midbrain. Low grain densities were present in most thalamic nuclei, the substantia nigra and cerebellum. The corpus callosum and controls treated with 1 microM unlabeled physalaemin had negligible levels of binding. The unique pharmacological and regional distribution data obtained suggest that [125I]physalaemin may serve as a valuable probe to study central substance P receptors.
2586750	The 2-deoxyglucose metabolic mapping technique has been used to investigate the neural mechanisms which underlie the symptoms of Parkinsonism in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine primate model of Parkinson's disease. In six cynomolgus monkeys, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine was either (a) administered intravenously to induce generalized Parkinsonism, or (b) infused into one carotid artery to induce unilateral Parkinsonism. Post-mortem examination revealed profound cell loss from the substantia nigra, pars compacta either bilaterally or unilaterally in the two groups, respectively. In addition, there was pathological involvement of the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus in animals receiving intravenous 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. 2-Deoxyglucose autoradiography revealed widespread changes in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the brains of parkinsonian animals when compared to controls. Most of these changes were in basal ganglia and related structures and were qualitatively similar in the two groups of experimental animals. Prominent increases in 2-deoxyglucose uptake were observed in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus (24-27%), the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus (14-22%) and the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus of the caudal midbrain (17-69%). A profound decrease (17-26%) in 2-deoxyglucose uptake was observed in the subthalamic nucleus. We propose these data to indicate that in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Parkinsonism there is the following pattern of abnormal neuronal activity in basal ganglia circuitry: (i) increased activity in the projection from the putamen to the lateral segment of the globus pallidus; (ii) decreased activity in the projection from the putamen to the medial segment of the globus pallidus; (iii) decreased activity in the projection from the lateral segment of the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus; (iv) increased activity in the projection from the subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus; and (v) increased activity in neurons of the medial segment of the globus pallidus projecting to the ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus and the pedunculopontine nucleus. These results are compared to the 2-deoxyglucose uptake findings in previous studies from this laboratory in hemiballism and hemichorea in the monkey. The central importance of the subthalamic nucleus in all three conditions is proposed, and supportive evidence for the excitatory nature of subthalamic efferent fibres is adduced.
2586753	Distribution of putative glutamatergic neurons in the lower brainstem and cerebellum of the rat was examined immunocytochemically by using a monoclonal antibody against phosphate-activated glutaminase, which has been proposed to be a major synthetic enzyme of transmitter glutamate and so may serve as a marker for glutamatergic neurons in the central nervous system. Intensely-immunolabeled neuronal cell bodies were densely distributed in the main precerebellar nuclei sending mossy fibers to the cerebellum; in the pontine nuclei, pontine tegmental reticular nucleus of Bechterew, external cuneate nucleus, and lateral reticular nucleus of the medulla oblongata. Phosphate-activated glutaminase-immunoreactive granular deposits were densely seen in the brachium pontis and restiform body, suggesting the immunolabeling of mossy fibers of passage. In the cerebellum, neuropil within the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex displayed intense phosphate-activated glutaminase-immunoreactivity, and that within the deep cerebellar nuclei showed moderate immunoreactivity. These results indicate that many mossy fiber terminals originate from phosphate-activated glutaminase-containing neurons and utilize phosphate-activated glutaminase for the synthesis of transmitter glutamate. Intensely-immunostained neuronal cell bodies were further observed in other regions which have been reported to contain neurons sending mossy fibers to the cerebellum; in the dorsal part of the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial part of the oral subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, interpolar subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, paratrigeminal nucleus, supragenual nucleus, regions dorsal to the abducens nucleus and genu of the facial nerve, superior and medial vestibular nuclei, cell groups f, x and y, hypoglossal prepositus nucleus, intercalated nucleus, nucleus of Roller, reticular regions intercalated between the motor trigeminal and principal sensory trigeminal nuclei, linear nucleus, and gigantocellular and paramedian reticular formation. Neuronal cell bodies with intense phosphate-activated glutaminase-immunoreactivity were also found in other brainstem regions, such as the paracochlear glial substance, posterior ventral cochlear nucleus, and cell group e. Although it is still controversial whether all glutamatergic neurons use phosphate-activated glutaminase in a transmitter-related process and whether phosphate-activated glutaminase is involved in other metabolism-related processes, the neurons showing intense phosphate-activated glutaminase-immunoreactivity in the present study were suggested to be putative glutamatergic neurons.
2587424	The distribution of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of the Formosan monkey (Macaca cyclopsis) was investigated employing immunohistochemical techniques. FMRFamide-containing cells were found to be widely distributed throughout the forebrain. Principal densities of FMRFamide neuronal perikarya were observed in the following areas: the amygdaloid complex, the olfactory tubercle, the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, the septum, the caudate-putamen and the arcuate nucleus. A large number of immunoreactive fibers were observed in areas ranging from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord, and were noted in the following locations: the preoptic area, the tuberal and posterior hypothalamic areas, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nuclei of the spinal trigeminal nerve, the hypoglossal nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The results generally parallel those described in the rat and guinea pig.
2591474	The effects of morphine tolerance-dependence and abstinence on 5-HT2 receptors in brain and spinal cord of the rat were determined. Tolerance to and physical dependence on morphine was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by implanting six morphine pellets (each containing 75 mg of morphine free base) during a seven day period. Two groups of rats were used for binding studies. In one group the pellets were left intact and in the other they were removed. The rats were killed and spinal cords and brains were excised and dissected into six regions (amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain and pons + medulla). 5-HT2 receptors were characterized by using [3H]spiperone as the ligand and unlabelled ketanserin to determine the non-specific binding. In morphine and placebo abstinent rats the binding of [3H]spiperone to 5-HT2 receptors in brain regions and spinal cord did not differ. The Bmax values of [3H]spiperone to bind to membranes prepared from non-abstinent morphine-dependent rats were increased in amygdala (78.0%), midbrain (65.0%) and pons + medulla (92.0%). The Kd values were unaffected. It is concluded that in morphine-tolerant-dependent rats 5-HT2 receptors are up-regulated in amygdala, midbrain and pons + medulla, but in morphine-abstinent rats they are unaffected.
2592603	The present study analyzes the distribution of corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive (CRF-IR) fibers and neuronal cell bodies within the cerebellum and brainstem, respectively, of the cat. Within the cerebellum, CRF is present in climbing fibers, mossy fibers, and a population of varicose fibers which traverses the lower molecular layer. CRF-IR fibers are present throughout all lobules of the cat cerebellar cortex, though the density and immunostaining intensity of each fiber system vary. Bands of intensely immunoreactive climbing fibers are prominent within the vermis, intermediate cortex, and crus II. Bands of intensely immunoreactive mossy fiber terminals accompany the climbing fiber bands within the vermis. Collaterals of climbing and mossy fibers contribute to a beaded fiber plexus localized to the Purkinje cell layer. Varicose fibers containing CRF immunoreactivity are present in all deep cerebellar nuclei. CRF-IR neuronal cell bodies are prominent within several brainstem nuclei known to project to the cerebellum: all divisions of the inferior olivary complex, the lateral reticular nucleus, paramedian reticular nucleus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, raphe nuclei, perihypoglossal complex, medial and inferior vestibular nuclei and cell groups f and x, locus ceruleus, and nucleus subceruleus. This study confirms and extends a previous study of CRF distribution within cerebellar afferent systems of the cat (Cummings et al.: J. Neurosci. 8:543-554, '88) and compares this distribution with previous descriptions in other species. The ubiquitous distribution of CRF throughout the cat cerebellum suggests a primary role for this peptide in signal transduction.
2592610	Many regions of the basal forebrain are innervated by zinc-containing axonal boutons. In the present work, the lesion/degeneration method, coupled with histochemical staining for zinc-containing boutons, was used to determine the origins and efferent pathways of these zinc-containing projections to the basal forebrain. Knife cuts of the stria terminalis or extensive electrolytic lesions of the amygdala resulted in the bleaching of the staining for zinc (Timm stain) and terminal degeneration (Fink-Heimer method) ipsilaterally in the following areas: granule cell layer of the accessory olfactory bulb, shell of nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, striohypothalamic nucleus, retrochiasmatic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (in the cell-sparse shell), medial tuberal nucleus, terete hypothalamic nucleus, and ventral premammillary nucleus. Small lesions made with ibotenic acid in the posteromedial part of the amygdalohippocampal area caused bleaching of the stain for zinc in the accessory olfactory bulb, in the medial zone of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and in the ventral premammillary nucleus. Lesions in either the ventral subiculum or the anterolateral part of the amygdalohippocampal area caused bleaching in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Lesions in the hippocampus or in the neocortex did not produce bleaching of the stain for zinc in the above-mentioned terminal fields. The present results agree with previous studies on amygdaloid efferents and suggest that neurons in the amygdalohippocampal area and, possibly, in the ventral subiculum give origin to zinc-containing boutons.
2592611	The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the topographical organization of efferent projections from the cytoarchitectonic divisions of the mPFC (the medial precentral, dorsal anterior cingulate and prelimbic cortices). We also sought to determine whether the efferents from different regions within the prelimbic division were organized topographically. Anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used to examine the efferent projections from restricted injection sites within the mPFC. Major targets of the prelimbic area were found to include prefrontal, cingulate, and perirhinal cortical structures, the dorsomedial and ventral striatum, basal forebrain nuclei, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, mediodorsal, midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray region, ventral midbrain tegmentum, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and raphe nuclei. Previously unreported projections of the prelimbic region were also observed, including efferents to the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, and the pedunculopontine tegmental-cuneiform region. A topographical organization governed the efferent projections from the prelimbic area, such that the position of terminal fields within target structures was determined by the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral placement of the injection sites. Efferent projections from the medial precentral and dorsal anterior cingulate divisions (dorsomedial PFC) were organized in a similar topographical fashion and produced a pattern of anterograde labeling different from that seen with prelimbic injection sites. Target structures innervated primarily by the dorsomedial PFC included certain neocortical fields (the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices), the dorsolateral striatum, superior colliculus, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and the pontine and medullary reticular formation. Previously unreported projections to the paraoculomotor central gray area and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were observed following dorsomedial PFC injections. These results indicate that the efferent projections of the mPFC are topographically organized within and across the cytoarchitectonic divisions of the medial wall cortex. The significance of topographically organized and restricted projections of the rat mPFC is discussed in light of behavioral and physiological studies indicating functional heterogeneity of this region.
2592734	Ethanol (1, 2 or 5 g kg-1) and lead (0.55 g l-1 in drinking water) were given either alone or in combination for 4 months to rats. The uptake of lead in tissues, some lead-sensitive variables, the levels of biogenic amines in different brain regions, hepatic lipid peroxidation, glycogen and blood glucose concentrations were measured. Ethanol or lead when given alone inhibited the activity of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD). The co-administration of 5 g kg-1 but not 1 or 2 g kg-1 ethanol significantly enhanced the lead-induced inhibition of blood delta-ALAD activity and the elevation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) excretion. Co-exposure to lead and ethanol (5 g kg-1) produced a more pronounced increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation and blood glucose level than either ethanol or lead alone. This combination also caused a significant increase in the dopamine (DA) contents of striatum, midbrain and pons medulla, norepinephrine (NE) contents in midbrain and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contents of hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain and pons medulla over levels produced by lead alone. However, the level of NE in hypothalamus decreased upon co-administration. The uptake and retention of lead was significantly higher in blood, liver, kidney and brain in animals co-exposed to lead and 5 g kg-1 ethanol. Blood and kidney lead was also increased by 2 g kg-1 ethanol. The results suggest that prolonged and heavy consumption of alcohol may increase the toxicity of lead.
2593779	The distribution of messenger RNA encoding neuropeptide Y (NPY) was studied in 11 different postmortem human brain regions using in situ hybridization histochemistry, and RNA blot analysis. In situ hybridization data revealed that the highest numerical density of labeled cells corresponded to neurons in accumbens area, caudate nucleus, putamen, and substantia innominata. Significantly fewer NPY mRNA-containing neurons were found in frontal and parietal cortex, amygdaloid body and dentate gyrus. No NPY mRNA-containing cells were found in substantia nigra. NPY mRNA-positive neurons from all regions studied showed relatively similar labeling, as revealed by computerized image analysis. Blot analysis showed an approximately 0.8 kb NPY mRNA in all brain regions studied, except in substantia nigra and cerebellum. Densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms revealed levels of NPY mRNA in the following order: putamen greater than caudate nucleus greater than frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 4 and 6) greater than temporal cortex (Brodmann area 38) greater than parietal cortex (Brodmann areas 5 and 7) greater than frontal cortex (Brodmann area 11). Hence, although NPY mRNA is widely distributed in neurons of the human brain large regional variation exists, with the highest expression in accumbens area and parts of the basal ganglia.
2597078	We have studied the fine structure of the cerebral cortex, the cerebellar cortex, the thalamus, the caudate nucleus, the amygdala, the putamen, the vestibular nuclei, the substantia nigra, the hippocampus and the centrum semiovale in a canine model following 20 min controlled hypotension by the administration of sodium nitroprusside. The neurons and the astrocytes of all structures were intact morphologically. The synapses in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex were all unremarkable. Sensitive areas such as the molecular layer of the cerebellum did not demonstrate any ultrastructural alterations. We believe that carefully controlled sodium-nitroprusside-induced hypotension might be applied in middle ear microsurgery in otherwise healthy patients as an effective and innocuous method without causing any anoxic insult to sensitive areas of the central nervous system.
2611694	Descending projections from cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, collectively referred to as the pontomesencephalotegmental (PMT) cholinergic complex, were studied by use of the fluorescent retrograde tracers fluorogold, true blue, or Evans Blue in combination with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pharmacohistochemistry. Pedunculopontine somata positive for ChAT or staining intensely for AChE were retrogradely labeled with fluorescent tracers following infusions into the motor nuclei of cranial nerves 5, 7, and 12. ChAT-positive cells in both the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei demonstrated projections to the vestibular nuclei, the spinal nucleus of the 5th cranial nerve, deep cerebellar nuclei, pontine nuclei, locus ceruleus, raphe magnus nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, median raphe nucleus, the medullary reticular nuclei, and the oral and caudal pontine reticular nuclei. Fluorescent tracers used in combination with AChE pharmacohistochemistry corroborated these projections and, in addition, provided evidence for cholinergic pontomesencephalic projections to the lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive. The majority of retrogradely labeled neurons demonstrating ChAT-like immunoreactivity were found ipsilateral to the injection site, but, in all cases, tracer-containing cholinergic cells contralateral to the infused side of the brain were detected also. More retrogradely labeled cells containing ChAT were observed in the pedunculopontine tegmental than in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus following tracer injections at all sites with the exceptions of the locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus where the converse profile was observed. None of the pedunculopontine or laterodorsal tegmental cells immunopositive for ChAT or stained intensely for AChE contained retrogradely transported tracers following dye infusions into the cerebellar cortex or cervical spinal cord. Triple-label experiments using two tracers infused into different sites in the same animal revealed that individual ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the PMT cholinergic complex projected to more than one hindbrain site in some cases and had ascending projections as well. Certain ChAT-positive somata in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei were found in close association with several fiber tracts, including the superior cerebellar peduncle, lateral lemniscus, dorsal tegmental tract, and medial longitudinal fasciculus.
2618582	An important feature of ischemic brain damage is the selective vulnerability of specific neuronal populations. We studied the distribution and time course of neuronal damage following transient cerebral ischemia in the gerbil, using light microscopy and 45Ca autoradiography. Following 5 min of ischemia, selective neuronal damage determined by abnormal 45Ca accumulation was recognized only in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and part of the inferior colliculus. Ischemia for 10 to 15 min caused extensive neuronal injury in the 3rd and 5th layers of neocortex, the striatum, the septum, the whole hippocampus, the thalamus, the medial geniculate body, the substantia nigra, and the inferior colliculus. Progression of the damage was rapid in the medial geniculate body and the inferior colliculus, moderate in the neocortex, striatum, septum, thalamus, and the substantia nigra, and was delayed in the hippocampal CA1 sector. However, the delayed damage of the hippocampus occurred earlier when the ischemia period was prolonged. Histological observation revealed neuronal loss in the identical sites of the 45Ca accumulation. This study revealed that the distribution and time course of selective neuronal damage by ischemia proceeded with different order of susceptibility and different speed of progression.
2622870	Changes in monoamines were studied in discrete areas of brain with varying dose of isopropanol. Acute administration of isopropanol (0.463 g/kg, 0.925 g/kg and 1.85 g/kg) decreased dopamine level in hypothalamus, pons medulla and cerebral cortex and whereas it was increased in striatum and cerebellum. Noradrenaline level was reduced in all the brain areas studied. Adrenaline level was increased in hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain and pons medulla, and decreased in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Serotonin level was increased in hypothalamus, midbrain, pons-medulla and cerebral cortex, and decreased in striatum and hippocampus. These changes were dose-dependent. It is concluded that isopropanol causes changes in brain monoamine content that this effect is not the same in all the regions of the brain.
2633131	Computed tomography (CT) gave a large contribution to morphological analysis of the aphasia syndromes. The aphasia problems are, however, still controversial and have many unresolved issues, even from a morphological point of view. In most cases with cerebral vascular lesion causing speech dysfunction, we are able to define an extent of density change on CT images. But its extent seems to be often not consistent with the area supposed to be deranged in functional work-up of speech. CT appearance of some areas may be little changed or normal when those areas are to be in poor condition in their functional maintenance. This may be due to such a vascular supply which permits brain tissues to be sustained but which does not work for their function to be normally performed. From 642 cases with cerebral vascular lesion we reviewed CT images of 382 cases: 171 cases having a lesion in the left hemisphere and 46 of them showing aphasia syndrome; 151, a lesion in the right hemisphere alone and 3, aphasic; and 60 cases having lesions on both sides and 7 showing aphasia syndrome. First, we determined anatomically the extent of CT change in 102 cases, all right-handed, with a lesion in the left hemisphere. The extents were piled and made up to a "non-aphasia-lesion-map". This map was used for eliminating those areas as not working in speech function. The other map of the areas was made out of CT images of aphasia cases (33 cases including one agraphia). The latter map was put upon the "non-aphasia-lesion-map", so that the very area working in speech function could be more restricted. The third map, "restricted-aphasia-lesion-map" demonstrated those areas related to speech function: (1) the region limited around the three rami in the Sylvian fissure (Broca A); (2) the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior aspect of the middle frontal gyrus (Broca B); (3) the inferior aspect of the cortex and subcortex of the Reil's island; (4) most of the middle temporal gyrus, the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus, a large portion of the supramarginal gyrus and a part of the limbic system; (5) a large portion of the limbic system; (6) the anterior aspect of the superior frontal gyrus; and (7) the corpus callosum. The Standard Language Test for Aphasia (SLTA) was applied for 33 cases of aphasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2650804	Pre-embedding immunofluorescence was used to study the development of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-containing neuronal systems in the brain of fetal and newborn rats. Immunoreactive cell bodies are first seen in association with the ventral olfactory bulb at the fetal embryonic (E) day 15. At day E 17, single GnRH-containing neurons are found in the nasal system, along the olfactory nerve, in the ganglion terminale, olfactory bulb, septum-diagonal band complex, olfactory tubercle and in the ventrolateral hypothalamus. A major spurt in the development of the brain GnRH-containing systems occurs between days E 18 and E 19. At day E 19, immunoreactive cell bodies are present in all areas as in the adult animals, however, in smaller number. GnRH-containing fibers are first detected in the nasal system at day E 17. At day E 18, GnRH positive projections are present in the nervus terminalis, in the developing organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and ventral hypothalamus. By day E 19, GnRH containing connections are established with most of the final target areas. These areas include the caudal olfactory bulb, lateral septum, stria terminalis, fimbria hippocampi, habenula, supramammillary commissure and central gray. In the hypothalamus, 3 major pathways are recognized: a ventral projection which runs in and beneath the optic chiasm toward the median eminence; a ventrolateral tract which is located lateral to the optic chiasm and which projects along the optic tract toward the lateral thalamus as well as to the median eminence; a periventricular network which projects to the habenula and, in a caudal direction, to the mediobasal hypothalamus including the median eminence. The results of the present study suggest that the GnRH neuronal systems develop considerably earlier than previously reported and that the intracerebral GnRH-containing fiber connections are established several days before birth.
2654944	The distribution of a subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC) encoded by the beta II sequence in rat central nervous tissue was demonstrated immunocytochemically by using antibodies raised against an oligopeptide having a partial sequence specific for the beta II PKC. The beta II PKC immunoreactivity was widely but discretely distributed in the brain. The distribution of the beta II PKC immunoreactivity differed from that of the beta I and gamma PKC subspecies. The beta II PKC immunoreactivity was found in the perikarya, dendrites, and axons of neuronal cells. Few if any glial cells were stained. Immunoreactive neurons were present in the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, amygdaloid complex, caudate-putamen, accumbens nucleus, claustrum, dorsal part of the lateral septal nucleus, CA1 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, medial habenular nucleus, cerebral cortex, nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, nucleus of the solitary tract, and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. In these neurons, the beta II PKC immunoreactivity was seen mainly in the form of cytoplasmic dots and, in some cases, diffusely in the cytoplasm. Under electron microscopy, these immunoreactive large dots appeared to be associated with the Golgi complex, suggesting that the beta II PKC plays a specialized function at the Golgi complex in certain neuronal cell types.
2655673	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by symptoms of disturbance of eye movement, nuchal rigidity, parkinsonism and subcortical dementia. Its pathology reveals that Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are situated especially in the nuclei of basal ganglia and brainstem. It has been pointed out that NFTs observed in PSP are composed of straight tubules, the width of which is about 15 nm. This report is to reappraise the ultrastructure of NFTs observed in three cases of PSP. They are case 1; 69-year-old male, case 2; 62-year-old female and case 3; 65-year-old male. The clinical features of three cases were characterized by above-mentioned symptoms. Many NFTs were observed in brainstem of case 1 and 3. NFTs seen in brainstem of case 2 were in a small amount. In case 1 and 2, there were many NFTs in cerebral cortex, especially in parahippocampal gyri and other limbic areas. We examined the portions of frontal cerebral cortex, parahippocampal cortex, the basal nucleus of Meynert, oculomotor nucleus, substantia nigra, pontine nuclei and locus caeruleus of case 1, substantia nigra, red nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus of case 2, and Ammon's horn, globus pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, oculomotor nucleus, pontine nuclei, locus ceruleus and inferior olivary nucleus of case 3. Ultrastructurally, NFTs of frontal cortex of case 1 consisted of twisted tubules and those of hippocampal and parahippocampal cortices of case 1 consisted of straight and twisted tubules, being observed separately in neurons. The NFTs of brainstem of case 1 and 2 were mainly composed of 12-17 nm straight tubules, and twisted tubules occasionally intermingled with straight components. In locus ceruleus of case 1, a single straight tubule could be seen in the bundles of twisted tubules. NFTs of case 3 were composed of only straight tubules, the width of which was about 15 nm. Twisted components were not observed in neurons of each nuclei of case 3. The characteristic ultrastructure of NFTs in PSP has been an appearance of straight tubules, however, twisted tubules were occasionally observed in this study. There are several case reports which demonstrated an appearance of both straight and twisted components. It is easily presumed that the process of aging takes part in the accumulation of twisted fibrils. However, it is now under consideration why twisted tubules are also observed in PSP. To summarize this study, the cases with many NFTs observed in widespread cerebral cortex may have a tendency to show both straight and twisted tubules.
2657475	The distribution of delta sleep inducing peptide (DSIP) in the rabbit brain has been studied with immunohistochemical techniques. DSIP-like immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus and hypophysis. Even in colchicine-pretreated animals, immunolabeled cell bodies were relatively few. They were mostly scattered through the ventrolateral septum, the diagonal band of Broca and preoptic areas. Clusters of positive cell bodies were also found in the arcuate nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic areas. Large populations of varicose fibers and terminal-like structures were observed in the juxtaventricular zone of the ventrolateral septum, in the preoptic areas and lamina terminalis especially around the preoptic recess of the third ventricle and more caudally, in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Dense networks of immunolabeled fibers were visualized in the median eminence and pituitary stalk where many fibers could be seen in close apposition to the capillaries. Many DSIP-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the subfornical organ. Other extra-hypothalamic regions displaying a low-to-moderate density of immunoreactive fibers were the indusium griseum, the hippocampus, the fimbria of the fornix, the subcommissural organ, the medial habenula and, occasionally, the medial periaqueductal gray. Most cells of the pars intermedia and a few cells of the pars distalis of the anterior pituitary were DSIP-immunoreactive. Taken together these results in the rabbit brain emphasize the predominant localization of DSIP-like immunoreactivity in areas related to the hypothalamic neurosecretory systems.
2663114	Specific [3H]MK-801 binding was measured under equilibrium conditions in 8 brain regions (frontal cortex, area entorhinalis, hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra and nucleus dentatus) in the right hemisphere of the human brain (n = 4). In addition, binding was assessed in 3 of these regions (frontal cortex, area entorhinalis and putamen) in the left hemisphere. High [3H]MK-801 binding levels occurred in the area entorhinalis, frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, medium levels were observed in the putamen and thalamus and low levels were found in the substantia nigra and nucleus dentatus. No evidence for laterality of [3H]MK-801 binding sites was observed in the 3 regions which were investigated on both sides of the brain.
2668353	The distribution of noradrenaline (NA) immunoreactivity in the forebrain and midbrain of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by means of recently developed antibodies against NA. Noradrenaline-containing cell bodies are found in the hypothalamic periventricular organ and ependymal wall of the infundibular recess of the diencephalon. They are also present in the locus coeruleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract of the brainstem. Noradrenaline-immunoreactive (NAi) fibers and varicosities are widely, but not uniformly, distributed throughout the forebrain and midbrain. In the telencephalon, dense plexuses of NAi fibers are found in the bed nucleus of the medial forebrain bundle, the vertical limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, and the caudoventral part of the septal region. The diencephalon, the periventricular preoptic area, the supraoptic nucleus, and, in particular, the medial habenular nucleus are densely innervated by NAi fibers, whereas in the midbrain NAi plexuses are found in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra and its dorsolateral extension (RA8), and in an area ventral to the nucleus interpeduncularis, pars ventralis. Moderately dense plexuses of NAi fibers are found in the small-celled medial cortex, the dorsal cortex, and the midbrain tectum. The remaining forebrain and midbrain areas are generally not or only sparsely innervated by NAi fibers. The distribution of NAi cell bodies and fibers resembles the pattern revealed with antibodies against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). A remarkable exception is that the cells in the hypothalamic periventricular organ and ependymal wall of the infundibular recess are immunonegative for DBH. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. The present study on the distribution of NA immunoreactivity in the brain of Gekko gecko combined with the results of a previous report on the distribution of dopamine in the same species (Smeets et al., '86b) offer the opportunity to differentiate between the two catecholamines in the brain of this vertebrate.
2677066	The distribution of the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 was examined in the frontal and parietal cortex of macaque monkeys. In both regions the distribution was uniform within cytoarchitecturally defined areas (or subareas) but varied between them. In all areas, Cat-301 labeled the soma and proximal dendrites of a restricted population of neurons. In the frontal lobe, Cat-301-positive neurons were intensely immunoreactive and present in large numbers in the motor cortex (area 4), premotor cortex (area 6, excluding its lower ventral part), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the caudal prefrontal cortex (areas 8a, 8b and 45). In the parietal lobe, large numbers of intensely immunoreactive neurons were evident in the post-central gyrus (areas 1 and 2), the superior parietal lobule (PE/5), and the dorsal bank (PEa), fundus (IPd), and deep half of the ventral bank (POa(i] of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Two major patterns of laminar distribution were evident. In motor, supplementary motor, premotor (excluding the lower part of its ventral division), and the caudal prefrontal cortex (Walker's areas 8a, 8b and 45), and throughout the parietal cortex (with the exception of area 3), Cat-301-positive neurons were concentrated in the lower part of layer III and in layer V. The laminar positions of labeled cells in these areas were remarkably constant, as were the proportions of labeled neurons that had pyramidal and nonpyramidal morphologies (means of 30.2% and 69.8%, respectively). In contrast, in prefrontal areas 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 46, in the cingulate cortex (areas 23, 24 and 25), and in the lower part of the ventral premotor cortex, Cat-301-positive neurons were spread diffusely across layers II to VI and a mean of 3.6% of the labeled neurons were pyramidal while 96.4% were nonpyramidal. Area 3 was unique among frontal and parietal areas, in that the labeled neurons in this area were concentrated in layers IV and VI. The areas in the frontal lobe which were heavily labeled are thought to be involved in the control of somatic (areas 4 and 6) and ocular (areas 8 and 45) movements. Those in parietal cortex may be classified as areas with somatosensory functions (1, 2, PE/5, and PEa) and areas which may participate in the analysis of visual motion (Pandya and Seltzer's IPd and POa(i), which contain Maunsell and Van Essen's VIP). The parietal somatosensory areas are connected to frontal areas with somatic motor functions, while POa(i) is interconnected with the frontal eye fields (8a and 45).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2685107	Neuronectin (NEC1) is a human extracellular matrix protein of central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma found throughout the white matter of rostral brain segments (telencephalon, diencephalon, some areas of mesencephalon), but not in rostral CNS gray matter, most areas of mesencephalon, pons, cerebellum, medulla, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. The present immunohistochemical study, using two monoclonal antibodies to distinct epitopes on the NEC1 molecule, examined NEC1 expression in normal non-neural tissues, malignant tumors of diverse histological types, non-malignant skin lesions, and dermal incision wounds. We show that (a) NEC1 is expressed in normal fetal precartilage blastemas and fetal and adult vascular and visceral smooth muscle, but not in most loose connective tissues and skeletal or cardiac muscle; (b) NEC1 is found along epithelial-mesenchymal junctions, with marked differences in prevalence and histological patterns in different organs; and (c) mesenchymal activation associated with wound healing, actinic keratosis, psoriasis, and neoplasia leads to strong induction of NEC1 expression. Parallel studies with cultured human cells suggest that region-specific NEC1 expression in normal developing tissues and localized induction in wound healing and disparate diseases is under the control of extrinsic signals provided by regulatory polypeptides.
2710333	A new immunohistochemical method that utilizes carbodiimide as a tissue fixative was applied to study the distribution of histamine-immunoreactive neuronal fibers and terminals in the rat brain. Immunoreactive fibers were observed in almost all major regions of the brain. They were most numerous in the different hypothalamic nuclei. Dense networks of immunoreactive fibers were also seen in the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band and ventral tegmental area. A moderate density of fibers was seen throughout the cerebral cortex, in some parts of the olfactory bulb and tubercle, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, basal parts of the hippocampus, inferior and superior colliculi, substantia nigra, lateral and medial parabrachial nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Few histamine-immunoreactive fibers were seen in most parts of the caudate putamen, most thalamic nuclei, most pontine and ventral medullary nuclei. Histamine-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies were found exclusively in the tuberomammillary nucleus, in agreement with previous reports. The results provide evidence for a widespread distribution of histamine-containing nerve fibers and terminals in the rat brain. Although immunohistochemical localization of histamine does not give direct evidence of a functional role of histamine in any brain area, this distribution suggests involvement in functions of the limbic system including the septal nuclei, hypothalamus and amygdala. The relatively dense histamine-immunoreactive fiber networks in the colliculi and dorsal cochlear nucleus indicate that this amine may play a role in visual functions and hearing. The paucity of immunoreactive fibers in the pontine and medullary areas suggests that the caudal projections originating from the tuberomammillary complex are minor ones compared to the major rostral projections. Several fiber projections originating from the tuberomammillary complex could be deduced from serial frontal, sagittal and horizontal sections. They contained fibers that crossed the midline at several levels of the brain. The results provide information on the target areas of the histaminergic neurons and form a basis for the examination of cellular contracts between the histaminergic neurons and other cells.
2715107	Concentrations of histamine were quantified by an enzymatic isotopic assay in different regions of the brain and pituitary gland of gonadal-intact and chronically ovariectomized ewes during the anestrous season. Sera concentrations of LH were confirmed to be elevated in ovariectomized compared with intact animals immediately before tissues were obtained. Areas of the brain that were examined included cerebral cortex, thalamus, pineal gland, hypothalamus (rostral, medial basal, median eminence), midbrain, cerebellum and brain stem. Concentrations of histamine were greatest within the thalamus, pineal gland, medial basal hypothalamus and median eminence. Histamine within the medial basal hypothalamus was greater (P less than .05) in ovariectomized than in ovarian-intact animals. Further experiments were designed to determine the effect of antihistaminic drugs on secretion of LH. Ovariectomized ewes were treated every 6 h (i.m.) for 24 h with diphenhydramine (an antagonist of the H1-receptor for histamine), cimetidine (an H2-receptor antagonist), a combination of the drugs, or vehicle. Twelve hours after initiation of treatments, animals were injected with estradiol. Diphenhydramine depressed (P less than .01) basal serum concentrations of LH and the positive feedback effect of estradiol on serum concentrations of LH. Cimetidine did not influence the pattern of secretion of LH. Diphenhydramine did not alter LHRH-induced release of LH in ovariectomized ewes or basal serum concentrations of LH in ovarian-intact anestrous ewes. We suggest that histamine acts at the level of the central nervous system through an H1-receptor mechanism to control secretion of LH in female sheep.
2715386	In a systematic attempt to trace all projections from the brainstem and diencephalon to the pontine nuclei of the cat, implantations and injections of horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) or Fluoro-Gold were placed in the pontine nuclei of 21 cats. In most of the cases there was no evidence of spread of tracer outside the pontine nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells in the brainstem and diencephalon were carefully mapped and counted. The number labeled cells in the brainstem and diencephalon ranged from 24 in cases with very small implantations to 3,490 in cases with large injections in the pontine nuclei (counts from every fifth section). The labeled cells are located bilaterally with an ipsilateral preponderance. After large injections, 25-38% of the labeled cells were located in the brainstem reticular formation, 10-16% in the pretectal nuclei, 10-15% in the hypothalamus, 7-9% in the zona incerta, 3-9% in the fields of Forel, 4-5% in the nucleus locus coeruleus, 3-5% in the ventral lateral geniculate body, 2-4% in the superior colliculus, 3% in the periaqueductal gray, and 14-15% in other parts of the brainstem. Judging from cases with small tracer deposits entirely confined to the pontine nuclei, there appear to be two types of subcortical inputs: Projections from the reticular formation, the nucleus locus coeruleus, the periaqueductal gray, and the raphe nuclei are widespread, presumably reaching all parts of the pontine nuclei, while projections from a diversity of other sources are localized, reaching limited parts of the pontine nuclei only or predominantly.
2716951	Immunoreactive (IR) prolactin was localized immunocytochemically in cell bodies in the mediobasal hypothalamus and in fibers in many regions of the rat brain. The cell bodies were found in the arcuate nuclei and the adjacent areas ventral to the ventromedial nuclei. Fiber projections extended rostrally to and/or through the anterior hypothalamus, preoptic area, nucleus accumbens, septum, diagonal bands of Broca, caudate-putamen, frontal cortex and accessory olfactory bulb; laterally to the amygdala, especially the central nucleus and some parts of the medial nucleus; caudally to and/or through the midbrain central gray, reticular formation, parabrachial region, and several portions of the lower brain stem and spinal cord extending to sacral levels. The system appears to be essentially identical to that containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and its processed peptides, as shown by double immunocytochemistry. Preabsorption of the antiprolactin antiserum with either prolactin or the 16,000-dalton N-terminus of POMC eliminated immunoreactivity in the brain. Preabsorption with other POMC-derived peptides, including beta-lipotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, met-enkephalin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (1-24), corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide, alpha- and gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormones and an octapeptide region of the N-terminus of POMC bearing some homology with prolactin, did not eliminate immunoreactivity in the brain. Similarly, preabsorption with growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, motilin or fetuin did not eliminate immunoreactivity in the brain. The antiprolactin antiserum also recognized all cells in the intermediate lobe and a subset of cells in the anterior lobe of the Snell dwarf mouse pituitary. This immunoreactivity was eliminated by preabsorption of the antiserum with prolactin or with the 16,000-dalton N-terminus of POMC. These results suggest that IR prolactin in the brain may be related to the N-terminus of POMC. Additional results based on one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting indicate that the antiprolactin antiserum used in the majority of the immunocytochemical studies recognized a number of proteins.
2721044	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a syndrome of supranuclear ophthalmoplegic palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, rigidity of the limbs, nuchal dystonia, and dementia in which the gaze palsy is the hallmark of the disease. Most neurologists are reluctant to consider the diagnosis unless visual problems exist. Since the earliest complaints of PSP are said to be variable and subtle, accurate diagnosis is often delayed and initial pathologic changes of the disease not well studied. Two patients came to autopsy with dementia, gait disturbances, and/or dysarthria but no eye findings by history or physical exams. Symptoms had been attributed to metastatic cancers. At autopsy prominent globose neurofibrillary tangles with variable cell loss, microglial nodules, and neuronophagia were found in the locus ceruleus, third cranial nerve complex, nucleus supratrochlearis, nucleus centralis superior, and nucleus basalis of Meynert with mild pallor of the globus pallidus, mild cell loss in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, and sparing of the superior colliculus. The diagnosis of early PSP was made. These cases serve to 1) detail the more limited neuropathologic changes in early PSP, 2) reemphasize that the earliest clinical symptoms of PSP are not gaze palsies, and 3) remind clinicians to consider PSP in their differential diagnosis in patients with gait disturbances, dementia, and/or dysarthria, and 4) document PSP in association with carcinoma in two cases.
2723155	The retrograde transport of the conjugate wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was used in the rat to identify the cell bodies of origin for all subcortical projections to the basilar pontine nuclei (BPN). A parapharyngeal surgical approach was used to allow the injection micropipette to enter the BPN from the ventral aspect of the brainstem and thus avoid any potential for false-positive labeling due to transection and injury-filling of axonal systems located dorsal to the basilar pontine gray. A surprisingly large number of BPN afferent cell groups were identified in the present study. Included were labeled somata in the lumbar spinal cord and a large variety of nuclei in the medulla, pons, and midbrain, as well as labeled cells in diencephalic and telencephalic nuclei such as the zona incerta, ventral lateral geniculate, hypothalamus, amygdala, nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the horizontal nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca. Quite a number of cell groups known to project directly to the cerebellum also exhibited labeled somata in the present study. To explore the possibility that such neurons were labeled because their axons were transected and injury-filled as they coursed through the BPN injection site to enter the cerebellum via the brachium pontis, a series of rats received complete, bilateral lesions of the brachium pontis followed 30-60 minutes later with multiple, diffuse injections of WGA-HRP (12-16 placements per animal) throughout the cerebellar cortex. In another series of animals, the massive cerebellar WGA-HRP injections were not preceded by brachium pontis lesions. In the latter cases, each of the cell groups in question that were known to project directly to the cerebellum exhibited labeled somata. However, when the cerebellar HRP injections were preceded by brachium pontis lesions, each of the cell groups in question continued to exhibit labeled somata in numbers comparable to that observed in the nonlesion cases. This implies that such neurons project to the BPN and the cerebellar cortex and that the axons of these particular neurons do not project to the cerebellum via the brachium pontis.
2725839	The binding of androgens to specific high-affinity receptor sites in brain tissue is postulated as an initial event in the mechanism of central androgenic action. In an effort to assess the functional capacity of the androgen receptor system in the central nervous system, we measured the concentration of nuclear (ARn) as well as cytosolic androgen receptors (ARc) in 13 microdissected brain samples from intact male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Tissues from 6 rats were combined for each determination and androgen receptor contents were measured with single-point in vitro assays that used saturating concentrations of high specific activity 3[H]dihydrotestosterone. We found that ARc levels tended to be higher in females than males although the general patterns of distribution were very similar. As expected, ARn concentrations were significantly higher in males than females. The highest concentrations of ARn (greater than 100 fmol/mg DNA) in males were measured in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and medial amygdala; intermediate levels (50-100 fmol/mg DNA) were found in arcuate nucleus-median eminence, medial preoptic nucleus, periventricular preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior hypothalamus, periventricular anterior hypothalamus, lateral septum, and parietal cortex, and low levels (less than 50 fmol/mg DNA) were measured in lateral preoptic nucleus and cortical amygdala. With the exception of the periventricular preoptic area (74 +/- 33 fmol/mg DNA), only very low concentrations of ARn were measured in females. These data provide the first quantitative profile of ARn in discrete brain nuclei and subregions of the rat.
2733258	By measuring levels of noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), in various rat brain regions, we investigated the effects of an extract isolated from vaccinia virus-inoculated and inflamed skin or tissue of rabbits (Neurotropin, NSP), administered acutely or chronically, on regional NA metabolism in stressed and nonstressed rats. An acute administration of NSP at 50 mg/kg significantly elevated MHPG-SO4 levels in the amygdala and cerebral cortex; and 100 mg/kg of the drug significantly increased the metabolite levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, midbrain, cerebral cortex and pons plus medulla oblongata without affecting NA levels. This suggests that acutely injected NSP slightly increases NA release in these brain regions. One hour immobilization stress caused significant increases in MHPG-SO4 levels, which were not affected by pretreatment with either 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg of NSP. Chronic injection with NSP daily at either 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg for 7 days was without effect on NA metabolism in all brain regions examined. However, increases in MHPG-SO4 levels caused by stress were significantly attenuated in some regions including the hypothalamus, amygdala and midbrain in chronic NSP-treated rats. This indicates that although an acute administration of NSP slightly increases brain NA release, a chronic treatment with NSP rather attenuates increases in NA release caused by immobilization stress in brain regions such as the hypothalamus, amygdala and midbrain. This suggests a possibility that these attenuating effects on stress-induced increases in brain NA release caused by chronic administration of NSP might be related to the stress-reducing or anti-stress properties of NSP.
2736395	Following minor concussive brain injury when there is an otherwise general suppression of CNS activity, the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTN) demonstrates increased functional activity (32). Electrical or pharmacological activation of a cholinoceptive region in this same general area of the medial pontine tegmentum contributes to certain components of reversible traumatic unconsciousness, including postural atonia (31, 32, 45). Therefore, in an effort to examine the neuroanatomical basis of the behavioral suppression associated with a reversible traumatic unconsciousness, the afferent and efferent connections of the VTN and putative cholinoceptive medial pontine reticular formation (cmPRF) were studied in the cat using the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP), HRP/choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) double-labeling immunohistochemistry, and anterograde HRP and autoradiographic techniques. Based upon retrograde HRP labeling, the principal afferents to the VTN region of the cmPRF originated from the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei, and lateral habenular nucleus, and to a lesser extent from the interpeduncular nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, superior central nucleus, and contralateral nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis. Other afferents, which were thought to have been labeled through spread of HRP into the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), adjacent paramedian pontine reticular formation, or uptake by transected fibers descending to the inferior olive, included the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, zona incerta, prerubral fields of Forel, deep superior colliculus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, nucleus cuneiformis, ventral periaqueductal gray, vestibular complex, perihypoglossal complex, and deep cerebellar nuclei. In HRP/ChAT double labeling studies, only a very small number of cholinergic VTN afferent neurons were found in the medial parabrachial region of the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum, although the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei contained numerous single-labeled ChAT-positive cells. Anterograde HRP and autoradiographic findings demonstrated that the VTN gave rise almost exclusively to ascending projections, which largely followed the course of the mammillary peduncle (16,21) and medial forebrain bundle, or the tegmentopeduncular tract (4). The majority of fibers ascended to terminate in the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei, interpeduncular complex (especially paramedian subnucleus), ventral tegmental area, lateral hypothalamus, and the medial septum in the basal forebrain. Labeling that joined the mammillothalamic tract to terminate in the anterior nuclear complex of the thalamus was thought to occur transneuronally. Some projections were also observed to nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis, superior central nucleus, and dorsal tegmental nucleus adjacent to the VTN...
2739164	Due to the recent advances in knowledge on the function of the limbic system it would be wise to consider this system as being widely distributed throughout the diencephalic and mesencephalic levels as well as the forebrain. Numerous regions have been discovered that are related to the limbic structures in anatomical and functional respects. According to Koikegami et al. (1967), it would be adequate to divide this system into two main categories--the major limbic rim or the structure proper and the paralimbic structures. The former defined phylogenetically and ontogenetically as those structures around the third ventricle such as: the hippocampus, septum, dentate gyrus, fimbria hippocampi, anterior and posterior cingulate gyri, area paraolfactoria, amygdala and Diagonal Band of Broca. The paralimbic structures may represent those brain regions, which have direct connections or functional correlations with the limbic formation proper. These areas include the posterior orbital gyrus, insula, nucleus accumbens, head of the caudate, nucleus habenula, nucleus interpendencularis, nucleus pulvinaris thalami, intralaminar and anterior thalamic nucleus, preoptic area, hypothalamic nuclei, mammillary body, subthalamus, limbic midbrain area of Nauta, temporal lobe pole, superior temporal gyrus, praecuneus, nucleus dorsalis et profundis tegmenti of Gudden and claustrum. In the present paper we will deal with the projections of the nucleus accumbens. This nucleus was described by Meynert (1872) as the anterior polar region of the caudate nucleus. Kappers describes the nucleus accumbens in 1908 as the nucleus accumbens septi and considers it as a part of the striatum. Later on, the histological studies of Brochaus (1942) relate a part of the nucleus with olfactory functions, and he describes another part, which is very well developed in microsmatic mammals and in anosmic mammals like the dolphin. Szteyn (1960) describes two main areas, the accumbens septi and the accumbens caudate. Nevertheless, the accumbens constitutes a very important region of the paralimbic system and seems to play an important role in some behavioral patterns.
2745971	The peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical method has been used in order to investigate the distribution of neurons immunoreactive with antiserum against neuropeptide Y in the hedgehog and the sheep brain. Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive bipolar and multipolar neurons, with a diameter ranging from 10-30 microns, were found in the following regions: cerebral cortex, striatum, Ammon's horn, gyrus dentatus, amygdala, anterior olfactory nucleus, nucleus accumbens, area along the medial forebrain bundle, arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and lateral reticular nucleus of both hedgehog and sheep brain. Furthermore, while neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons were also found in the medial and lateral septal nucleus, interstitial nucleus of the stria terminalis, retrochiasmatic area, central gray substance of the midbrain, colliculus caudalis, and nucleus of the solitary tract of the sheep, respective regions of the hedgehog brain appeared to be devoid of immunoreactive perikarya. This distribution pattern is identical to that observed with antiserum against avian pancreatic polypeptide. The differences in the distribution of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons in the two species studied as well as between our results and those in other species are briefly discussed.
2747911	N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) is a potent and highly selective neurotoxin which induces degeneration of noradrenergic axons. The effects of DSP-4 vary considerably in different brain regions: the drug produces nearly complete depletion of noradrenaline in neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and spinal cord, but only partial depletion in hypothalamus and brainstem. In this study we have employed an immunohistochemical method to assess the neurotoxic effects of DSP-4 on the structural integrity of central noradrenergic neurons in the rat, and to identify those noradrenergic axons that remain in the central nervous system 2-4 weeks after DSP-4 treatment. The staining results identified noradrenergic axon terminals as the principal site of action of DSP-4; noradrenergic cell bodies and preterminal axons were not noticeably affected. DSP-4 produced an almost all or none neurotoxic effect on noradrenergic axon terminals in different brain regions. Nearly all noradrenergic axon terminals were destroyed in the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, thalamus, tectum, cerebellum and spinal cord dorsal horn. In contrast, most noradrenergic axons were unaffected in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, reticular formation, brainstem motor nuclei and spinal cord ventral horn. These remaining noradrenergic axon terminals differed morphologically from sensitive axons by their thickness, size and spacing of their varicosities and their dense arborizations within terminal fields. The distribution of noradrenergic axons susceptible to DSP-4 correlates very closely with the distribution of locus coeruleus axons and possibly all regions in which noradrenergic terminals are unaffected by DSP-4 receive their major noradrenergic input from non-locus coeruleus neurons. This study provides the first direct evidence that DSP-4 destroys noradrenergic axon terminals from the locus coeruleus, but not those from non-locus coeruleus neurons. This profound differential sensitivity of noradrenergic axons to DSP-4 is matched by distinct differences in their morphology and their topographic projections. The results support the view that locus coeruleus and non-locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons constitute two separate subsystems, which differ not only in their projections but also with respect to the pharmacological properties of their axon terminals.
2755282	The concentration of histamine (HA) has been determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection in 21 different regions of brains from patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and subjects (CB) whose causes of death were not related to neuropsychiatric, neurological and/or neurodegenerative diseases. The highest levels of HA in the central nervous system (CNS) of both control (CB) and SDAT samples were found in the posterior hypothalamus (CB = 3.13 +/- 0.63 pmol/mg; SDAT = 7.75 +/- 1.43 pmol/mg, p less than 0.005), where the HA neurons are located, and in the anterior hypothalamus (CB = 1.77 +/- 0.33 pmol/mg; SDAT = 2.82 +/- 0.45 pmol/mg, p less than 0.005). The lowest HA levels were detected in the cerebellum (CB = 0.12 +/- 0.04 pmol/mg; SDAT = 0.24 +/- 0.09 pmol/mg, p less than 0.01) and medulla oblongata. HA levels were significantly higher in SDAT than in CB in the following areas: motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4) (A4), premotor cortex (A6), postcentral gyrus (A1,2), posterior parietal cortex (A5,7), superior temporal gyrus (A41,42), temporal pole (A38), primary and secondary visual cortices (A17,18), anterior and posterior regions of the hypothalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus, pons, medulla oblongata and cerebellum. No changes were seen in globus pallidus and corpus callosum. Since the origin of HA in the brain is dependent upon three main compartments (neuronal, mast cell, vascular smooth muscle), with approximately 60-80% of the total HA belonging to the neuronal pool, on the basis of neurochemical data we postulate that the increase in the levels of HA in SDAT might account for or be associated with alterations in neuroendocrine, cognitive, neurovascular and sleep-wakefulness functions.
2760264	Olfactory marker protein (OMP), previously thought to be expressed only by olfactory receptor neurons and their processes, was localized anatomically with immunocytochemical techniques to a number of brain regions in three rodent species, the mouse, rat, and hamster. In addition, the amount of antigen was quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and characterized by an immunoblot procedure. In all three species the antigen could be detected immunocytochemically in the preoptic region and hypothalamus. The rat did not exhibit immunostaining in any other brain region. However, in the mouse neuronal labelling was observed throughout the neural axis, including cellular labelling in the bed nucleus of the anterior commissure, the median preoptic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the periventricular region, the anterior parvicellular subnucleus of the paraventricular nucleus, around the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (pars compacta), the subincertal region, the arcuate nucleus, the anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, the suprageniculate nucleus, the lateral lemniscal nuclei, the lateraldorsal and lateralventral central gray, the posterior aspects of the commissural and marginal nuclei of the inferior colliculus, the paragenule nucleus, the A-5 region, the area postrema, the ventromedial nucleus of the solitary tract, area X, the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars zonale), and superficial laminae of the spinal cord. The hamster displayed a different pattern of labelling including cells in the periventricular gray, the pontine reticular tegmental nucleus, the A-5 region, the medial vestibular complex, the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, the parvicellular reticular nucleus, the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus, the raphe obscuras, the lateral reticular nucleus, and the lateral nucleus of the cerebellum. Immunostaining was seen in fibers within the red nucleus and within mossy fibers of the cerebellum. OMP levels could only be quantified by radioimmunoassay in the olfactory bulb of the three species and in the hamster cerebellum where they were 1/1,000 of those determined in the olfactory bulb. The authenticity of OMP measured in the RIA and detected immunocytochemically was verified by a double-antibody immunoisolation/immunodetection procedure, which confirmed that the antigen being visualized had the molecular properties expected for OMP. In summary, these experiments demonstrate that authentic OMP exists in small groups of neurons in many areas of the central nervous system.
2771055	Previous studies have suggested that insulin may play a role in the hormonal regulation of neurotransmitter metabolisms within the central nervous system. In order to provide additional information to support this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of insulin receptors within the forebrain of adult male rats. Insulin receptors were localized by immunocytochemistry, using an antibody directed against the carboxy-terminus of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. The antibody specificity was tested by immunoprecipitation of brain insulin receptors with antiserum and the purity of the receptor-antibody preparation was determined using hormone binding-assays with radiolabeled insulin and insulin-like growth factor-l. Insulin receptor-like immunoreactivity was found in a widespread, but selective, distribution on neurons throughout the rat forebrain. Double-labeling with glial fibrillary acidic protein did not demonstrate any detectable insulin receptor-like immunoreactivity on glial cells. Areas with the highest density of insulin receptor-like immunoreactivity were found in the olfactory bulbs, hypothalamus and median eminence, medial habenula, subthalamic nucleus, subfornical organ, CA 1/2 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and piriform cortex. Double-staining of hypothalamic sections with somatostatin and vasopressin antisera revealed insulin receptor-like immunoreactivity on a subpopulation of somatostatin neurons in the periventricular region and on vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus. A moderately dense insulin receptor-like immunoreactivity was observed in layers II-IV of cerebral cortex, medial amygdala, reticular thalamic nucleus, zona incerta, and preoptic and septal regions, whereas a low density of insulin receptor-like immunoreactive neurons was found in basolateral amygdala and most thalamic regions. The basal ganglia and most parts of the thalamus were almost devoid of insulin receptor-like immunoreactivity. Our findings provide morphological support for a direct action of insulin on selected regions of the rat forebrain and suggest that the insulin receptor may modulate synaptic transmission or the release of neurotransmitters and peptide hormones in the CNS.
2778107	This paper describes the vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OXT) immunoreactive structures in the brain and upper spinal cord of the adult male and female Macaca fascicularis. Immunocytochemistry following intraventricular application of colchicine displayed VP neurons in the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), medial amygdaloid nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, area of the locus coeruleus (LC), solitary tract nuclei (NTS), and the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord in addition to those known to exist in the paraventricular, supraoptic, and suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, a dense accumulation of VP fibers was observed in areas such as the DBB, medial septum, BST, amygdala, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, periaquaductal gray, dorsal and ventral raphe, area of Forel, LC region, parabrachial nuclei, and NTS. The lateral septum and lateral habenula displayed no and very few VP fibers, respectively. No extrahypothalamic OXT neurons were found in the brain of this macaque monkey. Dense concentrations of OXT fibers were demonstrated in the amygdala, NTS, and marginal layer of the cervical spinal cord. No sexual dimorphism was found in this primate VP or OXT system. The results show a distribution of the central VP and OXT systems in this primate which is quite different from that in the rat. However, in various aspects it agrees with current data on the VP and OXT systems of the human brain. The present results suggest, therefore, that this monkey might serve as a better model for the human VP system than the rat.
2779758	The regional brain and spinal cord concentrations of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8) were measured in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. The relative order of distribution of CCK-8 in the WKY strain was hippocampus (20.5 +/- 1.3 pmol/g) greater than cortex greater than striatum = hypothalamus greater than midbrain = thalamus greater than spinal cord greater than medulla oblongata/pons (MO/P, 1.6 +/- 0.2 pmol/g) whereas in the SH strain this order was hippocampus (12.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/g) greater than cortex = striatum greater than hypothalamus greater than midbrain greater than thalamus = spinal cord greater than MO/P (1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol/g). The concentrations of CCK-8 in the cerebellum were at the level of assay sensitivity (0.5 pmol/g in both strains). In comparison to the WKY rats, the SH strain had significantly lower levels of CCK-8 in the hippocampus (-37%), cortex (-28%), spinal cord (-23%) and pituitary (-57%). The lowered levels of CCK-8 in the brain of the SH rat may be causally related to, or result from, the cardiovascular, behavioural or morphological abnormalities of this strain.
2784450	The immunocytochemical distribution of authentic proenkephalin-containing perikarya and nerve fibers in the brain of Rana esculenta was determined with antisera directed toward different epitopes of preproenkephalin. The pattern of proenkephalinlike immunoreactivity was similar with antisera directed toward [Met5]-enkephalin, [Met5]-enkephalin-Arg6, [Met5]-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7, [Leu5]-enkephalin, and metorphamide; however, the intensity of the labelling varied depending on the target antigen. Proenkephalin-containing perikarya were located in all major subdivisions of the brain except the metencephalon. In the telencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were detected in the dorsal, medial, and lateral pallium; the medial septal nucleus; the dorsal and ventral striatum; and the amygdala. In the diencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were detected in the preoptic nucleus, in the dorsal and ventral caudal hypothalamus, and in an area that appeared to be homologous to the paraventricular nucleus. In the mesencephalon, numerous immunoreactive perikarya were detected in layer 6 of the optic tectum and a few scattered perikarya were detected in layer 4 of the optic tectum. Immunoreactive perikarya also occurred in the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis. In the rhombencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were detected in the obex region and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Immunoreactive fibers of varying density were observed in all major subdivisions of the brain with the densest accumulations of fibers occurring in the dorsal pallium, the lateral and medial forebrain bundles, the amygdala, the periventricular hypothalamus, the superficial region of the caudolateral brainstem, and in a tract that appeared to be homologous to the tractus solitarius. The extensive system of proenkephalin-containing perikarya and nerve fibers in the brain of an amphibian showed many similarities to the distribution of proenkephalin-containing perikarya and nerve fibers previously described for the amniote brain.
2790932	The septal region represents an important telencephalic center integrating neuronal activity of cortical areas with autonomous processes. To support the functional analysis of this brain area in the guinea pig, the afferent connections to the lateral septal nucleus were investigated by the use of iontophoretically applied horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Retrogradely labeled perikarya were located in telencephalic, diencephalic, mesencephalic and metencephalic sites. The subnuclei of the lateral septum (pars dorsalis, intermedia, ventralis, posterior) receive afferents from the (i) medial septal nucleus, diagonal band of Broca (pars horizontalis and pars ventralis), and the principal nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hippocampus, and amygdala (nucleus medialis): (ii) the medial habenular nucleus, and the para- (peri-) ventricular, parataenial and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus; the anterior, lateral and posterior hypothalamic areas (in particular, the medial and lateral preoptic, suprachiasmatic, periventricular, paraventricular, arcuate, premammillary, and supramammillary nuclei; (iii) the periaquaeductal grey, ventral tegmental area, nucleus interfascicularis, nucleus reticularis linearis, central linear nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus; (iv) dorsal and medial raphe complex, and locus coeruleus. Each subnucleus of the lateral septum displays an individual, differing pattern of afferents from the above-described regions. Based on a double-labeling method, the vasopressinergic and serotonergic afferents to the lateral septum were found to originate in the nucleus paraventricularis hypothalami and the raphe nuclei, respectively.
2794134	The development of cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain was studied by immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the rate-limiting enzyme for acetylcholine synthesis. Since this antibody stained dividing cells in ventricular germinal zones as well as differentiating neurons, likely routes of migration could be inferred on the basis of the location of immunoreactive (IR) cells at different gestational ages. Germinal zones for cholinergic cells were observed in all ventricular zones of the forebrain with the ventral zones generating the earliest cells by gestational day 13.5 (GD13.5). On GD14, ChAT IR cells were visible in the germinal zones of the eye, olfactory ventricle, anterior horn, and dorsolateral aspect of the lateral ventricle, lateral ganglionic eminence, ventro- and dorsolateral third ventricle, and in the pineal anlage (epiphysis). ChAT IR neurons continued to develop in these and additional germinal zones on GD15, including the medial, dorsal, and dorsomedial walls of the lateral ventricle, and the medial and dorsal ganglionic eminence. On GD16, ChAT IR neurons were located in the prelimbic, pyriform, and parietal cortices and the lamina terminalis, and a cluster of IR cells was observed in the ventricular zone of the caudatopallial angle. On GD17-18, neurons in the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, horizontal and vertical nucleus of the diagonal band, and medial septal nucleus stained more darkly and were multipolar, whereas immature bipolar neurons appeared to continue their migration into the hippocampus and along major fiber tracts, such as the corpus callosum, external capsule, fornix and anterior commissure. This study provides a comprehensive view of the zones of origin, probable routes of migration, and final destination of cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain.
2804629	The phenobarbital withdrawal syndrome in rats is characterized by tremors, arched back, weight loss and hyperactivity. This syndrome is shown to be associated with both general and localized increases in cerebral glucose utilization. An increase in glucose utilization (significant at the P less than or equal to 0.001 level) was observed in 72% of the 57 structures examined. Increases in glucose utilization of greater than or equal to 180% of control values were noted in structures associated with the motor system (columns in the frontal sensorimotor cortex, globus pallidus, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and ovoid areas in the cerebellar vermis), thalamic nuclei (lateral and posterior), dorsal lateral geniculate, mammillary body, cingulate cortex, locus ceruleus, and cerebellar flocculus and paraflocculus. The structures showing the greatest increase in glucose utilization were cerebellar paraflocculus (257% of control), columns in the frontal sensorimotor cortex (247% of control) and ovoid areas in the cerebellar vermis (223% of control). Areas of the brain that have been described as cell body areas for serotonergic (raphe), noradrenergic (locus ceruleus), dopaminergic (substantia nigra, zona compacta) and GABAergic (globus pallidus) neurons also showed increases in glucose utilization. The pattern of cerebral glucose utilization accompanying the phenobarbital withdrawal syndrome in rats contrasts with that for morphine withdrawal and exhibits both similarities and differences with respect to ethanol withdrawal.
2808753	The distribution of pancreastatin immunoreactivity was investigated in porcine brain, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and pituitary. In the brain, immunoreactive cell bodies were present in many areas including the cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalic reticular formation, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. Immunoreactive fibres were most abundant in the globus pallidus, stria terminalis, entopeduncular nucleus, hippocampus, and in the substantia nigra. In the spinal cord, immunoreactive cells were found in laminae IV-IX. Immunoreactive fibres were concentrated in the dorsal horn. Pancreastatin immunoreactivity was localised to fibres and small cells (5-10% of the total) in the dorsal root ganglia. In the posterior pituitary, many immunoreactive fibres were present and in the anterior lobe subsets of gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs were pancreastatin-immunoreactive. The localisation of pancreastatin showed a parallel distribution with chromogranin A. Coexistence of pancreastatin with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in cell bodies in the spinal cord, including motoneurones, and with CGRP or galanin immunoreactivities in dorsal root ganglion cells was also noted. The differential pattern of pancreastatin immunostaining was reflected in the extractable levels of peptide with highest concentrations in the cortex (55.8 +/- 6.0 pmol/g wet weight, mean +/- S.E.M.), thalamus (60.0 +/- 5.0 pmol/g), hypothalamus (54.4 +/- 6.5 pmol/g), and anterior pituitary (2,714 +/- 380 pmol/g). Characterisation of pancreastatin immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus and pituitary by gel permeation and high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed multiple molecular forms, one of which was indistinguishable from natural porcine pancreastatin. The widespread distribution of pancreastatin immunoreactivity suggests this peptide may play a part in several neuroendocrine, autonomic, somatic, and sensory functions, and its colocalisation with chromogranin A is consistent with a precursor-product relationship.
2813579	Effects of the Panax ginseng root (PGR) on spontaneous motor activity (vertical and horizontal motor activities), and on monoamine-related substances (tyrosine, DA, DOPAC, 3-MT, HVA, NE, MHPG, tryptophan, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA) in discrete brain areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, corpus striatum, limbic lobe, midbrain, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata) of ddY male mice (weighing 18-22 g) were examined using an infrared photo-cell counter and HPLC with electrochemical detection. PGR (100 mg/kg) was orally administered, twice a day, for 2 successive weeks (2W-group) or 7 successive weeks (7W-group). Vertical and horizontal motor activities increased significantly in the 7W-group but not in the 2W-group when compared to those of the control group. As to brain monoamine-related substances, the metabolism of DA and NE in the cerebral cortex and of 5-HT in the corpus striatum and cerebellum in the 2W-group were facilitated, while metabolism of DA in the corpus striatum and of 5-HT in the hypothalamus and midbrain were inhibited. In the 7W-group, except for a facilitated metabolism of 5-HT in the cerebellum, metabolism of DA, NE and 5-HT in all discrete brain areas were inhibited. These results show that PGR exerts an influence on the CNS.
2821415	Visual and auditory projections to the caudate nucleus were studied in cat by combination of the HPR method and experimental degeneration of retinal axons. It was shown that visual information comes to the caudate nucleus not only through the well-known polysynaptic pathways from the cerebral cortex, but also through both oligosynaptic (via pulvinar, lateroposterior nucleus, suprageniculate nucleus and nucleus limitans of the thalamus) and disynaptic pathways (via medial and lateral terminal nuclei of the accessory optic tract, pulvinar, pretectum, intermediate superior colliculus layer, supraoptic nucleus) some of which were found for the first time. Direct retinal inputs to the suprageniculate nucleus were found. Additional sources of auditory information to the caudate nucleus were revealed being as follows: the dorsal nucleus of parvocellular division of the medial geniculate nucleus, deep superior colliculus layer, dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. Physiological significance of the revealed pathways for the possible transmission of visual and auditory impulses and a new principle of organization of sensory inputs to the caudate nucleus are discussed.
2822770	With an antibody specific for L-histidine decarboxylase (HD) in combination with immunohistochemical techniques and retrograde fluorescent tracing, the morphology, distribution, and projections of the histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus were studied in the adult male rat. Magnocellular neurons, situated on both sides of the mammillary recess and close to the ventral surface of the brain rostral and caudal to the mammillary bodies, were found to contain HD-immunoreactivity (HD-i). In addition to these magnocellular neurons, a substantial number of small and medium-sized neurons were immunostained, as were strands of cells of all sizes bridging the HD-i cell groups. A detailed mapping of the HD-i cells in frontal, sagittal, and horizontal sections showed that these neurons make up one continuous cell group, defined as the tuberomammillary nucleus (TM). This nucleus can be divided into several subgroups. Thus, approximately 600 HD-i neurons situated on each side of the mammillary recess compose the medial subgroup of the TM (TMM). The ventral subgroup of the TM (TMV) consists of some 1,500 neurons situated at the ventral surface of the brain, rostral (TMVr) and caudal (TMVc) to the mammillary bodies. The TMM contains a greater proportion of parvicellular neurons compared to the TMV. About 100 HD-i cells are scattered within the lateral hypothalamic area, the posterior hypothalamic region, the perifornical area, the supramammillary nucleus, and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus. These cells are collectively named the diffuse part of the TM (TMdiff). The morphological differences between the TMM and the TMV did not signal differences in the efferent connections of these subgroups. Thus, single injections of the fluorescent tracer Fast Blue into different regions of the brain, including the spinal cord, resulted in retrograde labeling of HD-i neurons, which were distributed throughout the TM with no discernible topographic pattern. More specifically, each subgroup of the TM contributed projections innervating or passing through a large number of brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, cerebellum, tectum, medulla, and spinal cord. The widespread projections of the HD-i neurons contrasted to the more specific projections observed from non HD-i neurons in cell groups situated around the TM. Taken together, these findings suggest that the HD-i cells of the posterior hypothalamus constitute one major nucleus, the TM, and that this nucleus may be subdivided into three components, each of which has diffuse projections throughout the neuraxis.
2823193	The distribution of binding sites in the rat CNS for a synthetic analogue of eel calcitonin, [Asu1-7]eel calcitonin (carboCT) was investigated. This distribution was compared to that for the natural peptide to see whether a modified molecule would also reveal different classes of binding sites for CT. The regional distribution of 125I-carboCT binding in coronal sections of rat CNS was examined by an in vitro autoradiographic technique. Non-specific binding was assessed after addition of excess cold carboCT or eel CT and the results showed that carboCT binding is specific and that it is displaced equally by cold carboCT and by eel CT. There was dense labelling in the nucleus accumbens, in the tractus striohypothalamicus, in the anterior and posterior part of the hypothalamus except for the nucleus ventromedialis, in the amygdala, in the pars medialis of the reticular formation, in the nucleus ruber, in the periventricular gray and in the raphe magnus. Grains were less dense in the hypothalamus lateralis, in the substantia nigra and in the nucleus interpeduncularis. In contrast to eel CT, carboCT did not bind in the spinal cord, nor did carboCT prevent eel CT binding in this area, whereas it was able to prevent it in the brain. These results are consistent with the existence of different classes of binding sites for CT in rat brain and in spinal cord, and indicate that the substitution of the S-S bond with a C-C bond in the eel CT molecule makes the peptide more selective for one class of binding sites.
2823984	The effects of a specific GABA receptor agonist, progabide, have been examined on local cerebral glucose utilization through the use of the autoradiographic [14C]2-deoxyglucose technique in conscious rats. The intraperitoneal administration of progabide (80-320 mg.kg-1) resulted in a heterogeneous pattern of significantly reduced glucose utilization throughout the 50 discrete regions of the brain that were studied. Insignificant decreases in local cerebral glucose use were noted following the low dose of progabide (80 mg.kg-1). Following progabide (160 mg.kg-1), reductions of approximately 20% in glucose utilization were observed in most of the extrapyramidal system (substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata; globus pallidus; caudate nucleus), some thalamic nuclei (lateral geniculate body, anterior and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei), a number of areas related to the limbic system (cingulate cortex; amygdala; hypothalamus; lateral habenula; nucleus accumbens; dorsal hippocampus as well as the CA3 field) and the raphé nuclei. In contrast, layer IV of the neocortex, the cerebellum and cerebellar nuclei, displayed only minimal (10-15%) reductions in glucose utilization. At the highest dose (320 mg.kg-1) examined, progabide effected widespread though heterogeneously distributed decreases in glucose use. The overall pattern of decreased glucose use seen with progabide was different from that noted with previously studied GABA-mimetic drugs, such as muscimol, except for those changes observed in the extrapyramidal and sensory-motor areas for which similar dose-response relationships occurred. A significant correlation was observed between progabide-induced decreases in glucose utilization and in serotonin synthesis in a number of brain areas. The pattern of progabide-induced changes in integrated functional activity is compatible with its neurochemical spectrum and could indicate the loci at which its anticonvulsant, antidepressant and extrapyramidal activities are initiated.
2824075	Circadian rhythms were measured in alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic, acetylcholine muscarinic (ACh), and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in small regions of rat brain. Rhythms in alpha 1-receptor binding were measured in olfactory bulb, frontal, cingulate, piriform, parietal, temporal and occipital cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, pons-medulla, caudate-putamen and thalamus-septum. No rhythm was found in cerebellum. Rhythms in alpha 2-receptor binding were measured in frontal, parietal and temporal cortex, and pons-medulla. No rhythm was found in cingulate, piriform or occipital cortex, or hypothalamus. Rhythms in binding to beta-receptors were measured in olfactory bulb, piriform, insular, parietal and temporal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. No rhythms were found in frontal, entorhinal, cingulate, or occipital cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, or pons-medulla. Rhythms in ACh receptor binding were measured in olfactory bulb, parietal cortex and caudate-putamen. No rhythms were found in frontal or occipital cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, thalamus-septum, pons-medulla or cerebellum. Rhythms in BDZ receptor binding were measured in olfactory bulb, olfactory and occipital cortex, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate-putamen, hippocampus and cerebellum. No rhythms were found in parietal cortex, pons-medulla or thalamus-septum. The 24-hr mean binding to receptors varied between 3- and 10-fold, the highest in cortex and the lowest, usually, in cerebellum. The piriform cortex was particularly high in alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors; the nucleus accumbens and caudate, in ACh receptors; and the amygdala, in BDZ receptors. Most adrenergic and ACh receptor rhythms peaked in subjective night (the period when lights were off under L:D conditions), whereas most BDZ receptor rhythms peaked in subjective day (the time lights were on in L:D). Perhaps in the rat, a nocturnal animal, the adrenergic and ACh receptors mediate activity and the functions that accompany it, and the BDZ receptors mediate rest, and with it, sleep.
2826551	Afferent and efferent connections of the limb specific divisions of the cat magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) were traced using the bidirectional transport of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase complex (WGA-HRP). Injection sites within forelimb or hindlimb RNm regions were identified by microelectrode recording and confirmed by the position of labeled rubrospinal terminals. Additional injections into structures that project to, or receive input from, RNm confirmed the somatotopic organization of these pathways. The forelimb region of RNm receives input from the posteriolateral part of the anterior interpositus nucleus (NIA) and the intermediate part of the posterior interpositus nucleus (NIP). The hindlimb region of RNm receives input from anteriomedial NIA and medial NIP. Terminals of NIA cells densely fill all of RNm, but terminals of NIP cells form a half shell on the medial, ventral, and posterior borders of RNm without encroaching on RNm's lateral edge or central core. Forelimb and hindlimb RNm are reciprocally connected with the caudal cuneate and gracile nuclei respectively. There is little or no input to RNm from the medial or lateral cerebellar nuclei. Forelimb RNm, which also contains a face representation, projects to the lateral reticular nucleus, cell group f of the inferior vestibular nucleus, the facial nucleus, the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the caudal cuneate nucleus, the parvicellular reticular formation, and cervical segments of the spinal cord. A few fibers from forelimb RNm project directly to motor neurons in the lower cervical cord. Hindlimb RNm projects to only the lateral reticular nucleus, gracile nucleus, and lower spinal segments. Forelimb and hindlimb RNm project to different regions of the lateral reticular nucleus with some overlap.
2828283	After injection of 3H 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 to adult rats and mice, under normal or vitamin D deficient diet, the hormone was found to be accumulated in nuclei of neurons in certain brain regions. Nuclear concentration was prevented or diminished, when excess unlabeled 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 was injected before 3H 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3, while excess 25 (OH) vitamin D3 did not prevent nuclear labeling. Highest nuclear concentration of 3H 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 is observed in certain neurons in the nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis, involving its septo-preoptic pars dorsolateralis and its anterior hypothalamic-thalamic portion, and in the nucleus centralis of the amygdala, all constituting a system of target neurons linked by a component of the stria terminalis. Nuclear concentration of 3H 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 is also found in neurons in the periventricular nucleus of the preoptic-hypothalamic region, including its extensions, the parvocellular paraventricular and arcuate nucleus, in the ventromedial nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, ventral hippocampus, caudate nucleus, pallium, in the midbrain-pontine central gray, dorsal raphe nucleus, parabrachial nuclei, cranial motor nuclei, substantia gelatinosa of the sensory nucleus of the trigeminus, Golgi type II cells of the cerebellum, and others. The extensive distribution of target neurons suggests that 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 regulates the production of several aminergic and peptidergic messengers, and influences the activity of certain endocrine-autonomic, sensory and motor systems.
2834664	The pharmacological characteristics and anatomical distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the striatum (dorsal striatum, comprising the caudate nucleus and putamen, and ventral striatum) and globus pallidus (dorsal pallidum, comprising the external and internal segments, and ventral pallidum) of the human basal ganglia were examined in twelve cases aged 4-71 years. The pharmacology of the receptors was studied using computerized, non-linear least-squares regression analysis of [3H]flunitrazepam displacement by flunitrazepam, CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding to membranes. The results showed that the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) contained higher concentrations of receptors than the dorsal pallidum (external and internal segments). The dorsal striatum contained equal numbers of sites with high affinity (Type I) and low affinity (Type II) for CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate whereas the globus pallidus contained sites with only high affinity (Type I) for these ligands. The anatomical localization of the benzodiazepine receptor subtypes (Type I and II) was studied using quantitative autoradiography following in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with [3H]flunitrazepam in the absence or presence of the discriminating ligand CL218,872. The autoradiograms showed that benzodiazepine receptors were distributed throughout all regions of the human striatum in a heterogeneous fashion, i.e. high-density patches of receptors were set against a background matrix of lower receptor densities. The highest densities of receptors were seen in the ventral striatum where the patches were particularly extensive and showed densities 56% higher than the receptor densities in the dorsal striatal patches. Quantitative analysis showed that the patches in all striatal regions contained mainly Type II receptors (83%-86%) whereas the matrix regions in the ventral and dorsal striatum contained different proportions of the receptor subtypes; Type I receptors predominated (60%) in the matrix of the ventral striatum and Type II receptors predominated (67%-71%) in the matrix of the dorsal striatum. By contrast, the autoradiograms showed that the globus pallidus contained considerably lower concentrations of receptors than the striatum. The highest density of receptors in the globus pallidus was present in the ventral pallidum with successively lower concentrations in the external (26% less) and internal (66% less) segments of the dorsal pallidum. In agreement with the membrane binding studies the receptors in the globus pallidus were mainly of the Type I variety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2836036	Afferent projections to the parafascicular nucleus of the rat have been mapped using the retrograde transport of unconjugated wheat germ agglutinin and immunohistochemistry using very short survival times. Retrogradely labelled neurones were found in laminae V and V1 of primary motor cortex, lamina V1 of primary somatosensory cortex, and deep laminae of gustatory cortex; in the reticular thalamic nucleus and zona incerta; and in the caudate-putamen, entopeduncular nucleus, mesencephalic reticular formation and pretectum. Additional label was found in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus, dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei, vestibular nuclei and the lateral cervical, medial and interpositus nuclei of the cerebellum. These results are discussed in the context of the connections of parafascicular nucleus with the motor system, particularly the basal ganglia. Of particular interest are inputs from laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus reticularis of thalamus, mesencephalic reticular formation, nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus, primary motor cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. These indicate that the parafascicular nucleus lies at an interface between the reticular activating system on the one hand, and the motor system on the other. This result thus enlarges on present concepts of the parafascicular nucleus. Comparison of afferent projections to a variety of non-specific thalamic nuclei, the parafascicular, paraventricular and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, indicate a remarkable set of topographic parallels from cortical, reticular thalamic, hypothalamic and brainstem sites. These comparisons provide clues as to the organisational principles of these non-specific thalamic nuclei, particularly in the context of the reticular activating system.
2843998	We report here that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in the rat central nervous system (CNS). In frontoparietal cortex homogenates, the stimulation by CRF was dependent on time, temperature, tissue protein concentration, and guanine nucleotides. The rank order of potency for CRF analogs and fragments in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity [(Nle21,38) rat CRF greater than rat CRF approximately equal to acetyl ovine CRF (4-41) approximately equal to alpha helical ovine CRF greater than ovine CRF much greater than ovine CRF (1-39) approximately equal to ovine CRF (7-41)] was consistent with their affinities for CRF receptors in the brain and their relative potencies in stimulating pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion in vitro. The putative CRF receptor antagonist, alpha helical ovine CRF (9-41), did not stimulate adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production but was able to attenuate the stimulation by various concentrations of rat CRF. The regional distribution of 125I-Tyr(o)-ovine CRF binding (olfactory bulb greater than frontoparietal cortex approximately equal to cerebellum greater than hypothalamus greater than striatum greater than or equal to midbrain greater than hippocampus greater than or equal to spinal cord) did not correspond with the regional degree of CRF receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase (frontoparietal cortex greater than olfactory bulb greater than or equal to cerebellum greater than midbrain greater than or equal to hippocampus greater than striatum greater than or equal to hypothalamus greater than spinal cord). In addition, marked differences were observed in the ability of forskolin to potentiate CRF-stimulated cAMP production in the various brain areas examined. In summary, these data demonstrate that at least one of the second-messenger systems mediating the effects of CRF in the CNS involves stimulation of cAMP production and provides further support for a neurotransmitter role for this neuropeptide in the brain. Significant differences in the regulation of CRF-stimulated cAMP production and the disparity between CRF receptor number and receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activity in discrete regions of the rat CNS suggest that some populations of CRF receptors in the brain may be functionally coupled to alternative signal transduction mechanisms.
2844998	A human cDNA clone containing the 5' coding region of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor alpha subunit was used to quantify and visualize receptor mRNA in various regions of the rat brain. Using a [32P]CTP-labelled antisense RNA probe (860 bases) prepared from the alpha subunit cDNA, multiple mRNA species were detected in Northern blots using total and poly A rat brain RNA. In all brain regions, mRNAs of 4.4 and 4.8 kb were observed, and an additional mRNA of 3.0 kb was detected in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The level of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor mRNA was highest in the cerebellum followed by the thalamus = frontal cortex = hippocampus = parietal cortex = hypothalamus much greater than pons = striatum = medulla. In situ hybridization revealed high levels of alpha subunit mRNA in cerebellar gray matter, olfactory bulb, thalamus, hippocampus/dentate gyrus, and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These data suggest the presence of multiple GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor alpha subunit mRNAs in rat brain and demonstrate the feasibility of studying the expression of genes encoding the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor after pharmacological and/or environmental manipulation.
2845023	Nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor expression was studied in rats between embryonic day 11 (E11) to postnatal day 10 (PND10) by using a monoclonal antibody, 192-IgG, that specifically recognizes rat NGF receptor. Sympathetic ganglia were lightly stained by 192-IgG for NGF receptor immunoreactivity (NGFRI) (E11-PND10). Neural crest-derived sensory ganglia were moderately to densely stained (E11-PND10). Areas in CNS innervated by the central processes of these ganglia were also stained. Parasympathetic ciliary ganglion showed some detectable staining (E16-PND6). Placode-derived sensory ganglia were stained more densely than that of neural crest-derived sensory ganglia. The most densely stained tissue for NGFRI was found in all peripheral nerves. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons were NGFRI positive from E15 throughout the period examined. Motoneurons in both spinal cord and brain stem were positive for NGFRI between E15 and PND10. NGFRI staining was seen in a variety of sensory pathways and related structures, such as olfactory tract and glomerular layer of olfactory bulb; retina, optic nerve and tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, and olivary pretectal nucleus; ventral cochlear nucleus and to a lesser degree in dorsal cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and nucleus of lateral lemniscus; solitary tract; cuneate nucleus, gracile nucleus, and ventroposterior thalamic nucleus. The specific staining was also found in some other CNS structures, including brain-stem reticular formation; amygdala; medial nucleus of inferior olive but not the rest of inferior olive, external granule cell layer and Purkinje's cells of cerebellum, and deep cerebellar nuclei. Some non-neuronal tissues such as meninges and dental tissue showed very distinctive staining. Limb buds and somites were NGFRI positive starting at E11, and the staining on muscle tissue became very dense at E15-E18 and largely disappeared around PND10. Embryonic thymus was positive for NGFRI. The adventitia surrounding blood vessels was very densely stained. The changes in NGFRI staining seen in this study suggest that NGF may have broader effects during development than previously thought.
2845057	The distribution of the central omega 1 (benzodiazepine1; BZD1) and omega 2 (BZD2) receptor subtypes has been studied autoradiographically in monkey and human brain sections using [3H]flunitrazepam (which binds indiscriminately to omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes) and [3H]zolpidem (which recognizes selectively the omega 1 subtype). Both ligands labeled an homogeneous population of binding sites (Kd values approximately equal to 1.5 nM and approximately equal to 5 nM, respectively) whose pharmacological characteristics were similar to those of central omega (BZD) receptors. Regional displacement studies in monkey brain showed that zolpidem was a more effective displacer of [3H]flunitrazepam from omega 1-than from omega 2-enriched areas. For example, it was 73-fold more potent in the cerebellum (omega 1-enriched) than in the dentate gyrus (omega 2-enriched). Zolpidem thus selectively recognizes omega 1 sites in primate brain. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam (omega 1 + omega 2) binding sites in primate brain was highly heterogeneous. Very high densities were observed in lamina IV of the neocortex (with higher densities in the occipital than in the frontal pole), the substantia innominata and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Intermediate densities were found in other neocortical laminae, cerebellum (molecular layer), claustrum, globus pallidus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus (granular layer) and the majority of thalamic nuclei. Structures displaying low binding densities included the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. The regional distribution pattern of [3H]zolpidem binding sites was qualitatively similar to that of [3H]flunitrazepam but the relative density of the 3H-ligands differed in several brain regions. The relative density of omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes in each particular primate brain region was evaluated by measuring 1) the ratio of [3H]zolpidem to [3H]flunitrazepam binding; 2) [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the presence and in the absence of 100 nM zolpidem. With both approaches, a preferential enrichment in omega 1 sites was observed in lamina IV of sensorimotor cortical regions and in the extrapyramidal motor system (globus pallidus, ventral thalamic complex, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and cerebellum). In contrast, omega 2 sites predominated in limbic areas (e.g., the dentate gyrus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, cingulate and parahippocampal gyri) and in the anterior thalamic nucleus and caudate nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2846794	Common efferent projections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex were examined in 3 rhesus monkeys by placing injections of tritiated amino acids and HRP in frontal and parietal cortices, respectively, of the same hemisphere. Terminal labeling originating from both frontal and parietal injection sites was found to be in apposition in 15 ipsilateral cortical areas: the supplementary motor cortex, the dorsal premotor cortex, the ventral premotor cortex, the anterior arcuate cortex (including the frontal eye fields), the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, the frontoparietal operculum, the insular cortex, the medial parietal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus, the presubiculum, the caudomedial lobule, and the medial prestriate cortex. Convergent terminal labeling was observed in the contralateral hemisphere as well, most prominently in the principal sulcal cortex, the superior arcuate cortex, and the superior temporal cortex. In certain common target areas, as for example the cingulate cortices, frontal and parietal efferents terminate in an array of interdigitating columns, an arrangement much like that observed for callosal and associational projections to the principal sulcus (Goldman-Rakic and Schwartz, 1982). In other areas, frontal and parietal terminals exhibit a laminar complementarity: in the depths of the superior temporal sulcus, prefrontal terminals are densely distributed within laminae I, III, and V, whereas parietal terminals occupy mainly laminae IV and VI directly below the prefrontal bands. Subcortical structures also receive apposing or overlapping projections from both prefrontal and parietal cortices. The dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices project to adjacent, longitudinal domains of the neostriatum, as has been described previously (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985); these projections are also found in close apposition in the claustrum, the amygdala, the caudomedial lobule, and throughout the anterior medial, medial dorsal, lateral dorsal, and medial pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus. In the brain stem, both areas of association cortex project to the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus and to the midline reticular formation of the pons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2854273	The effect of chronic administration of methimazole (0.05% w/v) in drinking water for 32 days to male Sprague-Dawley rats on the binding of opioid ligands, 3H-Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAGO, mu-receptors), 3H-Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr (DSTLE, delta-receptors) and 3H-ethylketocyclazocine (EKC, kappa-receptors) to membranes of brain regions was determined. Chronic administration of methimazole to rats decreased their rate of body weight gain, colonic temperature, systolic blood pressure and heart rate in comparison to vehicle-treated rats. Administration of methimazole also decreased the serum concentration of triiodothyronine (total T3) and T4 when compared to vehicle-treated rats. The binding of 3H-DAGO to membranes of amygdala, pons and medulla, striatum, midbrain and cortex of methimazole-treated rats was greater than vehicle-treated rats, however, the binding to membranes of hypothalamus in the two treatment groups did not differ. The binding of 3H-DSTLE in amygdala and hypothalamus of methimazole-treated rats did not differ but it was significantly greater in pons and medulla, midbrain, cortex and striatum of methimazole-treated rats than vehicle-treated rats. The binding of 3H-EKC to membranes of pons and medulla was lower and of striatum and cortex of methimazole-treated rats was significantly greater than vehicle-treated rats, but the binding to membranes of amygdala, hypothalamus, and midbrain of the two treatment groups did not differ. The results indicate that brain, mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors are differentially altered in hypothyroidism.
2855103	The distribution of melatonin receptors in six discrete brain areas of mature (3-4 months old) and aged (greater than 24 months old) male rats was recorded every 4 h during a 24-hour light: dark cycle (L:D 14:10h). 125I-melatonin was used as a melatonin receptor probe. In the mature animals, specific binding of 125I-melatonin was found in all brain areas investigated, i.e. hypothalamus, medulla pons, hippocampus, cerebellum, parietal cortex and striatum. The density of 125I-melatonin-binding sites in the hypothalamus, medulla pons and hippocampus exhibited clear diurnal rhythms with different patterns and phases. No such rhythm was evident in the cerebellum, parietal cortex and striatum. The apparent affinity of the binding sites was similar in all the brain regions and did not change at any of the times recorded. In the old male rats, the density of 125I-melatonin binding sites in the hypothalamus was only 10% of that in the mature animals at 13 h after the onset of light and was vanishingly small throughout the 24-hour period. The 24-hour mean of the binding site density in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and medulla pons was significantly lower than in mature rats with no apparent diurnal variations. The age-related decrease in the density of melatonin-binding sites was less pronounced in the cerebellum and striatum. In all brain areas tested, apart from the hypothalamus, the decrease in receptor densities was not accompanied by changes in the apparent affinity towards the ligand.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2855912	A new, highly selective radio-iodinated oxytocin receptor antagonist [( 1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid, 2-O-methyltyrosine, 4-threonine, 8-ornithine, 9-tyrosylamide]-vasotocin) was used to identify and quantitate specific binding sites for the neurohypophyseal hormone oxytocin with in vitro incubation of rat brain sections and autoradiography. Exclusively oxytocin binding sites were detected in view of the high affinity of the [125I]-labelled oxytocin antagonist for oxytocin binding sites and the negligible affinity for the vasopressin liver (V1) and kidney (V2) receptor types. The putative oxytocin receptors were abundantly present in several brain regions, where previously discrimination between oxytocin and vasopressin binding was difficult, i.e. the olfactory nucleus, the islands of Calleja, the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the central amygdaloid nucleus and the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus. In addition oxytocin receptors were demonstrated in other areas, such as the taenia tecta, dorsolateral caudate putamen, ventral pallidum, accumbens, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, lateral, basolateral and medial amygdala, the dorsal subiculum, perirhinal cortex and the amygdaloid-hippocampal area. The high affinity and the low detection threshold of this [125I]-labelled oxytocin antagonist permitted identification of oxytocin receptors in new regions such as the ventral part of the lateral septum, medial septum, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the olive nuclei in the brain stem.
2864360	The distribution of central neurons displaying somatostatin immunoreactivity was studied using three monoclonal antibodies to cyclic somatostatin. The sensitive ABC immunoperoxidase technique was employed. A large number of positive cell groups including many previously undescribed populations were detected throughout the brain and spinal cord. Telencephalic somatostatin neurons included periglomerular cells in the olfactory bulb, mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb, and multipolar cells in the anterior olfactory nuclei, neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, lateral septum, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. Within the hypothalamus, positive neurons were found in the periventricular, suprachiasmatic, and arcuate nuclei, and throughout the anterior and lateral hypothalamus. The entopeduncular nucleus and zona incerta contained many positive neurons, and the lateral habenula had a dense terminal field suggesting a pallidohabenula somatostatin pathway. Somatostatin neurons were also found in association with many sensory systems. Positive cells were present in the superior and inferior colliculi, the ventral cochlear nuclei, the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, nucleus cuneatus, nucleus gracilus, and the substantia gelatinosa. Various cerebellar circuits also displayed somatostatin immunoreactivity. Golgi cells throughout the cerebellar cortex were intensely stained, and some Purkinje cells in the paraflocculus also showed a positive reaction. Positive fibers were present in the granular layer and large varicose fibers were present in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Many nuclei known to project to the cerebellum, including the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the medial accessory inferior olive, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, and many areas of the reticular formation contained positive neurons. These studies demonstrate that these new monoclonal antibodies are of great value for the study of central somatostatin systems. Previously described somatostatin systems are readily detected with these antibodies, and in addition, many otherwise unrecognized somatostatin cell groups have been discovered.
2867111	In this study we have investigated the presence of immunoreactive calcitonin in the central nervous system and pituitary of sheep. The calcitonin concentrations were determined radioimmunologically by two different antibodies. We have demonstrated calcitonin in extracts of areas of the central nervous system, whole pituitary, thyroid gland and plasma of 21 sheep. The concentrations were (ng/g wet weight, mean values +/- SE): thyroid 16.0 +/- 4.4, pituitary 2.03 +/- 0.34, reticular formation 1.64 +/- 0.25, substantia nigra 1.53 +/- 0.46, dentate nucleus 1.11 +/- 0.27, putamen 1.05 +/- 0.35, hippocampus 0.97 +/- 0.17, fornix 0.96 +/- 0.15, anterior thalamus 0.92 +/- 0.28, mammillary body 0.88 +/- 0.12, cerebellum 0.86 +/- 0.09, caudate nucleus 0.84 +/- 0.11, posterior hypothalamus 0.83 +/- 0.19, epiphysis 0.75 +/- 0.25, thalamus centralis 0.71 +/- 0.10, almond nucleus 0.69 +/- 0.16, medulla oblongata 0.67 +/- 0.15, anterior hypothalamus 0.66 +/- 0.20, precentral gyrus 0.66 +/- 0.16, globus pallidus 0.63 +/- 0.31, postcentral gyrus 0.36 +/- 0.08 and plasma (ng/ml) 0.058 +/- 0.013. Our results demonstrate that immunoreactive calcitonin is present in the central nervous system (CNS) of sheep, compatible with a neurotransmitter function for this hormone.
2867149	Aldehyde reductase (AR) activity was measured in whole brain, different brain areas, kidney and duodenum of 23-26 months old rats and then compared to matched animals of 3 months. No significant changes in AR activity were found in whole brain of old rats with D-glucose as substrate. A significant increase in AR activity in old rats was found in striatum (12%), cerebellum (26%), midbrain (6%), brainstem (19%) and hypothalamus (13%) with p-nitrobenzaldehyde, in striatum (14%), midbrain (10%), brainstem (52%), hypothalamus (9%) and hippocampus (20%) with D-glucuronate, in cerebellum (21%) with D-xylose, in striatum (43%), cerebellum (19%) and brainstem (22%) with DL-glyceraldehyde, and in brainstem (15%) with pyridine 3-aldehyde. A significant decrease in AR activity in old rats was found in midbrain (16%), brainstem (19%) and hypothalamus (19%) with D-xylose, and in midbrain (13%) with DL-glyceraldehyde. A significant decrease in AR activity in old rats was found in kidney with p-nitrobenzaldehyde (30%), D-xylose (31%), DL-glyceraldehyde (33%), pyridine 3-aldehyde (27%) and in duodenum with p-nitrobenzaldehyde (21%), but a significant increase was found in duodenum with pyridine 3-aldehyde (29%). Preliminary experiments show an increase (42%) of sorbitol dehydrogenase activity in whole brain of old rats. The present results clearly indicate that the AR activity increase in the brain of old rats is the high-Km form of aldehyde reductase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2869491	The distribution and properties of receptors for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) were analyzed in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys. Binding of [125I]tyrosine-labeled ovine CRF to frontal cortex and amygdala membrane-rich fractions was saturable, specific, and time- and temperature-dependent, reaching equilibrium in 30 min at 23 degrees C. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated one class of high-affinity sites with a Kd of 1 nM and a concentration of 125 fmol/mg (approximately equal to 30% of the receptor number in monkey anterior pituitary membranes). As in the rat pituitary and brain, CRF receptors in monkey cerebral cortex and amygdala were coupled to adenylate cyclase. Autoradiographic analysis of specific CRF binding in brain sections revealed that the receptors were widely distributed in the cerebral cortex and limbic system. Receptor density was highest in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary and throughout the cerebral cortex, specifically in the prefrontal, frontal, orbital, cingulate, insular, and temporal areas, and in the cerebellar cortex. A very high binding density was also present in the hippocampus, mainly in the dentate gyrus, and in the arcuate nucleus and nucleus tuberis lateralis. A high binding density was present in the amygdaloid complex and mamillary bodies, olfactory tubercle, and medial portion of the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus. A moderate binding density was found in the nucleus accumbens, claustrum, caudate-putamen, paraventricular and posterior lateral nuclei of the thalamus, inferior colliculus, and dorsal parabrachial nucleus. A low binding density was present in the superior colliculus, locus coeruleus, substantia gelatinosa, preoptic area, septal area, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These data demonstrate that receptors for CRF are present within the primate brain at areas related to the central control of visceral function and behavior, suggesting that brain CRF may serve as a neurotransmitter in the coordination of endocrine and neural mechanisms involved in the response to stress.
2872937	In the squirrel monkey, 164 brain sites yielding vocalization when electrically stimulated were tested for their capability to produce vocalization when injected with mono-sodium-L-glutamate. The sites were located in the anterior limbic cortex, n. accumbens, substantia innominata, amygdala, n. striae terminalis, hypothalamus, midline thalamus, field H of Forel, substantia nigra, periventricular and periaqueductal gray, inferior colliculus, reticular formation of midbrain, pons and medulla, inferior olive, lateral reticular nucleus and nucleus of solitary tract. Of the 164 sites tested, 31 were positive. These were located in the substantia innominata, caudal periventricular and periaqueductal gray, lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation. While all the calls obtained from the forebrain and midbrain had a normal acoustic structure, most pontine and all medullary vocalizations had an artificial character. It is concluded that: the substantia innominata, caudal periventricular and periaqueductal gray, lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation represent relay stations of vocalization-controlling pathways; the periaqueductal gray represents the lowest relay station above the level of motor coordination; neurons responsible for motor coordination of vocalization lie in the reticular formation around the caudal brachium conjunctivum, the superior olive, n. facialis, n. ambiguus and below the n. solitarius; not all areas from which vocalization can be obtained by electrical stimulation of nerve cell bodies, dendrites and nerve endings (in contrast to fibers en passage) also yield vocalization when stimulated with glutamate.
2874159	The neuroanatomical distribution of dynorphin B-like immunoreactivity (DYN-B) was studied in the adult male and female albino rat. The distribution of DYN B in colchicine- and noncolchicine-treated animals was also compared to that of another opioid peptide derived from the prodynorphin precursor dynorphin A (1-8) (DYN 1-8), and an opioid peptide derived from the proenkephalin precursor met-enkephalin-arg-gly-leu (MERGL). DYN B cell bodies were present in nonpyramidal cells of neo- and allocortices, medium-sized cells of the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, lateral part of the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, and in sectors of nearly every hypothalamic nucleus and area, medial pretectal area, and nucleus of the optic tract, periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei, cuneiform nucleus, sagulum, retrorubral nucleus, peripeduncular nucleus, lateral terminal nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, lateral superior olivary nucleus, superior paraolivary nucleus, medial superior olivary nucleus, ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus, accessory trigeminal nucleus, solitary nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, paratrigeminal nucleus, area postrema, lateral reticular nucleus, and ventrolateral region of the reticular formation. Fiber systems are present that conform to many of the known output systems of these nuclei, including major descending pathways (e.g., striatonigral, striatopallidal, reticulospinal, hypothalamospinal pathways), short projection systems (e.g., mossy fibers in hippocampus, hypothalamo-hypophyseal pathways), and local circuit pathways (e.g., in cortex, hypothalamus). The distribution of MERGL was, with a few notable exceptions, in the same nuclei as DYN B. From these neuroanatomical data, it appears that the dynorphin and enkephalin peptides are strategically located in brain regions that regulate extrapyramidal motor function, cardiovascular and water balance systems, eating, sensory processing, and pain perception.
2874525	High affinity somatostatin receptors have been measured in postmortem brains from 18 neurologically asymptomatic patients (mean age: 67 years) using the stable somatostatin analog 125I-204-090, DPhe-Cys-Tyr-DTrp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr(ol), as radioligand. In homogenates from human frontal cortex, high affinity (Kd = 0.52 nM; Bmax = 557 fmol/mg protein) receptors with pharmacological specificity for somatostatin, [D-Trp8]somatostatin and somatostatin-28 were found. The CNS distribution of these receptors was studied by autoradiography. Somatostatin receptors were distributed in varying densities throughout the whole brain. High concentrations are found in all cortical layers, the deeper layers (V-VI) being usually more dense than the superficial layers (I-III). The limbic system is heavily labeled, in particular hippocampus (CA1, dentate gyrus), most of the nuclei of the amygdala, and the habenula. Also parts of the basal ganglia are very rich in somatostatin receptors: the nucleus caudatus as well as the nucleus accumbens are very dense, whereas the globus pallidus is virtually unlabeled. Interestingly, significant amounts of somatostatin receptors are found in the human cerebellum, which is devoid of endogenous somatostatin. Other discrete areas of the CNS are enriched with somatostatin receptors: locus coeruleus, tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus, claustum, tuberculum olfactorium as well as spinal trigeminal nucleus and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. The substantia innominata is poor in somatostatin receptors. In general there is a good correlation in the distribution of somatostatin receptors in the human and rat brain and there is a reasonable correlation with endogenous somatostatin levels in human brain tissue, particularly in the larger structures. The very high density and the specific localization of somatostatin receptors in strategic key points in the CNS such as cortex, basal ganglia, limbic system and substantia gelatinosa suggests an important role of somatostatin in cognitive, sensory and extrapyramidal motor functions. The significance of somatostatin receptors in the human cerebellum remains to be elucidated.
2882801	[3H]-spiperone is commonly used to label dopamine receptors in vitro in brain tissue. However, spiperone also interacts with brain 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline receptors. In vivo, [3H]-spiperone has been used for identifying dopamine receptors in both animals and man but the nature of the sites identified is unknown. The in vivo administration of [3H]-spiperone to rats leads to a selective accumulation of radioactivity in the olfactory lobes, tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus accumbens, striatum, substantia nigra, hippocampus, frontal cortex and hypothalamus, when compared to the cerebellum. In vivo drug displacement studies suggest that the binding of [3H]-spiperone in these areas may be to dopamine, 5-HT or noradrenaline receptors. [3H]-spiperone in vivo mainly labels dopamine receptors in striatum, tuberculum olfactorium, hypothalamus, substantia nigra and olfactory lobes. However, in the frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens specific binding involves not only dopamine receptors but also 5-HT and/or noradrenaline receptors. Interpretation of in vivo studies in man using radioactive spiperone and its derivatives must take into account the fact that this ligand only labels dopamine receptors in some brain areas.
2893536	The distribution of somatostatinlike immunoreactive (SLI) perikarya, axons, and terminals was mapped in subcortical areas of the brain of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, using light microscopic immunocytochemistry. A preponderance of immunoreactivity was localized in reticular, limbic, and hypothalamic areas including: 1) in the forebrain: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; lateral preoptic, dorsal, anterior, lateral and posterior hypothalamic areas; amygdaloid, periventricular, arcuate, supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, ventromedial, dorsomedial, paraventricular, lateral and medial mammillary, and lateral septal nuclei; the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and nucleus accumbens septi; 2) in the midbrain: the periaqueductal gray, interpeduncular, dorsal and ventral tegmental, pretectal, and Edinger-Westphal nuclei; and 3) in the hindbrain: the superior central and parabrachial nuclei, nucleus incertus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis. Other areas containing SLI included the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), zona incerta, infundibulum, supramammillary and premammillary nuclei, medial and dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, entopeduncular nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, central medial thalamic nucleus, central tegmental field, linear and dorsal raphe nuclei, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, superior and inferior colliculi, nucleus ruber, substantia nigra, mesencephalic nucleus of V, inferior olivary nucleus, inferior central nucleus, nucleus prepositus, and deep cerebellar nuclei. While these results were similar in some respects to those previously reported in rodents, they also provided interesting contrasts.
2898418	In experiments on 2-, 10- and 22-month-old rats it was found that the Bmax values of dopamine (DA2), serotonin (5-HT1) and enkephalin (Enk) receptors as well as the 5-HT level in the three brain regions (cortex, striatum and hypothalamus) decreased with age; the DA level in the brain cortex and striatum and the noradrenaline (NA) content in the brain cortex decreased, while the NA level in the striatum and the 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) level in the brain cortex and the striatum as well as the MAO-T and MAO-A activities in the three brain structures increased. It is suggested that these and other changes observed in brain neurotransmission are an important element in the neurochemical bases of the age-related changes in behavior.
2913070	Previous histochemical studies have suggested that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase exists in distinct subsets of neurons that neither belong to a single transmitter type nor embrace all the neurons using a single transmitter. As a step toward establishing the role of this enzyme, the distribution of NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons and fibers in the cat central nervous system was mapped by using a direct histochemical method. Heavily stained NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons with many prominent cell processes were observed in the cerebral cortex, white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, septal nucleus, amygdala, anterior, lateral and posterior hypothalamic areas, dorsolateral part of the periaqueductal gray, superior colliculus, central tegmental field (Berman) (pedunculopontine tegmental area), dorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus coeruleus, mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation, gigantocellular and magnocellular tegmental fields, nucleus facialis, and motor nucleus of the vagus. Moderately stained neurons with two or three prominent cell processes were observed in the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, globus pallidus, and substantia innominata. Medium-size, moderately stained neurons that had round large nuclei and no visible cell processes were found in the subthalamic nucleus, pontine gray, trapezoid body, and infratrigeminal, cochlear, and vestibular nuclei. Very dense NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve terminal fields were seen in the olfactory tubercle, cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, dentate gyrus, and interpeduncular nucleus. Intensely stained NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve fibers were found in the stria terminalis, marginal region of the central tegmental field, dorsal tegmental nucleus, and spinal trigeminal tract as well as around the brachium conjunctivum. Although the staining of neurons and tracts was highly selective, they did not correspond to any single known neuronal or neurotransmitter type. Positive staining occurred in discrete subsets of neurons known to be associated with a variety of peptides and classical neurotransmitters. The functional significance of high NADPH diaphorase activity is unknown.
2918078	The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of cholecystokininlike-immunoreactive (CCK-I) neurons within the rat ventral mesencephalon which project to several forebrain areas. The peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemical technique was used to examine the anatomical localization of CCK-I within the ventral midbrain and in the following forebrain regions: caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, septum, amygdala, and prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and piriform cortices. CCK-I perikarya were distributed throughout the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and several midline raphe nuclei to a greater extent than previously reported, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Terminallike immunoreactivity for CCK was observed in all of the above forebrain sites. In addition, infrequent CCK-I cell bodies were localized in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, septum, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. To analyze forebrain projections of the ventral midbrain CCK-I neurons, indirect immunofluorescence was combined with fluorescence retrograde tracing. CCK-I neurons of the substantia nigra and/or ventral tegmental area were found to project, to varying extents, to all of the above CCK-I forebrain terminal fields. The nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and septal and prefrontal cortical projections arose primarily from CCK-I perikarya in the ventral tegmental area whereas the projections to the caudate-putamen and anterior cingulate cortex arose predominantly from immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The amygdala received innervation mainly from CCK-I cell bodies located in the substantia nigra pars lateralis. CCK-I afferents to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and piriform cortex originated from perikarya distributed approximately equally across the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta. The general topography of CCK-I forebrain innervation observed in this study is similar to that previously reported for the ascending dopaminergic projections from ventral mesencephalic neurons. CCK-I neurons of the midline raphe nuclei were found to provide relatively minor afferents to the caudate-putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, septum, and prefrontal cortex and more substantial projections to the amygdala. The results of this study demonstrate that CCK-I neurons of the ventral midbrain supply a much broader innervation of forebrain regions than previously appreciated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2918080	The regional distribution of the three opioid peptide neuronal systems--proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proenkephalin A, and proenkephalin B--was investigated in the lower brainstem of Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) by immunocytochemical techniques. Antiserum to beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin, [Met]-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, and human leumorphin were used to identify the POMC and the proenkephalin A and B systems, respectively. POMC-related immunoreactive material was not found in the neuronal perikarya in the lower brainstem; reactive fibers and apparent terminals were distributed in the substantia nigra, lemniscus lateralis, midbrain central gray, the nucleus raphes, nucleus parabrachialis lateralis, ventral area of the spinal trigeminal nerve, nucleus tractus solitarii, and in the reticular formation throughout the lower brainstem. Proenkephalin A-related immunoreactive neuronal perikarya were detected in the central gray, reticular formation, nucleus raphes, trapezoid body, nucleus parabrachialis lateralis and medialis, nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi, and in the nucleus tractus solitarii. Densely packed immunoreactive fibers were widely distributed in the substantia nigra, nucleus interpeduncularis, nucleus raphes, superior colliculus, periaqueductal central gray, nucleus parabrachialis lateralis and medialis, locus coeruleus, trapezoid body, nuclei cochleares, nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, tractus spinalis nervi trigemini, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi, nucleus gracilis, nucleus cuneatus, nucleus cuneatus accessorius, and in the reticular formation throughout the lower brainstem. Neuronal perikarya containing immunoreactive material related to proenkephalin B were found in the periaqueductal central gray, nucleus parabrachialis lateralis and medialis, nucleus tractus solitarii, and nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini. In addition, immunoreactive fibers were detected in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, nucleus parabrachialis lateralis and medialis, nucleus vestibularis lateralis and medialis, and in some areas of the reticular formation. These anatomical findings demonstrate that these three opioid peptide neuronal systems are widely but uniquely distributed in the lower brainstem of the monkey.
2918089	The projections of the main olfactory bulbs (MOBs) and the dorsal part of the anterior olfactory nucleus (NOA) in the hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) have been studied by fluorescent tracers and the horseradish peroxidase method (HRP), respectively, to reveal the pattern of labeling from these structures. After different dye injections in both MOBs, labeled cells were present in the following structures: tenia tecta, vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and medial septal nucleus in the ipsilateral injection site; and the NOA, piriform cortex, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus, anterior amygdaloid area, and dorsal raphe nucleus in both hemispheres. Structures showing double-labeled cells were the NOA, horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, anterior amygdaloid area, and posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus. After HRP injections in the dorsal part of the NOA, labeled cells were distributed in the NOA, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus, piriform cortex, horizontal and vertical limbs of the diagonal band of Broca, mitral cell layer of the MOB, tenia tecta, anterior amygdaloid area, and the contralateral NOA. We suggest that the contralateral projection nuclei to the MOB of the hedgehog, unusual in other mammals, and the large number of cells with axonal collaterals projecting to both hemispheres, may be a strategy in these animals to bilaterally integrate brain functions at the expense of its reduced corpus callosum.
2924841	Olivocerebellar branching projections to the flocculus, nodulus and uvula were studied electrophysiologically in pigmented rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital and halothane. Neurons in the dorsal cap of the inferior olive were antidromically activated by stimulation of the contralateral flocculus, nodulus and uvula. The antidromic responses in the dorsal cap from the flocculus, nodulus and uvula partially occluded with each other. Electrical stimulation of the nodulus (or uvula) evoked early and late climbing fiber responses in the flocculus with latencies of 4.0 ms and 10.0 ms, respectively. The early response was resistant to repetitive stimulation and not affected by interruption of the olivocerebellar fibers at the lower medulla, while the late response was abolished by these two procedures. This indicated that the early response was evoked through climbing fiber branches to the flocculus and nodulus (or uvula) as an axon reflex, while the late response was evoked via the inferior olive. Of 76 Purkinje cells in the flocculus, 35.6% showed climbing fiber activation through branches to the nodulus and/or uvula, 70% of which were orthodromically activated through climbing fibers from the contralateral optic tract. Electrical stimulation of the flocculus or uvula evoked the early and late climbing fiber responses in the nodulus. Of 60 Purkinje cells in the nodulus, 63.4% showed axon reflex activation from the flocculus and/or uvula, 42% of which were activated through climbing fibers from the contralateral optic tract. These findings demonstrated that the flocculus, nodulus and uvula receive branching climbing fiber projection from the inferior olive, a part of which conveys visual information.
2936429	The distribution of immunoreactive (ir) atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) in 47 microdissected brain and spinal cord regions of the rat was determined by radioimmunoassay. The highest concentrations of ir-ANPs exist in the paraventricular nucleus and median preoptic nucleus (580.9 and 558.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively). High concentrations of ir-ANP (greater than 300 fmol/mg protein) are present in the interpeduncular nucleus, preoptic and hypothalamic periventricular nuclei, median eminence and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Moderate concentrations of ir-ANPs (between 100 and 300 fmol/mg protein) are found in 16 brain regions such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus of the diagonal band, most of the hypothalamic nuclei, central gray, locus coeruleus and parabrachial nuclei. Low levels of ir-ANPs (less than 100 fmol/mg protein) exist in 22 brain regions including cortical areas, amygdala, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, supraoptic nucleus, subfornical organ, medial mammillary nucleus, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe nucleus, cerebellum, nucleus of the solitary tract and others. Cervical spinal cord and neurointermediate lobe of pituitary gland contain low levels of ir-ANPs.
2936980	The widespread distribution of neurons containing alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain was demonstrated using radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry in conjunction with specific antisera. The highest concentrations of alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity were in the hypothalamus and septum, with low but still appreciable concentrations in the mesencephalon, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and thalamus by radioimmunoassay. Immunohistochemical studies clearly showed that the perikarya of immunoreactive neurons are most prevalent in the ventral part of the lateral septal nucleus, periventricular preoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periventricular and dorsal parts of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus, median mamillary nucleus, supramamillary nucleus, zona incerta, medial habenular nucleus and the periaqueductal grey matter. Scattered neurons were seen in the cingulate cortex, endopiriform nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, and pretectal and dorsal thalamic areas. In addition to the areas mentioned above, high concentrations of immunoreactive varicose fibers were seen in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, external layer of the median eminence, central to paramedian parts of the interpeduncular nucleus and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. The globus pallidus, medial and central amygdaloid nuclei, dorsal raphe, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, vagal dorsal motor nucleus, solitary nucleus and some circumventricular organs, including the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, contained considerable numbers of immunoreactive varicose fibers. In dehydrated rats and homozygous Brattleboro rats, the pattern of alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide-immunoreactive neurons and varicose fibers was qualitatively similar to that seen in normal conditioned rats. This study gives an atlas of the distribution of the alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide-containing neuronal system in the rat brain and provides the groundwork for studying the influence of this new peptide on various brain functions.
2936983	Using antisera generated in rabbits against rat atriopeptin III [alpha-rANP(5-28)] and human alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide we mapped the distribution of atrial natriuretic factor-like immunoreactivity throughout the rat central nervous system. Cell bodies were observed in the telencephalon (nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis and between the amygdala centralis and medialis), throughout the diencephalon in all nuclei of the "anteroventral third ventricle", the base of the hypothalamus, the subzona incerta area, the medial forebrain bundle and the medial habenula, in the mesencephalon (mamillary body, substantia nigra lateralis, dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei) and very sparse in the medulla oblongata along the fourth ventricle towards the vestibular nuclei, the nucleus tractus solitarii and nervi trigemini. Fibers were present wherever cell bodies were located. The highest relative densities were observed in the anteroventral third ventricle area and the medial habenula. Sparse fibers were also seen in the spinal cord (dorsal and ventral horn and around the central canal) and in the posterior pituitary. The predominance of the atrial natriuretic factor-like perikarya and fibers in the anteroventral third ventricle area suggests an involvement of this peptide in central blood pressure control.
2940480	Using the novel substituted benzamide drug [3H]raclopride in combination with in vitro receptor autoradiography, the distribution of dopamine D-2 receptors was studied in the monkey brain. Highest densities of D-2 receptors are present in dopamine-rich areas and the distribution shows the following rank order: caudatus and putamen greater than nucleus accumbens greater than olfactory tubercle greater than substantia nigra (pars compacta) greater than insular cortex greater than piriform and entorhinal cortex greater than substantia nigra (pars reticulata). In all of these areas [3H]raclopride binding was blocked by dopamine (1 microM) and by D-2 receptor antagonists such as (+)-butaclamol, eticlopride and raclopride, while the D-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (1 microM) reduced [3H]raclopride binding by 15-20% in some restricted parts of the caudatus and putamen exclusively.
2942221	The regional distribution of D1 dopamine (DA) receptors in the rat brain has been studied by quantitative autoradiography using the specific D1 antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 as a ligand. The binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to striatal sections was saturable, stereospecific, reversible and of high affinity (Kd = 2.05 nM); it occurred at a single population of sites and possessed the pharmacological features of the D1 DA receptor. The highest densities of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites were found in the caudate-putamen, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra (especially in the pars compacta). High densities were also observed in the nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the entopeduncular nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the claustrum and the amygdalohippocampal area. An intermediate labelling was found in the anteromedial and suprarhinal DA terminal fields of the cerebral cortex, the basolateral, medial and lateral amygdaloid nuclei, the endopiriform nucleus, the primary olfactory cortex, the globus pallidus, the superior colliculus (especially the superficial layer), the nucleus amygdaloideus corticalis and the dorsal hippocampus (molecular layer of the CA1 and dentate gyrus). In the anteromedial and suprarhinal cortices, [3H]SCH 23390 binding was more concentrated in layers V and VI. Moderate levels of [3H]SCH 23390 were found in the thalamus, hypothalamus, the habenula, the ventral tegmental area, the posterior cingulate and entorhinal cortices, the supragenual dopamine terminal system and the cerebellum (molecular layer). This regional distribution of [3H]SCH 23390 closely correlated (except for the cerebellum) with the reported distribution of dopaminergic terminals. The topographical distribution of [3H]SCH 23390 has also been studied in detail in striatal subregions. The density of D1 receptors was much greater in the ventrolateral sector and medial margin of the striatum than in the ventromedial and dorsolateral sectors. A rostrocaudal decrease in the densities of D1 sites was also found along the rostrocaudal axis of the caudate-putamen. These lateral to medial and anteroposterior gradients overlapped with the density of the dopaminergic afferents.
2946973	The topographical distribution of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles has been investigated in 12 patients with Down's syndrome ranging from 31 to 65 years of age. No plaques or tangles whatsoever were seen in the brain of the 31-year-old patient. The nine patients over 53 years of age, showed a similar pathological picture in which there were numerous mature plaques in all areas of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala and numerous tangles in these areas and in subcortical structures such as nucleus basalis, locus caeruleus, dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, olfactory bulb and tracts. In the other two patients aged 37 and 51 years, an intermediate pathological picture was seen in which primitive plaques predominated within the cortex, with numerous mature plaques in hippocampus and amygdala. In the 37-year-old patient, tangles were numerous in the entorhinal cortex, but much less common in hippocampus and amygdala, rare in cerebral cortex and absent in the subcortical areas, olfactory bulbs and tracts. A similar pattern was seen in the 51-year-old patient though here some cells in the subcortex were also affected. These observations suggest that the primary focus of plaque and tangle formation in Down's syndrome may be in amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, with a 'spreading out' to subsequently involve all areas of cortex, certain subcortical regions and the olfactory bulbs and tracts. It appears unlikely that the olfactory bulbs and tracts provide a portal of entry for any pathogenic agent that may be responsible for inducing plaque and tangle formation within the rest of the brain.
2946980	The regional distribution of the specific D1 agonist [3H]SKF 38393 (SKF 38393, 2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine) has been studied autoradiographically in the rat CNS. The binding of [3H]SKF 38393 to striatal sections was saturable, stereospecific, reversible, of high affinity (Kd = 9.9 nM) and partly sodium sensitive; it occurred at a single population of sites and possessed the pharmacological characteristics of the dopamine D1 receptor. The highest levels of [3H]SKF 38393 binding sites were found in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and substantia nigra. Moderately high concentrations of the [3H]ligand were observed in the amygdala, endopyriform nucleus, nucleus olfactorius anterior, lateral septum, primary olfactory cortex, cerebellum (molecular layer) and spinal cord. An intermediate labelling was found in the thalamus, habenula, subthalamic nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, superior colliculus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Moderate levels of [3H]SKF 38393 binding were observed in the globus pallidus and arcuate nucleus. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]SKF 38393 overlapped with that of [3H]N,n-propylnorapomorphine, a radioligand which labels the D2 dopamine receptors, in a number of dopamine-rich brain areas but there were several areas which exhibited a high density of [3H]SKF 38393 binding sites but undetectable concentrations of [3H]N,n-propylnorapomorphine. Moreover, in the spinal cord, the subregional localization of these [3H]ligands clearly differed. Intrastriatal injection of ibotenic acid caused a large decrease in [3H]SKF 38393 and [3H]N,n-propylnorapomorphine binding in the striatum and provoked a reduction of [3H]SKF 38393 but not [3H]N,n-propylnorapomorphine binding in the substantia nigra confirming the view that nigral D1 but not D2 receptors are located on striatonigral fibres.
2955851	Specific, high-affinity binding sites for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were identified and localized in the rat and guinea pig central nervous system (CNS), the cat brainstem, and the rat, guinea pig, cat and human spinal cord using quantitative autoradiographic techniques. The radioligands tested were rat 125I-ANF(1-28) in guinea pig, rat, cat and human tissues, human 125I-ANF in rat and human, and rat [3H]atriopeptin III in rat. All 3 radioligands labeled essentially the same structures in the brain and spinal cord of all species in which they were tested. In guinea pig very high concentrations of ANF binding sites were observed in the olfactory bulb, lateral olfactory tract and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, high concentrations were observed in the fasciculus retroflexus, interpeduncular nucleus and subfornical organ. Moderate concentrations were observed in the nucleus accumbens, dorsomedial and suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nuclei, paraventricular thalamic nuclei, primary olfactory cortex and the subcommissural organ. High concentrations of ANF binding sites were also observed in the choroid plexus and the leptomeninges. Low concentrations were observed in the pineal gland. In the rat the same structures were labeled as in the guinea pig except that suprachiasmatic and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, paraventricular thalamus and cerebellum were unlabeled. In the lower brainstem of the cat and all levels of the rat, guinea pig, cat and human spinal cord, the only site where specific binding was observed was in the pia/arachnoid. These findings suggest that ANF binding sites constitute several functional classes in the CNS as well as in a variety of other tissues. Outside the blood-brain barrier binding sites are prominent in glandular tissues implicated in the production of hormones involved in fluid and electrolyte balance, e.g. adrenal glomerulosa, neurohypophysis and subfornical organ, unstratified epithelia involved in ion gradient exchange, e.g. renal glomerulus, ciliary body, choroid plexus and pia mater; crossing the blood-brain barrier are sites in the anterior hypothalamus, e.g. organum vasculosum, regions of the brain parenchyma associated with angiotensin II binding sites, e.g. dorsomedial nucleus of hypothalamus, some of which may be occupied by brain rather than cardiac synthesized ANF, regions of brain lacking an obvious role in fluid and ion exchange or regulation, e.g. cerebellum, although association with K+,Na+-ATPase in guinea pig cerebellum may be a relevant clue and brain regions possibly implicated in an integrative and/or indirect regulatory role in fluid and electrolyte balance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2971680	Recent studies utilizing electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry have added to the understanding of the pathology of progressive supranuclear palsy. This article reviews the neuropathologic findings of progressive supranuclear palsy and includes two new case reports. Findings in the patients reported here include extensive neuronal loss with reactive gliosis in deep subcortical gray matter such as globus pallidus, subthalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, red nucleus, dentate nucleus, and inferior olives. Neurofibrillary tangles were also noted in thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, nucleus basalis, locus ceruleus, basis pontis nuclei, midbrain, pontine, and medullary reticular formation as well as in various cranial nerve nuclei.
2974879	The stereospecific blockade by raclopride and FLB472 (the R enantiomer of raclopride) of the specific in vivo binding of [3H]-spiperone, [3H]-N,N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) and [3H]-raclopride was studied in seven brain regions (e.g., caudate nucleus, olfactory tubercle, septum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, substantia nigra, pituitary gland) of the male albino rat. The binding of all three ligands was dose-dependently blocked by raclopride and FLB472. The blockade by FLB472 occurred at doses 50-100 times higher than that obtained by raclopride. The maximal blockade by raclopride of [3H]-spiperone binding differed between brain areas. Thus, the largest blockade was obtained in the substantia nigra (95%), septum (90%), caudate nucleus (60%) and olfactory tubercle (60%), while the blockade of [3H]-spiperone binding in the frontal cortex and pituitary gland did not exceed 30% and 50%, respectively. In contrast to [3H]-spiperone, the in vivo binding of [3H]-NPA and [3H]-raclopride was prevented by 90-100% in all brain areas examined. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the in vivo binding of three radioactive ligands to a central dopamine D-2 receptor can be stereoselectively blocked by the enantiomers of raclopride. The findings suggest that, under in vivo conditions, [3H]-raclopride and [3H]-NPA may label a closely related receptor site. However only some of the [3H]-spiperone binding sites may be identical to the [3H]-raclopride binding sites. The findings indicate furthermore that the relative overlap of D-2 sites shared by [3H]-spiperone and [3H]-raclopride may vary between brain regions.
2975068	Paroxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake into neurons. Serotonin uptake sites have been identified, localized, and quantified in rat brain by autoradiography with 3H-paroxetine; 3H-paroxetine binding in slide-mounted sections of rat forebrain was of high affinity (KD = 10 pM) and the inhibition affinity constant (Ki) values of various drugs in competing 3H-paroxetine binding significantly correlated with their reported potencies in inhibiting synaptosomal serotonin uptake. Serotonin uptake sites labeled by 3H-paroxetine were highly concentrated in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, central gray, superficial layer of the superior colliculus, lateral septal nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and the islands of Calleja. High concentrations of 3H-paroxetine binding sites were found in brainstem areas containing dopamine (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area) and norepinephrine (locus coeruleus) cell bodies. Moderate concentrations of 3H-paroxetine binding sites were present in laminae I and IV of the frontal parietal cortex, primary olfactory cortex, olfactory tubercle, regions of the basal ganglia, septum, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and some brainstem areas including the interpeduncular, trigeminal, and parabrachial nuclei. Lower densities of 3H-paroxetine binding sites were found in other regions of the neocortex and very low to nonsignificant levels of binding were present in white matter tracts and in the cerebellum. Lesioning of serotonin neurons with 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine caused large decreases in 3H-paroxetine binding. The autoradiographic distribution of 3H-paroxetine binding sites in rat brain corresponds extremely well to the distribution of serotonin terminals and cell bodies as well as with the pharmacological sites of action of serotonin.
2983042	Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) is a putative neurotransmitter in both the central and peripheral nervous system. In the present report, we have used autoradiography coupled with densitometric analysis of tritium-sensitive film to investigate the distribution of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH [( 3H]MeTRH)-binding sizes in the rat brain. Previous pharmacological reports have established that many of these [3H]MeTRH-binding sites have a structure-activity profile consistent with being a physiological TRH receptor. A high level of TRH receptors were observed in the accessory olfactory bulb, lateral nucleus of the amygdala, dentate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. Moderate levels of TRH receptors were observed in the rhinal cortex, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, several brainstem motor nuclei, and lamina I of the spinal trigeminal nucleus pars candalis, while low concentrations of receptors are present in the cerebral cortex, striatum and ventral horn of the spinal cord. Very low levels of receptors were observed in the globus pallidus and in most nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Comparisons of the distribution of TRH receptors to TRH-immunoreactive content indicates that, while in some areas of the brain there is a rough correlation between levels of TRH peptide and its receptor, in most brain areas there is little obvious correlation between the two. While such a discrepancy has been observed for other peptides and their receptors, the extensive distribution of TRH receptors in the central nervous system does provide an explanation for the variety of behavioral effects observed when TRH is infused into the central nervous system.
2985201	Acute injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mimetics progabide, aminooxyacetic acid, gamma-acetylenic GABA and dipropylacetamide reduced 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation in serotonergic nerve terminal regions (prefrontal cortex, olfactory tubercle, septum, striatum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum and spinal cord) as well as in corresponding cell body areas (raphé dorsalis, medianus, pontis and magnus). This effect was antagonized by bicuculline. The inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis induced by a single progabide administration was accentuated on repeated treatment in the striatum, prefrontal cortex and cerebellum but was similar to that seen after acute treatment in the other areas. Local infusion of high concentrations of GABA or GABA mimetics into the striatum, septum or substantia nigra failed to modify 5-HTP accumulation in these areas. Cerebral hemitransection antagonized the ability of progabide (1200 mg/kg i.p.) to diminish 5-HTP accumulation in the striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Intra-raphé dorsalis infusion of muscimol (0.1-100 ng) or GABA (1-100 micrograms) decreased 5-HT synthesis in the corresponding projection areas (e.g. striatum, substantia nigra, cortex) but not in the hippocampus or cerebellum. Conversely, intra-raphé medianus infusion of these drugs diminished 5-HTP accumulation in the corresponding projection areas (e.g. hippocampus, septum, cortex) but not in the striatum or cerebellum. Intra-raphé dorsalis or medianus injection of GABA antagonists (bicuculline, picrotoxinin, RU-5135) was without effect on cerebral 5-HT synthesis but antagonized the diminution of the amine synthesis observed in corresponding projection areas after intra-raphé dorsalis or medianus infusion of muscimol or GABA. These results suggest that GABA exerts an inhibitory (non-tonic) control over central serotonergic neurons which is mediated via GABA receptors located in the raphé nuclei.
2994820	Binding activities specific for each of [3H]prostaglandin (PG) D2, E2 and F2 alpha were detected in the P2 fraction of the human brain homogenates. The bindings were time-dependent, saturable and of high affinity; Kd values were 30 nM for all the PG bindings. Regional distribution of these binding activities was determined by measuring specific bindings with 10 nM [3H]PG-D2, [3H]PG-E2 and [3H]PG-F2 alpha in the P2 fractions from 17 brain regions. The PG-D2 binding activity was high in the hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus followed by cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex. The PG-E2 binding sites were similarly concentrated in the hypothalamus and the limbic system, but, unlike the PG-D2 binding, no significant binding of [3H]PG-E2 was observed in cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar cortex and putamen. Compared with these two PG bindings, PG-F2 alpha binding activity was low in many areas, but significant binding was detected in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, cerebellar medulla, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, midbrain and hypothalamus. These results suggest the presence and specific distribution of three distinct types of PG binding activities, i.e. specific binding of PG-D2, PG-E2 and PG-F2 alpha, in the human brain.
2995460	The afferent and efferent connections of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi with brainstem nuclei were studied using anterograde and retrograde axonal transport techniques, and by intracellular recordings and injections of horseradish peroxidase into prepositus hypoglossi neurons. The results of experiments in which horseradish peroxidase was injected into the prepositus hypoglossi suggest that the major inputs to the prepositus hypoglossi arise from the ipsi- and contralateral perihypoglossal nuclei (particularly the prepositus hypoglossi and intercalatus), vestibular nuclei (particularly the medial, inferior, and ventrolateral nuclei), the paramedian medullary and pontine reticular formation, and from the cerebellar cortex (flocculus, paraflocculus, and crus I; the nodulus was not available for study). Regions containing fewer labeled cells included the interstitial n. of Cajal, the rostral interstitial n. of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the n. of the posterior commissure, the superior colliculus, the n. of the optic tract, the extraocular motor nuclei, the spinal trigeminal n., and the central cervical n. The efferent connections of the prepositus hypoglossi were studied by injecting 3H-leucine into the prepositus hypoglossi, and by following the axons of intracellularly injected prepositus hypoglossi neurons. The results suggest that in addition to the cerebellar cortex, the most important extrinsic targets of prepositus hypoglossi efferents are the vestibular nuclei (particularly the medial, inferior, and ventrolateral nuclei, and the area X), the inferior olive (contralateral dorsal cap of Kooy and ipsilateral subnucleus b of the medial accessory olive), the paramedian medullary and pontine reticular formation, the reticular formation surrounding the parabigeminal n., the contralateral superior colliculus and pretectum, the extraocular motor nuclei (particularly the contralateral abducens nucleus and the ipsilateral medial rectus subdivision of the oculomotor nucleus), the ventral lateral geniculate n., and the central lateral thalamic nucleus. Other areas which were lightly labeled in the autoradiographic experiments were the contralateral spinal trigeminal n., the n. raphe pontis, the Edinger Westphal n., the zona incerta, and the paracentral thalamic n. Many of the efferent connections of the prepositus hypoglossi appear to arise from principal prepositus hypoglossi neurons whose axons collateralize extensively in the brainstem. On the other hand, small prepositus hypoglossi neurons project to the inferior olive, and multidendritic neurons project to the cerebellar flocculus, apparently without collateralizing in the brainstem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2998553	A mutant strain of Wistar rats which carries an autosomal gene defect is characterized by a progressively developing hyperexcitability, tremor, olfactory and gustatory movements, bradykinesia, ataxia and a pathologically increased muscle tone of hindlimbs which can be measured by recording tonic activity in the electromyogram (EMG) of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle. The activity of the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the receptor binding of GABA as estimated by [3H]GABA binding to synaptic membranes were examined in olfactory bulbs, frontal cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, tectum, substantia nigra, medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and pons of mutant rats. Mutant rats exhibit a lower activity of GAD in synaptosomal fractions of olfactory bulbs and substantia nigra whereas GAD activity within the pons was increased. The changes in the activity of GAD were accompanied by alterations in [3H]GABA binding to synaptic membranes: GABA binding was significantly elevated in the olfactory bulbs and the substantia nigra, but it was markedly reduced in the pons. The functional importance of impaired nigral GABAergic transmission in mutant rats was demonstrated by the fact that intranigral injection of the GABA agonist muscimol reduced the tonic extension of the hindlimbs as indicated by reduced tonic EMG activity of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle, while intranigral injection of the GABA antagonist bicuculline increased the disturbance.
2999650	Light microscopic autoradiographic localization of specific recognition sites for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was determined on thin sections of rat brain using the potent analogue [3H](3-Me-His2)-TRH ([3H]MeTRH). Microdensitometric analysis of the relative optical densities of TRH receptor labelling revealed the following brain regional enrichment: lateral and cortical amygdaloid nuclei greater than ventral dentate gyrus greater than n. accumbens greater than medial septum greater than piriform cortex greater than paraventricular thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei greater than preoptic area greater than diagonal band of Broca greater than lateral septum greater than I-IV layers of frontoparietal cortex greater than dorsal hippocampus greater than olfactory tubercle greater than caudate putamen; globus pallidus. In the spinal cord the apparent relative enrichment of TRH receptors was: substantia gelatinosa = central canal gray greater than ventral gray greater than dorsal gray (layers III-VII) greater than white matter. This heterogeneous distribution of TRH binding sites correlated well with our previous data obtained from membrane binding studies. Furthermore, the specific anatomical localization of receptors for TRH in many nuclei was consistent with those loci involved in the mediation of many physiological and behavioural actions of the peptide in rodent brain.
3001239	Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor-binding sites have been localized and quantified in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by autoradiography with an iodine-125-labeled analogue of ovine CRF substituted with norleucine and tyrosine at amino acid residues 21 and 32, respectively. High affinity and pharmacologically specific receptor-binding sites for CRF were found in discrete areas within the rat CNS. CRF receptors were highly concentrated in laminae 1 and 4 throughout the neocortex, the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, the external layer of the median eminence, several cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem including the facial, oculomotor, trochlear, vestibulocochlear, and trigeminal nuclei, the deep cerebellar nuclei, and the cerebellar cortex. Moderate concentrations of CRF receptors were present in the olfactory tubercle, caudate-putamen, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, nucleus of the diagonal band, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, mammillary peduncle, inferior and superior olives, medullary reticular formation, inferior colliculus, and brainstem nuclei including tegmental, parabrachial, hypoglossal, pontine, cuneate, and gracilis nuclei, and in spinal cord. Lower densities of CRF binding were found in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central and medial amygdaloid nuclei, and regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and brainstem. The distribution of CRF-binding sites generally correlates with the immunocytochemical distribution of CRF pathways and with the pharmacological sites of action of CRF. These data strongly support a physiological role for endogenous CRF in regulating and integrating functions in the CNS.
3001464	One-hour immobilization stress increased levels of the major metabolite of brain noradrenaline (NA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-ethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), in nine brain regions of rats. Diazepam at 5 mg/kg attenuated the stress-induced increases in MHPG-SO4 levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and locus coeruleus (LC) region, but not in the thalamus, pons plus medulla oblongata excluding the LC region and basal ganglia. The attenuating effects of the drug on stress-induced increases in metabolite levels in the above regions were completely antagonized by pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 at 5 or 10 mg/kg, a potent and specific benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor antagonist. When given alone, Ro 15-1788 did not affect the increases in MHPG-SO4 levels. Behavioral changes observed during immobilization stress such as vocalization and defecation, were also attenuated by diazepam at 5 mg/kg and this action of diazepam was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 at 10 mg/kg, which by itself had no effects on these behavioral measurements. These findings suggest: (1) that diazepam acts via BDZ receptors to attenuate stress-induced increases in NA turnover selectively in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and LC region and (2) that this decreased noradrenergic activity might be closely related to relief of distress-evoked hyperemotionality, i.e., fear and/or anxiety in animals.
3001670	Using autoradiographic method and 125I-Tyro rat CGRP as a ligand, receptor binding sites were demonstrated in the rat central nervous system. Saturation studies and Scatchard analysis of CGRP-binding to slide mounted tissue sections containing primarily cerebellum showed a single class of receptors with a dissociation constant of 0.96 nM and a Bmax of 76.4 fmol/mg protein. 125I-Tyro rat CGRP binding sites were demonstrated throughout the rat central nervous system. Dense binding was observed in the telencephalon (medial prefrontal, insular and outer layers of the temporal cortex, nucleus accumbens, fundus striatum, central and inferior lateral amygdaloid nuclei, most caudal caudate putamen, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, subfornical organ), the diencephalon (anterior hypothalamic, suprachiasmatic, arcuate, paraventricular, dorsomedial, periventricular, reuniens, rhomboid, lateral thalamic pretectalis and habenula nuclei, zona incerta), in the mesencephalon (superficial layers of the superior colliculus, central nucleus of the geniculate body, inferior colliculus, nucleus of the fifth nerve, locus coeruleus, nucleus of the mesencephalic tract, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, superior olive), in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, in the medulla oblongata (inferior olive, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus commissuralis, nuclei of the tenth and twelfth nerves, the prepositus hypoglossal and the gracilis nuclei, dorsomedial part of the spinal trigeminal tract), in the dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord (laminae I-VI) and the confines of the central canal. Moderate receptor densities were found in the septal area, the "head" of the anterior caudate nucleus, medial amygdaloid and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the pyramidal layers of the hippocampus and dentate gyri, medial preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus, lateral hypothalamic and ventrolateral thalamic area, central gray, reticular part of the substantia nigra, parvocellular reticular nucleus. Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract and gracile fasciculus of the spinal cord. The discrete distribution of CGRP-like binding sites in a variety of sensory systems of the brain and spinal cord as well as in thalamic and hypothalamic areas suggests a widespread involvement of CGRP in a variety of brain functions.
3003349	In vitro autoradiographic techniques were used to examine the distribution of [3H]tryptamine binding sites in rat brain. The gross distribution and pharmacological characteristics of binding to brain sections resembled those seen in homogenate studies. Binding sites were found throughout the brain, with a preponderance of sites in the forebrain and limbic structures; highest levels were seen in the choroid plexus and the interpeduncular nucleus. Other regions exhibiting high levels of [3H]tryptamine binding include the cortex (especially lamina I), caudate putamen, hippocampus, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, superior colliculus (superficial gray layer), locus ceruleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the pineal body. Although there were similarities in this distribution to that for binding sites of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]serotonin), the overall patterns were distinct. The binding site for [3H] tryptamine in the choroid plexus (termed T-2) was pharmacologically distinct from that in the rest of the brain (termed T-1); several compounds, including kynuramine, were potent inhibitors of [3H]tryptamine binding at the brain site, but not at the choroid plexus site. [3H]Serotonin also labels a site in the rat choroid plexus; this site was different from both [3H]tryptamine sites. Knowledge of the distribution of tryptamine binding sites in the brain will aid in efforts to ascertain the function of these sites.
3005393	Fluctuations in the content and distribution of adenosine triphosphatase in the brain of mice during the period of morphine tolerance-dependence development as well as normal and and naloxone induced withdrawal have been studied. The histochemical investigation revealed the enzyme activity in the neurons, neuroglia and blood vessels. In the control animals the nucleus caudatus putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, nuclei of amygdala, nuclei hypothalami, substantia grisea centralis, griseum pontis, nucleus trapezoideus, nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, nucleus parabrachialis, nucleus vestibularis, nucleus nervi hypoglossi, nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi, nucleus olivaris and nucleus centralis superior are found to be very rich in ATPase. However, morphine treatment inhibited the enzyme in all the above nuclei and it was linear with the increase in dose and the duration of the treatment. Cytophotometric studies reveal that the differences in the enzymatic activity varies from nuclei to nuclei. Surprisingly enough, normal withdrawal as well as naloxone induced withdrawal significantly elevated the enzyme levels. All above findings have been confirmed biochemically. The study gives a firm support of the earlier finding that morphine inhibits ATPase. In addition to this, the present work also reveals a direct antagonistic effect of naloxone on the content of the enzyme in the morphine treated animals. This suggests that the observed inhibition of the enzyme is narcotic specific. The role of ATPase in the Na+, K+ transport is discussed with respect to morphine action. In the light of the present investigation, the effect of morphine on the neurotransmitter release, and the cause and effect there upon has been analyzed. It has been suggested that ATPase might be the enzyme responsible for the observed pharmacological responses of the neurons to the application of the drug by affecting the Na+, K+ flux and neurotransmitter release.
3012017	(+)3H-3-PPP [(+)3H-3-(3-Hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)-piperidine] binds with high affinity to brain membranes with a pharmacological profile consistent with that of sigma receptors. The distribution of (+)3H-3-PPP binding sites in brain and spinal cord of both guinea pig and rat has been determined by in vitro autoradiography with binding densities quantitated by computer-assisted densitometry. (+)3H-3-PPP binding to slide-mounted brain sections is saturable and displays high affinity and a pharmacological specificity very similar to sites labeled in homogenates. (+)3H-3-PPP binding sites are heterogeneously distributed. Highest concentrations of binding sites occur in spinal cord, particularly the ventral horn and dorsal root ganglia; the pons-medulla, associated with the cranial nerve and pontine nuclei and throughout the brain stem reticular formation; the cerebellum, over the Purkinje cell layer; the midbrain, particularly the central gray and red nucleus; and hippocampus, over the pyramidal cell layer. Lowest levels are seen in the basal ganglia and parts of the thalamus, while all other areas, including hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, exhibit moderate grain densities. Quinolinic acid-induced lesions of the hippocampus indicate that (+)3H-3-PPP labels hippocampal pyramidal cells and granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Intrastriatal injection of ibotenic acid dramatically reduces (+)3H-3-PPP binding in this area, while injection of 6-hydroxydopamine produces a relatively slight decrease. The distribution of (+)3H-3-PPP binding sites does not correlate with the receptor distribution of any recognized neurotransmitter or neuropeptide, including dopamine. However, there is a notable similarity between the distribution of (+)3H-3-PPP sites and high-affinity binding sites for psychotomimetic opioids, such as the benzomorphan (+)SKF 10,047.
3013366	125I-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) binding sites were mapped in the human brain and rat brains by in vitro macroautoradiography, and compared to each other. Binding experiments were made to characterize 125I-CGRP binding on the human and rat brains. Scatchard analysis of saturation experiments from slide-mounted sections of the human and rat cerebellum displayed 125I-CGRP binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.17 nM and 0.11 nM, respectively, and a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of 96.8 fmol/mg and 23.0 fmol/mg protein. 125I-CGRP binding was time-dependent, reversible and saturable with high affinity in the brains. Autoradiograms showed a discrete distribution of 125I-CGRP binding sites throughout the brains of human and rat with patterns similar to each other. In the human brain, the highest binding was seen in the cerebellum, inferior olivary nuclear complex, certain parts of the central gray matter, arcuate nuclei of the medulla oblongata and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and densities of CGRP-binding sites were high in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, tail of the nucleus caudatus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, medial portion of the inferior colliculus, medial pontine nuclei, locus coeruleus, inferior vestibular nucleus, substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and nucleus cuneatus lateralis. In the rat, high densities were found in the hippocampus pars anterior, nucleus accumbens, ventral and caudal portions of the nucleus caudatus-putamen, central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, caudal portion of the insular cortex, medial geniculate body, superior and inferior colliculi, certain portions of the central gray matter, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nuclei, vagal complex, nucleus cuneatus lateralis and cerebellum. In contrast, in both species, most of the cortical areas including the hippocampus, most of the thalamus, and hypothalamus exhibited few binding sites. In addition, high quantities of the binding sites were seen on the pia mater and on walls of blood vessels in the brain and subarachnoidea. These results revealed essentially homologous locations of CGRP binding sites in the human and rat central nervous systems and well corresponding distributions of binding sites and endogenous CGRP-like immunoreactivity.
3016445	Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-responsive areas in rat brain were examined by measuring ANF-stimulated cyclic GMP production in rat brain slice preparations. The medulla oblongata, thalamus, and pituitary gland responded most sensitively, the septum, hypothalamus, pons, midbrain and olfactory bulb responded moderately, but neocortex, cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus were unresponsive to ANF. The most responsive regions in spontaneously hypertensive rats brains showed 2 to 5 times higher cyclic GMP production than those from the control Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings provide evidence for biological action of ANF on brain tissues, and indicate the action of ANF produced in the brain.
3016600	Seizures produced by pilocarpine given i.p. to rats provide an animal model for studying the initiation, spread and generalisation of convulsive activity within the forebrain. Pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, produces a sequence of behavioural and electroencephalographic alterations indicative of motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus, which is followed by widespread damage to the limbic forebrain resembling that occurring subsequent to prolonged intractable seizures. Microinjections of a selective antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, (+/-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, into the substantia nigra pars reticulata, bilaterally, protects against the behavioural, electrographic and morphological features of seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, with an ED50 of 0.0007 mumol (0.0004-0.0011). Microinjections of (+/-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, 0.005 or 0.01 mumol, into the substantia nigra pars compacta or into the dorsal part of mid-anterior striatum do not modify the electrographic and morphological sequelae of pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. In rats pretreated with microinjections of N-methyl-D-aspartate into the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a non-convulsive dose of pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, results in recurrent motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. The ED50 of N-methyl-D-aspartate for the generation of seizures after pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, is 0.0014 mumol (0.001-0.0019). Electrographic monitoring shows a pattern and sequence of evolution of convulsant activity within the hippocampus and cortex similar to that produced with pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, alone. Morphological examination of brains from rats treated with N-methyl-D-aspartate in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and subsequently given pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, which underwent status epilepticus, reveals widespread damage to the amygdala, thalamus, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra, neocortex, and hippocampus. Microinjections of N-methyl-D-aspartate, 0.002 mumol, into either the substantia nigra pars compacta or dorsal striatum, bilaterally, do not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg. The results indicate that the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats is modulated by excitatory amino acid neurotransmission within the substantia nigra pars reticulata.
3016682	Receptors for VIP were characterized in the rat CNS. 125I-VIP bound with high affinity to rat brain slices. Binding was time dependent and specific. Pharmacology studies indicated that specific 125I-VIP binding was inhibited with high affinity by VIP and low affinity by secretin and PHI. Using in vitro autoradiographic techniques high grain densities were present in the dentate gyrus, pineal gland, supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus and the area postrema. Moderate grain densities were present in the olfactory bulb and tubercle, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, interstitial nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, subiculum and the medial geniculate nucleus. Grains were absent in the corpus callosum and controls treated with 1 microM unlabeled VIP. The discrete regional distribution of VIP receptors suggest that it may function as an important modulator of neural activity in the CNS.
3021824	With the multiple fluorescent retrograde tracer technique, the collateralization in the spinal cord of descending supraspinal pathways was studied in a lizard, Varanus exanthematicus. Fast Blue (FB) gels were implanted unilaterally in the spinal gray matter of the cervical enlargement and Nuclear Yellow (NY) gels were implanted ipsilaterally in two series of experiments in all spinal funiculi of the lumbar enlargement or in midthoracic spinal segments, respectively. All brainstem nuclei known to project to the spinal cord in reptiles were found to give rise to branching axons that may influence widely separate levels of the spinal cord. The number of double-labeled FB-NY cells varied in these brainstem nuclei from none to half the number of neurons projecting to the cervical enlargement. Highly collateralizing projections (expressed as the percentage of double-labeled neurons, DL) were found to arise from the nucleus raphes inferior, the contralateral nucleus reticularis superior pars lateralis, the contralateral nuclei vestibulares ventromedialis and descendens, and the ipsilateral nucleus reticularis inferior pars ventralis. A lower percentage of DL neurons was noted for the contralateral nucleus ruber and bilaterally for the nucleus reticularis medius and nucleus reticularis inferior. Extensive brainstem projections directed to cervical and high thoracic spinal levels originate from the area lateralis hypothalami, the nucleus of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, the contralateral nucleus cerebellaris medialis, and from the nucleus tractus solitarii. Projections preferentially directed to midthoracic or lower levels of the spinal cord were found to arise from the ipsilateral locus coeruleus, the contralateral nucleus reticularis superior pars lateralis, the nucleus reticularis inferior pars ventralis, the nucleus reticularis inferior, and the nucleus raphes inferior. In contrast to findings in mammals, in Varanus exanthematicus the red nucleus, the nucleus vestibularis ventrolateralis, and certain parts of the reticular formation did not display a clear-cut somatotopic organization. In general two different patterns of collateralization can grossly be discerned: a gradual decrease of spinal collaterals caudalward, which can be interpreted as a certain specificity of such projections; and a constant number of collateral nerve fibers throughout the spinal cord that can be interpreted as either a nonspecific or, in contrast, a highly specific system, focussed exclusively on the cervical and lumbar enlargements.
3025271	An autoradiographic method was used to assess the distribution of binding sites for [3H]neurotensin (NT) in the forebrain and midbrain of the pigeon. Within the telencephalon the highest levels of NT binding sites were observed within the hyperstriatum ventrale (HV). Moderate to high levels of NT binding were observed within the archistriatum, neostriatum intermedium, and hyperstriatum accessorium. These telencephalic regions and HV are thought to be comparable to portions of mammalian neocortex. Lower levels of binding sites were observed within the striatal complex including the laterally situated paleostriatum augmentatum and medially situated lobus parolfactorius. The lowest levels of NT binding sites in the telencephalon were observed within the paleostriatum primitivum (PP, considered comparable to mammalian globus pallidus), ectostriatum (comparable to layer IV of mammalian extrastriate visual cortex), field "L" (comparable to layer IV of mammalian auditory cortex), hippocampus, septum, and preoptic area. Despite considerable regional variation, the overall level of NT binding throughout the pigeon telencephalon appears to be significantly higher than that reported for mammals, particularly within pallial areas. Within the brainstem, moderate levels of NT binding sites were observed in the lateral habenular nuclei, the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, nucleus tegmentipedunculopontinus, pars compacta (comparable to the mammalian substantia nigra, pars compacta), locus coeruleus, and the nucleus subcoeruleus dorsalis. The latter four cell groups contain numerous catecholaminergic neurons. Corresponding catecholaminergic cell groups in mammalian forms also contain high levels of NT receptors. As in mammals, lower levels of NT binding were observed in most diencephalic nuclei. Somewhat higher levels of NT binding were observed within the pretectal nuclei spiriformis lateralis and spiriformis medialis. Moderate levels of NT binding sites were observed within the retinal terminal layers of the tectum (i.e., layers 1-7). Immunohistochemical experiments (Reiner and Carraway; Brain Res. 341:365-371, '85; Reiner: ARVO Abstracts: p. 185, '86) localizing NT and a related hexapeptide, LANT6, have shown that LANT6 is present in retinal ganglion cells, in cells of the paleostriatum, and in the striatotegmental and striatopretectal fiber pathways of the pigeon. Thus some features of the NT binding observed here in pigeon brain including the existence of substantial NT binding sites in the brainstem catecholamine nuclei, pretectum (nucleus spiriformis lateralis), and optic tectum may reflect the existence, at least in part, of functional receptors for LANT6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3027279	A stable, iodine-125-labeled analog of rat/human corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was used to define the characteristics of CRF receptors in a crude mitochondrial/synaptosomal membrane preparation of rat olfactory bulb, and to study the distribution of CRF binding sites in discrete regions of the rat CNS. The binding of 125I-Tyro rat/human CRF (125I-rCRF) was time- and temperature-dependent, was sensitive to the pH, ionic strength, and cationic composition of the incubation buffer, and was linear over a broad range of membrane protein concentrations. 125I-rCRF binding to olfactory bulb membrane was saturable, reversible, and, on Scatchard analysis, revealed a high-affinity component with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.2 nM and a low-affinity binding site with Kd of approximately 20 nM. Data from pharmacological studies indicated that the ability of a variety of CRF fragments and analogs to inhibit 125I-rCRF to olfactory bulb membranes correlates well with their reported relative potencies in stimulating pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion in vitro. Consistent with a coupling of CRF receptors to adenylate cyclase, the binding of 125I-rCRF was decreased by guanine nucleotides and increased by magnesium ions. A heterogeneous distribution of 125I-rCRF binding sites was found in the rat CNS, with highest densities present in olfactory bulb, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and striatum, and progressively lower but significant levels of binding were detected in cervical spinal cord, hypothalamus, medulla, midbrain, thalamus, pons, and hippocampus. These data, using a rat CRF ligand homologous to the endogenous peptide, are consistent with those from previous studies demonstrating the presence of specific binding sites for ovine CRF in rat brain, and provide further support for the suggestion that endogenous CRF may function as a neurotransmitter in the CNS.
3029330	Using ligand binding techniques, we studied beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in brains obtained at autopsy from seven histologically normal controls and seven histopathologically verified cases with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). Inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) binding by the selective beta 1 antagonist, metoprolol, results in nonlinear Hofstee plots, suggesting the presence of the two receptor subtypes in the human brain. The calculated ratios of beta 1/beta 2-adrenergic receptors in control brains are as follows: frontal cortex, 49:51; temporal cortex, 31:69; hippocampus, 66:34; thalamus, 23:77; putamen, 70:30; caudate, 48:52; nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), 43:57; cerebellar hemisphere, 25:75. Compared with the controls, total concentrations of beta-adrenergic receptors were significantly reduced only in the thalamus of the ATD brains. beta 1-Adrenergic receptor concentrations were significantly reduced in the hippocampus and increased in the NbM and cerebellar hemisphere, whereas beta 2-adrenergic receptor concentrations were significantly reduced in the thalamus, NbM, and cerebellar hemisphere and increased in the hippocampus and putamen of the ATD brains. These results suggest that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are present in the human brain and that there are significant changes in both receptor subtypes in selected brain regions in patients with ATD.
3031629	P-type, E-type, and K-type tachykinin binding sites have been identified in the mammalian CNS. These sites may be tachykinin receptors for which the mammalian neuropeptides substance P, neuromedin K, and substance K are the preferred natural agonists, respectively. In the present investigation, we have compared the pharmacology and the autoradiographic distribution of CNS binding sites for the iodinated (125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent) tachykinins substance P, eledoisin, neuromedin K, and substance K. Iodinated eledoisin and neuromedin K exhibited an E-type binding pattern in cortical membranes. Iodinated eledoisin, neuromedin K, and substance K each labeled sites that had a similar distribution but one that was considerably different from that of sites labeled by iodinated substance P. CNS regions where there were detectable densities of binding sites for iodinated eledoisin, neuromedin K, and substance K and few or no sites for iodinated substance P included cortical layers IV-VI, mediolateral septum, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra pars compacta. Binding sites for SP were generally more widespread in the CNS. CNS regions where there was a substantial density of binding sites for iodinated substance P and few or no sites for iodinated eledoisin, neuromedin K, and substance K included cortical layers I and II, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, medial and lateral septum, endopiriform nucleus, rostral thalamus, medial and lateral preoptic nuclei, arcuate nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, inferior olive, nucleus ambiguus, retrofacial and reticular nuclei, and spinal cord autonomic and somatic motor nuclei. In the brainstem, iodinated substance P labeled sites in both sensory and motor nuclei whereas iodinated eledoisin, neuromedin K, and substance K labeled primarily sensory nuclei. Our results are consistent with either of two alternatives: (1) that iodinated eledoisin, neuromedin K, and substance K bind to the same receptor site in the rat CNS, or (2) that they bind to multiple types of receptor sites with very similar distribution.
3033170	The number and proportion of neurons displaying GABA immunoreactivity were determined for 50-micron-wide columns through the thickness of 10 areas of monkey cerebral cortex, including the precentral motor area (area 4), 3 cytoarchitectonic fields of the first somatic sensory area (areas 3b, 1, and 2), 2 areas of parietal association cortex (areas 5 and 7), the first and second visual areas (areas 17 and 18), area 21 of the temporal lobe, and areas of the orbital and lateral frontal cortex. Methods of fixation and immunocytochemical processing were designed to maximize the number of stained cells in 15-micron-thick frozen sections and 1-micron-thick plastic sections. In 8 of the 10 areas the number and proportion of GABA-immunoreactive neurons per 50-micron-wide column were found to be the same (34-43 cells/column; 25% of the total neuronal population). Areas 17 and 3b differed. Area 17 contained 50% more GABA-immunoreactive neurons (52-66 cells/column) but more than twice the total number of neurons, so that the GABA cells made up less than 20% of the total. In 3 monkeys, the number and proportion of GABA-positive neurons per 50-micron-wide column in area 3b were smaller than in adjacent areas of sensorimotor cortex (26-42 cells/column; 19-22%). In 2 other monkeys, the number and proportion (34-43 cells/column; 24-26%) were the same as in adjacent areas. Despite the similarity among most areas of monkey cortex, within some areas, the number of GABA-positive neurons per 50-micron-wide column varied as much as 30%. These variations form a significant, repeating pattern only in area 18, where narrow bands (150-200 micron wide) of relatively few stained cells alternated with either narrow or wide bands (600-700 micron wide) in which columns contained more cells. The GABA-immunoreactive neurons were unevenly distributed across layers, with every area containing large numbers and proportions of stained cells in layer II, and every area but area 4 displaying a second concentration in the principal thalamocortical recipient layers. In area 4, the number of GABA-positive neurons declined sharply from layer II to layer III and remained low through layer VI. For areas displaying the greatest intra-areal variability, only 1 or 2 layers contributed significantly to that variability (layer IV in area 3b, layers III and V in area 18, and layers II and III in area 17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3035579	Highly specific radioligands and quantitative autoradiography reveal strikingly different neuroanatomical patterns for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors of rat brain. The mu receptors are most densely localized in patches in the striatum, layers I and III of the cortex, the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal formation, specific nuclei of the thalamus, the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the locus coeruleus. In contrast, delta receptors are highly confined, exhibiting selective localization in layers I, II, and VIa of the neocortex, a diffuse pattern in the striatum, and moderate concentration in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and in the interpeduncular nucleus. delta receptors are absent in most other brain structures. This distribution is unexpected in that the enkephalins, the putative endogenous ligands of the delta receptor, occur essentially throughout the brain. The kappa receptors of rat brain exhibit a third pattern distinct from that of the mu and delta receptors. kappa receptors occur at low density in patches in the striatum and at particularly high density in the nucleus accumbens, along the pyramidal and molecular layers of the hippocampus, in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus, specific midline nuclei of the thalamus, and hindbrain regions. kappa receptors appear to be uniformly distributed across regions in the neocortex with the exception of layer III, which revealed only trace levels of binding. An important conclusion of the present study is that delta receptors occur at high density only in the forebrain and in two midbrain structures, whereas mu and kappa receptors exhibit discrete patterns in most major brain regions.
3037041	Monoclonal antibodies, raised against a purified GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex from bovine cerebral cortex, have been used to visualize the cellular and subcellular distribution of receptorlike immunoreactivity in the rat CNS, cat spinal cord, and bovine and postmortem human brain. Two different antibodies have been used for these studies; bd-17 recognizes the beta-subunit (Mr 55 kDa) in all the species tested, whereas bd-24 recognizes the alpha-subunit (Mr 50 kDa) of bovine and human but not rat and cat tissues. In bovine and human brain, both antibodies produced very similar staining patterns, indicating a homogeneous receptor composition, at least in the brain areas investigated. The general distribution and density of receptor antigenic sites in all tissues studied were very similar to that of benzodiazepine binding sites radiolabeled with 3H-Ro 15-1788 and of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-stained nerve terminals. The results demonstrate a very high receptor density (around neuronal cell bodies and processes or less discretely distributed) in the rat olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, ventral pallidum, islands of Calleja, globus pallidus, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, substantia nigra, geniculate nuclei, inferior colliculus, cerebellum, reticular formation, spinal cord, and retina. In contrast, no receptors could be detected in white matter, pineal, pituitary, adrenals, and superior cervical ganglia. Only among the cerebellar layers did we observe a conspicuous difference between the staining intensity and the radiolabeling. In bovine and postmortem human brain, e.g., hippocampus, dentate gyrus, cerebral cortex, and substantia nigra, the same close correlation between the immunohistochemical and radiohistochemical findings was observed. At the electron microscopic level, the immune reaction product in the rat substantia nigra and globus pallidus, for example, was localized to pre- and postsynaptic membranes of axodendritic and axosomatic synapses. Whether the presynaptic labeling represents GABA autoreceptors is discussed. In the near future, the monoclonal antibodies will be used in double-labeling experiments with GAD to identify those GABAergic projections that are modulated by benzodiazepine minor tranquillizers. Furthermore, they could also be used, in studies of postmortem human brain, to diagnose receptor dysfunction possibly associated with CNS disorders such as epilepsy.
3037066	Previous autoradiographic studies which have localized alpha-2 adrenoceptors within brain have used tritiated derivatives of clonidine and other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. In the present study we have compared the autoradiographic distributions of binding sites labeled by two reportedly selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists, [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]idazoxan, in rat brain. The distribution of high affinity [3H]idazoxan binding sites differed markedly from that of high affinity [3H]rauwolscine sites throughout the neuraxis. The distribution of [3H]idazoxan binding sites paralleled closely that of [3H]clonidine sites, and corresponded to areas of noradrenergic innervation. Densest [3H]idazoxan labeling appeared over anterior olfactory nuclei, fundus striatum, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, central gray, inferior colliculus, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, locus ceruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. In contrast, much lower levels of [3H]rauwolscine labeling appeared over several areas which receive primarily dopaminergic innervation, and thus corresponded closely to [3H]spiroperidol binding distributions. Densest [3H]rauwolscine labeling appeared over nucleus caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, Islands of Calleja, hippocampus, parasubiculum, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus and substantia nigra. In areas labeled by [3H]rauwolscine, computerized densitometric analysis of autoradiographic saturation curves revealed that the maximum binding values for [3H]idazoxan high affinity binding sites were consistently greater than those for high affinity [3H]rauwolscine sites. The pharmacological characterization of these two binding sites in the accompanying paper supports the present anatomical evidence that [3H]idazoxan labels a heterogenous population of alpha-2 adrenoceptor sites, one population of which is selectively labeled by [3H]rauwolscine.
3039057	The regional distribution of [3H]zolpidem, a novel imidazopyridine hypnotic possessing preferential affinity for the BZD1 (benzodiazepine subtype 1) receptor, has been studied autoradiographically in the rat CNS and compared with that of [3H]flunitrazepam. The binding of [3H]zolpidem to rat brain sections was saturable, specific, reversible, and of high affinity (KD = 6.4 nM). It occurred at a single population of sites whose pharmacological characteristics were similar to those of the benzodiazepine receptors labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam. However, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and CL 218,872 were more potent displacers of [3H]zolpidem than of [3H]flunitrazepam. The autoradiographic brain distribution of [3H]zolpidem binding sites was qualitatively similar to that previously reported for benzodiazepine receptors. The highest levels of [3H]-zolpidem binding sites occurred in the olfactory bulb (glomerular layer), inferior colliculus, ventral pallidum, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, cerebral cortex (layer IV), medial septum, islands of Calleja, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, whereas the lowest densities were found in parts of the thalamus, pons, and medulla. Comparative quantitative autoradiographic analysis of the binding of [3H]zolpidem and [3H]flunitrazepam [a mixed BZD1/BZD2 (benzodiazepine subtype 2) receptor agonist] in the CNS revealed that the relative density of both 3H-labeled ligands differed in several brain areas. Similar levels of binding for both ligands were found in brain regions enriched in BZD1 receptors, e.g., substantia nigra pars reticulata, inferior colliculus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex lamina IV. The levels of [3H]zolpidem binding were five times lower than those of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in those brain regions enriched in BZD2 receptors, e.g., nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus, and striatum. Moreover, [3H]zolpidem binding was undetectable in the spinal cord (which contains predominantly BZD2 receptors). Finally, like CL 218,872 and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, zolpidem was a more potent displacer of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in brain regions enriched in BZD1 receptors than in brain areas enriched in BZD2 receptors. The present data add further support to the view that zolpidem, although structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, binds to the benzodiazepine receptor and possesses selectivity for the BZD1 receptor subtype.
3039080	While there is an abundance of pharmacological and biochemical evidence to suggest the existence of multiple opioid receptors, their precise localization within the brain is unclear. To help clarify this issue, the present study examined the distributions of the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor subtypes in the rat forebrain and midbrain using in vitro autoradiography. Mu and delta receptors were labeled with the selective ligands 3H-DAGO (Tyr- D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol), and 3H-DPDPE (D-Pen2, D-Pen5-enkephalin), respectively, while the kappa receptors were labeled with 3H-(-)bremazocine in the presence of unlabeled DAGO and DPDPE. Based on previous findings in our laboratory, the labeling conditions were such that each ligand selectively occupied approximately 75% of each of the opioid sites. The results demonstrated that all 3 opioid receptor subtypes were differentially distributed in the rat brain. Mu binding was dense in anterior cingulate cortex, neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, ventral dentate gyrus, presubiculum, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, thalamus, habenula, interpeduncular nucleus, pars compacta of the substantia nigra, superior and inferior colliculi, and raphe nuclei. In contrast, delta binding was restricted to only a few brain areas, including anterior cingulate cortex, neocortex, amygdala, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, and caudate putamen. Kappa binding, while not as widespread as observed with mu binding, was densely distributed in the amygdala, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, medial preoptic area, hypothalamus, median eminence, periventricular thalamus, and interpeduncular nucleus. While all 3 opioid receptor subtypes could sometimes be localized within the same brain area, their precise distribution within the region often varied widely. For example, in the caudate putamen, mu binding had a patchy distribution, while delta and kappa sites were diffusely distributed, with delta sites being particularly dense ventrolaterally and kappa sites being concentrated ventromedially. These results support the existence of at least 3 distinct opioid receptors with possibly separate functional roles.
3059204	Localization of labelled neurons (sources of projections to the lateral vestibular nucleus) in the brain was studied by means of microiontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase. Bilateral projections of the midbrain structures to all parts of the nucleus mentioned (field of Forel, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, oculomotor nerve nucleus and red nucleus) were found. There have been also shown: bilateral projections from more caudally localized structures of the superior, medial and inferior (descending) vestibular nuclei, group "Y" of the vestibular nuclear complex, facial nucleus and hypoglossi, nucleus prepositus nervi hypoglossi and spinal trigeminal nucleus; ipsilateral projections from crus IIa of lobulus ansiformus of the cerebellar hemisphere; contralateral projections from lateral reticular nucleus of medulla oblongata and Deiters' nucleus. Trajectories of the labelled fibre system projecting to Deiters' nucleus are described.
3070587	A rich network of NPY-like immunoreactive fibers was found in the paraventricular nucleus and the ventromedial region of the hypothalamus juxtapositioned to the third ventricle, including the median eminence. Brain regions, areas or nuclei found densely innervated by NPY-like immunoreactive fibers included the olfactory bulb region, septal area, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, preoptic periventricular nucleus, hypothalamic periventricular nucleus, medial suprachiasmatic nucleus, subseptal (subfornical) organ, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, infundibular nucleus and nucleus tractus solitarius. NPY-like containing perikarya were localized within the hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and surrounding the nucleus rotundus and nucleus of the basal optic root. Since the immunocytochemical study showed that NPY was localized in brain structures known to alter food intake and the compound is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide family, a second study was designed to determine if the neuropeptide altered plasma concentrations of insulin, glucagon and glucose following intracerebroventricular administration. It was found that NPY significantly increased plasma concentration of insulin. It is proposed that two reasons why NPY is such a potent orexigenic agent is that the paraventricular nucleus and structures surrounding the third ventricle throughout the ventromedial hypothalamic region show high levels of NPY-like immunoreactivity. Secondly, NPY effects an increase in plasma insulin in the periphery.
3093564	Afferent connections to the substantia innominata/nucleus basalis complex of monkeys and cats were traced by using the method of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Altogether ten injections of HRP were performed in four monkeys (Saimiri sciureus, Callithrix jacchus, Galago senegalensis) and in four cats, with either vertical or oblique needle approaches. The entire brains excluding the olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum were then screened for labeled neurons. In both monkey and cat brains, many retrogradely labeled neurons could be detected in the amygdala, hypothalamus, midline thalamus, zona incerta, and the fields of Forel. Further but weaker labeling occurred in the medial septal nucleus, diagonal band of Broca, olfactory tubercle, paraventricular, anterior, mediodorsal, and central lateral thalamic nuclei, lateral habenula, ventral tegmental area of Tsai, interpeduncular nucleus, parabrachial, raphe, dorsal tegmental nucleus and the locus caeruleus. Cortically, prefrontal, insular, entorhinal, prepiriform, and periamygdaloid areas of both species showed considerable labeling as well as the whole temporal lobe of the monkeys used. The perirhinal and basal temporal cortex of all cats showed moderate labeling. In both monkeys and cats, extremely scarce labeling occurred within the cingulate, retrosplenial, and subicular cortex. From an anatomical point of view, the manifold connections of the substantia innominata/basal nucleus of Meynert found in this study underscore the participation of these nuclear groups in motivational, emotional, and cognitive (e.g. mnemonic) functions. Considering the widespread cortical efferents of this complex, it is suggested that the substantia innominata/nucleus basalis of Meynert serves the transmission of information arising within the limbic system to the whole neocortex.
3128314	In 1980, Fukuhara et al. have reported two patients with "myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers" (MERRF), which is at present accepted as a distinctive clinical entity among the mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. We describe here postmortem findings of the case whose clinical findings were reported in detail by Fukuhara et al. (1980) as Case 1. The neuropathological findings were summarized as follows: 1) degeneration of dentate nucleus, red nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and pontine tegmentum, 2) degeneration of the Clarke's column, spinocerebellar tract, posterior column and corticospinal tract, as well as of the posterior spinal nerve root and sural nerve, and 3) degeneration of substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, cerebellar cortex and inferior olivary nucleus. The lesions were degenerative in nature, and their distribution was different from those of dentato-rubropallidoluysian atrophy, Joseph's disease or Friedreich's ataxia. It was concluded that MERRF is a single disease entity also from pathological point of view.
3133939	An antiserum raised against the synthetic tripeptide pyroglutamyl-histidyl-proline (free acid) was used to localize thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by immunocytochemistry. The distribution of TRH-immunoreactive structures was similar to that reported earlier; i.e., most of the TRH-containing perikarya were located in the parvicellular part of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the suprachiasmatic portion of the preoptic nucleus, the dorsomedial nucleus, the lateral basal hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei. Several new locations for TRH-immunoreactive neurons were also observed, including the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nuclei, the diagonal band of Broca, the septal nuclei, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area, the reticular thalamic nucleus, the lateral reticular nucleus of the medulla oblongata, and the central gray matter of the mesencephalon. Immunoreactive fibers were seen in the median eminence, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, the lateral septal nucleus, the medial habenula, the dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei, the nucleus of the solitary tract, around the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, the dorsal vagal complex, and in the reticular formation of the brainstem. In the spinal cord, no immunoreactive perikarya were observed. Immunoreactive processes were present in the lateral funiculus of the white matter and in laminae V-X in the gray matter. Dense terminal-like structures were seen around spinal motor neurons. The distribution of TRH-immunoreactive structures in the CNS suggests that TRH functions both as a neuroendocrine regulator in the hypothalamus and as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator throughout the CNS.
3158380	Previous studies indicate that 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) intoxication produces discrete lesions of the inferior olive (IO) and other central structures in rats and mice. As a result, it has been widely employed in investigations of the influences of climbing fibers on cerebellar function. This study examines the central toxicity of a protocol reported to produce lesions restricted to the inferior olive in rats. Adult male Long-Evans (n = 12) and Sprague-Dawley (n = 18) were given serial injections of 3-AP (75-80 mg/kg), harmaline (15 mg/kg) or saline, and niacinamide (300 mg/kg). Silver degeneration staining (cupric-silver method) after 6-48 h survival revealed consistent patterns of degenerating neurons in IO, nucleus ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus X, nucleus intercalatus, nucleus dorsalis raphe, medial terminal nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, entopeduncular nucleus, hippocampus (dentate gyrus and CA 3-4), horizontal limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band, and lateral entorhinal cortex, which were not produced by control experiments with 3 saline injections or with two saline injections followed by niacinamide. These data apparently resolve conflicts in the literature regarding central 3-AP toxicity and indicate that the 3-AP-harmaline-niacinamide protocol produces degeneration that is similar to 3-AP alone. However, they also document the discrete, reproducible susceptibility of certain neuronal populations to 3-AP intoxication and suggest that the motor symptoms of intoxication are not solely due to IO destruction. Finally, they form a basis for biochemical investigations of 3-AP toxicity in susceptible central structures.
3192768	The morphology of horizontal canal second-order type I neurons was investigated by intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and three-dimensional reconstruction of the cell bodies and axons. Axons penetrated in and around the abducens nucleus were identified as originating from type I neurons by their characteristic firing pattern to horizontal rotation and by their monosynaptic response to stimulation of the ipsilateral vestibular nerve. A total of 47 type I neurons were stained. The cell bodies were located in the rostral portion of the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) and were large or medium sized and had rather elongated shapes and rich dendritic arborizations. The neurons were divided into two groups: those which projected to the contralateral side of the brain stem (type Ic neurons) and those which projected to the ipsilateral side of the brainstem (type Ii neurons). All stem axons of type Ic neurons crossed the midline and bifurcated into rostral and caudal branches in the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). Two or three collaterals arising close to this bifurcation distributed terminals in a relatively wide area in the contralateral abducens nucleus. Some of these collaterals projected further to the contralateral MVN and thus are vestibular commissural axons. Some of the rostral and caudal stem axons had collaterals which projected to the contralateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (PH), nucleus raphe pontis, or medullary reticular formation. There were at least six classes of type Ii neurons, most of which distributed to a relatively limited region in the ipsilateral abducens nucleus and they were categorized according to their future projections into the following categories: A) no further collaterals beyond the abducens nucleus; B) collaterals in the abducens nucleus and a branch descending and terminating in ipsilateral PH; C) projected to the abducens nucleus, PH, and an area rostral to the abducens nucleus; D) projected to the abducens nucleus and to ipsilateral reticular formation rostral and caudal to the abducens nucleus; E) collaterals in the abducens nucleus and a thick caudal stem axon entering and descending in ipsilateral MLF; F) a thick caudal stem axon entering and descending in ipsilateral MLF and no collaterals to the abducens nucleus. Some type Ii neurons also had recurrent collaterals which projected back to the ipsilateral MVN; these may inhibit type II neurons during ipsilateral rotation.
3193183	Previous studies have identified two neurectoderm-specific serotonin binding proteins (SBP), one with an apparent Mr of 45 kDa, and one of 56 kDa. The current experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that these proteins are specific components of serotonergic neurons. Since actin has been found to bind serotonin, the relationship of the 2 forms of SBP to actin was also investigated. Antisera against purified 45 and 56 kDa SBP were raised in rabbits and shown by analyses of immunoblots and differential absorption to be monospecific and not cross-reactive. Neither antiserum reacted with purified actin and none of 3 different anti-actin sera reacted with purified 45 or 56 kDa SBP. The antisera to 45 and 56 kDa were used for immunocytochemical localization of the proteins, which was compared to that of serotonin. SBP immunoreactivity was found in rat brain and spinal cord; however, no significant differences were observed in the pattern of distribution of 45 and 56 kDa SBP-immunoreactive structures. Immunostaining of neuronal perikarya by either SBP antiserum required pretreatment of animals with colchicine. The distribution of neurons and terminals labeled by each antiserum to SBP was similar to that of neurons and terminals labeled by anti-5-HT sera. SBP-immunoreactive neuronal perikarya were present in the nuclei raphe dorsalis, raphe centralis superior, raphe medianus, raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus, dorsal to the medial lemniscus in the region of the B9 cell group, near the interpeduncular nucleus, in the area postrema, the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the arcuate nucleus. SBP-immunoreactive fibers and terminals were present in many additional areas of the brain, as well as the spinal cord, where they paralleled those that were immunostained with antibodies to 5-HT. When double-immunostaining was used, serotonin and 45 and 56 kDa SBP immunoreactivities were found to be colocalized in both the brain and spinal cord. Cells and fibers found to be stained by one immunoreagent were also stained by the others; therefore, serotonergic neurons of the CNS probably contain both 45 and 56 kDa SBP. Moreover, it also seems likely that nonserotonergic neurons contain neither form of SBP. These data strongly suggest that SBP is an intrinsic and specific component of serotonergic neurons that can serve as a serotonergic marker.
3193185	We used the autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose (14C-DG) method of Sokoloff to identify brain areas with altered rates of local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in vivo in response to peripheral I-nicotine administration (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 1.75 mg/kg, s.c.). Nicotine stimulated LCGU primarily in areas reported to contain nicotine binding sites, indicating that the sites are true receptors. Increases in LCGU of 100% or more over control were obtained in the medial habenula, fasciculus retroflexus, superior colliculus, and median eminence. Substantial stimulation (50-100% increases) also was obtained in the cerebellar vermis, interpeduncular nucleus, and anteroventral and interanteromedial thalamic nuclei. Moderate increases (20-50%) were observed in the reticular nucleus of the medulla, paramedian lobule, nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, presubiculum, subiculum, red nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus tractus solitarius, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, mammillothalamic tract, and fornix. The greatest stimulation in most affected areas was obtained with 0.3 mg/kg nicotine administered at 2 min, but not longer, before 14C-DG. Effects of nicotine on LCGU were antagonized by mecamylamine. The findings indicate that the interaction of nicotine with specific binding sites is coupled to cerebral energy metabolism. The distribution of in vivo cerebral metabolic effects of nicotine implicates various brain regions in the behavioral and physiological effects of nicotine.
3198786	Previous studies have described the distribution of serotonin- and enkephalin-immunoreactive elements in the posterior lobe vermis of the opossum's cerebellum. In the present study we have used a double labeling paradigm which combines the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with serotonin and enkephalin immunohistochemistry to determine the brainstem origin of serotoninergic and enkephalinergic neurons that project to the opossum's cerebellar cortex. Subsequent to HRP injections into the posterior lobe vermis, widespread areas of the medulla and pons were found to contain retrogradely labeled neurons. Serotonin-immunoreactive somata are present primarily in the raphe nuclei and the adjacent reticular formation. Enkephalinergic neurons were numerous in the raphe nuclei, medial accessory olive, gigantocellular reticular formation, locus coeruleus, and the nucleus of the trapezoid body. However, serotoninergic neurons that project to the cerebellum were located only in the medullary pyramids and the reticular formation adjacent to the raphe. Double-labeled enkephalinergic neurons were located 1) within the medullary pyramids, 2) throughout the extent of the caudal medial accessory olive, 3) in the rostral subnucleus a of the medial accessory olive, 4) in the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars ventralis, 5) in the nucleus reticularis lateralis, and 6) in the nucleus reticularis ventralis lateral to the inferior olivary complex. These results indicate that although neurons containing serotonin and enkephalin immunoreactivity may be present in some of the same pontine and medullary nuclei, those serotoninergic and enkephalinergic neurons that project to the cerebellum are present primarily in restricted and spatially separate regions of the caudal medulla.
3198792	Using a sensitive double-immunostaining technique with nonconjugated cholera toxin B subunit (CT) as a retrograde tracer, we examined the cells of origin and the histochemical nature of afferents to the cat nucleus reticularis magnocellularis (Mc) of the medulla oblongata. After injections of CT confined to the Mc, we found that the major afferents to the Mc arise from: (1) the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus of the anterior commissure, the preoptic area, the central nucleus of the amygdala, the posterior hypothalamus, and the nucleus of the fields of Forel; (2) the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, and the ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal grey; (3) the nuclei locus coeruleus alpha (LC alpha), peri-LC alpha, locus subcoeruleus, and reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis; (4) the caudal raphe nuclei; and (5) the nucleus reticularis ventralis of the medulla.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3209731	The regional density and laminar distribution of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) afferents were investigated in the cerebral cortex of cynomolgus monkeys using a radioautographic technique that is based on the high affinity uptake capacity of these aminergic neurons. Large vibratome sections, 50 micron thick, were incubated with [3H] DA (0.2 microM) and desipramine (5 microM) or with unlabeled norepinephrine (5 microM) and [3H] 5-HT (0.6 microM), which allowed for the specific labeling of the DA and 5-HT innervations, respectively. After fixation, these sections were dried, defatted, and radioautographed by dipping. Semiquantitative data on the DA innervation also were provided by counting [3H] DA-labeled axonal varicosities in radioautographs from 4-micron-thick sections of the slices obtained after epon embedding. The DA innervation was widespread and differed in density and laminar distribution in the agranular and granular cortices. DA afferents were densest in the anterior cingulate (area 24) and the motor areas (areas 4, 6, and supplementary motor area [SMA]). In the latter they displayed a trilaminar pattern of distribution, predominating in layers I, IIIa, and V-VI, with characteristic cluster-like formations in layer IIIa, especially in the medial part of motor areas. In the granular prefrontal (areas 46, 9, 10, 11, 12), parietal (areas 1, 2, 3, 5, 7), temporal (areas 21, 22), and posterior cingulate (area 23) cortices, DA afferents were less dense and showed a bilaminar pattern of distribution, predominating in the depth of layer I and in layers V-VI; density in layers II, III, and IV was only 20% of that in layer I. The lowest density was in the visual cortex, particularly in area 17, where the DA afferents were almost restricted to layer I. The density of 5-HT innervation was generally greater than that of DA except in the motor areas and in the anterior cingulate cortex. Region-specific laminar patterns characterized (1) motor areas where a lower density in layer III contrasted with the clusters of DA axons in the same layer; (2) the primary visual cortex (area 17), where two bands of higher density in layers III-IV and layer V outlined a poorly innervated zone in layer IVc-beta; (3) the peristriate area 18, where the 5-HT network was relatively loose but with a denser band in layer III. Thus, DA innervation of the cerebral cortex displays major differences between rodents and primates, characterized by expanded cortical targets and by a highly differentiated laminar distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3209741	We have localized nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the zebra finch brain by using three 125I-labelled ligands: alpha bungarotoxin and two monoclonal antibodies to neuronal nicotinic receptors (MAb 35 of Tzardos et al., J. Biol. Chem., 250: 8635-8645, '81; and MAb 270 of Whiting and Lindstrom: J. Neurosci. 6: 3061-3069, '86). Unfixed brains from intact adult male and female zebra finches were prepared for in vitro autoradiography. Low-resolution film autoradiograms and high-resolution emulsion autoradiograms were prepared for each of the three ligands. The major brain structures that bind all three of the ligands are hippocampus; hyperstriatum dorsalis; hyperstriatum ventralis; nucleus lentiformis mesencephali; nucleus pretectalis, some layers of the optic tectum; nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis; pars dorsalis; locus ceruleus; and all cranial motor nuclei except nucleus nervi hypoglossi. The major structures labelled only by [125I]-alpha bungarotoxin binding included hyperstriatum accessorium and the nuclei: preopticus medialis, medialis hypothalami posterioris, semilunaris, olivarius inferior, and the periventricular organ. Of the song control nuclei, nucleus magnocellularis of the anterior neostriatum; hyperstriatum ventralis, pars caudalis; nucleus intercollicularis; and nucleus hypoglossus were labelled. The binding patterns of the two antibodies were similar to one another but not identical. Both labelled nucleus spiriformis lateralis and nucleus geniculatus lateralis, pars ventralis especially heavily and also labelled the nucleus habenula medialis; nucleus subpretectalis; nucleus isthmi, pars magnocellularis; nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis; nucleus reticularis lateralis; nucleus tractus solitarii; nucleus vestibularis dorsolateralis; nucleus vestibularis lateralis; nucleus descendens nervi trigemini; and the deep cerebellar nuclei. Lobus parolfactorius and nucleus vestibularis medialis were labelled by only MAb 270, whereas only MAb 35 labelled nucleus laminaris and the medial and lateral pontine nuclei. These data extend previous reports of cholinergic participation in the song system (Ryan and Arnold: J. Comp. Neurol. 202: 211-219, '81) to suggest that the zebra finch song system may contain several closely related nicotinic receptors. In several brain nuclei it appeared that certain anatomical portions of a nucleus or a certain class of neurons were specifically labelled. Furthermore, in certain cases, the labelling appeared to be clustered around Nissl-stained cell nuclei, thus suggesting that the receptors are concentrated on or in somata.
3233482	Afferent projections to the tectum opticum of the clawed toad Xenopus laevis were studied by injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the tectum. Cells were labelled in the following nuclei, listed from rostral to caudal: nucleus entopeduncularis anterior, nucleus anterior thalami, nucleus posterior thalami, nucleus ventromedialis thalami, nucleus ventrolateralis thalami pars dorsalis, nucleus lateralis thalami pars posterodorsalis, nucleus neuropilis postthalamici, nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, nucleus praetectalis, nucleus laminaris tori semicircularis, nucleus principalis tori semicircularis, nucleus magnocellularis tori semicircularis, nucleus profundus mesencephali, nucleus anterodorsalis tegmenti, nucleus posterodorsalis tegmenti, nucleus posteroventralis tegmenti, nucleus isthmi, nucleus lineae lateralis pars rostralis, nucleus lineae lateralis pars caudalis, nucleus intermedius, nucleus lateralis nervi octavi, nucleus descendens nervi trigemini, nucleus reticularis superior, nucleus reticularis medius, nucleus reticularis inferior, nucleus reticularis lateralis, nucleus cuneatus and area dorsalis medullae spinalis. Four of these nuclei can be associated with lateral-line processing: the nuclei lineae lateralis rostralis and caudalis of the medulla and the centrolateral nuclei magnocellularis and principalis of the torus semicircularis. The toric input is particularly prominent; it is topologically organized in that central parts of the torus project to the medial tectum, and lateral parts of the torus project to the rostrolateral tectum. For comparison, the torotectal connection was also examined in several anuran species that lose their lateral line at metamorphosis. In these animals, this projection is less well developed than in Xenopus. Therefore, it is argued that the torotectal connection primarily conveys lateral-line information.
3242455	Location of aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldDG) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADG) has been studied in 38 nuclei of the human brain. Neurons with a high AldDG activity predominate in the nucleus of the descending root of the trigeminal nerve, motor nuclei of the craniocerebral nerves (trigeminal, facial, abducent, blocking, sublingual, supraspinal), motor nuclei of the anterior horns of the spinal cord, lateral vestibular nucleus, posterior nucleus of the vagus nerve, pedunculopontine nucleus, superior salivary nucleus, and in the nucleus of Westphal-Edinger-Jacobovich. Neurons with a moderate AldDG activity predominate in the superior olivary complex, nucleus of the lateral loop, parabrachial (pigmented) mesencephalic nucleus and reticular lateral nucleus. A low enzymatic activity is specific for neurons of the pons proper, inferior vestibular nucleus, trapezoid body of the inferior olivary complex, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, reticular nucleus of the tegmen of Bekhterev's pons and posterior nucleus of Gudden's suture. A high ADG activity is revealed in piriform neurons of the cerebellar cortex. Functional importance of ADG and AldDG activity in the brain is discussed.
3252172	Vasopressin may act in the brain as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator to influence blood pressure, memory, body temperature and brain development. In order to localize probable central nervous system sites for these actions, we have used 125I-labelled 1-d(CH2)5, 7-sarcosine-8-arginine vasopressin, a specific V1-receptor antagonist, and in vitro autoradiography to map brain vasopressin binding sites. High levels of binding were found in the choroid plexus, blood vessels, lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, accumbens nucleus, central nucleus of amygdala, stigmoid hypothalamic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, area postrema and parts of the hippocampus, thalamus, superior colliculus, and inferior olivary nuclei. Many of these regions are known to be vasopressin-sensitive and to contain vasopressin fibres. Significantly there was no binding to the paraventricular nor the supraoptic nuclei. Displacement of the radioligand from the lateral septum with unlabelled vasopressin analogues gave a rank order of potencies: d(CH2)5-D-Tyr2(Et)Val4-desGly9-arginine-vasopressin approximately equal to d(CH2)5-Tyr2-(Me)arginine-vasopressin approximately equal to arginine-vasopressin approximately equal to d(CH2)5-Sar7-arginine-vasopressin greater than [1-deamino, 8-D-arginine]-vasopressin approximately equal to oxytocin much greater than vasopressin4-9, consistent with binding to V1 receptor subtype. These studies confirm and extend previous findings of V1 receptors in the rat brain. In particular, several new regions of vasopressin receptor binding have been identified, possibly due to the advantages of a radioiodinated ligand with high receptor affinity without binding to neurophysins. Future study of these regions may prove fruitful in elucidating the central actions of vasopressin.
3264390	The ontogeny of the calcitonin gene-related peptide in the neuron system of the rat brain stem was investigated by means of the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity was first detected in the fibers of the nucleus of spinal tract trigeminal nerve on gestational day 18, and thereafter appeared gradually in various brain stem areas such as in the fibers of the solitary tract, gracile nucleus, cuneate nucleus, inferior colliculus, superior colliculus, medial geniculate nucleus and in the neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus, facial nucleus, superior olive, parabrachial area, superior colliculus and peripeduncular nucleus. In colchicine-untreated animals, the immunoreactive fibers increased in number and reached adult level by postnatal day 14, whereas the number of cells reached a maximum between postnatal days 2 and 6 and then decreased in number and immunoreactivity or disappeared, except in some areas such as the superior olive and peripeduncular nucleus, which showed the same immunoreactivity as for adult animals. With colchicine treatment, calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactive cells were found in more areas of the brain stem such as the abducens nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, principal oculomotor nucleus, trochlear nucleus and central gray, along with the nuclei which had shown calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in the untreated animals. However, the neurons in the inferior olive showed a different ontogenetical pattern of calcitonin gene-related peptide of immunoreactivity. Immunoreactivity disappeared completely by postnatal day 21 in both colchicine-untreated and -treated animals.
3267341	An analysis of the distribution of substance P immunoreactive nerve cell bodies and fibres is given for infant and adult human hippocampus by using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique of Sternberger. The description covers the substance P distribution in the area dentata, the Ammon's horn, the subicular complex and the entorhinal cortex. Each region shows a specific pattern in its substance P immunoreactivity. In general, the hippocampal neurons occur in three major classes of interneurons: large (20-35 microns) horizontal bipolar or multipolar neurons in the alveus, in the deep part of the subicular complex, the entorhinal cortex, and in the white matter of the angular bundle; small (10-20 microns) and large (20-35 microns) vertically oriented bipolar or multipolar neurons in the stratum oriens, in the stratum pyramidale of the Ammon's horn, and in the deep part of the subicular complex and the entorhinal cortex; large (20-35 microns) multipolar neurons in the hilus. Substance P immunoreactive fibres are particularly abundant around pyramidal cells of the CA2 and CA3 subfields of the Ammon's horn and around granule cells of the area dentata. They are also detected in the fimbria and angular bundle. Comparative study of the infant and adult hippocampus reveals no variation in the area dentata and Ammon's horn except that substance P immunoreactive fibres are more abundant in the molecular layer of the area dentata in adults. In contrast, a far more extensive number of substance P immunoreactive cell bodies are detected in the deep layers of the subicular complex and the entorhinal cortex, as well as in the white matter of the angular bundle in infants aged between three and 12 months old. This rich substance P immunoreactive network raises questions concerning its function within the human hippocampus.
3276831	Distribution of protein kinase C in the CNS of rat is presented based on immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies against this protein kinase. Protein kinase C-like immunoreactivity was discretely localized and associated with neurons. Most, if not all, glial cells were not significantly stained. The greatest density of the immunoreactive material was seen in the following regions: the olfactory bulb (external plexiform layer), olfactory tuberculum, anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral cortex (layers I and IV), pyriform cortex, hippocampus (strata radiatum and oriens), amygdaloid complex (central and basolateral nuclei), cerebellar cortex (molecular layer), dorsal cochlear nucleus, nucleus spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord (substantia gelatinosa). Image analysis revealed that the regional distribution of the protein kinase C-like immunoreaction generally agreed with that of phorbol ester-binding sites. Immunoreactive perikarya were found in the following areas: the cerebral cortex (layers V and VI), caudate putamen, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdaloid complex, medial and lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, cerebellar cortex, nucleus spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, dorsal cochlear nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Intense protein kinase C-like immunoreactivity in the neuron was observed both in the membrane and cytoplasm of the perikarya, dendrites, axons, and axon terminals, while weak immunoreaction was seen in the nuclei but almost never in the nucleoles. A map of protein kinase C-containing neurons was constructed. Such an uneven distribution in the brain suggests that this enzyme may play roles in controlling neuronal function in the areas noted.
3295585	The sites of origin of brain stem enkephalin and cholecystokinin projections to the rodent spinal trigeminal nucleus were studied utilizing the combined retrograde transport-peroxidase antiperoxidase immunohistochemical technique. Several brain stem areas were found to contain enkephalin-like immunoreactive double-labeled neurons following injection of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or horseradish peroxidase into the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The largest numbers of enkephalin double-labeled neurons were identified in the nucleus pontis oralis, nucleus raphe medianis, medial vestibular nucleus and the midbrain periaqueductal gray. Enkephalin projections to the spinal trigeminal nucleus were also found to originate from the nucleus solitarius, nucleus raphe pallidus, nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe dorsalis, nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars alpha and the deep mesencephalic nucleus. In contrast to the numerous sources of enkephalin input to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, cholecystokinin projections to this region were limited to four brain stem nuclei. These included the nucleus solitarius, raphe obscurus, nucleus paragigantocellularis and the ventral reticular nucleus of the medulla. The finding that only a small number of brain stem cholecystokinin-like immunoreactive neurons project to the spinal trigeminal nucleus supports the hypothesis that most of the cholecystokinin input to the spinal trigeminal nucleus arises from primary afferent trigeminal fibers. The spinal trigeminal nucleus is known to play a role in processing sensory information and in the transmission of orofacial nociception. The present study identifies several brain stem sites which provide enkephalin and/or cholecystokinin input to the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Several of these nuclei have been implicated as components of the endogenous pain control system and the present results raise the possibility that they may modulate incoming orofacial nociception by releasing the endogenous opioid, enkephalin. Cholecystokinin, on the other hand, has been demonstrated in other studies to attenuate the action of opiates and thus may play an opposing role in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.
3299138	The distribution of choline-acetyltransferase-like immunoreactive structures in the rat hypothalamus and preoptic area was examined by using avidin-biotin immunocytochemistry. We found that the hypothalamus is richly innervated by the cholinergic neuron system. Sites containing cholinergic neurons of varying density were: medial and lateral preoptic areas, septohypothalamic nucleus, median preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus including the perifornical area, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, posterior hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal and ventral premammillary nuclei, neuropil mediodorsal to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, neuropil ventral to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, neuropil between lateral hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus, and neuropil between dorsal premammillary nucleus and posterior hypothalamic nucleus. There were also many varicose and non-varicose fibers in the preoptic area and hypothalamus. Two kinds of varicose fibers, one with strong immunoreactivity and the other with weak immunoreactivity, were seen. Non-varicose fibers were also detected in the optic chiasma and habenulo-interpeduncular tract. These fibers were passing fibers.
3305599	The distribution of methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, a unique peptide derived from proenkephalin A in the rat brainstem, was studied immunocytochemically by using a highly specific antiserum to this octapeptide sequence. Immunoreactive perikarya with various shapes and sizes were detected in many regions of the rat brainstem. Dense accumulation of immunoreactive perikarya and fibers was seen in the nuclei associated with special sensory and visceral functions, such as the interpeduncular nucleus, the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. Clusters of methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8-like immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were observed in certain areas considered to play a role in nociception and analgesia, such as the central gray of the midbrain central gray and the raphe magnus nucleus. Some methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8-like immunoreactive perikarya were distributed in the lateral reticular nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the raphe magnus nucleus, where monoaminergic neurons were also detected. In addition to the previously reported enkephalinergic cells, we found many methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 containing neurons; the rostral and caudal linear nucleus of raphe, the median raphe nucleus, entire length of the raphe magnus nucleus, the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the cuneate nucleus, the external cuneate nucleus, the gracile nucleus, and the area postrema. The wide distribution of this octapeptide-like immunoreactivity reflected neurons expressing the preproenkephalin A gene distributed more widely than previously reported and that innervated many regions.
3306450	The distribution of the C-terminal glycopeptide of the vasopressin prohormone was mapped in rat brain by an immunocytochemical method using antibodies to the sheep glycopeptide. The antibodies did not react with vasopressin, oxytocin or their related neurophysins. Stained neural perikarya were observed in the hypothalamus (suprachiasmatic, paraventricular, and supraoptic nuclei) and in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Fibres were detected in the hypothalamus and in extrahypothalamic regions (the frontal cortex, the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the medial nuclei of the thalamus, the lateral habenula, the amygdala, the mesencephalic central gray, the raphe nucleus of the solitary tract and the cervical spinal cord). The distribution of glycopeptide immunoreactive cells was generally similar in young rats (8 weeks old) to the distribution in older rats (13 weeks old) except in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis where stained neurons were relatively sparse or absent in the younger animals. Similarly, in the young rats the density of fibres containing the glycopeptide was reduced in territories innervated by the bed nucleus. In both young and old rats the neuronal distribution of the glycopeptide was identical to the distribution of vasopressin, which suggests that the glycopeptide and vasopressin are co-transported from the sites of biosynthesis to the sites of release.
3313097	The topographic distribution of specifically labeled neurotensin binding sites was examined by light microscopic radioautography in rat brain sections incubated with monoiodo [125I]Tyr3-neurotensin. Preliminary experiments indicated that under the present experimental conditions [125I]neurotensin specifically binds to a single apparent population of sites with a dissociation constant of 7.7 +/- 0.3 nM, and that fixation of the labeled sections with glutaraldehyde ensures regionally proportional retention of more than 70% of bound [125I]neurotensin molecules. High concentrations of [125I]neurotensin binding sites were detected in the olfactory bulb and tubercle, parts of the neocortex, the lateral septum, the diagonal band of Broca, the caudate putamen, the amygdala, the dentate gyrus, the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the medial habenula, the zona incerta, the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. In certain areas, such as in the diagonal band of Broca, the substantia innominata, the nucleus basalis and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, discrete accumulations of silver grains were apparent over neuronal perikarya and their proximal dendrites. In most areas, however, the label appeared more or less uniformly distributed over nerve cell bodies and surrounding neuropil. In several instances, the labeling conformed with the distribution of cell bodies of origin and terminal aborizations of specific projection systems, suggesting that neurotensin receptors might be distributed both proximally and distally on the plasma membrane of certain neurons. Such putative "neurotensinoceptive" projection systems might involve part of the mesostriatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems, as well as the raphe-prosencephalic serotonin system and the habenulo-interpeduncular and basal forebrain-cortical cholinergic systems. Finally, areas of dense [125I]neurotensin labeling often corresponded to zones previously shown to exhibit intense acetylcholinesterase staining, suggesting the existence of a possible link between the expression of neurotensin binding sites and that of acetylcholinesterase in certain neuronal populations.
3325198	Renin-like enzyme(s) in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were activated unequivocally by trypsin. The highest concentration of the active renin-like enzyme was localized in the hypothalamus (1.03 +/- 0.25 ng angiotensin I/mg of protein per h, mean +/- S.D.), followed by the striatum (0.51 +/- 0.21), thalamus (0.40 +/- 0.08), midbrain (0.33 +/- 0.04), medulla oblongata (0.25 +/- 0.01), cerebral cortex (0.21 +/- 0.03), and cerebellum (0.14 +/- 0.03), while the highest concentration of the inactive renin-like enzyme was localized in the hypothalamus (0.86 +/- 0.17), followed by the striatum (0.47 +/- 0.15), thalamus (0.32 +/- 0.09), cerebellum (0.29 +/- 0.04), midbrain (0.26 +/- 0.02), cerebral cortex (0.24 +/- 0.04), and medulla oblongata (0.10 +/- 0.03). The active renin-like activity in the thalamus of SHR was significantly lower than that of age- and sex-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Furthermore, the inactive renin-like activity in the striatum, thalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, and medulla oblongata of SHR was significantly lower than that in the corresponding areas of WKY rats. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the conversion of inactive to active renin-like enzyme in the brain remain to be resolved, these results may offer a new aspect for the role of the brain renin-angiotensin system in the initiation and/or development of hypertension of SHR.
3325853	The distribution of neuromedin Us, uterus-stimulating and hypertensive peptides newly identified in porcine spinal cord, was examined in the rat brain by the indirect immunofluorescent method. Neuromedin U-like immunoreactive structures were found to be unevenly distributed in the neuronal system. Neuromedin U-like immunoreactive neurons were present in the cranial motor nuclei, reticular nuclei, nucleus vestibularis lateralis, trigeminal sensory nuclei, colliculus superior and inferior, lemniscus lateralis, nucleus pontis, nucleus ruber, zona incerta, substantia innominata, horizontal limb of the diagonal band and cerebral cortex. The immunoreactive fibres were found in the above areas, particularly near the labelled cells, forming a fibre plexus with various intensities of immunoreactivity. In addition, dense plexuses were also seen in the nucleus reticularis thalami, nucleus ventralis posteromedialis, nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, nucleus tegmentalis dorsalis and ventralis, vertical limb of the diagonal band, nucleus olivaris superior, and nucleus pontis. In the first six structures, no labelled neurons were present and in the remaining structures, a few scattered neurons were noted. This indicates that these fibres are probably of extrinsic origin.
3329297	Location of retrogradely labelled neurons in various structures of the central nervous system was studied by microiontophoretic injection of horseradish peroxidase into dorsal sections of the magnocellular part of the cat red nucleus. Projections were revealed from some hypothalamic nuclei, centrum medianum, as well as from nucleus parafascicularis and subthalamic nucleus; from zone incerta, field of Forel, nucleus medialis habenulae; from reticular formation of the pons, medulla oblongata and midbrain, central gray matter, colliculus superior, nucleus interstitialis Cajal; from contralateral red nucleus, nucleus fastigii and facial nucleus; from nucleus vestibularis lateralis (pars dorsalis) and nucleus vestibularis medialis as well as from ventral horn of the spinal cord cervical segments. Connections between substantia nigra and the red nucleus have been studied more accurately. Bilateral trajectories of retrogradely labelled fibre systems are described.
3335858	2-Hydroxyputrescine in seven regions of single rat brains was measured with a sensitive, specific assay by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The regions were the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. The level of 2-hydroxyputrescine was very high in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, high in the medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, and low in the striatum and midbrain. The level of 2-hydroxyputrescine in the cerebellum was significantly higher than in the striatum and midbrain.
3340317	Immunohistochemical localization of cytochrome P-450 in the brains of normal untreated male rats has been demonstrated with polyclonal antibodies raised against hepatic P-450C. These antibodies recognize P-450C and D, two closely related forms of P-450. We have identified P-450C,D immunoreactivity (P-450C,D-i) within both neurons and glial cells. Neuronal cell bodies showing P-450C,D-i were present in several forebrain areas, including the olfactory bulb, the caudate nucleus, the cingulate, the frontal and the entorhinal cortex, the hippocampus and the thalamus. In the brainstem, P-450C,D-i neurons were detected in the substantia nigra, the nucleus locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus, reticular formation and the trigeminal nerve nucleus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Glial cells containing P-450C,D-i were situated within myelinated fiber tracts in the forebrain (e.g. the corpus callosum, the internal capsule) and the brainstem (e.g. the superior cerebellar peduncle, the medial longitudinal fasciculus). Some, but not all, of the P-450C,D-i glial cells also stained with an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein. The present findings represent the first immunohistochemical demonstration of cytochrome P-450 in the brain and suggest that cytochrome P-450C,D is constitutive in neurons and glial cells of most brain regions throughout the rat neuraxis.
3345450	Brain activity was measured autoradiographically using [1-14C]octanoate (OCTO) as a fast functional tracer in rats receiving either saline, heroin or cocaine. Regional optical densities were normalized to a relative optical density index for comparisons of OCTO labeling between treatment groups. Heroin significantly increased labeling in the dentate gyrus and cocaine increased density in the anterior cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, hippocampus CA3-4, lateral septum, hypothalamus and ventral tegmentum. Heroin and cocaine induced significant, but opposing effects in medial cortex and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Both drugs decreased labeling density in the nucleus accumbens and piriform cortex, and increased density in the substantia nigra, subthalamus, medial septum, claustrum, lateral hypothalamus and hippocampus CA2. These results demonstrate the ability of the OCTO method to discriminate the brief metabolic effects of different drug classes, and suggest that heroin and cocaine may activate a common functional system in the brain.
3346676	In a postmortem study of nicotinic receptors in human brain, cigarette smoking was found to be associated with increased (-)-[3H]nicotine binding to membranes prepared from gyrus rectus (Brodmann area 11) (p less than 0.001), hippocampal neocortex (Brodmann area 27), cerebellar cortex (p less than 0.01), hippocampal formation (Ammon's horn + subiculum), and the median raphe nuclei of the midbrain (p less than 0.05) but not the medulla oblongata. Analysis of the binding data suggested that the increased binding reflected an increase in the density of the receptors rather than a change in their affinity for (-)-nicotine. The effects of smoking were not influenced significantly by either the sex or age of the subject. It is concluded that smoking evokes an increase in high-affinity nicotine binding similar to that observed previously in animals treated chronically with nicotine and that the effect of smoking on these sites is probably caused by the nicotine present in the tobacco smoke.
3356502	Regional morphine accumulation was examined in 8 brain areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum) following either a single dose or incremental doses administered by intraperitoneal injection. Morphine levels were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with chemical ionization detection. Prior to morphine assay, the vasculature was cleared of blood by saline perfusion to eliminate distortion of tissue-morphine by blood-morphine. Results indicate a dose-dependent, differential accumulation of morphine in different brain regions following incremental morphine administration. Three distinct uptake profiles were obtained, with the cerebellum, hippocampus, medulla and cortex showing roughly linear accumulation the midbrain, striatum and thalamus showing nonlinear accumulation, and the hypothalamus showing significantly higher absolute morphine levels than any other brain region.
3358826	The effect of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and lactation on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in different rat brain regions of 3-week-old pups was investigated. There was a significant decrease in the thalamus, pons, cerebellum and hippocampus, no change in posterior colliculus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, hypothalamus, septum or striatum and a significant increase in frontal cortex, olfactory bulbs, anterior colliculus and amygdala. These modifications could be a consequence of alterations in membrane permeability and may be related to the behavioural disorders associated with the fetal-alcohol syndrome.
3359255	Alterations in local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in conscious rats during electrical stimulation of the striatum and the globus pallidus were investigated using the [14C]deoxyglucose method. Stimulation of the globus pallidus produced a marked contraversive circling behavior, while stimulation of the striatum led only to contraversive head turning. Unilateral stimulation of the striatum increased LCGU bilaterally in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars compacta, but only ipsilaterally in the entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and subthalamic nucleus. Similar stimulation of the globus pallidus increased LGCU in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, deep layers of the superior colliculus and pedunculopontine nucleus, exclusively on the ipsilateral side. These results indicate that the electrical stimulation induces LCGU changes in the respective structures having both monosynaptic and transsynaptic neuronal inputs. Some changes may also be mediated by antidromic activation. They also suggest that activation of a synaptic process whether excitatory or inhibitory results in increases in LCGU. The bilateral modulatory effects of striatal stimulation may cancel out the circling behavior seen during pallidal stimulation, and cause only head turning.
3360994	Distributions of neurons located in the central rostral mesencephalon and caudal diencephalon that project to the upper cervical spinal cord, vestibular nuclei, or inferior olive were studied in the cat by using retrograde axonal transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Afferent sources to all of these targets were observed in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), the region surrounding the fasciculus retroflexus (PF), and the nucleus of the fields of Forel (NFF). Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed differences in densities of cells projecting from these common areas. Spinal projecting cells were present in slightly greater numbers in the caudal two-thirds of the INC, whereas those projecting to the vestibular complex were more numerous in the rostral two-thirds of this nucleus. A relatively smaller number of olivary projecting cells were dispersed throughout the INC. Olivary afferent sources outnumber those with spinally directed or vestibularly directed axons in the PF region. In the fields of Forel, cells projecting to the vestibular nuclei or inferior olive were concentrated medially, whereas cells projecting to the spinal cord appeared both medially and laterally. Each type of afferent source was also seen in the nucleus of the posterior commissure and the posterior ventral lateral hypothalamic area. Unique sources of afferents to the inferior olive were observed in the parvicellular red nucleus (ipsilateral to the injections) and the anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei. A large number of labeled neurons was seen in the nucleus of Darkschewitsch after injections of tracer into the inferior olive, but this projection did not appear to be unique, as small numbers of labeled cells were also seen after injections into the cervical spinal cord. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the adjacent somatic oculomotor nucleus contained cells which projected separately to the spinal cord or the vestibular complex, and the superior colliculus contained cells which projected separately to the contralateral spinal cord or the contralateral inferior olive. In this study, it was also noted that neurons in the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract projected to the ipsilateral inferior olive or to the contralateral vestibular complex. These differences in locations and densities of cells projecting to the cervical spinal cord, vestibular complex, and inferior olive may underlie functional specializations in these areas in relation to vertical eye and head movement control and to neural systems controlling postural adjustments accompanying limb movements.
3361005	The distribution and density of the nonretinal projections to the rabbit medial terminal accessory optic nucleus (MTN) have been studied after injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the MTN in seven rabbits, and confirmation for the presence of certain of these projections has been made in the rabbit or rat by utilizing anterograde transport of tritiated leucine or leucine/proline after appropriate injections into cerebral cortical areas and brainstem nuclei. In seven cases studied by the retrograde axonal transport method, HRP-labeled neurons have been identified: (A) In four visual or preoculomotor nuclei in which available autoradiographic brain series have confirmed the presence of projections to the MTN: (1) The nucleus of the optic tract/dorsal terminal accessory optic nucleus, (2) the interstitial nucleus of the superior fasciculus (posterior fibers), (3) the periaqueductal gray (including its supraoculomotor portion), and (4) the medial division of the deep mesencephalic nucleus. (B) Within the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, from which a projection to the MTN has been confirmed autoradiographically in the rat by other workers. (C) In brainstem nuclei and cerebral cortical areas in which available autoradiographic brain series fail to confirm the presence of afferents to the MTN: (1) The nucleus reticularis pontis, pars oralis and pars caudalis, (2) the intermediate interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, (3) the nucleus raphe pontis, and (4) five cerebral cortical areas (the area retrosplenialis granularis dorsalis, the striate area, the parietal area 3, the subicular cortex, and the regio praecentralis granularis). Finally, we report retrograde labeling which, on the basis of published connectional data, we believe to result from the spread to and uptake from axons en passant. The false-positive labeling in this category is likely to result from spread of HRP into ventral tegmental nuclei or tracts adjacent to the MTN. Thus, as a result, in the medulla and pons, labeled neurons are found in the medial, lateral, and superior vestibular nuclei, the medullary reticular formation including the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, the lateral reticular nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the spinal nucleus of V, the nucleus gracilis/nucleus cuneatus, the dorsal and ventral divisions of the parabrachial nucleus, the central pontine gray, the nucleus K of Meessen and Olszewski, and the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3364750	The anterior dorsal ventricular ridge (ADVR), a large intraventricular protrusion in the reptilian forebrain, receives information from many different sensory modalities and in turn, projects massively onto the striatum. The ADVR possesses functional similarities to the mammalian isocortex and may perform complex sensory integrations. The ADVR in lizards is composed of three longitudinal zones which receive visual, somatosensory and acustic information, respectively. These projections are relayed via thalamic nuclei. Previous retrograde tracer studies also suggested brain stem projections to the ADVR arising in the midbrain reticular formation and in certain monoaminergic brain stem nuclei (substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and nucleus raphes superior). In the present study the powerful retrograde fluorescent tracer 'Fast Blue' was applied as a slow-release gel to the ADVR of the savanna monitor lizard, Varanus exanthematicus. Thalamic projections were confirmed and various direct brain stem projections to the ADVR were demonstrated. Brain stem afferents to the ADVR were found from the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis (possibly comparable to the mammalian periaqueductal gray), from the midbrain reticular formation, from the substantia nigra (pars compacta and reticulata) and the adjacent ventral tegmental area, from the nucleus raphes superior, from the locus coeruleus, from the parabrachial region, from the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and even from the most caudal part of the brain stem (a few neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract and lateral reticular formation, possibly comparable to the mammalian A2 and A1 groups, respectively). These data strongly suggest direct ADVR projections from the parabrachial region (related to visceral and taste information) as well as distinct catecholaminergic (presumably dopaminergic: substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and, noradrenergic: locus coeruleus, respectively) and serotonergic projections (nucleus raphes superior).
3370442	In three breeds of domestic pigeons (fantails, homing pigeons, and strassers) the volumes of fresh, i.e. unfixed tissue of 14 brain structures were determined (telencephalon, diencephalon, nervus opticus, tectum, cerebellum, tegmentum and hyperstriatum accessorium, hyperstriatum ventrale, neostriatum, paleostriatum, hippocampus, septum, regio praepiriformis, bulbus olfactorius). Allometric comparisons that take into account differences in body weight and size were made among these three breeds. The tectum, hippocampus, paleostriatum and especially the neostriatum and olfactory bulb are remarkably larger in homing pigeons. These data are discussed in a functional context, in which the homing ability of homing pigeons is considered.
3372741	The topographic distribution of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)-immunoreactive (IR) neurons was investigated in the cat hypothalamus, limbic areas, and thalamus by using specific antiserum raised against porcine kidney AADC. The perikarya and main axons were mapped on an atlas in ten cross-sectional drawings from A8 to A16 of the Horsley Clarke stereotaxic plane. AADC-IR neurons were widely distributed in the anterior brain. They were identified in the posterior hypothalamic area, rostral arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, dorsal hypothalamic area, and periventricular complex of the hypothalamus, which contain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR cells and are known as A11 to A14 dopaminergic cell groups. AADC-IR perikarya were also found in the other hypothalamic areas where few or no TH-IR cells have been reported: the supramamillary nucleus, tuberomamillary nucleus, pre- and anterior mamillary nuclei, caudal arcuate nucleus, dorsal hypothalamic area immediately ventral to the mamillothalamic tract, anterior hypothalamic area, area of the tuber cinereum, retrochiasmatic area, preoptic area, suprachiasmatic and dorsal chiasmatic nuclei. We also identified them in the anterior commissure nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, stria terminalis, medial and central amygdaloid nuclei, lateral septal nucleus, and nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca. AADC-IR neurons were localized in the ventromedial part of the thalamus, lateral posterior complex, paracentral nucleus and lateral dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, medial habenula, parafascicular nucleus, subparafascicular nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. Conversely, we detected only a few AADC-IR cells in the supraoptic nucleus whose rostral portion contains TH-IR perikarya. Comments are made on the relative localizations of the AADC-IR and TH-IR neurons, on species differences between the cat and rat, as well as on the possible physiological functions of the enzyme AADC.
3372742	Binding of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8] angiotensin II (AII) to sections of brains from both wild and laboratory rabbits was determined by in vitro autoradiography. In the forebrain, specific high density binding was observed in the olfactory bulb, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), subfornical organ, median eminence, lateral septum, median preoptic nucleus and hypothalamic paraventricular, supraoptic and arcuate nuclei. In the midbrain, binding of the radioligand was observed in the interpeduncular and parabrachial nuclei, in the locus coeruleus, and ventrolateral pons. In the hind brain, there was dense binding of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8] AII to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and to both rostral and caudal parts of the reticular formation of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata. Weaker specific binding of the radioligand to the molecular layer of the cerebellum, to the nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, area postema, and to a band of tissue connecting the NTS to the ventrolateral medulla was also observed. Binding of the ligand to circumventricular organs such as the OVLT, subfornical organ, and median eminence suggests that these are sites in the brain of the rabbit at which blood-borne AII may exert influences on the central regulation of fluid balance and pituitary hormone secretion, although AII of neuronal origin could also act at these sites. Binding of the radioligand in several other brain regions suggests that angiotensin II of cerebral origin may be involved in a number of different aspects of brain function in the rabbit. The finding of dense binding in the NTS and ventrolateral medulla, which are involved in autonomic activity and are also sites of catecholamine-containing neurons, raises the possibility of angiotensin interaction with these neurons and involvement in autonomic function.
3380307	Brainstem afferents to various nuclei of the basal forebrain of the rat were examined using the retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. These forebrain nuclei included the medial septum-vertical limb of the diagonal band nucleus, the lateral septum, the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, the medial preoptic area and the magnocellular preoptic nucleus/substantia innominata. Medial septal-vertical limb of the diagonal band injections produced dense cell labeling in: raphe obscurus, nucleus incertus, central gray-pars alpha, locus coeruleus, raphe pontis, median raphe, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, a compact cell group within the mesencephalic gray dorsolateral to the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and the supramammillary nucleus. Lateral septal injections produced the heaviest cell labeling in the A1 and A2 areas (of Dahlstrom and Fuxe), the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus, the ventral tegmental area and the supramammillary nucleus. There were considerably fewer labeled cells overall with lateral septal as compared with medial septal injections. Brainstem projections to the horizontal limb of the diagonal band were pronounced. The most heavily labeled nuclei were A1, locus coeruleus, laterodorsalis (dorsolateral tegmental nucleus of Castaldi), raphe pontis, median raphe, lateral parabrachial nucleus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus of Darkschewitsch and the supramammillary nucleus. Medial preoptic area injections produced pronounced labeling in: A1 and A2 areas, raphe magnus, locus coeruleus, laterodorsalis, lateral parabrachial nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, peripenduncular nucleus and the supramammillary nucleus. The pattern of brainstem labeling obtained with magnocellular preoptic/substantia innominata injections was considerably different from the patterns seen with the other injections. Specifically, relatively few cell groups, essentially confined to the upper brainstem (rostral pons and midbrain), were densely labeled following magnocellular preoptic/substantia innominata injections. These included the medial parabrachial nucleus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the ventral tegmental area and the supramammillary nucleus. With the exception of the supramammillary nucleus, each of these cell groups was more heavily labeled with magnocellular preoptic/substantia innominata injections than with others of this series. The above describes the major brainstem projections to each of the forebrain sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3392544	In vitro quantitative autoradiography of high-affinity [3H]imipramine binding sites was performed on 16 human brains postmortem. The densities of binding sites were highest in the hypothalamus. Next, in descending order, were the basal and lateral nuclei of the amygdala; substantia innominata; insular cortex; the central nucleus of the amygdala; the anterior nucleus of the thalamus; the head of the caudate nucleus; portions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex; claustrum; the granular layer of the dentate gyrus; substantia nigra; the pyramidal layer of CA fields; globus pallidus; red nucleus; and white matter. Imipramine binding was found to increase with age in a region-specific manner. The presence of alcohol had a similar effect, which was most pronounced in the hippocampus. Sex and time from death to autopsy did not affect imipramine binding, in our sample.
3394010	The microsurgical anatomy of the choroidal fissure was examined in 25 cadaveric heads. The choroidal fissure, the site of attachment of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle, is located between the fornix and thalamus in the medial part of the lateral ventricle. The choroidal fissure is divided into three parts: (a) a body portion situated in the body of the lateral ventricle between the body of the fornix and the thalamus, (b) an atrial part located in the atrium of the lateral ventricle between the crus of the fornix and the pulvinar, and (c) a temporal part situated in the temporal horn between the fimbria of the fornix and the lower surface of the thalamus. The three parts of the fissure are the thinnest sites in the wall of the lateral ventricle bordering the basal cisterns and the roof of the third ventricle. Opening through the body portion of the choroidal fissure from the lateral ventricle exposes the velum interpositum and third ventricle. Opening through the temporal portion of the choroidal fissure from the temporal horn exposes the structures in the ambient and crural cisterns. Opening through the atrial portion of the fissure from the atrium exposes the quadrigeminal cistern, the pineal region, and the posterior portion of the ambient cistern. The neural, arterial, and venous relationships of each part of the fissure are reviewed. The operative approaches directed through each part of the fissure are also reviewed.
3404987	Previous results obtained in this laboratory indicate that in the rat brain the 5 alpha-reductase, the enzymatic activity involved in metabolizing testosterone into 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one (dihydrotestosterone), is particularly concentrated in the white matter. In the present experiments, this enzymatic activity was studied in the following white matter structures, which were microdissected using the punch technique of Palkovits: anterior commissure (CA), fornix (FX), habenulo-interpeduncular tract (HP), corpus callosum (CC), stria medullaris (SM), optic chiasm (CO), fimbria of the hippocampus (FI), cerebral peduncle (PC), pontine fibers (FP), cerebellar medulla (CMD) and corticospinal tract (TCS). Moreover brain myelin was isolated and purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The results obtained confirm that, in the rat brain, the enzymes involved in testosterone 5 alpha-reduction are preferentially localized in the white matter. However, clearcut differences in the metabolic activity exist between the different structures examined so far. DHT formation increases rostro-caudally, so that the highest activity has been recorded in the white matter structures punched at the level of pons (FP), medulla oblungata (TCS) and cerebellum (CMD). The high metabolic activity associated with the white matter structures appears to be linked to the presence of myelin, since the specific activity of the enzyme is particularly elevated in purified preparations of myelin sheaths.
3409030	In vitro quantitative autoradiography of high-affinity [3H]desmethylimipramine (DMI) binding sites was performed on 24 human brains postmortem. Highest densities of binding sites were found in portions of the amygdala, the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal layer of CA4. Next, in descending order were other portions of the hippocampus and amygdala, the head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, hypothalamus, insular cortex, prefrontal cortex, parietal, frontal and temporal cortex, anterior, medial and posterolateral nuclei of the thalamus. Lowest densities, hardly above background, were found in the two divisions of the globus pallidus, the centromedian, ventrolateral and posteroventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus, substantia nigra, red nucleus and white matter. Specific high-affinity [3H]DMI binding was not affected by age, sex and suicide in any of the regions studied. It was negatively correlated with postmortem delay in several regions.
3414978	Cortical and brain stem neurons projecting to the spinal cord in the hedgehog were studied by means of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracing method. HRP injections were placed in the first cervical segments, in the cervical enlargement (C5-T3) and in the lumbar enlargement. Following injections in the first cervical segments and in the cervical enlargement labelled neurons were observed in the somatic motor and somatic sensory cortices, the paraventricular and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, the nuclei of field H of Forel, the red nucleus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the deep layers of the superior colliculus, the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the periaqueductal grey, the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, the loci coeruleus and subcoeruleus, the nuclei raphe dorsalis, centralis superior, raphe magnus, raphe pallidus, and raphe obscurus, the rhombencephalic reticular formation, the lateral, medial and caudal vestibular nuclei, the nucleus ambiguus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the gracile nucleus. After HRP injections in the lumbar enlargement, labelled neurons were not found in the cortex, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, the nuclei of field H of Forel, the superior colliculus and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. These results show that cortical and brain stem projections to the spinal cord are comparable to those described in other species.
3416778	The distribution of the mesencephalic neural crest cells in the mouse embryo was studied by mapping the colonization pattern of WGA-gold labelled cells following specific labelling of the neuroectoderm and grafting of presumptive neural crest cells to orthotopic and heterotopic sites. The result showed that (1) there were concomitant changes in the morphology of the neural crest epithelium during the formation of neural crest cells, in the 4- to 7-somite-stage embryos, (2) the neural crest cells were initially confined to the lateral subectodermal region of the cranial mesenchyme and there was minimal mixing with the paraxial mesoderm underneath the neural plate, (3) labelled cells from the presumptive crest region colonized the lateral cranio-facial mesenchyme, the developing trigeminal ganglion and the pharyngeal arch, (4) the formation of neural crest cells was facilitated by the focal disruption of the basal lamina and the cell-cell interaction specific to the neural crest site and (5) the trigeminal ganglion was colonized not only by neural crest cells but also by cells from the ectodermal placode.
3417901	Using an antiserum against conjugated histamine we mapped the histaminergic somata and their fiber projection areas in carbodiimide-fixed guinea pig central nervous system. The neurons were large and they were found exclusively in the posterior hypothalamus, as in the rat, but in the guinea pig they were more numerous and distributed more widely in thin layer around the posterior mammillary nucleus, scattered between and within the medial mammillary nuclei, and in a dense cell cluster emerging from the caudal magnocellular nucleus and extending to the medial preoptic area. The density of histamine-immunopositive fibers was very high in the olfactory tubercle, diagonal band of Broca, nucleus accumbens, medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, periventricular and lateral basal hypothalamus, paraventricular thalamus, and in a region from the medial central gray to the locus coeruleus and the parabrachial nucleus. Dense fiber networks were found in the piriform and entorhinal cortex, septum, dentate gyrus, and subiculum, in most parts of amygdala, and in many areas of the hypothalamus, thalamus, substantia nigra, raphe nuclei, inferior olivary, solitary tract and medial vestibular nuclei, and neurohypophysis. Medium fiber density was observed in the internal layers of the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nuclei, neocortex, zone CA1 of hippocampus, and many midbrain and hindbrain regions. Low density was present in the outer layers of the olfactory bulb, other parts of hippocampus, the globus pallidus, most of the caudatus-putamen, the cerebellar cortex, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The retina and most of the myelinated white matter had single or no histaminergic fibers. It may be concluded from the results that most fibers seem to follow a ventromedial route to the forebrain, reaching the amygdala ventral to the medial forebrain bundle, the hippocampus via subiculum, and the hindbrain structures via the medial central gray. As compared to the rat, the fiber projections in the guinea pig brain were denser, particularly in the hippocampus, thalamus, pons-medulla, and neurohypophysis. The fiber densities in various regions of the guinea pig brain are compared to histamine receptor densities and the possible functions of histamine are discussed.
3418119	The present study considers patterns of brain morphology in 14 common species of mid-European Cyprinidae. Sixteen areas per brain were measured on serial cryostat sections by computer-aided planimetry. The volumes of these areas were expressed as % of the total brain volume. These brain centres (ranked according to falling values of the coefficient of variation VR, of the interspecific mean) are: Lobus facialis, L. vagus, central acustic area, Crista cerebellaris, Bulbus olfactorius, Eminentia granularis, Stratum opticum (of the optic tectum), Torus longitudinalis, Nucleus habenularis, Valvula cerebelli, Corpus cerebelli, Telencephalon, Tectum opticum, Diencephalon, Torus semicircularis, mesencephalic tegmentum. Seven primary sensory areas are leading in VR; highest in interspecific variability were the two special viscerosensory brainstem lobes for external (L. facialis) and internal (L. vagus) taste. Low in interspecific variability were integration centres (see above). By plotting the relative volumina of those brain centres which represent three major sensory modalities: brain stem chemosense, acoustico-lateralis and sense of vision, species are separated into three groups: 1) Most species scatter along an axis from moderately (Aspius aspius, Rutilus rutilus, Leuciscus cephalus, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Alburnus alburnus, Chondrostoma nasus) to highly developed chemo- and acustico-lateralis centres (Vimba vimba, Abramis brama, Abramis ballerus). Blicca bjoercna is situated in the middle of this axis. Within the latter group the optic centres are evenly well developed. 2) Carassius carassius, Gobio gobio and Tinca tinca are characterized by relatively small acoustico-lateralis and optic areas, but highly developed chemocentres. 3) Pelecus cultratus is monotypic among the species investigated by having large acoustico-lateralis and optic, but modestly developed chemocentres. The brain patterns relative to life style are discussed.
3418752	The cerebral cortices from 14-day gestation rat embryos were prelabeled with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutin (PHAL) and then homografted into freshly made implantation pockets in the host cerebral cortex. Animals were sacrificed at 30 and 60 days postimplantation (DPI). Paraffin sections were double labeled for the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific marker for astrocytes, and PHAL, utilized as a marker for transplant-derived cells. Transplant-derived astrocytes were found on the glia limitans along the entire circumference of the brain, in the hippocampal commissure, corpus callosum, internal capsule, entopeduncular nucleus, habenular commissure, brachium of the superior colliculus, optic tract, optic chiasm, and sensory root of the trigeminal nerve. Transplanted astrocytes entered the spaces of Virchow-Robin, and migrated along parenchymal blood vessels and between the ependymal and subependymal layers of the third and lateral ventricles. The presence of basal lamina or parallel nerve fiber bundles was a common factor for these migration routes.
3420164	Male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under controlled environmental conditions were used. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined in the cerebral cortex, bulbus olfactorius, midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata of control rats and rats treated with apomorphine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) after a single dose or after a second dose administered 24 h later at 10.00 or 22.00 h. Results of this experiment indicate that the repeated administration of apomorphine at 10.00 h was associated with rapid development of tolerance to the hypothermic action of this drug. A single injection of apomorphine resulted in significant (p less than 0.01) decrease of AChE and significant increase of ChAT activity (p less than 0.01) in the cortex, hypothalamus and pons. There were no significant differences between tolerant and control animals in the activities of AChE or ChAT in the bulbus olfactorius, cerebral cortex, midbrain, pons or medulla. On the other hand, repeated administration of apomorphine at 22.00 h was not associated with tolerance to the hypothermic action of this drug. A single injection of apomorphine at 22.00 h resulted in significant (p less than 0.01) increase in AChE activity of the midbrain, hippocampus, and the medulla oblongata with no significant changes in the cerebral cortex and bulbus olfactorius. There was a significant decline (p less than 0.01) of ChAT activity of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata (p less than 0.05). Meanwhile, there was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase of ChAT activity of the midbrain with no significant changes in the cerebellum, pons and the bulbus olfactorius.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3427431	Local cerebral glucose utilization was measured in 21 discrete regions of the rat CNS following unilateral kainic acid lesions of the caudate nucleus, and subsequent pharmacological challenge with GABAergic or dopaminergic agonists. The most pronounced increases in glucose use were observed in those ipsilateral areas of the brain to which the lesioned striatum normally projects (globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata), although several other brain regions with known anatomical connections to the striato-pallido-nigral system were also affected, most notably in the thalamus and epithalamus. These effects were similar to those reported previously from a different group of animals in which the injection protocol was slightly different. The consequences of striatal lesion, in terms of alterations in local rates of glucose use, were attenuated by i.v. administration of the putative GABA agonist, muscimol. In one area, the ventromedial thalamus, glucose use was more markedly affected by muscimol treatment bilaterally in lesioned animals than in intact animals. The consequences of striatal lesions upon the response to the putative dopaminergic agonist apomorphine, were both complex and profound. In some regions (e.g. globus pallidus), striatal lesion eliminated, or masked the normal response to apomorphine. Elsewhere, the apomorphine response, although in evidence, was significantly attenuated by striatal lesion (e.g. entopeduncular nucleus), but in only two brain areas, substantia nigra pars reticulata and ventrolateral thalamus, the apomorphine response was significantly potentiated by striatal lesion. These studies add further weight to the concept of disinhibition, mediated via striatal GABA fibres, as an organizing principle in striatonigral function and indicate a complex interaction of intrinsic GABAergic pathways with dopaminergic systems in the integrated response to stimulation of dopaminergic receptors in the extrapyramidal motor system.
3435829	The effect of immobilization stress (IM-stress) on the muscarinic cholinergic (m-Ch) receptor binding was determined in 8 brain regions using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). IM-stress produced an increase in specific QNB binding in the septum, striatum, hippocampus and pons + medulla oblongata. Scatchard analysis revealed that IM-stress produced an increase in the affinity of m-Ch receptors in the septum, hippocampus and pons + medulla oblongata, but did not alter the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax). In the striatum, an increase in specific QNB binding was due to both the increase in Bmax and reduction of the dissociation constant (Kd). The present study suggests that IM-stress induces supersensitivity of postsynaptic m-Ch receptors probably due to a decrease in presynaptic cholinergic activities in the septum, striatum, hippocampus and pons + medulla oblongata. As the m-Ch receptors in the striatum and pons + medulla oblongata are affected by IM-stress, further studies of the m-Ch neural system must be performed under stressful situations in these regions as well as in the septum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
3437978	The distribution of vasoactive intestinal peptide binding sites in the rat brain was examined by in vitro autoradiography on slide-mounted sections. A fully characterized monoiodinated form of vasoactive intestinal peptide (M-[125I]VIP) previously shown to maintain in the central nervous system the full biological activity of native vasoactive intestinal peptide was used for this study. In initial kinetic and pharmacological experiments the binding of M-[125I]vasoactive intestinal peptide to slide-mounted sections was shown to be time-dependent, saturable and reversible. Association of M-[125I]VIP specific binding was maximal within 90-120 minutes. Specific binding, corresponding to approximately 50% of total binding was saturable, of high affinity (Kd of 76.6 pM) and low capacity (fmol/mg prot range). Dissociation of M-[125I]VIP was maximal at 10 minutes. Unlabeled vasoactive intestinal peptide and the two structurally related peptides "peptide-histidine-isoleucine" (PHI) and secretin competed in a concentration-dependent manner for sites labeled by M-[125I]vasoactive intestinal peptide with the following rank order of potencies: vasoactive intestinal peptide greater than PHI greater than secretin. Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors, as revealed by quantitative autoradiography, are present at various levels of the neuraxis. High densities were observed in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex (highest in layers I, II, IV and VI), dentate gyrus, subiculum, various thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, superior colliculus, locus coeruleus, area postrema, subependymal layer and pineal gland. Intermediate densities were found in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, CA1 to CA4 fields of the hippocampus and central gray. No specific binding of M-[125I]vasoactive intestinal peptide was observed in white matter tracts such as corpus callosum, anterior commissure, medial forebrain bundle and fornix. The mapping of M-[125I]vasoactive intestinal peptide binding sites as revealed by autoradiography on slide-mounted sections indicates an association, although not exclusive, of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors with brain regions involved in the processing of specific sensory inputs.
3437996	Subcutaneous treatment of rats with low doses of lithium and pilocarpine or a high dose of pilocarpine results in a severe seizure--brain damage syndrome. Rats thus treated were studied with multiple-depth electrodes, quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, and light and electron microscopy. Rats receiving lithium-pilocarpine did not differ from high-dose pilocarpine rats in behavioral, electrographic, metabolic or histopathological findings, but lithium-pilocarpine reproduced the syndrome more reliably and with a lower acute mortality rate. Organized electrographic seizure activity developed just prior to the onset of behavioral forelimb clonus and appeared to originate from ventral forebrain in the vicinity of the ventral pallidum and/or nucleus accumbens. From these sites activity spread rapidly to involve other regions. Once initiated, electrographic seizures persisted for hours. Increased glucose utilization was found in most brain regions during the period of continuous seizure activity. The greatest increases were found in the ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, lateral septum, substantia nigra, ventrobasal and mediodorsal thalamus and frontal motor cortex. Animals sustaining seizures displayed a disseminated pattern of neural degeneration not involving globus pallidus or ventral pallidum but otherwise coinciding with the above pattern of enhanced glucose utilization. No consistent correlation was observed between the pattern of brain damage and known regions of high muscarinic cholinergic receptor density. Ultrastructurally, the cytopathological changes, like those associated with various other sustained seizure syndromes, resemble the excitotoxic type of damage glutamate is known to cause. This seizure-brain damage syndrome and that induced by systemic kainic acid appear to be similar in behavioral but not in electrophysiological or metabolic manifestations. During kainic acid seizures, electrographic changes are first recorded in the hippocampus while they are first detected in the ventral forebrain region in pilocarpine seizures. Pilocarpine also induced metabolic activation of ventral forebrain sites not activated by kainic acid. The cytopathology associated with the two syndromes is identical in type but not in pattern, the cholinergic model being characterized by much greater neocortical and slightly less hippocampal damage. Further study of these cholinergic models may provide new insights into the roles of the major excitatory neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic and glutamergic) in limbic epilepsy.
3438030	Prompted by recent findings suggesting that the basal ganglia and possibly the limbic midbrain area and brainstem reticular formation may be represented within the general learning system of the rat brain, the current study was undertaken to assess the learning ability of different groups of young rats prepared with bilateral lesions to either the caudatoputamen, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, ventromedial thalamus, habenula, subthalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area, anterior pretectal nucleus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, or red nucleus. The test battery included both appetitively (three distinct climbing detour problems) and aversively (visual discrimination, three cul maze, and an inclined plane discrimination) motivated learning tasks. Only those animals with lesions to the posterodorsal caudatoputamen, ventral tegmental area of Tsai, or superior colliculus were deficient in acquiring all six problems (suggestive of a generalized learning impairment) and therefore were viewed as being mentally retarded. The overall findings pertaining to the general learning system are interpreted within a conceptual framework based upon Spearman's two-factor theory of intelligence. The significance of these data for a brain-injured animal model of mental retardation is also discussed.
3440837	This distribution of choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) immunoreactivity (CHAT-I) in the rat lower brain stem was analyzed using a highly sensitive avidin-biotin immunocytochemical method and 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole visualization. A much wider and more abundant distribution of CHAT-I structures in the lower brain stem was demonstrated than in earlier studies. The following areas were newly identified as areas rich in CHAT-I fibers: the interpeduncular nucleus, medial geniculate body, central gray matter of pons, pontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, lateral trapezoid nucleus, inferior colliculus, dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, medial and lateral vestibular nuclei, reticular formation of medulla oblongata, and gelatinosa of caudal trigeminal spinal tract nucleus. In addition to the areas in which they have been known to exist, CHAT-I perikarya were found in the caudal portion of substantia nigra pars reticulata, the area between trigeminal motor nucleus and superior olivary nucleus, the medial and spinal vestibular nucleus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, raphe magnus and obscurus, ventromedial portion of solitary tract nucleus and its just ventral reticular formation, and caudal trigeminal spinal tract nucleus.
3480938	Sites of action of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors in the human brain were analyzed by studying the distribution of the respective MAO subtype, MAO-A or -B. Blood brain barrier (BBB), glial cells and neurons of several brain areas were examined with biochemical and immunocytochemical methods. Whereas MAO-A was localized in microvessels and neurons of locus ceruleus, MAO-B was present predominantly in neuronal cells of dorsal raphe nucleus. The neurons of substantia nigra revealed no immunohistochemically detectable MAO. Astrocytes expressed both subtypes and were observed in all cortical areas examined and all over the brain stem including medulla reticular formation, pontine reticular formation, reticular formation of mesencephalon, midbrain reticular formation, red nucleus, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and putamen (sections according to DeArmond et al., 1976). MAO activity in several brain areas seems mostly to be due to astrocytes rather than to neuronal cells. As MAO inhibitors have beneficial effects in the treatment of malfunctions of aminergic transmitter systems (Johnstone and Marsh, 1973; Robinson et al., 1973; Birkmayer et al., 1977; Knoll, 1981; Zarifian, 1984; Riederer and Youdim, 1986) and a large amount of MAO activity seems to be localized in brain astrocytes, the function of glial cells especially with regard to their neuromodulating capacity should be focused in more detailed research in future.
3484992	This paper and the following one describe the effects of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (after 3 intracisternal injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (DHT], fenfluramine (FF), p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) and drug combinations on (i) brain regional amine concentration (HPLC with LEC) and serotonin S-1 receptor binding; and (ii) 'serotonergic' behaviors in the same adult rats. Serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxins produced significantly different regional profiles of 5-HT depletion. Multiple DHT injections caused a 90-100% depletion of 5-HT concurrently in neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, septum/accumbens, pons, cerebellum, and cervical cord. Only PCA significantly depleted midbrain. Drug combinations with DHT resembled DHT alone rather than additive depletions, except for PCA + DHT, which produced a hybrid pattern of depletion. The S-1 binding assay, using cold 5-HT to displace [3H]5-HT, was performed with and without ascorbate, EDTA, CaCl2, and pargyline. Without ascorbate, binding was specific, saturable, region-dependent, and non-linear with high (Kd 1-3 nM) and low affinity (10-20 nM) components but no cooperativity (0.8 less than nH less than 1.0). Bmax and Kd did not differ significantly between vehicle- and drug-treated animals in neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla, cervical cord, cerebellum, or septum/accumbens two weeks after lesioning, while the assay did detect a 60% reduction in Bmax induced by ascorbic acid (1 mM). The effects of assay conditions exceeded the changes sometimes reported in S-1 receptor Bmax after 5-HT lesions.
3493449	The distribution of binding sites for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rat brain were studied using in vitro autoradiography. In a radioreceptor assay using [125I]human calcitonin gene-related peptide as the radioligand, with cerebellar cortical membranes, rat calcitonin gene-related peptide had a binding affinity constant of 1.16 +/- 0.23 X 10(10) M-1 and a site concentration of 43.4 +/- 3.4 fmol/mg protein. In this system, human calcitonin gene-related peptide had a binding affinity constant of 3.9 +/- 0.7 X 10(9) M-1 whereas salmon calcitonin was very weak with a binding affinity constant of only 6.8 +/- 4.0 X 10(5) M-1. CGRP binding localized by in vitro autoradiography, using [125I]rat calcitonin gene-related peptide, had a characteristic distinct distribution in the rat brain. There were high concentrations of binding found over the accumbens nucleus, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, ventral caudate putamen, median eminence, the arcuate nucleus, lateral amygdaloid nucleus and lateral mammillary nucleus, the superior and inferior colliculi, pontine nuclei, molecular and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellar cortex, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the inferior olivary nuclei, hypoglossal complex and the vestibular and cochlear nuclei. The distribution of these binding sites suggests multiple roles for CGRP in the central nervous system including auditory, visual, gustatory and somatosensory processing, and in neuroendocrine control.
3496365	The hypothalamus is closely involved in a wide variety of behavioral, autonomic, visceral, and endocrine functions. To find out which descending pathways are involved in these functions, we investigated them by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and autoradiographic tracing techniques. HRP injections at various levels of the spinal cord resulted in a nearly uniform distribution of HRP-labeled neurons in most areas of the hypothalamus except for the anterior part. After HRP injections in the raphe magnus (NRM) and adjoining tegmentum the distribution of labeled neurons was again uniform, but many were found in the anterior hypothalamus as well. Injections of 3H-leucine in the hypothalamus demonstrated that: The anterior hypothalamic area sent many fibers through the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to terminate in the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VTA), the rostral raphe nuclei, the nucleus Edinger-Westphal, the dorsal part of the substantia nigra, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the interpeduncular nuclei. Further caudally a lateral fiber stream (mainly derived from the lateral parts of the anterior hypothalamic area) distributed fibers to the parabrachial nuclei, nucleus subcoeruleus, locus coeruleus, the micturition-coordinating region, the caudal brainstem lateral tegmentum, and the solitary and dorsal vagal nucleus. Furthermore, a medial fiber stream (mainly derived from the medial parts of the anterior hypothalamic area) distributed fibers to the superior central and dorsal raphe nucleus and to the NRM, nucleus raphe pallidus (NRP), and adjoining tegmentum. The medial and posterior hypothalamic area including the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) sent fibers to approximately the same mesencephalic structures as the anterior hypothalamic area. Further caudally two different fiber bundles were observed. A medial stream distributed labeled fibers to the NRM, rostral NRP, the upper thoracic intermediolateral cell group, and spinal lamina X. A second and well-defined fiber stream, probably derived from the PVN, distributed many fibers to specific parts of the lateral tegmental field, to the solitary and dorsal vagal nuclei, and, in the spinal cord, to lamina I and X, to the thoracolumbar and sacral intermediolateral cell column, and to the nucleus of Onuf. The lateral hypothalamic area sent many labeled fibers to the lateral part of the brainstem and many terminated in the caudal brainstem lateral tegmentum, including the parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, and the solitary and dorsal vagal nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3497182	A cobalt-glucose-oxidase diaminobenzidine (Co-GOD) method, employing a specific antiserum against rat corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), was applied to determine immunohistochemically a widespread and detailed localization of corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity (CRFI) in the rat brain. Besides the CRFI cells in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus that project to the median eminence, CRFI cells were demonstrated in many brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, septal nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamic nuclei, medial hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, perifornical area, central gray, cuneiform nucleus, inferior colliculus, raphe nuclei, mesencephalic reticular formation, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nuclei, mesencephalic tract of the trigeminal nerve, pontine reticular formation, lateral superior olive, vestibular nuclei, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, lateral reticular nucleus, nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, external cuneate nucleus, inferior olive, and medullary reticular formation. CRFI-reacting neural processes were also detected in these same areas. In particular, the median eminence, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, mesencephalic reticular formation, parabrachial nuclei, and nucleus of the solitary tract contained large numbers of CRFI fibres. The widespread localization of CRFI demonstrated in the present study strongly suggests that CRF, like many other neurohormones and peptides, may act as a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in numerous extrahypothalamic circuits, as well as participate in neuroendocrine regulation.
3512625	The subcortical nuclear groups projecting to the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) were studied in pigmented rats with the aid of the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. Small iontophoretic injections of HRP were placed in the medial regions of the NRTP, an area that has been shown in several species to be involved in eye movements. Other large injections in the NRTP or small injections placed just outside the nucleus were used to clarify the projections to the NRTP. Results indicate that the NRTP receives afferents from visual relay nuclei, including the nucleus of optic tract, the superior colliculus, and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus; oculomotor-associated structures including the zona incerta, the H1 and H2 fields of Forel, the nucleus subparafasciculus, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the visual tegmental relay zone of the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, the mesencephalic, pontine, and medullary reticular formations, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, and a portion of the periaqueductal gray termed the supra-oculomotor periaqueductal gray; cerebellar and pontomedullary nuclei, including the superior, lateral, and medial vestibular nuclei, the deep cerebellar nuclei, and NRTP interneurons, and nuclei related to limbic functions including the lateral habenula, the mammillary nuclei, the hypothalamic nuclei, the preoptic nuclei, and the nucleus of diagonal band of Broca. A surprisingly large number of afferents to the medial regions of the NRTP arise from visual- or eye-movement-related nuclei. The projection from the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) confirms previous anatomical and physiological studies on the pathways involved in horizontal optokinetic nystagmus, but the number of NOT afferents is small in relation to other areas potentially related to visuomotor pathways such as the zona incerta, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, fields of Forel, perirubral area, and subparafasciculus. The NRTP may also relay information related to vertical visuomotor reflexes (e.g., vertical optokinetic nystagmus) given the strong projections from the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system, visual tegmental relay zone, supra-oculomotor periaqueductal gray, interstitial n. of Cajal, and midbrain reticular formation. The presence of significant NRTP projections from the superior colliculus and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formations suggests that these nuclei may provide the pathways for the noted saccade-related activity of NRTP neurons. In addition, projections from the vestibular nuclei were found that provide the anatomical basis for head velocity signals recorded in NRTP neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3540035	The distribution of dopamine (DA) immunoreactivity in the forebrain and the midbrain of the lizard Gekko gecko was studied by using recently developed antibodies against DA. Dopamine-containing cells were found around the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb, in several parts of the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, in the periventricular organ, the ependymal wall of the infundibular recess, the lateral hypothalamic area and the pretectal posterodorsal nucleus of the diencephalon, and in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, and the presumed reptilian equivalent of the mammalian A8 cell group of the mesencephalon. Dopaminergic fibers and terminals were observed throughout the whole brain, but particularly in the diencephalon and the telencephalon. The nucleus accumbens appears to have the most dense innervation, but also the striatum, amygdaloid complex, olfactory tubercle, septum, and dorsal ventricular ridge (especially its superficial zone) show numerous DA-containing fibers and terminals. Except for the lateral cortex, cortical areas are not densely innervated by DA fibers. In several respects DA distribution in the gekkonid brain differs from that in other reptiles studied. For instance, in the Gekko the dorsal ventricular ridge is densely innervated by DA fibers, whereas in turtles and crocodiles the same structure shows only weak catecholaminergic histofluorescence. When compared to the distribution of DA immunoreactivity in mammals, it appears that the DA system in the gekkonid telencephalon resembles the distribution of DA in the limbic forebrain and striatum of mammals. Whether these similarities in distribution of DA also imply similarities in function will be discussed.
3546594	Incubation period and survival time were determined in C57BL mice which had been injected stereotaxically with either the 139A, ME7 or 22L strain of scrapie in one of five different brain regions (cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra, cerebellum). The injection of 139A in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra or cerebellum resulted in significantly shorter incubation periods than following cerebral cortex injection. For ME7, mice injected in the thalamus and cerebellum had incubation periods approximately 2 weeks shorter than the cerebral cortex group. For 22L, the incubation periods after substantia nigra or cerebellum injection were significantly shorter than after cortex injection. The cerebellum injection group had a significantly shorter incubation period than the substantia nigra injection group. The survival times for mice injected with a particular scrapie strain were directly related to the incubation periods. The groups with the shortest incubation also had the shortest survival time (e.g. 22L in the cerebellum). On histological examination, 139A and ME7 produced brain lesions in all brain areas regardless of injection site. For the 22L strain, after cerebellum injection vacuolation was limited to the cerebellum, while injection into the cerebral cortex and other forebrain regions resulted in vacuolation in all brain regions examined. Despite the difference in the distribution of vacuolation seen in cerebellum- compared to cortex-injected (22L) mice, infectivity titres were similar in the cortex, cerebellum, cerebellar cortex and medulla plus pons.
3549796	The origin and termination of fibers to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, especially those to the medial, magnocellular part of the nucleus (MDm), have been studied using anterograde and retrograde axonal tracing methods, as well as electrophysiological recording. The results indicate that in addition to its well-known connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, MDm receives fibers from many parts of the basal forebrain, including the ventral pallidum and other parts of the substantia innominata, the amygdaloid complex, the primary olfactory cortex, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and the cortex at the pole of the temporal lobe. Lighter projections arise in the subiculum, the ventral insula, and the superior and inferior temporal gyri. The cells that project to MDm tend to be large, polymorphic neurons. Throughout most of the basal forebrain they are diffusely distributed through several nuclei or cortical layers, without obvious relation to nuclear or laminar boundaries. The major exception to this is in the ventral pallidum, where there is a dense concentration of cells that project to MDm. The lateral part of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDl) receives few if any fibers from the basal forebrain and temporal lobe, but is innervated by several brainstem structures, especially the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra, the medial vestibular nucleus, and the midbrain tegmental fields. In MDm, the fibers are distributed in irregular patches. Three-dimensional analysis indicates that these patches are often clustered into separate bands or columns at different anteroposterior levels. In addition, the strongest projections from the three major regions that innervate MDm are organized in a complex three-dimensional pattern. First, the fibers from the amygdaloid nuclei terminate most heavily (but not exclusively) in the rostral third of MDm. The parvicellular accessory basal amygdaloid nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area project principally to the dorsal part of the nucleus. The parvicellular basal nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex project to the ventromedial quadrant of MDm; and the magnocellular basal nucleus, the magnocellular accessory basal nucleus, and the lateral nucleus all project to the ventrolateral quadrant. Second, the substantia innominata projects preferentially to the caudal part of MDm. The medial part of the substantia innominata, especially the ventral pallidum, innervates the dorsomedial quadrant, while more caudal and lateral areas of this region project ventrolaterally. Third, the projections arising from the entorhinal and other temporal cortical areas terminate primarily in the mid-rostrocaudal level of MDm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3552118	In rhesus monkeys, autoradiographic tracing methods, complemented by immunocytochemical and histochemical techniques, were used to delineate pathways by which cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (ndbB) project to forebrain targets. Following injections of [3H]amino acids into these nuclei, 5 major fiber pathways were identified: axons of the nbM and ndbB project medially, principally within the cingulum bundle, to dorsomedial portions of the hemispheres; nbM and ndbB fibers exit laterally beneath the pallidum and striatum, enter the external and extreme capsules, and pass within the corona radiata to terminate in lateral and caudal regions of neocortex; axons coursing ventrally from the nbM project to portions of the temporal lobe, including the amygdala; some fibers pass through the fibrae pass orbitofrontales to the orbitofrontal cortex; and, finally axons of the nbM/ndbB project via the fimbria/rornix and a ventral pathway to the hippocampus. The presence of these 5 radiolabeled pathways arising from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons was confirmed by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry.
3556470	In an attempt to identify cholinergic neurons of the brain stem which project to the forebrain, retrograde labeling of neurons in the brain stem was examined by autoradiography following injections of 20 microCi [3H]choline into the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain and frontal cortex. After injections into the thalamus, retrogradely labeled neurons were evident within the lateral caudal mesencephalic and dorsolateral oral pontine tegmentum (particularly in the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei) and in smaller number within the latero-medial caudal pontine (Reticularis pontis caudalis, Rpc) and medullary (Reticularis gigantocellularis, Rgc) reticular formation. Following [3H]choline injections into the lateral hypothalamus and into the basal forebrain, retrogradely labeled neurons were localized in the dorsolateral caudal midbrain and oral pontine tegmentum and in smaller number in the medial medullary reticular formation (Rgc), as well as in the midbrain, pontine and medullary raphe nuclei. After injections into the anterior medial frontal cortex, a small number of retrogradely labeled cells were found in the brain stem within the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus. In a parallel immunohistochemical study, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons were found to be located in most of the regions of the reticular formation where cells were retrogradely labeled from the forebrain following [3H]choline injections. These results suggest that multiple cholinergic neurons within the lateral caudal midbrain and dorsolateral oral pontine tegmentum and a few within the caudal pontine and medullary reticular formation project to the thalamus, hypothalamus and basal forebrain and that a limited number of pontine cholinergic neurons project to the frontal cortex.
3562316	The distribution of neuropeptide K (NPK), a 36-residue amidated peptide originally isolated from porcine brain, is described in the rat CNS by immunohistochemical methods. Antibodies were generated in rabbits to N-terminus and C-terminus regions of the peptide and the distribution of immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers was mapped in colchicine-treated and normal rat brains. Major areas of cell body staining included the medial habenular nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the interpeduncular nucleus, the lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus, the nucleus raphe pallidus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Some of the areas of dense NPK-fiber immunoreactivity included the ventral pallidum, the caudate-putamen, certain areas of the hypothalamus, the central and medial amygdaloid nuclei, the entopeduncular nucleus, the habenular nuclei, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the caudal part of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A striking similarity exists between this pattern of immunoreactive staining and that described for substance P, suggesting that the tachykinin systems do not exist independently in the brain. The possible roles for multiple tachykinins in the brain are discussed.
3584538	To determine the localization in rat brain and spinal cord of individual neurons that contain the messenger RNA coding for the opioid peptide precursor preproenkephalin, we performed in situ hybridization with a tritiated cDNA probe complementary to a protion of preproenkephalin mRNA. We observed autoradiographic signal over the cytoplasm of neurons of many regions of the central nervous system. Several types of controls indicated specificity of the labeling. Neurons containing preproenkephalin mRNA were found in the piriform cortex, ventral tenia tecta, several regions of the neocortex, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, caudate-putamen, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, diagonal band of Broca, preoptic area, amygdala (especially central nucleus, with fewer labeled neurons in all other nuclei), hippocampal formation, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, perifornical region, lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, arcuate nucleus, dorsal and ventral premamillary nuclei, medial mamillary nucleus, lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta, periaqueductal gray, midbrain reticular formation, ventral tegmental area of Tsai, inferior colliculus, dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of Gudden, dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei, pontine and medullary reticular formation, several portions of the raphe nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract (especially substantia gelatinosa), ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei, medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, cuneate and external cuneate nuclei, gracile nucleus, superior olive, nucleus of the trapezoid body, some deep cerebellar nuclei, Golgi neurons in the cerebellum, and most laminae of the spinal cord. In most of these brain regions, the present results indicate that many more neurons contain preproenkephalin mRNA than have been appreciated previously on the basis of immunocytochemistry.
3584548	Lying just ventral to the medial geniculate nucleus and dorsal to the cerebral peduncle, the peripeduncular area (PPA) seems to be implicated in the expression of several sexual reflexes in rodents. The aim of the present investigation was to establish the organization of the afferent and efferent projections of the rat's PPA in an attempt to provide a neural substrate corresponding to the behavioral observations. Based on both retrograde and anterograde transport methods, our results suggest that the PPA: receives its main afferent projections from the insulotemporal cortex, basal ganglia, ventromedial and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, zona incerta, inferior colliculus, intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus, central gray, cuneiform nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and, projects essentially to the basal ganglia, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, central gray, cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei, deep layers of the superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, and dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. These findings, indicating that the PPA is connected with the auditory, motor, and limbic systems and with nonspecific diencephalic and mesencephalic centers, are in agreement with the notion that in rodents this area might play a role in the female sexual receptivity (as expressed by lordosis display or ultrasound production) or male mounting behavior.
3585331	The turnover rates and steady-state levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been determined in 15 brain areas of three sublines of inbred mice differing in their susceptibility to audiogenic seizures: Rb3, which is seizure resistant; Rb2, which develops clonic seizures; and Rb1, which develops tonic-clonic seizures. In the Rb1 subline, GABA steady-state levels are lower than in the Rb3 subline in three of the 15 areas examined (cerebellum, anterior colliculus, and amygdala), whereas in the Rb2 subline, steady-state levels are either higher (posterior colliculus and hippocampus) or lower (amygdala) than in the Rb3 subline. GABA turnover rates differ in three brain areas in Rb1 (amygdala, raphe, and hypothalamus) and in a single area (amygdala) in Rb2 when compared with Rb3. Only one area has similar variations of GABA turnover rate and steady-state levels in the two susceptible sublines: the amygdala. After 2 weeks of repeated auditory stimulations (two times a day, 8,000 Hz, 100 dB), additional alterations in GABA metabolism are observed: mainly large increases in GABA turnover rates (from 40% to three- to fourfold). The Rb2 subline displays a greater number of alterations (increases of turnover rates in pons, cerebellum, anterior and posterior colliculus, amygdala, olfactory bulbs and tubercles, striatum, and frontal cortex) than the Rb1 subline (increases of turnover rates in cerebellum, posterior colliculus, olfactory tubercles, raphe, and frontal cortex and a decrease in hypothalamus). In the Rb3 subline, increases of the turnover rate in amygdala and olfactory tubercles and decreases in olfactory bulbs and hippocampus are observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3599564	The pharmacokinetic profiles of clomipramine (CMP) and the serial changes of its concentration in specific brain regions were investigated in rats after an acute treatment with intravenous CMP (10 mg/kg). The CMP concentrations in plasma declined triexponentially and fitted a three-compartment open model. The brain to plasma concentration ratio showed a constant value, 22.2 +/- 4.9, 30 minutes after the injection. Regional brain differences in the CMP distribution and accumulation were also found. Four hours after the injections, the hippocampus was found to have the highest drug concentration, and the concentrations in this region were in the following order; thalamus, striatum, amygdala, cortex greater than pons + medulla oblongata greater than hypothalamus, bulbus olfactorius + septum, mesencephalon greater than cerebellum. Particularly, unique kinetics were observed in the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus.
3620947	The localization of the Purkinje cells in the uvula and nodulus projecting to the vestibular nuclei and the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus (PH) was studied by means of retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase in cats. Findings indicate a zonal organization in the uvula and nodulus projecting to the vestibular nuclei as follows; the Purkinje cells located in the medial half of the uvula except for the area along the posterolateral fissure project to the middle part of the inferior vestibular nucleus (IV) (middle IV zone); those in the lateral half of the uvula other than the laterocaudal part project to the caudal part of the IV (caudal IV zone); those in the mediorostral part of the nodulus and the middle part of the nodulus project to the middle part of the medial vestibular nucleus (MV) (middle MV zone); those in the lateral part of the nodulus project to the caudal part of the MV (caudal MV zone); those in the medial part of the uvula and nodulus along the posterolateral fissure project to the dorsal peripheral part of the superior vestibular nucleus (SV) (SV zone). There is no specific projection zone in the uvula and nodulus projecting to the lateral vestibular nucleus, the ventral peripheral and the central part of the SV, the rostral part of the MV, the rostral part and the caudal pole of the IV, the caudal one-third of the group f, the group x and the PH.
3621295	The origin of skeletal muscle cells in avian iris muscle was investigated by quantitative analysis of heterochromatin profiles at the electron-microscopic level in irides of six types of quail-duck chimeras. Each of the following tissues was transplanted into the head region from quail to duck between stages 9 and 10: cranial neural crest; trunk neural crest; midbrain and adjacent mesoderm; forebrain; forebrain without neural crest; and forebrain without neural crest and mesoderm. The average ratio of heterochromatin profile to nucleus profile in iris skeletal muscle cells was high (quail type) in the dorsal iris, but low (duck type) in the ventral iris of the chimeras resulting from isotopic transplantation of cranial neural crest. Heterotopic transplantation of trunk neural crest to cranial position resulted in failure of development of skeletal muscle cells in the dorsal iris, but not in the appearance of skeletal muscle cells in the ventral iris. The average ratio of heterochromatin profile to nucleus profile in iris skeletal muscle cells was high in the chimeras resulting from transplantation of midbrain region and the chimeras resulting from transplantation of forebrain region, intermediate in the chimeras resulting from transplantation of forebrain region without neural crest, and low in the chimeras resulting from transplantation of forebrain region without neural crest and mesoderm. These results indicate that the skeletal muscle cells in the dorsal iris are of cranial neural crest origin while those in the ventral iris are not, and could possibly arise from cranial mesoderm.
3624555	Cortical projections to subdivisions of the cingulate cortex in the rhesus monkey were analyzed with horseradish peroxidase and tritiated amino acid tracers. These projections were evaluated in terms of an expanded cytoarchitectural scheme in which areas 24 and 23 were divided into three ventrodorsal parts, i.e., areas 24a-c and 23a-c. Most cortical input to area 25 originated in the frontal lobe in lateral areas 46 and 9 and orbitofrontal areas 11 and 14. Area 25 also received afferents from cingulate areas 24b, 24c, and 23b, from rostral auditory association areas TS2 and TS3, from the subiculum and CA1 sector of the hippocampus, and from the lateral and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala (LB and AB, respectively). Areas 24a and 24b received afferents from areas 25 and 23b of cingulate cortex, but most were from frontal and temporal cortices. These included the following areas: frontal areas 9, 11, 12, 13, and 46; temporal polar area TG as well as LB and AB; superior temporal sulcus area TPO; agranular insular cortex; posterior parahippocampal cortex including areas TF, TL, and TH and the subiculum. Autoradiographic cases indicated that area 24c received input from the insula, parietal areas PG and PGm, area TG of the temporal pole, and frontal areas 12 and 46. Additionally, caudal area 24 was the recipient of area PG input but not amygdalar afferents. It was also the primary site of areas TF, TL, and TH projections. The following projections were observed both to and within posterior cingulate cortex. Area 29a-c received inputs from area 46 of the frontal lobe and the subiculum and in turn it projected to area 30. Area 30 had afferents from the posterior parietal cortex (area Opt) and temporal area TF. Areas 23a and 23b received inputs mainly from frontal areas 46, 9, 11, and 14, parietal areas Opt and PGm, area TPO of superior temporal cortex, and areas TH, TL, and TF. Anterior cingulate areas 24a and 24b and posterior areas 29d and 30 projected to area 23. Finally, a rostromedial part of visual association area 19 also projected to area 23. The origin and termination of these connections were expressed in a number of different laminar patterns. Most corticocortical connections arose in layer III and to a lesser extent layer V, while others, e.g., those from the cortex of the superior temporal sulcus, had an equal density of cells in both layers III and V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3627444	Transganglionic transport of horseradish peroxidase or lectin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase from an application site in the cervical trunk of the glossopharyngeal (IXth cranial) nerve of the rat produced extraperikaryal reaction product characteristic of axon terminal processes in three regions of the brain stem: (1) the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, from approximately 2.5 mm rostral to the obex to approximately 3 mm caudal to the obex; (2) the spinal trigeminal nucleus at the level of obex; (3) the cuneate fasciculus, approximately 3 mm caudal to the obex. In contrast, labelling of the carotid sinus nerve, a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve which conveys chemoreceptor and baroreceptor afferent fibers from the carotid bifurcation, revealed a restricted central projection to within 1 mm of the obex and corresponding to the intermediate region of the glossopharyngeal nerve projection to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Two distinct aggregations of label were observed: (1) rostral to the obex, within the lateral and dorsomedial subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius; (2) caudal to the obex, within the commissural and ventrolateral subnuclei of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Between these two sites the density of labelling was reduced. Retrogradely labelled neurons were demonstrated in the inferior salivatory nucleus and in the nucleus ambiguus after application of lectin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase to the glossopharyngeal nerve. Of the labelled neurons in the nucleus ambiguus (approximately 100), 25% contributed fibers to the carotid sinus nerve. The concentration of extraperikaryal reaction product located rostral to the obex after labelling of the carotid sinus nerve closely matches descriptions of the region of afferent terminations from carotid and aortic baroreceptors in the cat. The concentration of label caudal to the obex may therefore correspond to the region of afferent terminations from carotid chemoreceptors. This study may therefore provide some basis for a separation of the central synapses of primary afferent fibers from the carotid baroreceptors and chemoreceptors in the rat. The labelled neurons of the nucleus ambiguus provide the anatomical substrate for centrifugal control of carotid chemoreceptor activity.
3658109	This paper presents the first detailed localization of luteinizing hormone (LH)-containing cells and fibers in the rat central nervous system. These immunoreactive elements were identified by four LH antisera, two directed against the intact LH molecule and two against LHb. Cell bodies, immunoreactive for LH were found throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the hypothalamic arcuate and ventromedial nuclei, the periarcuate area ventral to the ventromedial nucleus, and the retrochiasmatic area. Immunopositive fibers were traced to numerous structures within the brain including discrete regions of the hypothalamus, septal area, nucleus of the diagonal band, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, amygdala, thalamus, periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei, brainstem reticular nuclei, locus ceruleus, parabrachial nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract, with a few fibers extending into spinal cord central gray. This pattern of fiber distribution corresponds closely with those described for fibers containing several other anterior pituitary hormones. The extensive projection for LH may provide neuroanatomical substrate mediating reproductive events as it does in the pituitary, or it may serve some modulatory function in brain which is independent of its role in reproduction.
3667984	Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a putative peptide neurotransmitter present in high concentration in the cerebral cortex. By using techniques of in vitro receptor autoradiography, CCK binding sites in primate cortex were labeled with 125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled CCK-33 (the 33-amino-acid C-terminal peptide) and 3H-CCK-8 (the C-terminal octapeptide). Biochemical studies performed on homogenized and slide-mounted tissue sections showed that the two ligands labeled a high-affinity, apparently single, saturable site. Autoradiography revealed that binding sites labeled by both ligands were anatomically indistinguishable and were distributed in two basic patterns. A faint and diffuse label characterized portions of medial prefrontal cortex, premotor and motor cortices, the superior parietal lobule, and the temporal pole. In other cortical areas the pattern of binding was layer-specific; i.e., binding sites were concentrated within particular cortical layers and were superimposed upon the background of diffuse label. Layer-specific label was found in the prefrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal lobule, retrosplenial cortex, insula, temporal lobe cortices, and in the primary visual and adjacent visual association cortices. The areal and laminar localization of layer-specific CCK binding sites consistently coincided with the cortical projections of thalamic nuclei. In prefrontal cortex, CCK binding sites were present in layers III and IV, precisely paralleling the terminal fields of thalamocortical projections from the mediodorsal and medial pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. In somatosensory cortex, the pattern of CCK binding in layer IV coincided with thalamic inputs arising from the ventrobasal complex, while in the posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, layer IV and lower III binding mirrored the laminar distribution of cortical afferents of the medial pulvinar. CCK binding in layers IVa, IVc alpha, IVc beta, and VI of primary visual cortex corresponded to the terminal field disposition of lateral geniculate neurons, whereas in adjacent visual association cortex, binding in layers III, IV, and VI faithfully followed the cortical distribution of projections from the inferior and lateral divisions of the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. We interpret the diffusely labeled binding sites in primate cortex as being associated with the intrinsic system of CCK-containing interneurons that are distributed throughout all layers and areas of the cortex. The stratified binding sites, however, appear to be associated with specific extrinsic peptidergic projections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3683860	Specific high-affinity neurotensin binding sites were labeled in sections of the rat caudal brainstem using a monoiodinated ligand, and their distribution was examined by light microscopic radioautography after fixation with glutaraldehyde. In the medulla, labeled binding sites were mainly concentrated within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the external cuneate nucleus, the lateral reticular nucleus, the medial vestibular nucleus, the retrofacial nucleus, the linearis nucleus, the paragigantocellular nucleus and the nucleus raphe pallidus. Within the pons, neurotensin binding sites were detected in the reticulotegmental nucleus, the pontine nuclei, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei and the nuclei raphe dorsalis and medianus. Most nuclei found here to contain high densities of neurotensin binding sites have been shown to stain intensely for acetylcholinesterase, suggesting a possible association between this enzyme and neurotensin receptors.
3710560	Angiotensinogen (renin substrate) and its messenger RNA are known to accumulate in the rat brain. We have cloned rat preangiotensinogen cDNAs and used them as probes to measure the accumulation of preangiotensinogen messenger RNA sequences in eight regions of rat brain, as well as in liver and kidney. The brain regions examined were the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, diencephalon (including basal forebrain structures), midbrain, brainstem, and pituitary. On a tissue weight basis, the accumulation of preangiotensinogen RNA sequences was greatest in the liver, midbrain, and brainstem. The relative concentrations of messenger RNA were ranked as follows: liver, brainstem, midbrain greater than cerebellum, diencephalon greater than hippocampus greater than cortex, striatum, kidney greater than pituitary. Relative RNA concentrations from liver to kidney varied over a 16-fold range. Liver and brain preangiotensinogen RNA sequences were indistinguishable in size as measured by gel electrophoresis; however, the kidney sequences appeared some 100 nucleotides larger. Our data agree with previous measurements of angiotensinogen in the rat brain as assayed by renin-catalyzed angiotensin I release.
3719340	The motoneurons innervating the orbicularis oculi muscle from a subgroup within the facial nucleus, called the intermediate facial subnucleus. This makes it possible to study afferents to these motoneurons by means of autoradiographical tracing techniques. Many different injections were made in the brainstem and diencephalon and the afferent projections to the intermediate facial subnucleus were studied. The results indicated that these afferents were derived from the following brainstem areas: the dorsal red nucleus and the mesencephalic tegmentum dorsal to it; the olivary pretectal nucleus and/or the nucleus of the optic tract; the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum (parabrachial nuclei and nucleus of Kölliker-Fuse) and principal trigeminal nucleus; the ventrolateral pontine tegmentum at the level of the motor trigeminal nucleus; the caudal medullary medial tegmentum; the lateral tegmentum at the level of the rostral pole of the hypoglossal nucleus and the ventral part of the trigeminal nucleus and the nucleus raphe pallidus and caudal raphe magnus including the adjoining medullary tegmentum. These latter projections probably belong to a general motoneuronal control system. The mesencephalic projections are mainly contralateral, the caudal pontine and upper medullary lateral tegmental projections are mainly ipsilateral and the caudal medullary projections are bilateral. It is suggested that the different afferent pathways subserve different functions of the orbicularis oculi motoneurons. Interneurons in the dorsolateral pontine and lateral medullary tegmentum may serve as relay for cortical and limbic influences on the orbicularis oculi musculature, while interneurons in the ventrolateral pontine and caudal medullary tegmentum may take part in the neuronal organization of the blink reflex.
3722460	The cortical connections of electrophysiologically identified locations in the body representations in somatosensory cortex of macaque monkeys were investigated after injections of horseradish peroxidase, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, tritiated WGA, or tritiated proline. After extensive microelectrode mapping of portions of the body representations in areas 3b, 1, 2, and 5 and careful determinations of electrophysiological borders between areas, restricted injections of tracers were placed, usually into the representation of the hand in area 2. Other injections were placed in the foot representation in area 2 or in area 1, in the wrist representation in area 1, and in the forearm and wrist representation in area 5. Connection patterns were related to the physiological mapping results and to cortical cytoarchitecture. Injections confined to a lateral portion of area 2 representing the glabrous digits of the hand revealed reciprocal connections with the digit representations in areas 1 and 3b. Projections to area 2 were largely from layer III neurons in both of these fields, and return projections terminated largely in supragranular layers. Other inputs were from layer III cells in one or more separate locations in area 5 and in one or more closely spaced foci in the expected location of S-II in the lateral sulcus. These connections were also reciprocal with terminations apparent in layers IV and III. A few neurons in area 4 were labeled in some of these cases. Results were similar after an injection in the foot representation in area 2 with the differences that infragranular neurons, in addition to supragranular neurons, formed a substantial part of the projection to area 2, terminations as well as projections were noted from area 4, interconnections were found more rostrally in area 6, and a dense focus of label was apparent in the dorsal bank of cingulate sulcus in the apparent location of the supplementary motor area. Injections in the foot representation in area 1 revealed dense layer IV terminations in the foot representation in area 2, as well as connections with area 3b, the S-II region, and areas 5 and 7. The injection in the wrist representation in area 1 resulted in dense terminations in the portion of area 5 responsive to the distal forearm and hand, sparser connections with a lateral location in part of area 2 related to the hand, and interconnections with 3b and S-II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3732437	Unilateral injection of Fast Blue retrograde fluorescent neuron tracer into the parolfactory lobe (POL) in the quail showed multiple innervation of this structure. Neurons projecting into the POL were located in three areas: the telencephalon, where they were scattered in the paleostriatum, the archistriatum and ventral hyperstriatum, and among the fibers of different tracts including the anterior commissure, the occipito-mesencephalic tract and the fasciculus prosencephali lateralis; the diencephalon, where fluorescent neurons with large multipolar perikarya were found in the dorsal thalamic wall; the midbrain, where large perikarya were located in the ventralis area of Tsai, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus subcoeruleus, around the medial longitudinal fasciculus, in the substantia grisea centralis, the formatio reticularis mesencephali and among the fibers of the brachium conjunctivum. In most cases, axons innervating the POL ran parallel to the fibers of the medial forebrain bundle and contralateral to the perikarya from which they originated. This study also showed that the anterior and posterior parts of the POL received fibres from different sources.
3748377	The regional distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptors in the primate brain was studied by semi-quantitative autoradiographic analysis of tritiated ligand binding. Areas showing the highest density of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptors (greater than 200 fmol [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine bound per mg tissue), included the cerebral cortex (laminae I-II), claustrum, posterior cell group of the basal nucleus of Meynert, the infracommissural part of the globus pallidus, cortical amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampal formation (CA1-subiculum region, the anterior CA2, CA3 and CA4 regions and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus), thalamic nuclei (parafascicular, parataenial, paraventricular and superior central lateral nuclei), substantia nigra pars reticulata, dorsal raphe nucleus and choroid plexus. The distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptors is compared to the distribution of both 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors and terminal fields of serotonergic projections as previously described in subprimates.
3755809	The distribution of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain and spinal cord was investigated by means of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase procedure of Sternberger using a rabbit anti-neuropeptide Y serum. A widespread distribution of immunostained cells and fibres was detected with moderate to large numbers of cells in the following regions: olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, striatum, nucleus accumbens, all parts of the neocortex and the corpus callosum, septum including the anterior hippocampal rudiment, ventral pallidum, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, amygdaloid complex. Ammon's horn, dentate gyrus, subiculum, pre- and parasubiculum, lateral thalamic nucleus (intergeniculate leaflet), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, mediobasal hypothalamus, supramammillary nucleus, pericentral and external nuclei of the inferior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal central gray, locus coeruleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, lateral superior olive, lateral reticular nucleus, medial longitudinal fasciculus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. In the spinal cord cells were found in the substantia gelatinosa at all levels, the dorsolateral funiculus and dorsal gray commissure in lumbosacral cord. The pattern of staining was found to be similar to that observed with antisera to avian and bovine pancreatic polypeptide, but to differ in some respects from that observed with antisera to molluscan cardioexcitatory peptide. The presence of neuropeptide Y immunoreactive fibres in tracts such as the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, lateral olfactory tract, fimbria, medial corticohypothalamic tract, medial forebrain bundle, stria terminalis, dorsal periventricular bundle and other periventricular areas, indicated that in addition to the localisation of neuropeptide Y-like peptide(s) in interneurons in the forebrain, neuropeptide Y may be found in long neuronal pathways throughout the brain.
3760866	The substrate and cofactor requirements and some kinetic properties of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC; EC 1.2.4.2, EC 2.3.1.61, and EC 1.6.4.3) in purified rat brain mitochondria were studied. Brain mitochondrial KGDHC showed absolute requirement for alpha-ketoglutarate, CoA and NAD, and only partial requirement for added thiamine pyrophosphate, but no requirement for Mg2+ under the assay conditions employed in this study. The pH optimum was between 7.2 and 7.4, but, at pH values below 7.0 or above 7.8, KGDHC activity decreased markedly. KGDHC activity in various brain regions followed the rank order: cerebral cortex greater than cerebellum greater than or equal to midbrain greater than striatum = hippocampus greater than hypothalamus greater than pons and medulla greater than olfactory bulb. Significant inhibition of brain mitochondrial KGDHC was noted at pathological concentrations of ammonia (0.2-2 mM). However, the purified bovine heart KGDHC and KGDHC activity in isolated rat heart mitochondria were much less sensitive to inhibition. At 5 mM both beta-methylene-D,L-aspartate and D,L-vinylglycine (inhibitors of cerebral glucose oxidation) inhibited the purified heart but not the brain mitochondrial enzyme complex. At approximately 10 microM, calcium slightly stimulated (by 10-15%) the brain mitochondrial KGDHC. At concentrations above 100 microM, calcium (IC50 = 1 mM) inhibited both brain mitochondrial and purified heart KGDHC. The present results suggest that some of the kinetic properties of the rat brain mitochondrial KGDHC differ from those of the purified bovine heart and rat heart mitochondrial enzyme complexes. They also suggest that the inhibition of KGDHC by ammonia and the consequent effect on the citric acid cycle fluxes may be of pathophysiological and/or pathogenetic importance in hyperammonemia and in diseases (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, inborn errors of urea metabolism, Reye's syndrome) where hyperammonemia is a consistent feature. Brain accumulation of calcium occurs in a number of pathological conditions. Therefore, it is possible that such a calcium accumulation may have a deleterious effect on KGDHC activity.
3761387	The adaptation to repeated periods of intermittent normobaric hypoxia (oxygen:nitrogen = 10:90, 12 hr daily for 5 days) of some specific enzymatic activities related to energy metabolism has been observed in different rat brain areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata). The evaluation of the maximum rate (Vmax) of the enzymes was carried out on: the homogenate "in toto," the nonsynaptic mitochondrial fraction, and the crude synaptosomal fraction. The adaptation to intermittent normobaric hypoxic exposure was characterized by significant modifications of some enzyme activities in the homogenate "in toto" (decrease of hexokinase activity in cerebellum), in the nonsynaptic mitochondrial fraction (increase of succinate dehydrogenase activity in corpus striatum and decrease of cytochrome oxidase activity in cerebral cortex), and, particularly, in the synaptosomal fraction (decrease of cytochrome oxidase activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, and cerebellum, and decrease of malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase activity in cerebellum). The adaptation to normobaric intermittent hypoxia differs according to the brain area, subcellular fraction, and enzyme activity tested.
3774149	Anatomical studies utilizing wheat germ lectin-bound horseradish peroxidase demonstrated direct connections between the pontine parabrachial region and the substantia nigra pars reticulata and to a lesser extent, the entopeduncular nucleus as well as a number of other forebrain regions including the amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, bed nucleus stria terminalis and substantia innominata. The pontine parabrachial region was also shown to receive direct inputs from the spinal trigeminal system and to send axons to areas surrounding trigeminal and hypoglossal motor areas. Once the anatomical connections were determined, electrophysiological studies were undertaken to investigate some of the functional aspects of these connections between the pontine parabrachial, basal ganglia and trigeminal systems. Extracellular single unit recordings were obtained from 228 cells in the dorsal pontine parabrachial region of the cat. These cells were tested for responsiveness to trigeminal sensory stimulation and activation of basal ganglia outputs (i.e. substantia nigra and entopeduncular nucleus). Twenty-two percent of pontine parabrachial cells responded to only trigeminal stimulation; 4% responded to entopeduncular nucleus only; 37% responded to substantia nigra only, and 28% responded to both substantia nigra and trigeminal stimulation. Furthermore, 43% of pontine parabrachial cells with both substantia nigra and sensory response had the sensory response altered by a preceding stimulus to the substantia nigra. Thus, the substantia nigra is shown to exert influences on both the spontaneous activities and afferent responses of pontine parabrachial neurons. The significance of these findings are discussed in relation to the importance of descending basal ganglia influences and ascending influences from the pontine parabrachial region on various sensorimotor activities.
3779392	We studied the trigeminal and facial motor nuclei of the hagfish by the retrograde HRP method. We distinguished 4 components in a single column of the motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve, viz., the pars magnocellularis of the trigeminal motor nucleus (mVm), the anterior part of the pars parvocellularis of the trigeminal motor nucleus (mVp1), the posterior part of the pars parvocellularis of the trigeminal motor nucleus (mVp2) and the facial motor nucleus (mVII). Although in Nissl preparations only the mVm could be distinguished from the rest of the nucleus, the boundaries of the other 3 components were clearly demarcated in HRP preparations. Intramuscular injections into two representative antagonistic jaw muscles revealed that there was no apparent topological organization of the neurons pertaining to the opening and closing muscles in the mVm and mVp1, but both antagonistic muscles were innervated bilaterally. Although the hagfish does possess a cartilaginous jaw, the organization pattern of the motor nuclei of the jaw muscles seems to be the most primitive of all living vertebrates.
3782511	The cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents of cortical area 6 located on the anterior sigmoid gyrus were mapped and analyzed in the dog by means of cytoarchitectonic, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and autoradiographic methods. Cytoarchitectonically, area 6 consists of medial and lateral subdivisions that correspond, respectively, to areas 6a alpha and 6a beta in the cat. In the dog, area 6a alpha is characterized by a wide layer III, the merging of borders between layers III and V, the presence of small-to-medium-size pyramidal cells in layer V, and a pallisade arrangement of cells in layer VI. Area 6a beta appears more stratified, with a relatively acellular layer present between layers V and VI and the presence of large pyramidal cells in layer V. Neither area 6a alpha nor 6a beta contains a layer IV. Data obtained from injections of HRP into areas 6a alpha or 6a beta revealed that labeled thalamic neurons were distributed in a longitudinal band extending from the rostral part of the ventral anterior nucelus (VA) through the caudal part of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Labeled cells were observed in the ventral lateral and ventral medial thalamic nuclei as well as in several of the intralaminar nuclei including the central lateral, central medial, parafascicular, and centrum medianum nuclei. A few labeled cells were also located in the suprageniculate nucleus. The densest thalamic labeling was present in VA and MD following injections into area 6a alpha. Equivalent or even larger injections into area 6a beta resulted in much less thalamic labeling. The band of labeled cells also extended into the hypothalamus, zona incerta, amygdala, claustrum, periaqueductal gray of the midbrain, and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch. Results from autoradiographic experiments showed that area 6 subdivisions receive a loosely organized topographic input from VA. Injections of tritiated amino acids were made into selected regions of VA and into the caudal part of MD, areas in which the largest numbers of HRP-labeled cells were located. Area 6a alpha receives afferents primarily from the rostromedial part of VA and the caudal part of MD while area 6a beta receives its principal input from the caudal and lateral parts of VA with minimal input from MD. Axons originating from VA terminate in both layers I and III of area 6 while those originating from the caudal part of MD terminate only in layer III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3793998	Intracortical microstimulation was used to define the borders of the frontal eye fields in squirrel, owl, and macaque monkeys. The borders were marked with electrolytic lesions, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected within the field. Following tetramethyl benzidine histochemistry, afferent and efferent connections of the frontal eye field with subcortical structures were studied. Most connections were ipsilateral and were similar in all primates studied. These include reciprocal connections with the following nuclei: medial dorsal (lateral parts), ventral anterior (especially with pars magnocellularis), central lateral, paracentral, ventral lateral, parafascicular, medial pulvinar, limitans, and suprageniculate. The frontal eye field also projects to the ipsilateral pretectal nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, superior colliculus (especially layer four), zona incerta, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, nucleus Darkschewitsch, dorsomedial parvocellular red nucleus, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, basilar pontine nuclei, and bilaterally to the paramedian pontine reticular formation and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Many of these structures also receive input from deeper layers of the superior colliculus and are known to participate in visuomotor function. These results reveal connections that account for the parallel influence of the superior colliculus and the frontal eye field on visuomotor function; suggest that there has been little evolutionary change in subcortical connections, and therefore function, of the frontal eye fields since the time that these lines of primates diverged; and support the conclusion that the frontal eye fields are homologous in New and Old World monkeys.
3796817	Cholera toxin conjugated horseradish peroxidase was injected into the posterior pituitary and its afferents traced in 21 albino rats. The neuronal processes as well as the perikarya were elaborately displayed. The principal and retrochiasmatic supraoptic nuclei and the magnocellular paraventricular subnuclei were densely labelled. The accessory cell groups or nuclei labelled included: the medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas, the anterior and posterior fornical nuclei, the lateral hypothalamic area, the nucleus circularis and nucleus of the forebrain bundle and hitherto unknown or not fully appreciated retrochiasmatic area, the dorsal accessory groups in an area between the stria medullaris and fornix, on the one hand, and the stria terminalis and internal capsule, on the other, and a well developed subependymalperiventricular zone. The medial preoptic nucleus, subfornical organ and organ vasculosum laminae terminalis were also weakly stained. Dendrites of the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus have been said by some to be largely confined to the subnuclei in which they lie. Immunohistochemical studies have proved that they extended beyond their nuclear confinement. The present study has found much wider extension of their dendritic fields. In fact, dendrites of the magnocellular neurosecretory cells in general were long and had a certain degree of directional bias. Several sites projecting to the posterior pituitary were closely related to the cerebrospinal fluid. Namely, the subependymal neuronal plexuses along the third ventricle and beneath the interventricular foramen, and the subpial dendritic plexuses of the supraoptic and retrochiasmatic supraoptic nuclei. Neurons were seen to squeeze in-between the ependymal cells, bringing themselves very close to the cerebrospinal fluid. No direct cerebrospinal fluid-contacting elements, either cell bodies or processes, however, could be ascertained. It is proposed that these plexuses may monitor changes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Besides the principal neurohypophysial tract the posterior pituitary was found in the present study to receive its afferents via two accessory fasciculi, one coursing in the medial forebrain bundle and the other running along the lateral wall of the infundibular recess subependymally.
3796820	Ascending projections from the several nuclei of the medullary reticular formation were examined using the autoradiographic method. The majority of fibers labeled after injections of [3H]leucine into nucleus gigantocellularis ascended within Forel's tractus fasciculorum tegmenti which is located ventrolateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Nucleus gigantocellularis injections produced heavy labeling in the pontomesencephalic reticular formation, the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the pontine and midbrain central gray, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the ventral midbrain tegmentum including the retrorubral area, the centromedian-parafascicular complex, the fields of Forel/zona incerta, the rostral intralaminar nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area. Nucleus gigantocellularis projections to the rostral forebrain were sparse. Labeled fibers from nucleus reticularis ventralis, like those from nucleus gigantocellularis, ascended largely in the tracts of Forel and distributed to the pontomedullary reticular core, the facial and trigeminal motor nuclei, the pontine nuclei and the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum including the locus coeruleus and the parabrachial complex. Although projections from nucleus reticularis ventralis diminished significantly rostral to the pons, labeling was still demonstrable in several mesodiencephalic nuclei including the cuneiform-pedunculopontine area, the mesencephalic gray, the superior colliculus, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the zona incerta and the paraventricular and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. The main bundle of fibers labeled by nucleus gigantocellularis-pars alpha injections ascended ventromedially through the brainstem, just dorsal to the pyramidal tracts, and joined Forel's tegmental tract in the midbrain. With the brainstem, labeled fibers distributed to the pontomedullary reticular formation, the locus coeruleus, the raphe pontis, the pontine nuclei, and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus and adjacent regions of the pontine gray. At mesodiencephalic levels, labeling was present in the rostral raphe nuclei (dorsal, median and linearis), the mesencephalic gray, the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the medial and anterior pretectal nuclei, the ventral tegmental area, zona incerta as well as the mediodorsal and reticular nuclei of the thalamus. Injections of the parvocellular reticular nucleus labeled axons which coursed through the lateral medullary tegmentum to heavily innervate lateral regions of the medullary and caudal pontine reticular formation, cranial motor nuclei (hypoglossal, facial and trigeminal) and the parabrachial complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3797493	The central nervous structures involved in behavioral thermoregulatory responses during cold exposure were investigated in conscious rats by means of the 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose ([14C]-DG) autoradiographic technique. According to autoradiographs, many brain regions with significant increases or decreases in [14C]-DG incorporation were observed during thermoregulatory behavior. When animals were only exposed to cold, significant increases in [14C]-DG incorporation were observed in the caudate putamen, lateral preoptic area, medial forebrain bundle, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), posterior hypothalamus, ventroposteromedial thalamus (VPM), dorsomedial thalamus (MD), substantia nigra (SN) and red nucleus (RN). Lower activities were observed in the hippocampus and the medial habenula. However, when animals performed the behavioral thermoregulation (heat seeking behavior) significant increases were noted in the sulcal prefrontal cortex, sensory-motor cortex, and MD, while decreases were noted in the piriform cortex, VMH, VPM, medial habenula, SN and RN, compared with those in the group without the thermoregulatory behavior.
3801918	The regional brain and spinal cord concentrations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide immunoreactivity (VIP) were measured in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. The relative order of distribution of VIP in the WKY strain was cortex (44 pmol/g) greater than hippocampus = striatum greater than midbrain = hypothalamus greater than medulla oblongata/pons = lumbar spinal cord (SC) greater than cervical SC greater than thoracic SC (2.5 pmol/g) whereas in the SH strain this order was cortex (35 pmol/g) greater than striatum = midbrain greater than hippocampus = hypothalamus greater than medulla oblongata/pons = lumbar SC greater than cervical SC greater than thoracic SC (1 pmol/g). The VIP concentrations of the thalamus, cerebellum and pituitary were at the level of assay sensitivity (0.5 pmol/g) in both strains. In comparison to the WKY, the SH rats had significantly lower VIP levels in the hippocampus (-42%) and cervical (-46%) and thoracic (-56%) spinal cord but significantly higher levels in the midbrain (+64%).
3805358	The afferent and efferent connections of the dorsolateral precentral gyrus, the primary motor cortex for control of the upper extremity, were studied by using the retrograde and anterograde capabilities of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique in three adult macaque monkeys that had received HRP gel implants in this cortical region. Reciprocal corticocortical connections were observed primarily with the supplementary motor area (SMA) in medial premotor area 6 and dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus, postarcuate area 6 cortex, dorsal cingulate cortex (area 24), superior parietal lobule (area 5, PE/PEa), and inferior parietal lobule (area 7b, PF/PFop, including the secondary somatosensory SII region). In these heavily labeled regions, the associational intrahemispheric afferents originated primarily from small and medium sized pyramidal cells in layer III, but also from layer V. The SMA projections were columnar in organization. Intrahemispheric afferents from contralateral homologous and nonhomologous frontal and cingulate cortices also originated predominantly from layer III, but the connections from contralateral area 4 were almost exclusively from layer III. The bilateral connections with premotor frontal area 6 and cingulate cortices were not observed with parietal regions; i.e., only ipsilateral intrahemispheric parietal corticocortical connections were observed. There were no significant connections with prearcuate area 8 or the granular frontal (prefrontal) cortex. Subcortical afferents originated primarily from the nucleus basalis of Meynert, dorsal claustrum, ventral lateral (VLo and VLc), area X, ventral posterolateral pars oralis (VPLo), central lateral and centromedian thalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, locus ceruleus and subceruleus, and superior central and dorsal raphe nuclei. Lesser numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the nucleus of the diagonal band, mediodorsal (MD), paracentral, and central superior lateral thalamic nuclei, nucleus limitans, nucleus annularis, and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3806100	We measured putrescine levels in minute sites of single rat brains using a sensitive, specific assay involving gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The putrescine level was measured in 20 sites of single rat brains: three sites in the cerebral cortex, six sites in the hypothalamus, three sites in the basal ganglia, three sites in the thalamus, three sites in the limbic system, and two sites in the cerebellum. The level of putrescine was very high in the hypothalamus, high in the basal ganglia and limbic system, and low in the thalamus, cerebellum, and two of the three sites in the cerebral cortex. The highest levels were in the anterior hypothalamic area and the lateral hypothalamic area, and the lowest levels were in the vermis and the lobe of the cerebellum.
3809489	Correlation of magnetic resonance (MR) images with cryomicrotome sections and formalin-fixed sections of human brain documents that spin-echo MR imaging with short repetition time/short echo time pulse sequences can display the surface gyri of the inferomedial temporal lobe, including the temporal pole, the parahippocampal gyrus, the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, the lateral and medial occipitotemporal gyri, and the inferior temporal gyrus; the associated sulci including the rhinal and collateral sulci, the occipitotemporal sulcus, and the anterior calcarine sulcus; the components and fiber tracts of the hippocampal formation including the pes hippocampi, the hippocampus, the subiculum, the dentate gyrus, the subsplenial gyri, the alveus, the fimbria, and the fornix; the fissures and sulci associated with the hippocampal formation, including the hippocampal fissure, dentatofimbrial fissure, and the choroidal fissure; the continuity between the cingulate gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus through the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus; and the continuity between the callosal sulcus and the hippocampal fissure.
3809490	Magnetic resonance (MR) images in the sagittal plane display the lengths of the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, dentate gyrus, hippocampus, fimbria, fornix, hippocampal fissure, choroidal fissure, and temporal horn, and the anatomic relationships of these structures to the surrounding brain. Correlation of these images with anatomic specimens provides criteria for identifying these structures confidently on routine clinical MR imaging.
3827687	We describe a case of an adult-onset progressive dystonia with external ophthalmoplegia, occurring in a black man without a family history of neurologic disorders. Neuropathologic examination demonstrated neuronal loss and gliosis in the anterior horn and Clarke's column in the spinal cord, nuclei of cranial nerves III, VI, X, and XII, vestibular complex, lateral cuneate nucleus, lower pontine tegmentum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and dentate nucleus. The cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, basis pontis, inferior olives, and cerebellum were spared. The clinical and pathologic findings closely resemble autosomal-dominant motor system degeneration or "Azorean disease," without, however, demonstrable familial transmission. In addition to the absence of a family history, unique features of the case include the presence of Alzheimer type II glial cells in the red nucleus and an unexplained persistent elevated concentration of serum amylase.
3840236	Bilateral electrolytic lesions and unilateral tracer injections were performed in lactating rats in order to study the participation of the mesencephalic lateral tegmentum in the milk-ejection reflex. The release of oxytocin was detected as a rise in intramammary pressure during each milk ejection. In animals with lesions, the lateral part of the deep grey layers of the superior colliculus, the intercollicular area and the rostromedial portion of the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus were destroyed. The mesencephalic lateral tegmentum of animals in which the milk-ejection reflex was blocked sustained a larger damage than in rats where the frequency of the milk-ejection response was only slowed down. Solutions of True Blue, horseradish peroxidase or horseradish peroxidase coupled to wheat germ agglutinin were injected in the mesencephalic lateral tegmentum of rats with and without lesions. Retrogradely labelled cells were found in several nuclei of the somatosensory pathways: the principal sensory and spinal parts of the trigeminal complex, the cuneate and gracile nuclei, the lateral cervical nucleus and the nucleus proprius of the spinal cord. Labelled cells were also found in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, the ventral parabrachial nucleus, the gigantocellular reticular nucleus, the lateral nucleus of the substantia nigra, the prerubral nucleus of the thalamus, the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, the zona incerta and in the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas. Labelled fibres and "terminal-like" labelling were found in the anterior pretectal area, in the thalamic parafascicular nucleus, in the posterior nucleus and the ventroposterior complex, in the zona incerta and in the fields of Forel, but none were observed in the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei. Injections made in the area of the lateral cervical nucleus and in the cuneate and gracile nuclei labelled fibres and "terminal-like" fields in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, the intercollicular area, the deep grey layers of the superior colliculus and in the mesencephalic lateral tegmentum. After injections in the posterior nucleus and ventroposterior complex of the thalamus, retrogradely labelled cells were found in the lateral tegmentum, the intercollicular area and the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus. These results indicate that bilateral lesioning of the mesencephalic lateral tegmentum, which disrupts the milk-ejection response, could damage somatosensory projections originating from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the lateral cervical nucleus, the dorsal column nuclei and the sensory and spinal trigeminal nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3843302	A series of three studies was performed to investigate the effects of the ability to avoid or escape shock (controllability) and the lack of ability to do so (uncontrollability) on noradrenergic neurons in various brain regions of male Wistar rats. The levels of noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), in the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, midbrain, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, pons plus medulla oblongata, and basal ganglia were measured fluorometrically. These studies indicated that after 3 hr and 6 hr in a free operant avoidance-escape stress procedure, the experimental rats able to avoid or escape shock showed greater increases in NA turnover (lower NA levels and higher MHPG-SO4 levels) in specific brain regions (i.e., the hypothalamus, amygdala, and thalamus) than the yoked rats unable to control the same shock. After 21 hr of stress, in contrast to stress of either 3-hr or 6-hr duration, the yoked rats exhibited a more marked enhancement of NA turnover in these brain regions than did experimental rats. Once shock-controlling responses had been acquired and well established by experimental rats, the responses of NA neurons in these rats did not differ markedly from those in the nonshocked control rats. Yoked rats given the same repetitive sessions of uncontrollable shock displayed sustained increases in NA turnover preferentially in the hypothalamus and amygdala, compared with the experimental rats. These results suggest that NA release in specific brain regions in the experimental "coping" rats is increased before the rats have learned the effective coping response. However, once a coping response is firmly established, NA release is reduced.
3877182	The concentration of corticotropin-releasing factor-like immunoreactivity (CRF-LI) in the human central nervous system was measured by radioimmunoassay in postmortem tissue of control patients and in those with histologically confirmed senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). In the controls, CRF-LI was found in high concentrations in the hypothalamus and frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 10), in moderate concentrations in amygdala, substantia innominata, temporal and parietal cortex (Brodmann's areas 38 and 7), and the caudate nucleus, and in low concentrations in posterior hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. A marked reduction in the concentration of CRF-LI was observed in the frontal and temporal cortex (approximately 50%) as well as in the caudate nucleus (approximately 70%) in the SDAT group. The present findings suggest that neurons containing corticotropin-releasing factor are pathologically altered in SDAT, in addition to the previously described cholinergic and somatostatinergic neuronal degeneration.
3877882	The distribution of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide in the rat brain was investigated by means of an indirect immunofluorescence method. In addition to previously reported calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactive structure-containing sites such as the nucleus ambiguus, nucleus originis nervi facialis, nucleus originis nervi hypoglossi, nucleus peripeduncularis and nucleus parabrachialis, the present study demonstrated a far wider distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactive structure-containing cells in the rat brain, i.e. the nucleus hypothalamicus lateralis, nucleus ventromedialis thalami, colliculus superior, lemniscus lateralis, gyrus dentatus, nucleus olivaris superior, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus cuneiformis, nucleus parabigeminalis and a proportion of the Purkinje cells. We have also demonstrated a more extensive network of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactive fibers distributed in various areas throughout the rat brain than has been reported previously such as the colliculus inferior, nucleus olivaris superior, nucleus vestibularis lateralis and inferioris, and nucleus cochlearis dorsalis and ventralis, etc.
3882778	A detailed description is given of the distribution of vasopressin-immunoreactive structures in the brain of intact adult male rats. By application of a modified immunocytochemical procedure, vasopressin-immunoreactive fibers were detected in many new areas. In adult male rats which were castrated 15 weeks before death, vasopressin-immunoreactive cell bodies had disappeared from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the medial amygdaloid nucleus. No obvious changes were found in vasopressin-immunoreactive cell bodies in other areas. Furthermore, a very strong reduction was seen in the density of vasopressin-immunoreactive fibers in the olfactory tubercle, nucleus of the diagonal band and its immediate surroundings, ventral pallidum, basal nucleus of Meynert, lateral septum, septofimbrial nucleus, ventral hippocampal formation, amygdaloid area, pre- and supramammillary nucleus, supramammillary decussation, (inter)dorsomedial, parafascicular, and ventral aspect of paraventricular thalamic nuclei, zona incerta, lateral habenular nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, periventricular gray, dorsal and median raphe nucleus, and locus coeruleus. No changes were observed in other areas containing vasopressin-immunoreactive fibers. These changes following gonadectomy were not observed in castrated rats which had been treated with testosterone. The results suggest that vasopressin projections from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and possibly from the medial amygdaloid nucleus require the presence of gonadal hormones for their normal appearance. This is in contrast to pathways arising from the hypothalamic vasopressin-producing nuclei, which fail to show obvious changes following castration.
3883229	The distribution of serotonin-containing nerve cell bodies, fibers and terminals in the lizard Varanus exanthematicus was studied with the indirect immunofluorescence technique, using antibodies to serotonin. Most of the serotonin-containing cell bodies were found in the midline, in both of the raphe nuclei, i.e. the nuclei raphes superior and inferior. A considerable number of more laterally shifted serotonergic neurons was found particularly at three levels of the brain stem, viz. in the caudal mesencephalic tegmentum, at the isthmic level, and over a long distance in the medulla oblongata. These laterally situated serotonin-positive neurons were partly found within the confines of the substantia nigra, the nucleus reticularis superior and the lateral part of the nucleus reticularis medius and ventrolateral part of the nucleus reticularis inferior, respectively. No serotonergic cell bodies were found in the spinal cord. In the brain stem a dense serotonergic innervation was observed in all of the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, in two layers of the tectum mesencephali, in the nucleus interpeduncularis pars ventralis, the nucleus profundus mesencephali pars rostralis, the periventricular grey, the nucleus parabrachialis, the vestibular nuclear complex, the nucleus descendens nervi trigemini, the nucleus raphes inferior, and parts of the nucleus tractus solitarii. Descending serotonergic pathways could be traced into the spinal cord via the dorsolateral, ventral and ventromedial funiculi, and were found to innervate mainly three parts of the spinal grey throughout the spinal cord, i.e. the dorsal part of the dorsal horn, the motoneuron area in the ventral horn, and the intermediate zone just lateral to the central canal. The results obtained in the present study suggest a close resemblance of the organization of the serotonergic system in reptiles and mammals, especially as to the serotonergic innervation of the spinal cord.
3887207	The distribution of visinin, a 24,000 dalton peptide, in the lower brain stem of the rat was examined by means of an indirect immunofluorescent method. Visinin-immunoreactive structures were found to be unevenly distributed only in the neuronal elements. The following neuronal systems were strongly labeled by the antiserum; the Purkinje cell system, mammillotegmental system, habenulointerpeduncular system, the second layer of the superior colliculus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars lateralis, area medial to the medial geniculate body, parabrachial area, dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, pontine reticular formation just medial to the trigeminal principal nucleus, superior olivary nucleus, solitarii nucleus, external layer of the inferior colliculus and spinal trigeminal nucleus. The densities of the labeled fibers in these areas paralleled those of the labeled cells. In addition, highly dense visinin-immunoreactive fiber plexuses were seen in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra, lateral portion of the interpeduncular nucleus, ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden and vestibular nucleus.
3891012	The distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactive (NPYI) structures in the rat lower brainstem was examined by means of indirect immunofluorescence or peroxidase-antiperoxidase methods. In addition to the well known immunoreactive NPYI containing cell groups, the present study demonstrated a much wider distribution of immunoreactive NPYI cells in the lower brainstem, i.e. substantia nigra pars lateralis, interpeduncular nucleus, inferior colliculus, nucleus cuneiformis, dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, nucleus laterodorsalis tegmenti, nucleus vestibularis medialis, nucleus vestibularis inferioris, in the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis and nucleus parvocellularis compacta. We also demonstrated an extensive network of NPYI fibers in various areas of the lower brainstem including the auditory system, viscerosensory system, visceromotor system, raphe nuclei, reticular formation, parabrachial area, locus coeruleus and interpeduncular nucleus, etc. The possible importance of NPY is briefly discussed.
3906428	The present study is an examination, using an indirect immunofluorescence method, of the distribution of visinin, a 24,000 dalton peptide, in the rat forebrain and diencephalon. Immunoreactive structures were localized in the neuronal elements showing an uneven distribution. Immunoreactive neurons were found in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral cortex, amygdaloid complex, ventral portion of the nucleus caudatus putamen, septal area, nucleus accumbens, nucleus paratenialis, nucleus rhomboideus, nucleus reuniens, nucleus paraventricularis hypothalami, nucleus supraopticus, nucleus anterior hypothalami, preoptic area, hypothalamic periventricular nucleus, nucleus mammillaris medialis, medial habenular nucleus, zona incerta, nucleus lateralis thalami, nucleus tractus optici and gyrus dentatus. Immunoreactive fibers were observed in the above areas, particularly near the labelled cells, forming fiber plexuses of varying density. In addition, dense plexuses were also seen in the globus pallidus, anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus, substantia nigra and hippocampus. In the former three structures, no labelled cells were present and in the latter, a few scattered neurons were found, indicating that these fibers originate from extrinsic sources.
3906594	With the use of an antiserum generated in rabbits against synthetic human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) the distribution of CGRP-like immunoreactive cell bodies and nerve fibers was studied in the rat central nervous system. A detailed stereotaxic atlas of CGRP-like neurons was prepared. CGRP-like immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the rat central nervous system. CGRP positive cell bodies were observed in the preoptic area and hypothalamus (medial preoptic, periventricular, anterior hypothalamic nuclei, perifornical area, medial forebrain bundle), premamillary nucleus, amygdala medialis, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, central gray and the ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus. In the midbrain a large cluster of cells was contained in the peripeduncular area ventral to the medial geniculate body. In the hindbrain cholinergic motor nuclei (III, IV, V, VI, VII XII) contained CGRP-immunoreactivity. Cell bodies were also observed in the ventral tegmental nucleus, the parabrachial nuclei, superior olive and nucleus ambiguus. The ventral horn cells of the spinal cord, the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia also contained CGRP-immunoreactivity. Dense accumulations of fibers were observed in the amydala centralis, caudal portion of the caudate putamen, sensory trigeminal area, substantia gelatinosa, dorsal horn of the spinal cord (laminae I and II). Other areas containing CGRP-immunoreactive fibers are the septal area, nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic and hypothalamic nuclei (e.g., medial preoptic, periventricular, dorsomedial, median eminence), medial forebrain bundle, central gray, medial geniculate body, peripeduncular area, interpeduncular nucleus, cochlear nucleus, parabrachial nuclei, superior olive, nucleus tractus solitarii, and in the confines of clusters of cell bodies. Some fibers were also noted in the anterior and posterior pituitary and the sensory ganglia. As with other newly described brain neuropeptides it can only be conjectured that CGRP has a neuroregulatory action on a variety of functions throughout the brain and spinal cord.
3907752	The distribution of enkephalin-immunoreactive neuronal profiles in the forebrain and upper brainstem of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) was studied by means of the indirect immunofluorescence method. Numerous enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were disclosed in various regions including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, septal area, olfactory tubercle, substantia innominata, amygdala, various hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray, midbrain reticular formation and interpeduncular nucleus. Some of the highest concentrations of enkephalin-positive fibers in the squirrel monkey brain were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus, the outer layer of the median eminence, and in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Overall, the pattern of distribution of the enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the forebrain and upper brainstem of the squirrel monkey is similar to that found in the rat, except that the density of positive neuronal profiles in the entire forebrain appears much higher in monkey than in rat. Furthermore, the very dense network of enkephalin-immunoreactive fibers disclosed in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkey appears to be lacking in rat.
3909123	The present study describes the immunocytochemical distribution of peptides derived from the prodynorphin precursor in the brain of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Animals were treated with colchicine (intracerebroventricularly) prior to perfusion to enhance the observation of perikaryal immunoreactivity. Using antisera generated against dynorphin A(1-17), dynorphin B(1-13), and prodynorphin(186-208) (or bridge peptide), the anatomical distribution of dynorphin systems was mapped. The results indicate a widespread neuronal localization of immunoreactivity from the cerebral cortex to the caudal medulla. Anti-dynorphin B and anti-bridge peptide sera proved useful for the demonstration of neuronal perikarya, while the dynorphin A antiserum was best for localizing terminal projection fields. Immunoreactive perikarya are located in numerous brain loci, including the cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus (especially the magnocellular nuclei), thalamus, substantia grisea centralis, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus tractus solitarius, and other nuclei. In addition, fiber and terminal immunoreactivity are seen in varying densities in the striatum and pallidum, substantia innominata, hypothalamus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, parabrachial nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and other areas. The distribution of prodynorphin peptides in the brain of the monkey is similar to that described for the rat brain; however, significant differences also exist. Other interspecies differences in the anatomy of prodynorphin and proenkephalin neuronal systems in the monkey and human brain are further discussed.
3912207	Inactive renin in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rat was investigated. The results are as follows. Treatment with either trypsin or glandular kallikrein of the brain tissue extract caused a rapid and apparent increase in the renin activity at either 0 or 27 degrees C. The molecular weight of the active renin was estimated to be 41,000 or 50,000 daltons, while that of the trypsin-activatable inactive renin was found to be 44,000 or 57,000 daltons on a column chromatography with Sephadex G-100. The contents of the active renin was the highest in the hypothalamus, followed by the striatum, thalamus, midbrain, medulla oblongata, cerebral cortex and cerebellum, while the contents of the trypsin-activatable inactive renin was the highest in the hypothalamus, followed by the striatum, thalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata. These results suggest that inactive renin(s) exist in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rat. It seems likely that the brain renin-angiotensin system is modulated by the conversion of inactive to active renin(s), which, in turn, plays at least in part a role in the blood pressure regulation through generation of angiotensin II in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
3950094	Neurotensin-containing neurons in the hedgehog and sheep central nervous system were studied immunohistochemically. In both species, mapping of neurotensin neurons was achieved only after pretreatment with colchicine injected intracerebroventricularly 2 days prior to perfusion. Bipolar or multipolar neurotensin neurons, 10-30 micron in diameter, were observed in the following regions of the central nervous system of both species: medial amygdaloid nucleus, lateral septal nucleus, interstitial nucleus of the stria terminals, caudate nucleus, preoptic area, and hypothalamus. On the contrary, while immunoreactive neurons were found in the central amygdaloid nucleus, nucleus accumbens, nucleus of the diagonal band, subthalamus, superior central nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, central gray substance of the pons, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord of the hedgehog, respective regions of the sheep appeared to be devoid of immunoreactive perikarya. Also, in some regions, namely the hippocampal formation, the central gray substance of the midbrain, the locus coeruleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract, neurotensin neurons were found exclusively in the latter species. The existence of these differences in the distribution pattern of neurotensin-immunoreactive neurons between the two species as well as between them and others already examined is briefly discussed.
3956628	Subcortical connections of the superior colliculus were investigated in albino and pigmented rats using retrograde and anterograde tracing with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), following unilateral injection of HRP into the superior colliculus. Afferents project bilaterally from the parabigeminal nuclei, the nucleus of the optic tract, the posterior pretectal region, the dorsal part of the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex and the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus; and ipsilaterally from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the pars lateralis of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet, the zona incerta, the olivary pretectal nucleus, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, the lateral thalamus, Forel's field H2, and the ventromedial hypothalamus. Collicular efferents terminate ipsilaterally in the anterior, posterior and olivary pretectal nuclei, the nuclei of the optic tract and posterior commissure, the ventrolateral part of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the pars lateralis of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet, and the zona incerta; and bilaterally in the parabigeminal nuclei and lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (chiefly its dorsal part). The general topographical patterns of some of the afferent and efferent projections were also determined: the caudal and rostral parts of the parabigeminal nucleus project to the caudal and rostral regions, respectively, of the superior colliculus; caudal superior colliculus projects to the most lateral, and lateral superior colliculus to the most caudal part of the terminal field in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; caudolateral superior colliculus projects to the caudal ventrolateral part of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, while rostromedial parts of the colliculus project more rostrally and dorsomedially. Following comparable injections in pigmented and albino animals, fewer retrogradely labelled cells were found in subcortical structures in the albino than in the pigmented rats. The difference was most marked in nuclei contralateral to the injected colliculus. Thus, the effects of albinism on the nervous system may be more widespread than previously thought.
3956636	The projection of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and the adjacent tegmental area, to the caudal brain stem and the cerebellum were investigated by means of anterograde transport of tritiated leucine. The nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis was found to be exclusively connected with the cerebellum. Mossy fiber terminals were absent only from lobule X and most abundant in lobule VII and the hemispheres with a slight contralateral predominance. The paramedian pontine reticular formation projects with bilateral symmetry to the cerebellar lobules VI, VII and the crura I and II, and heavily to the medial aspect of predominantly the ipsilateral reticular formation in the lower brain stem including specific targets as the nucleus reticularis paramedianus, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the nucleus intercalatus, the nucleus of Roller, the nucleus supragenualis and the dorsal cap of the inferior olive. The nucleus vestibularis medialis receives a very weak projection. The connections are discussed in the light of their possible involvement in pathways for the execution of voluntary and reflex eye movements.
3960201	Neuronal populations in the brainstem and spinal cord as sources of fibre pathways to the facial nucleus were studied in adult cats by means of microionophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase into restricted zones of the facial nucleus. Projection from nucleus nervi hypoglossi, nucleus praepositus hypoglossi, nucleus raphe pallidus, nucleus intercalatus, medial nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, neurons of genu of the facial nerve, ipsilateral red nucleus and reticular formation of the midbrain to the facial nucleus are found. Projections from a number of other brain structures to the facial nucleus are confirmed. A topographical map of distribution of the brainstem and spinal cord afferents in the facial nucleus is proposed.
3968225	After horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections into various parts of the ventral thalamic nuclear group and its adjacent areas, the distribution of labeled neurons was compared in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and the brain stem. The major differences in distribution patterns were as follows: Injections of HRP into the lateral or ventrolateral portions of the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclear complex of the thalamus (VA-VL) produced retrogradely labeled neurons consistently in area 4 gamma (lateral part of the anterior and posterior sigmoid gyri, lateral sigmoid gyrus and the lateral fundus of the cruciate sulcus), the medial division of posterior thalamic group (POm), suprageniculate nucleus (SG) and anterior pretectal nucleus ipsilaterally, and in the nucleus Z of the vestibular nuclear complex bilaterally. Injections into the medial or dorsomedial portion of the VA-VL resulted in labeled neurons within the areas 6a beta (medial part of the anterior sigmoid gyrus), 6a delta (anterior part of ventral bank of buried cruciate sulcus), 6 if. fu (posterior part of the bank), fundus of the presylvian sulcus (area 6a beta), medial part of the nucleus lateralis posterior of thalamus and nucleus centralis dorsalis ipsilaterally, and in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) and medial pretectal nucleus bilaterally. Only a few neurons were present in the contralateral area 6a delta. After HRP injections into the ventral medial nucleus (VM), major labeled neurons were observed in the gyrus proreus, area 6a beta (mainly in the medial bank of the presylvian sulcus), and EPN ipsilaterally, and in the medial pretectal nucleus and substantia nigra bilaterally. Following HRP injections into the centre médian nucleus (CM), major labeled neurons were found in the areas 4 gamma, 6a beta, and the orbital gyrus ipsilaterally, and in the EPN, rostral and rostrolateral parts of the thalamic reticular nucleus, locus ceruleus, nucleus reticularis pontis oralis et caudalis and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi bilaterally. The contralateral intercalatus nucleus also possessed labeled neurons. With HRP injections into the paracentral and centrolateral nuclei, labeled neurons were observed in the gyrus proreus and the cortical areas between the caudal presylvian sulcus and anterior rhinal sulcus ipsilaterally, and in the nuclei interstitialis and Darkschewitsch bilaterally. Minor differences in the distribution pattern were observed in the superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, mesencephalic and medullary reticular formations, and vestibular nuclei in all cases of injections.
3968238	The pharmacohistochemical method previously used to identify the distribution in rat brain of gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T)-intensive neurons has been applied to the rat pons and medulla. The method involves systemic administration of the irreversible GABA-T inhibitor Gabaculine and the detection, 12 to 15 hours after the injection of the newly synthesized GABA-T by histochemical means. GABA-T-intensive neurons were found to be rich in the following hindbrain structures: inferior colliculus, nuclei of the raphe system, nuclei parabrachialis dorsalis and ventralis, nucleus cuneiformis, nucleus vestibularis medialis, nucleus tractus spinalis nervi trigemini, nucleus vagus, nucleus cochlearis, nucleus reticularis lateralis, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus cuneatus lateralis, inferior olive, and reticular formation of the pons and medulla. Neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei and the rostral portion of the lateral vestibular nucleus were negative for GABA-T but were surrounded by granular staining indicative of impinging GABA-T-rich nerve endings. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that GABA neurons are far more GABA-T-intensive than other neurons in the central nervous system.
3971138	The distribution of immunoreactive (ir) leucine-enkephalin (LE) and ir-methionine-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu (ME-RGL) in 101 microdissected rat brain and spinal cord regions was determined using specific and sensitive radioimmunoassays. The highest concentrations of LE and ME-RGL were measured in globus pallidus (5190 and 4378.8 fmol/mg protein, respectively). Very high concentrations of LE and ME-RGL (greater than 750 fmol/mg protein) were found in the central amygdaloid nucleus, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, lateral preoptic area, nucleus of the solitary tract (medial and commissural parts), bed nucleus of stria terminalis, dorsomedial nucleus, parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray and motor hypoglossal nucleus. Very high concentrations of ME-RGL were found in 14 additional brain regions including medial preoptic area, area postrema, nucleus ambiguus, periventricular nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, paraventricular, arcuate and others. High concentrations of LE (between 500 and 750 fmol/mg protein) were found in 15 brain areas, among them the periventricular nucleus, medial preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsal premamillary nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, locus coeruleus, substantia nigra. High concentrations of ME-RGL were measured in 13 brain areas including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, lateral septal nucleus, raphe magnus, motor facial nucleus, lateral amygdaloid nucleus, sensory trigeminal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen. Moderate concentrations of LE (between 250 and 500 fmol/mg) were found in 46 brain areas such as the lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, several amygdaloid nuclei, supraoptic nucleus, the perifornical nucleus, posterior hypothalamic nucleus, red nucleus. Moderate concentrations of ME-RGL were detected in 27 areas such as the median eminence, nuclei of the reticular formation, supraoptic nucleus, red nucleus and others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3973677	The binding of (125I-Tyr4)bombesin to rat brain slices was investigated. Radiolabeled (Tyr4)bombesin bound with high affinity (Kd = 4 nM) to a single class of sites (Bmax = 130 fmol/mg of protein); the ratio of specific to nonspecific binding was 6/1. Also, pharmacology studies indicated that the C-terminal of bombesin was important for the high affinity binding activity. Autoradiographic studies indicated that the (125I-Tyr4)bombesin-binding sites were discretely distributed in certain gray but not white matter regions of rat brain. Highest grain densities were present in the olfactory bulb and tubercle, nucleus accumbens, suprachiasmatic and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, central medial thalamic nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, nucleus of the solitary tract, and substantia gelatinosa. Moderate grain densities were present in the parietal cortex, deep layers of the neocortex, rhinal cortex, caudate putamen, stria terminalis, locus ceruleus, parabrachial nucleus, and facial nucleus. Low grain densities were present in the globus pallidus, lateral thalamus, and midbrain. Negligible grain densities were present in the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and all regions treated with 1 microM unlabeled bombesin. The discrete regional distribution of binding suggests that endogenous bombesin-like peptides may function as important regulatory agents in certain brain loci.
3978438	Injections of the retrograde tracer [125I]wheat germ agglutinin have been placed in different areas of the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), a well known premotor center for gaze control. Experiments in 5 monkeys revealed 3 major sources of input: (1) bilateral projections from the so-called frontal eye field (FEF), which is situated in the frontal cortex around the arcuate sulcus; (2) the intermediate and deep layers of mainly the contralateral superior colliculus; and (3) ipsilateral projections from brainstem structures such as the accessory oculomotor nuclei (nucleus interstitialis of Cajal, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, and nucleus of the posterior commissure), the mesencephalic reticular formation, the vestibular nuclei, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, and the cerebellar fastigial nucleus. The results are compared with previous anatomical investigations and confirm the electrophysiologically demonstrated FEF-PPRF-abducens disynaptic pathway.
3995355	The ipsilateral cortico-cortical connexions passing between the architectonic subdivisions of the primary somatic sensory cortex, S1, of the monkey have been studied with axonal degeneration methods after the placement of small lesions. All architectonic subdivisions except area 3a, and all the topographic representations, have been involved by the lesions. The degeneration of local intracortical fibres has the same features that have been described in other cortical areas: dense terminal degeneration for about 200 micron immediately around the lesion and moderate degeneration extending for a few millimetres with that in layers I, IV and the deep part of V being the most marked and reaching furthest; the degeneration extends further in the antero-posterior than in the medio-lateral dimension, and further posteriorly than anteriorly. The arrangement of the intercortical fibre connexions varies with the architectonic subdivision and with the topographic representation, and as in other sensory areas these fibres may be considered as either feed-forward or feed-back. The feed-forward projections are heavy, terminate in all layers of the cortex but mainly in layer IV and the deep part of layer III, whereas the feed-back connexions are lighter and end in layers I, II, the superficial part of layer III and in layers V and VI. In the antero-posterior dimension, feed-forward fibres from area 3b go to areas 3a, 1 and 2; area 1 sends feed-forward connexions to areas 3a and 2 and feed-back to area 3b; area 2 sends a feed-forward projection to area 3a and feed-back to areas 3b and 1; all areas also send fibres to area 5. A lesion in one of the architectonic subdivisions in the trunk and face representations results in degeneration throughout the antero-posterior extent of S1, but after damage within an architectonic area in the distal limb regions, there are foci of degeneration in the middle of the antero-posterior extents of the other areas but with little or none at the boundaries. The cortico-cortical fibres also extend medially or laterally for a few millimetres, in bands a few hundred micron wide. After damage of the trunk, occiput or proximal limb representations, the degenerating fibres pass predominantly along the boundaries; the separate representations of the caudal trunk, at the postcentral dimple and cingulate sulcus, are connected by continuous bands along the boundaries of area 3a and at the 2/5 boundary, and those of the occiput region at the levels of the postcentral dimple and lower end of the intraparietal sulcus are similarly linked.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3995367	Afferent and efferent connections of the medial preoptic area including medial preoptic nucleus (MP) and periventricular area at the MP level were examined using WGA-HRP as a marker. Injections were performed by insertion of micropipette containing (1) small amount of HRP powder or (2) dryed HRP solution for 24 to 48 hr until the fixation or for 5 min respectively. Dorsal and ventral approaches of injection micropipettes were performed and the results were compared. Previously reported reciprocal connections with lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdaloid nucleus, lateral hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, central gray at the mesencephalon, raphe dorsalis, raphe medianus, and lateral parabrachial nucleus have been confirmed. In addition, we found reciprocal connections with septo-hypothalamic nucleus, amygdalo-hipocampal nucleus, subiculum, parafascicular thalamic nucleus, posterior thalamic nucleus at the caudo-ventral subdivision, median preoptic nucleus, lateral preoptic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, periventricular area at the caudal hypothalamic level, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, posterior hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal and ventral premammillary nucleus, lateral mammillary nucleus, peripeduncular nucleus, periventricular gray, ventral tegmental area, interpeduncular nucleus, nucleus raphe pontis, nucleus raphe magnus, pedunculo-pontine tegmental nucleus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus and solitary tract nucleus. The areas which had only efferent connections from MP were accumbens, caudate putamen, ventral pallidum, substantia innominata, lateral habenular nucleus, paratenial thalamic nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, reuniens thalamic nucleus, median eminence, medial mammillary nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, pars compacta of substantia nigra, oculomotor nucleus, red nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, reticular tegmental nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, nucleus locus coeruleus, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus among which substantia innominata and median eminence were previously reported. Efferent connections to the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, dorsal tegmental nucleus, ventral tegmental nucleus, vestibular nuclei, nucleus raphe obsculus were very weak or abscent in the ventral approach while they were observed in dorsal approach. Previously reported afferent connections from dorsal tegmental nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, and nucleus locus ceruleus were not detected in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3996501	Injections of HRP in the nucleus raphe magnus and adjoining medial reticular formation in the cat resulted in many labeled neurons in the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) but not in the medial part of this nucleus. HRP injections in the nucleus raphe pallidus and in the C2-segment of the spinal cord did not result in labeled neurons in the BNST. Injections of 3H-leucine in the BNST resulted in many labeled fibers in the brain stem. Labeled fiber bundles descended by way of the medial forebrain bundle and the central tegmental field to the lateral tegmental field of pons and medulla. Dense BNST projections could be observed to the substantia nigra pars compacta, the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, the PAG (except its dorsolateral part), the cuneiform nucleus, the nucleus raphe dorsalis, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus subcoeruleus, the medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, the lateral tegmental field of caudal pons and medulla and the nucleus raphe magnus and adjoining medial reticular formation. Furthermore many labeled fibers were present in the solitary nucleus, and in especially the peripheral parts of the dorsal vagal nucleus. Finally some fibers could be traced in the marginal layer of the rostral part of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus. These projections appear to be virtually identical to the ones derived from the medial part of the central nucleus of the amygdala (Hopkins and Holstege 1978). The possibility that the BNST and the medial and central amygdaloid nuclei must be considered as one anatomical entity is discussed.
3996514	Changes in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in the central nervous system during systemic hypercapnia were determined by the [3H]2-DG autoradiographic method in peripherally chemodenervated rats. Autoradiographs were made from serial transverse sections of the brain and analyzed by a computer-based interactive image processing system for areas having increases or decreases in metabolic activity compared with control animals. The most pronounced change shown by autoradiographs of the hypercapnic animals was a generalized decrease in the metabolism of the gray matter throughout the central nervous system with respect to the normocapnic controls. However, several central structures showed evidence of either no change or an increased metabolism in the hypercapnic animals. In the brain stem these areas were localized to the ventrolateral region of the nucleus of the solitary tract rostral to the obex, around the region of the nucleus retroambiguus, in a region of the ventrolateral medullary reticular formation extending rostrally from the obex to the level of the intramedullary rootlets of the facial nerve, in the region of the ventral nucleus raphe pallidus, and in the region of the lateral parabrachial nucleus. In the diencephalon these regions included the supraoptic nucleus and the dorsal hypothalamic area, extending into the caudal portion of the paraventricular nucleus. The thoracolumbar cord showed activation of the lateral aspects of the dorsal horns, the region of lamina X and the region of the intermediolateral nucleus. These data may be interpreted as a functional map of the central structures activated in hypercapnia in the peripheral chemodenervated rat. It appears likely that these structures are involved in mediating the cardiorespiratory responses associated with the activation of central chemoreceptors by the increased carbon dioxide concentrations.
3998213	Previous histological and histochemical studies have provided evidence that the globus pallidus (external pallidal segment) as conventionally delineated in the rat extends ventrally and rostrally beneath the transverse limb of the anterior commissure, invading the olfactory tubercle with its most ventral ramifications. This infracommissural subdivision of the globus pallidus or ventral pallidum (VP) is most selectively identified by being pervaded by a dense plexus of substance-P-positive striatofugal fibers; the extent of this plexus indicates that the VP behind the anterior commissure continues dorsally over some distance into the anteroventromedial part of the generally recognized (supracommissural) globus pallidus; the adjoining anterodorsolateral pallidal region, here named dorsal pallidum (DP), receives only few substance-P-positive fibers, but contains a dense plexus of enkephalin-positive striatal afferents that also pervades VP. Available autoradiographic data indicate that VP and DP receive their striatal innervation from two different subdivisions of the striatum: whereas VP is innervated by a large, anteroventromedial striatal region receiving substantial inputs from a variety of limbic and limbic-system-associated structures (and therefore called "limbic striatum"), DP receives its striatal input from an anterodorsolateral striatal sector receiving only sparse limbic afferents ("nonlimbic" striatum) but instead heavily innervated by the sensorimotor cortex. The present autoradiographic study has produced evidence that this dichotomy in the striatopallidal projection is to a large extent continued beyond the globus pallidus: whereas the efferents of DP were traced to the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, those of VP were found to involve not only the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra but also the frontocingulate (and adjoining medial sensorimotor) cortex, the amygdala, lateral habenular and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and tegmental regions farther caudal and dorsal in the midbrain. These findings indicate that the ventral pallidum can convey striatopallidal outflow of limbic antecedents not only into extrapyramidal circuits but also back into the circuitry of the limbic system.
4004152	Frozen samples of postmortem human brain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 25) and control patients who died without neurological disease (n = 25) were assayed for neurotensin and bombesin by specific radioimmunoassay. Twelve brain regions were examined: substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray matter, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and entorhinal cortex. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the concentration of bombesin was significantly decreased in the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus, and the concentration of neurotensin was significantly reduced in the hippocampus. The concentration of neither peptide was significantly altered in the substantia nigra or ventral tegmental area, two regions known to exhibit reductions in other neurotransmitter substances.
4010932	To detect neuronal cell bodies whose axon projects to the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, small volumes (10-50 nl) of 30% horseradish peroxidase or 2% fast blue solutions were pressure-injected into the area of one supraoptic nucleus of rats. Both dorsal and ventral approaches to the nucleus were used. In animals where the injection site extended beyond the limits of the supraoptic nucleus, retrogradely labelled cell bodies were found in many areas of the brain, mainly in the septum, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and ventral subiculum in the limbic system; the dorsal raphe nucleus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the dorsal tegmentum, the dorsal parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the catecholaminergic A1 region in the brain stem; in the subfornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, as well as in the median preoptic nucleus. In contrast, when the site of injection was apparently restricted to the supraoptic nucleus, labelling was only clearcut in the two circumventricular organs, the median preoptic nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the A1 region. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin coupled with horseradish peroxidase (60-80 nl of a 2.5% solution) made in the septum and in the ventral subiculum anterogradely labelled fibers coursing in an area immediately adjacent to the supraoptic nucleus but not within it. In contrast, labelling within the nucleus was found following anterograde transport of tracer deposited in the A1 region and in an area that includes the nucleus of the solitary tract. Neurones located in the perinuclear area were densely labelled by small injections into the supraoptic nucleus; they may represent a relay station for some afferent inputs to the supraoptic nucleus. These results suggest that the supraoptic nucleus is influenced by the same brain areas which project to its companion within the magnocellular system, the paraventricular nucleus.
4020034	Two days after an experimental whiplash performed on anesthetized Long-Evans female rats, without any direct blow to the head, we observed: (1) a hypotension (in supine position) (P less than 0.01), (2) a disturbance of the postural regulation of cerebral blood flow (P less than 0.01), (3) a disturbance of learning behavior characterized by decreased acquisition and retention (conditioned avoidance response and labyrinth tests), (4) an increase of the dopamine level (whole brain, cerebellum, thalamus + hypothalamus, corpus striatum and rest), (5) a decrease of the noradrenaline level in whole brain (P less than 0.05) and in the medulla oblongata but an increase in thalamus plus hypothalamus, hippocampus and corpus striatum, (6) an increased reactivity of the peripheral alpha and beta receptors, determined by analyzing the hemodynamic consequences of i.v. injection of norepinephrine or isoproterenol, (7) there was no modification of the brain content of water or of serotonin and (8) finally, the injured rats displayed a remarkably aggressive behavior, though this was not quantified. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that a change in brain amines metabolism could explain the different functional effects of whiplash. We therefore believe that the postconcussion syndrome is not subjective and that the neck injury is primary in the determination of the syndrome.
4052776	The distribution of serotonin-1 (5-HT1) receptors in the rat brain was studied by light microscopic quantitative autoradiography. Receptors were labeled with [3H]serotonin (5-[3H]HT), 8-hydroxy-2-[N-dipropylamino-3H]tetralin (8-OH- [3H]DPAT), [3H]LSD and [3H]mesulergine, and the densities quantified by microdensitometry with the aid of a computer-assisted image-analysis system. Competition experiments for 5-[3H]HT binding by several serotonin-1 agonists led to the identification of brain areas enriched in each one of the three subtypes of 5-HT1 recognition sites already described (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C). The existence of these 'selective' areas allowed a detailed pharmacological characterization of these sites to be made in a more precise manner than has been attained in membrane-binding studies. While 5-[3H]HT labeled with nanomolar affinity all the 5-HT1 subtypes, the other 3H-labeled ligands labeled selectively 5-HT1A (8-OH-[3H]DPAT), 5-HT1C ([3H]mesulergine) and both of them ([3H]LSD). Very high concentrations of 5-HT1 receptors were localized in the choroid plexus, lateroseptal nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral pallidum, dentate gyrus, dorsal subiculum, olivary pretectal nucleus, substantia nigra, reticular and external layer of the entorhinal cortex. The different fields of the hippocampus (CA1-CA4), some nuclei of the amygdaloid complex, the hypothalamic nuclei and the dorsal raphé, among others, also presented high concentrations of sites. Areas containing intermediate densities of 5-HT1 receptors included the claustrum, olfactory tubercle, accumbens, central grey and lateral cerebellar nucleus. The nucleus caudate-putamen and the cortex, at the different levels studied, presented receptor densities ranging from intermediate to low. Finally, in other brain areas--pons, medulla, spinal cord--only low or very low concentrations of 5-HT1 receptors were found. From the areas strongly enriched in 5-HT1 sites, dentate gyrus and septal nucleus contained 5-HT1A sites, while globus pallidus, dorsal subiculum, substantia nigra and olivary pretectal nucleus were enriched in 5-HT1B. The sites in the choroid plexus, which presented the highest density of receptors in the rat brain, were of the 5-HT1C subtype. The distribution of 5-HT1 receptors reported here is discussed in correlation with the distribution of serotoninergic neurons and fibers, the related anatomical pathways and the effects which appear to be mediated by these sites.
4056098	The nigrothalamocortical connections and their topography were analyzed by autoradiography and double or triple retrograde labeling with the fluorescent dyes Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, and Propidium Iodide. Injections of tritiated leucine into different parts of the substantia nigra (SN) revealed that the medial SN projects to the medial magnocellular subdivisions of the ventral anterior (VAmc) and mediodorsal (MDmc) nuclei of the thalamus while the lateral SN projects to the more lateral and more posterior part of the VAmc, and the paralaminar, parvicellular, and densocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc). With the exception of the MDmf, terminal areas observed in the mediodorsal nucleus were in the form of scattered clusters of grains. Analysis of the thalamus in cases with fluorescent dye injections into the lateral orbital gyrus (Walker's area 11), principal sulcus (area 46), anterior bank of the arcuate gyrus (areas 8 and 45), supplementary motor area (area 6), and motor cortex (area 4) revealed topographic organization of the nigrothalamocortical projection system. The parts of the VAmc and MDmc which receive afferents from the medial part of the SN in turn project to the most anterior regions of the frontal lobe including principal sulcus and orbital cortex. The lateral posterior VAmc, MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc, all of which receive afferents from the lateral part of the SN; project to more posterior regions of the frontal lobe including, in addition to the principal sulcus, the frontal eye field and also areas of the premotor cortex. These findings indicate that the SN has preferential targets in the thalamus and cerebral cortex which are segregated from those of the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Whereas the motor cortex is the primary target of cerebellar output (Asanuma et al., '83b), and the premotor cortex is the target of pallidal output (Schell and Strick, '84), the SN output appears to be directed more anteriorally--to the prefrontal cortex.
4075153	An autoradiographical oxytocin (OXT) labeling procedure using frozen, unfixed tissue sections resulted in very dense labeling of the mammary gland. Binding sites for OXT were also found in various forebrain areas, including the hippocampus, especially the ventral subiculum and taenia tecta, central amygdala, posterior part of the anterior olfactory nucleus, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and the posterior pituitary. The ependyma of the lateral ventricle and/or the chorioid plexus near the lateral septum was labeled as well. These data support the hypothesis that OXT plays a role in a number of centrally regulated processes.
4077698	The intermediate part of the medial component of the hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) of the chick telencephalon is implicated in the learning process of imprinting. The afferent connections of this region were investigated using the retrograde neuronal tracers horseradish peroxidase (HRP), nuclear yellow and fast blue. Labelled cells were found (i) ipsilaterally in the visual Wulst, neostriatum pars intermedia and caudalis, the posterior part of the hyperstriatum ventrale, the dorsal part of the archistriatum, paleostriatum augmentatum, dorsomedial part of the thalamus, and (ii) bilaterally in the hippocampus, area septalis, ventromedial part of the thalamus and the stratum album centrale of the tectum opticum. The efferent projections of the IMHV were studied using the anterograde tracer, [3H]leucine. Labelling was seen ipsilaterally over the dorsolateral part of the hemispherium telencephali, the paleostriatum augmentatum and the posterior and dorsal parts of the archistriatum. Double labelling with nuclear yellow and fast blue revealed (i) neurons in the IMHV which project to both the paleostriatum augmentatum and the archistriatum, and (ii) neurons in the hippocampus which project bilaterally to the IMHV.
4078041	The origins of descending spinal projections in the lepidosirenid lungfishes were identified by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) introduced into the rostral spinal cords of juvenile African (Protopterus annectans and Protopterus amphibians) and South American (Lepidosiren paradoxa) lungfishes. Standard HRP histochemistry revealed retrogradely labeled neurons in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, midbrain tegmentum, red nucleus, optic tectum, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, granule cell layer of the cerebellum, superior, middle, and inferior medullary reticular nuclei, magnocellular and descending octaval nuclei, region of the descending trigeminal tract, solitary complex, and the margins of the spinal gray matter anterior to the spinal HRP implant. A small number of retrogradely labeled neurons were also present in the ventral thalamus of Protopterus. A descending spinal projection from the forebrain was not evident in either genus of lepidosirenid lungfishes. The presence of projections to the spinal cord from the diencephalon, medial reticular formation of the midbrain and medulla, octaval (vestibular) nuclei, solitary complex, and probable nucleus of the descendin trigeminal tract in lungfishes and their overall similarity to comparable projections in other vertebrates suggest that these pathways are among those representative of the primitive pattern of descending spinal projections in vertebrates.
4084793	The distribution of immunoreactive (ir)-metorphamide (adrenorphin) in 101 microdissected rat brain and spinal cord regions was determined using a highly specific radioimmunoassay. The highest concentration of metorphamide in brain was found in globus pallidus (280.1 fmol/mg protein). High concentrations of ir-metorphamide (greater than 120 fmol/mg protein) were found in 9 nuclei, including central amygdaloid nucleus, lateral preoptic area, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal grey matter and nucleus of the solitary tract. Moderate concentrations of the peptide (between 60 and 120 fmol/mg protein) were found in 47 brain nuclei such as nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, several septal and amygdaloid nuclei, most of the hypothalamic nuclei, ventral tegmental area, red nucleus, raphe nuclei, lateral reticular nucleus, area postrema and others. Low concentrations or ir-metorphamide (less than 60 fmol/mg protein) were measured in 41 nuclei, e.g., cortical structures, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, thalamic nuclei, supraoptic nucleus, substantia nigra, vestibular nuclei, cerebellum (nuclei and cortex). The olfactory bulb has the lowest metorphamide concentration (5.8 fmol/mg protein). Spinal cord segments exhibit very low peptide concentrations.
4086572	A highly sensitive assay for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was devised by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. It is based on the separation of acetylcholine and choline on an octadecylsilane reversed-phase column, followed by their enzymatic conversion into hydrogen peroxide through the post-column reaction with immobilized AChE and choline oxidase. The system is highly sensitive, and the relationship between the peak height and the amount of choline is linear over the range 5 pmol to 5 nmol. When homogenate of bovine caudate nucleus was used as enzyme, the Michaelis constant of the enzyme for acetylcholine was 0.4 mM. The regional distribution of AChE activity in rat brain was examined, and the order of the activity from the highest to the lowest agreed with the reported brain distribution of AChE: striatum, thalamus plus hypothalamus, pons plus medulla oblongata, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum.
4086658	Ascending projections from the midbrain central gray (CG) and from the region lateral to it were traced in the rat using tritiated amino acid autoradiography. Leucine or a cocktail of amino acids (leucine, proline, lysine, histidine, and tyrosine) were used as tracers. In addition to projections within the midbrain, ascending fibers follow three trajectories. The ventral projection passes through the ventral tegmental region of Tsai and the medial forebrain bundle to reach the hypothalamus, preoptic area, caudoputamen, substantia innominata, stria terminalis, and amygdala. There are labeled fibers in the diagonal bands of Broca and medial septum, and terminal labeling in the lateral septum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and frontal cortex. The dorsal periventricular projection terminates in the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. The ventral periventricular projection follows the ventral component of the third ventricle into the hypothalamus, passing primarily through the dorsal hypothalamic area and labeling the rostral hypothalamus and preoptic area. Projections from the region lateral to the CG are similar, but exhibit stronger proximal, and weaker distal, projections. Rostral levels of the CG send heavier projections to the fields of Forel and the zona incerta, but fewer fibers through the supraoptic decussation, than do caudal levels. Ascending projections from the CG are both strong and widespread. Strong projections to the limbic system and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei provide an anatomical substrate for CG involvement in nociception and affective responses.
4093595	Sources of afferent projections to the superior colliculus (SC) of the rat were determined by means of the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method. The experiments were conducted first to provide a comprehensive map of all the brain structures which supply input to the SC, and secondly to pinpoint the sources of afferents to the deep collicular layers. Experiments conducted after large HRP deposits invading almost all the collicular layers resulted in the labeling of visual centers (cortical areas 17, 18 and 18a, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, nucleus of the optic tract, anterior and olivary pretectal nuclei, parabigeminal nucleus); somatosensory centers (cortical area SmI, principal and spinal tract trigeminal nuclei) auditory centers (auditory cortex, inferior colliculus and nuclei of the lateral lemniscus) and various other centers (zona incerta, substantia nigra, cingulate and motor cortices, and some hypothalamic, thalamic, pontine reticular and deep cerebellar nuclei). Deposits limited to the deep SC layers resulted in the labeling of a smaller number of structures: visual centers (cortical area 18a, nucleus of the posterior commissure, parabigeminal nucleus); somatosensory centers (cortical area SmI, principal and spinal tract trigeminal nuclei); auditory centers (inferior colliculus, nuclei of the lateral lemniscus); and various other centers (zona incerta, substantia nigra, cingulate cortex, some hypothalamic nuclei, posterior thalamic nucleus, central gray, cuneiformis and subcuneiformis nuclei, pontine reticular nucleus pars oralis). The pattern of the afferent connections to the rat's SC appears identical to the general plan of organization in mammals; the sources of afferents are extensive and allow the SC to be influenced by multisensory, limbic and even motor-related systems.
5789808	1. The effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the metabolism of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in dog brain was investigated by following the concentrations of the acid metabolites of these amines, homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid, in the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (C.S.F.) of dogs over a period of 5 hr after intravenous administration of CPZ (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg), using the technique of serial sampling of lateral ventricular C.S.F. "Low" doses (2.5-10 mg/kg) produced a rise in the concentration of homovanillic acid and smaller increases in the concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid. "High" doses (10-15 mg/kg) had a lesser effect on the concentration of homovanillic acid and had no effect on, or decreased, the concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid. The concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was maximal in the ventricular C.S.F. 2 hr after CPZ 5 mg/kg and was unaltered from the control level 2 hr after 15 mg/kg.2. The effects on the metabolism of brain amines of CPZ (5 mg/kg), doses which the serial sampling of C.S.F. experiments had indicated as producing maximal and minimal effects on dopamine metabolism in brain tissue, were studied by estimating the concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, metanephrine, methoxydopamine, homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid in the hypothalamus, midbrain, thalamus, hindbrain, cortex, globus pallidus and caudate nucleus of control dogs and of dogs treated with CPZ intravenously 2 hr before killing. The concentrations of homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid were estimated in samples of ventricular C.S.F. withdrawn from these dogs 2 hr after the injection of CPZ (i.e., immediately before death).3. The following changes in concentrations were observed. Dopamine: CPZ 5 mg/kg produced no change in the concentration in the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus and midbrain and increased the concentration in the thalamus; CPZ 15 mg/kg appeared to cause a reduction in the concentration of this amine in the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus. Homovanillic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid: CPZ 5 mg/kg increased the concentrations of both acids in the caudate nucleus and had no effect on the concentrations of the acids in the globus pallidus, hypothalamus and thalamus; CPZ 15 mg/kg produced no change in the concentrations of the acids in any area of the brain. Methoxydopamine: CPZ 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg reduced the concentration in the caudate nucleus. Noradrenaline: The concentrations in the hypothalamus, midbrain, thalamus and hindbrain were slightly increased by CPZ 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg. Only in the thalamus was a statistically significant increase in noradrenaline observed.4. It was concluded that the actions of chlorpromazine on catecholamine synthesis and metabolism in the brain of the dog are dose dependent. A dose of CPZ 5 mg/kg was postulated to have the following actions: (i) to increase dopamine synthesis; (ii) to activate mitochondrial monoamine oxidase. A dose of CPZ 15 mg/kg was postulated to act as follows: (i) to decrease dopamine synthesis; or (ii) to release dopamine from its storage sites.5. The ratios of the concentrations of homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid in the caudate nucleus to the concentrations of these acids in the ventricular C.S.F. were the same in the control dogs as in the dogs treated with CPZ (5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg). It was concluded that the levels of the acid metabolites of dopamine in lateral ventricular C.S.F. reflect the levels of these acids in the caudate nucleus.
6084511	The influence of 2-(2-oxo-3-piperidyl)-1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one-1, 1-dioxide (supidimide), a representative of a new class of sedative drugs, on the noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuronal systems of rodent brains was investigated. In each case the brain transmitter levels after administration of supidimide were determined. Utilisation of noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also investigated ex vivo. The study was complemented with in vitro investigations of biosynthesis, synaptosomal uptake, degradation, and receptor binding of the transmitters. Based on a preliminary study of the distribution of [35S]-supidimide in rat brain, in vitro effects observed at greater than 10(-4) mol/l were considered irrelevant. Similarly, in vivo effects requiring dosages higher than 300 mg/kg i.p. were not regarded adequate to explain the sedative and antiaggressive efficacy of supidimide. With the above restrictions, the following parameters can be rated as not influenced by supidimide: levels of tryptophan in rat brain and serum (free and total); 5-HT biosynthesis in vivo (rat brain; 5-HT accumulation after monoamine oxidase (MAO) blockade); activity of MAO-A and MAO-B (rat brain mitochondria); uptake of 5-HT, NE and DA (rat synaptosomes); 5-HT receptor binding ( [3H]-LSD binding assay in rat cortical membranes); tyrosine hydroxylase activity (rat adrenal glands); catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) (rat liver); NE binding to central alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors (rat brain; radioligand assay with [3H]-dihydroergocryptine, [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-WB 4101 (2',6'-dimethoxy-(G-3H]-phenoxy]-ethylaminomethylbenzo-1,4-dioxane ); DA levels (whole rat brain and striata); dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels (whole rat brain without cerebellum and striata); elevated DOPAC levels after pretreatment with haloperidol; DA-dependent adenylate cyclase in vitro (rat striatum); D2 receptor binding ( [3H]-spiperone binding assay, rat striatum); GABA levels (mouse brain); GABA transaminase activity (mouse brain stem); sodium-independent [3H]-GABA receptor binding (rat brain) and benzodiazepine binding (rat cortical membranes, [3H]-diazepam binding assay). Two effects on the GABAergic system were induced by supidimide. Starting at 300 mg/kg i.p., supidimide slowed down the GABA accumulation in brains of aminooxyacetate-treated mice. At 10(-4) mol/l supidimide caused a significant inhibition of GABA uptake (rat synaptosomes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6087984	Substance P (SP) is a putative neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the present report we have used a modification of the Young and Kuhar technique to investigate some of the SP receptors binding properties and the distribution of SP receptors in rat brain. Tritiated SP [( 3H]SP) absorbed extensively to glass but this adsorbtion was greatly reduced by preincubating the slide-mounted tissue sections in a solution containing the cationic polymer polyethylenimine. [3H]SP was found to bind to rat tissue in a saturable fashion with a Bmax of 14.7 fmol/mg tissue wet weight and a Kd of 1.1 nM. The rank order of potencies for displacing [3H]SP binding from rat tissue sections was SP greater than SP sulphoxide greater than DiMeC7 greater than Eledoisin greater than SP(5-11) greater than SP(COOH) greater than SP(1-9) amide. Using autoradiography coupled with LKB tritium-sensitive Ultrofilm or the dry emulsion-coated coverslip technique the distribution of [3H]SP binding sites was found to be very dense within olfactory bulb, amygdalo-hippocampal area and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Heavy concentrations of receptors were observed in the septum, diagonal band of Broca, striatum subiculum, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus and lobule 9 and 10 of the cerebellum. Moderate to low concentrations of receptors were observed in the cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, raphe nuclei and the trigeminal nucleus. Very low densities were observed in most aspects of the dorsal thalamus, substantia nigra and cerebellum (other than lobule 9 and 10). Comparisons of the present data with SP peptide levels indicate that in some areas of the brain there is a rough correlation between peptide and receptor levels. However, in other brain areas (olfactory bulb, globus pallidus and substantia nigra) there is little obvious correlation between the two.
6096414	The topical and laminar distribution of corticotectal cells, as well as their size and morphology, were studied in the macaque monkey with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. After HRP injections restricted primarily to the superficial layers of the colliculus, labelled cells were found in visual cortex (areas 17, 18, and 19) and both in the frontal eye field (area 8) and the adjacent part of premotor cortex (area 6). The clustering of labelled cells in visual cortex indicated that each of the anatomically and functionally distinct visual areas has its own set of collicular projections. When intermediate and deeper layers of the colliculus were injected, labelled cells were found also in posterior parietal cortex (area 7) where they were concentrated mainly on the posterior bank of the intraparietal fissure, in inferotemporal cortex (areas 20 and 21), in auditory cortex (area 22), in the somatosensory representation SII (anterior bank of sylvian fissure, area 2), in upper insular cortex (area 14), in motor cortex (area 4), in premotor cortex (area 6), and in prefrontal cortex (area 9). In the motor and premotor cortex, labelled cells formed a continuous band which appeared to stretch across finger-hand-arm-shoulder-neck representation. Similarly, the cluster of labelled cells in area 2 may correspond to the finger-hand representation of SII. The cortical regions not containing labelled cells were the somatosensory representation SI (areas 3, 1 and 2) and the infraorbital cortex. Labelled cells were restricted to layer V of all cortical areas except in the primary visual cortex, where labelled cells were found in both layer V and layer VI. The size spectrum of corticotectal cells ranged from 14.8 micron (average diameter) in area 17 to 27.8 micron in area 6, comprising cells as small as 8 micron and as large as 45 micron. Labelled cells in posterior parietal (area 7), in auditory (area 22), and in motor cortex (area 4) were small and distributed over only a narrow range of sizes. Those in premotor cortex (area 6) were often large and had a wide range in size distribution. The differences in size and morphology of corticotectal neurons suggest that they do not form a uniform class of neurons.
6099558	Specific receptors for corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) were identified in two functionally distinct systems within the brain, the cortex and the limbic system. Autoradiographic mapping of the CRF receptors in the brain revealed high binding density throughout the neocortex and cerebellar cortex, subiculum, lateral septum, olfactory tract, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, interpeduncular nucleus and superior colliculus. Moderate to low binding was found in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, claustrum, nucleus periventricularis thalamus, mammillary bodies, subthalamic nucleus, periaqueductal grey, locus coeruleus and nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract. As in the anterior pituitary gland, CRF receptors in the brain were shown to be coupled to adenylate cyclase. However, in contrast to the marked decrease in CRF receptors observed after adrenalectomy in the anterior pituitary gland, CRF receptor concentration in the brain and pars intermedia of the pituitary was unchanged. The presence of CRF receptors in areas involved in the control of hypothalamic and autonomic nervous system functions is consistent with the major role of CRF in the integrated response to stress.
6099745	The immunocytochemical distribution of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) peptides (beta-endorphin, ACTH, alpha-MSH, 16K fragment) was studied in the brain of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Some animals were administered colchicine intracerebroventricularly prior to sacrifice to enhance the visualization of perikaryal immunoreactivity. Immunoreactive perikarya are localized to hypothalamic infundibular nucleus, giving rise to several distinct projections. Rostral projections extend through midline diencephalic and preoptic areas, and enter the telencephalon. Along this course, immunoreactive fibers are seen in midline hypothalamic and preoptic nuclei, nucleus of the diagonal band, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septum, and other limbic structures in telencephalon. Caudal to the anterior commissure, some fibers ascend dorsally to enter the midline thalamus, which they innervate. Lateral projections of the infundibular perikarya course through the medial-basal hypothalamus, dorsal to the optic tracts, and enter the amygdala region where they innervate more medially situated amygdaloid nuclei. Caudal projections of the POMC neurons also extend through midline diencephalon, some coursing along a periventricular path to innervate midline hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei. This projection extends into the mesencephalic substantia grisea centralis and may also contribute to the innervation of more dorsally situated nuclei in the pons and medulla, such as the parabrachial nuclei and nucleus tractus solitarius. Other caudal projections originating in the hypothalamus course through the ventral tegmentum of mesencephalon and pons and may contribute to the innervation of midline raphe and other ventrally situated nuclei in the pons and medulla. The distribution of immunoreactive perikarya and fibers in the brain of rhesus monkey is strikingly similar to that found in the rat brain. However, subtle differences appear to exist in the innervation patterns of particular brain regions.
6105921	Cells and fibers containing somatostain (SRIF) or SRIF-like peptides were detected immunocytochemically in the brain of the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus L.). The periventricular preoptic nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus encompass a component of the SRIF-immunoreactive hypothalamo-infundibular and hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal systems. The suprachiastmatic, ventromedial and arcuate nuclei contain a number of SRIF-positive cells and receive a rich SRIF innervation. The extrahypothalamic systems containing SRIF can be subdivided into the following groups: (1) Afferents, the cellular origin of which is not always clearly evident, i.e., fibers of the septum, the lateral preoptic area, the thalamus, the superior olivary nucleus, the mesencephalic gray matter, and the subfornical organ; (2) dispersed cells with short projections (neocortex, caudate nucleus, putamen); (3) scattered cells with short projections (nucleus accumbens) or innervating remote territories (nucleaus interpeduncularis); (4) vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, a neurohemal area comparable to the median eminence. These observations lead to a theory of a functional bipotentiality of the somatostatin molecule. Immunocytological results depend on the antisera employed, the type of fixation and the experimental conditions. Adrenalectomy is followed by an accumulation of immunoreactive material in all SRIF-containing systems of the brain. These results clearly indicate the SRIF participates in the function of the CRF-ACTH-adrenal axis. The endocrine disturbance induced by adrenalectomy appears to modify the activity of both the neurohormonal and neuromodulator components of the SRIF system.
6106694	The regional distribution of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-sensitive stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity was studied in homogenates or rat brain. The order of sensitivity of this peptide on enzyme activity was: olfactory bulb > hippocampus > thalamus > occipital cortex congruent to frontal cortex congruent to midbrain congruent to hypothalamus > striatum > cerebellum congruent to brain stem > spinal cord. With neurotoxin-induced lesions the possible location of VIP-sensitive adenylate cyclase within the anterior hypothalamus was investigated. Intrahypothalamic 6-hydroxydopamine blocked the stimulatory effect of VIP on hypothalmic adenylate cyclase, but neither kainic acid nor 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions had any effect. Similarly, there was a 71% reduction in the sensitivity of VIP-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in animals whose hypothalamic noradrenergic innervation had been interrupted by transection of the ascending dorsal and ventral bundles. Biochemical analyses of the lesions suggested that loss of VIP action on adenylate cyclase was associated with loss of hypothalamic noradrenaline-containing neurons. These results may give insight into those regions of rat brain where VIP may have a neurotransmitter role, and point to a possible noradrenergic localization of the VIP-sensitive adenylate cyclase within the hypothalamus.
6113893	By use of the PAP-immunohistochemical staining technique with serial sections, somatostatin-immunoreactive fiber projections into the brain stem and the spinal cord are described. These projections originate in the periventricular somatostatin-immunoreactive perikarya of the hypothalamus and form three main pathways: (1) along the stria medullaris thalami and the fasciculus retroflexus into the interpeduncular nucleus; (2) along the medial forebrain bundle into the mammillary body; and (3) via the periventricular gray and the bundle of Schütz into the midbrain tegmentum. Densely arranged immunoreactive fibers and/or basket-like fiber terminals are observed within the following afferent systems: somatic afferent systems (nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, substantia gelatinosa dorsalis of the entire spinal cord), and visceral afferent systems (nucleus solitarius, regio intermediolateralis and gelatinosa gelatinosa of the sacral spinal cord). These projections form terminals around the perikarya of the second afferent neuron. Perikarya of the third afferent neuron are influenced by somatostatin-immunoreactive projections into the auditory system (nucleus dorsalis lemnisci lateralis, nucleus corporis trapezoidei). Furthermore, a somatostatin-immunoreactive fiber projection is found in the ventral part of the medial accessory olivary nucleus, in nuclei of the limbic system (nucleus habenularis medialis, nucleic supramamillaris and mamillaris lateralis) and in the formatio reticularis (nucleus Darkschewitsch, nuclei tegmenti lateralis and centralis, nucleus parabrachialis lateralis, as well as individual perikarya of the reticular formation). Targets of these projections are interneurons within interlocking neuronal chains.
6120746	Data recently published as indicating little or no evidence of neurotransmitter asymmetries in post-mortem human brain were analyzed by correlational and Chi-square procedures. Although handedness data were not available and it was not possible to determine the functional significance of asymmetries, our analysis shows that asymmetries in several brain structures and transmitter systems do indeed exist. The major findings are: (1) correlations of left-right asymmetries between and within structures and transmitters yielded a non-random distribution of significant correlations; (2) left-right asymmetries in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were positively correlated in all 9 structures examined; (3) correlations between left-right asymmetries of different neurotransmitters within the same structure tended to be positive whereas correlations between different structures tended to be negative: both trends were significant; (4) choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and dopamine (DA) were both significantly left-biased, by Chi-square tests, in globus pallidus; left-right asymmetries in ChAT and DA were positively correlated in globus pallidus, as well as in caudate nucleus and putamen; (5) left-right asymmetries in ChAT and GAD were positively correlated in all cortical areas and negatively correlated in all nigrostriatal structures; (6) in caudate, putamen and globus pallidus, there was a significant trend for brains with lower dopamine levels to be left-biased and vice-versa; (7) there was a highly significant inverse correlation of age with the absolute asymmetry in globus pallidus ChAT; (8) correlations of absolute asymmetries between the same or different neurotransmitters in different structures were usually positive, indicating that a greater or lesser degree of asymmetry probably characterizes each particular brain; (9) lastly, there were several similarities between the human data and those previously reported in rats, demonstrating that studies in the rat may reveal mechanisms and functions of brain asymmetry that are relevant to man.
6126837	The activity of ATP-citrate lyase in homogenates of five selected rat brain regions varied from 2.93 to 6.90 nmol/min/mg of protein in the following order: cerebellum less than hippocampus less than parietal cortex less than striatum less than medulla oblongata and that of the choline acetyltransferase from 0.15 to 2.08 nmol/min/mg of protein in cerebellum less than parietal cortex less than hippocampus = medulla oblongata less than striatum. No substantial differences were found in regional activities of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase or acetyl-CoA synthase. High values of relative specific activities for both choline acetyltransferase and ATP-citrate lyase were found in synaptosomal and synaptoplasmic fractions from regions with a high content of cholinergic nerve endings. There are significant correlations between these two enzyme activities in general cytocol (S3), synaptosomal (B) and synaptoplasmic (Bs) fractions from the different regions (r = 0.92-0.99). These data indicate that activity of ATP-citrate lyase in cholinergic neurons is several times higher than that present in glial and noncholinergic neuronal cells.
6132365	The distribution of dynorphin in the central nervous system was investigated in rats pretreated with relatively high doses (300-400 micrograms) of colchicine administered intracerebroventricularly. To circumvent the problems of antibody cross-reactivity, antisera were generated against different portions as well as the full dynorphin molecule (i.e., residues 1-13, 7-17, or 1-17). For comparison, antisera to [Leu]enkephalin (residues 1-5) were also utilized. Dynorphin was found to be widely distributed throughout the neuraxis. Immunoreactive neuronal perikarya exist in hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei, periaqueductal gray, scattered reticular formation sites, and other brain stem nuclei, as well as in spinal cord. Additionally, dynorphin-positive fibers or terminals occur in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, many brain stem sites, and the spinal cord. In many areas studied, dynorphin and enkephalin appeared to form parallel but probably separate anatomical systems. The results suggest that dynorphin occurs in neuronal systems that are immunocytochemically distinct from those containing other opioid peptides.
6138125	The anatomical distribution of neuronal perikarya and nerve fibres containing FMRF-amide-like immunoreactivity in the brain, spinal cord and pituitary of the rat has been studied by immunohistochemistry. In animals pretreated with colchicine, the highest concentration of nerve cell bodies occurred in hypothalamic nuclei. Cells were also present in the cortex, striatum, septum, thalamus and in the brainstem. Beaded nerve fibres were abundant in the septum, nucleus of the striae terminalis, hypothalamus, medial regions of the thalamus, the parabrachial nucleus, the ventrolateral medulla, the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Fibres were also present in the cortex, striatum, amygdala, pons, ventral spinal cord and the neural lobe of the pituitary. The localization was specific in that preabsorbtion of the antisera with FMRF-amide, but not structurally related molecules such as Met-Enk-Arg6Phe7, APP or BPP, completely abolished the localization. The mammalian counterparts of FMRF-amide may have a neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory role.
6139495	The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and its analog gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide citrate (DN-1417) on adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) levels in rat brain were investigated using a radioimmunoassay method. The time course of elevation of these nucleotides in various brain regions after administration of DN-1417 showed a peak at 5 to 15 min followed by a gradual decrease. DN-1417 (1 to 10 mg/kg i.p.) caused a dose-related increase in cyclic AMP levels in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus and brain stem; whereas significant increases in cyclic GMP were observed in the cerebellum, nucleus accumbens and brain stem. TRH (3 to 10 mg/kg i.p.) caused significant increases of cyclic AMP in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and brain stem and also caused an increase in cerebellar cyclic GMP. With one exception, DN-1417, apomorphine (Apo), methamphetamine (MAP) (all, 3 mg/kg i.p.)- and TRH (10 mg/kg i.p.)-induced increases in cyclic nucleotides were blocked by pimozide (1 mg/kg i.p., 4 hr before), a dopamine receptor blocker; the exception was a TRH-induced increase in cerebellar cyclic GMP. These increases were not blocked by propranolol (10 mg/kg i.p., 30 min before), an adrenergic beta-receptor blocker. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT, 250 mg/kg i.p., 4 hr before), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, almost completely blocked DN-1417- and MAP-induced increases in cyclic nucleotides, slightly blocked TRH-effects, and had no effect on Apo-effects. These in vivo results were confirmed in an in vitro system using brain slices. The addition of DN-1417 (10(-4) M) or TRH (10(-3) M) significantly enhanced the spontaneous [3H]-dopamine and [3H]-norepinephrine release from the superfused slices of the rat nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex in vitro. The addition of DN-1417 (10(-4) M) or TRH (10(-4) M) had no effect on the activities of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase, although only a high concentration (10(-3) M) of DN-1417 inhibited the cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-hydrolytic activities in various brain region homogenates. These results suggest that DN-1417 does not produce an increase in the levels of cyclic nucleotides by direct receptor-enzyme activation, but that DN-1417 like MAP causes the increase through endogenous catecholaminergic, particularly dopaminergic activation.
6148028	Antibodies to the neuropeptides somatostatin (SOM) and neurotensin were used to study the distribution of the two peptides within the septum of the rat brain. In colchicine treated rats, numerous somatostatin-positive cell bodies were found in the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the lateral septum, along the border of the nucleus accumbens, in the ventral tip of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca as well as in the anterior hippocampal rudiment, infralimbic area and several other structures of the basal forebrain (e.g., nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and substantia innominata). Cell bodies containing immunoreactivity for neurotensin were situated in the intermediate and ventral subdivisions of the lateral septum, the medial septal nucleus, the diagonal band of Broca, the rostro-medial continuation of the substantia innominata and the olfactory tubercle. In untreated rats, somatostatin positive processes formed terminal plexuses in the medial septal nucleus and along an area close to the ventricular wall of the lateral septal nucleus. Other septal nuclei, such as the diagonal band of Broca contained a sparse innervation by somatostatin positive fibers. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and the substantia innominata contained a rich innervation by somatostatin positive axons and terminals. Within these structures the density of SOM positive processes show great variations with patches of densely packed terminals separated by areas of sparser or no innervation. The neurotensin positive terminals were situated predominantly within the intermediate part of the lateral septum and the medial septal nucleus. Both of these regions contained numerous pericellular baskets of neurotensin positive terminals around septal neurons. In addition to the septal innervation, several of the basal forebrain structures were rich in neurotensin positive processes with the densest innervation found in the nucleus accumbens and substantia innominata. Like the SOM-immunoreactivity distinct islands of dense neurotensin innervation separated by less or no innervation occur throughout the basal forebrain. Taken together, these findings suggest that somatostatin and neurotensin occur in separate neuronal populations and that each may influence important physiological functions within the individual septal nuclei.
6150049	Antisera were raised against gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glutamate (Glu) conjugated to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. After purification, these antisera reacted strongly with fixed GABA or Glu, but not significantly with other amino acids fixed with glutaraldehyde to brain macromolecules. The antisera were used to demonstrate the distributions of Glu-like and GABA-like immunoreactivities (Glu-LI and GABA-LI) in parts of the perfusion-fixed mouse and rat brain, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral neocortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, lower brain stem, and cerebellum. The level of GABA-LI varied widely among brain regions, thus it was very high in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and low in the bulk of the thalamus. The GABA antisera labeled nonpyramidal neurons of the neocortex, most cells of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, medium-sized cells of the caudatoputamen, and stellate, basket, Golgi, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. The distribution of GABA-LI closely matched that of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), as revealed in immunocytochemical studies by others. However, the GABA antisera seem to be better suited than GAD antisera for demonstrating putative GABA-ergic axons. The results suggest that GABA-LI, as displayed by the present method, is a good marker of neurons thought to use GABA as a transmitter. Glutamate-like immunoreactivity was much more evenly distributed among regions than GABA-LI, but was particularly low in globus pallidus and substantia nigra and high in the cerebral cortex. Mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal neocortical cells, and other cells assumed to use Glu or aspartate as transmitter were stained for Glu-LI, but so also were neurons that are thought to use other transmitters, such as cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and in the brain stem motor nuclei. The Glu antisera seem to reveal the "transmitter pool" as well as the "metabolic pool" of Glu in perfusion-fixed material. This report shows that it is possible by means of immunocytochemistry to display reliably the tissue contents of GABA and Glu in material that has been fixed by perfusion with glutaraldehyde.
6153919	The neuroanatomical organization of the efferent connections of the septal area in the cat was analyzed by the use of anterograde ([3H]leucine radioautography) and retrograde (horseradish peroxidase histochemistry) tracing techniques. The results indicate that the lateral septal nucleus projects to the nuclei of the diagonal band, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, and supramammillary region. The projections of the septofimbrial nucleus supply the nuclei of the diagonal band and the medial habenular nucleus. Projection targets of the vertical limb of the diagonal band are widespread and include the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, anterior limbic cortex, amygdala, medial habenular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus and hippocampal formation. The projection from the vertical limb to the hippocampal formation is organized in a topographical manner in such a fashion that cells positioned near the midline project to the dorsal hippocampus and adjoining subicular cortex while fibers originating from cells situated more laterally project to more ventral parts of the hippocampal formation. In general, the projections from the horizontal limb were similar to those from the vertical limb, but several differences were noted. Fibers arising from the horizontal limb are distributed to the ventral tegmental area and interpeduncular nucleus but this region seems to lack a projection to either the habenular complex or to the ventral aspect of the hippocampal formation. Fibers arising from the bed nucleus of the anterior commissure are distributed to the preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, supramammillary region, posterior aspect of the medial mammillary nucleus and lateral habenular nucleus.
6157310	1. In this study, rhesus monkeys were given daly high doses of chlorpromazine (up to 40 mg/kg orally) or haloperidol (up to 1 mg/kg orally) for up to 17 months. After sacrifice the brains were analyzed for regional concentrations of DA, HVA, 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and NE. 2. The most prominent effects of this long-term administration of neuroleptics were (a) a widespread elevation of NE levels in the forebrain, including the hypothalamus, thalamus, olfactory area, and nucleus accumbens; (b) a decrease of 5-HT turnover (calculated from the ratio "5-HT/5-HIAA") in several limbic forebrain areas, including the amygdaloid nucleus, septum, and nucleus accumbens as well as thalamus; and (c) a mild but consistent increase of HVA concentration in all DA-containing forebrain regions; in the striatum, this effect was found in the CPZ but not the HAL group. 3. The possible involvement of these neurochemical changes in the clinical actions of neuroleptics characteristically requiring long-term medication, such as the production of persistent (tardive) dyskinesias as well as the antipsychotic effect, is discussed.
6164450	Multiple retrograde fluorescent tracing was employed to investigate the organization of the rat entopeduncular nucleus projections to the lateral habenula, ventral anterior-ventral lateral thalamus, parafasicular-centre median complex, and tegmenti pedunculopontis area of the brain stem. The results indicate that neurons in the rostral 2/3 of the entopeduncular nucleus project to the lateral habenula. In contrast, neurons in the caudal 1/3 of the entopeduncular nucleus project to the ventral anterior-ventral lateral thalamus, parafasicular-centre median complex, and tegmenti pedunculopontis area of the brain stem. The majority of neurons in the caudal 1/3 of the entopeduncular nucleus are retrogradely double-labeled from various combinations of tracer injections into the 3 termination areas to which they projected. Little or no retrograde labeling in the entopeduncular nucleus was produced by tracer injections in the substantia nigra or subthalamic nucleus. Only large injections of tracers in the tegmenti pedunculopontis are and the surrounding brain stem produced retrograde labeling in the entopeduncular nucleus. These brain stem injections also labeled a band of cells surrounding the entopeduncular nucleus in the zona incerta, lateral hypothalamus, of the ansa lenticularis and central nucleus of the amygdala. [3H]Leucine injections in the head of the caudate-putamen complex (but not in the cortex or globus pallidus) produced dense accumulations of silver grains over both the rostral and caudal portions of the entopeduncular nucleus. [3H]Leucine injections in the caudal body of the caudate-putamen complex produced accumulations of silver grains over a "ventral entopeduncular nucleus area' in the nucleus of the ansa peduncularis. It was suggested that the head of the striatum projects both to the neurons of the rostral "limbic' portion of the entopeduncular nucleus, which project to the lateral habenula, and to the neurons of the caudal "motor' portion of the entopeduncular nucleus, which project primarily by way of axon collaterals to the ventral anterior-ventral lateral thalamus, parafascicular-centre median complex, and tegmenti pedunculopontis area of the brain stem.
6164704	To elucidate the anatomical relationships between the frontal association cortex and the limbic system in primates, projections from the amygdala to frontal cortex were studied in the rhesus monkey using retrograde and anterograde tracing methods. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the orbital prefrontal cortex, the gyrus rectus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus of the frontal lobe, labeled neurons were found in the basolateral, basomedial, or basal accessory nuclei of the amygdala. None of these nuclei contained labeled neurons following HRP injections into the principal sulcus or the lateral inferior convexity of the frontal lobe. This selective distribution of amygdala connections was confirmed by injection tritiated amino acids into the amygdala. Silver grains were present only over the orbital cortex and gyrus rectus on the ventral surface of the frontal lobe and over the superior prefrontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus on the medial wall of the hemisphere, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was free of radioactivity. The isotope injection of the amygdala also revealed a projection to the magnocellular moiety of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDmc) which is known to innervate the same ventromedial regions of the frontal lobe that receive direct connections from the amygdala. Although MDmc and amygdala project to the same cortical regions, their terminal fields are different. The direct amygdala input terminates in layer 1 in orbital cortex and gyrus rectus and layer 2 in the dorsomedial cortex and cingulate gyrus, while the thalamic input is primarily to layer 3 and, in some areas, also the superficial half of layer 1. These findings indicate that the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys can be subdivided into two separable cortical regions: 1) A ventromedial region including the anterior cingulate gyrus which receives both direct (amygdalo-cortical) and indirect (amygdalo-thalamo-cortical) input from the amygdala; and 2) a dorsolateral frontal region which is essentially devoid of either direct or indirect amygdalofugal axons. On the basis of its selective relationship with the amygdala, the ventromedial region may be considered the "limbic" portion of the frontal association cortex.
6165607	Efferent cortical connections of the cingulate gyrus are investigated in rhesus monkey using autoradiographic technique. The results indicate that the rostralmost part of the cingulate gyrus (area 32) sends projections to the lateral prefrontal and midorbitofrontal cortex and to the rostral portion of the superior temporal gyrus. In contrast, the other two major subdivisions of the cingulate gyrus, areas 24 and 23, have widespread connections within the cortex. Area 24, for example, projects to the premotor region (areas 6 and 8), the fronto-orbital cortex (area 12), the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule, the anterior insular cortex, the perirhinal area and the laterobasal nucleus of amygdala. Area 23, likewise, sends its connections to the dorsal prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10), the rostral orbital cortex (area 11), the parieto-temporal cortex (posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and the superior temporal sulcus), the parahippocampal gyrus (areas TH and TF), the retrosplenial region and the presubiculum. It seems that the connections of the rostralmost part of the cingulate gyrus resemble the efferent cortical connectional patterns described for lateral prefrontal and orbito-frontal cortex, whereas the projections of areas 24 and 23 are directed to the neocortical, the paralimbic and the limbic areas.
6171630	The efferent connections of the central nucleus of the monkey amygdala have been studied using the autoradiographic method for tracing axonal projections. Small injections of 3H-amino-acids which are largely confined to the central nucleus lead to the labeling of several brainstem nuclei as far caudally as the spinomedullary junction. Specifically, in the forebrain, the central nucleus projects heavily to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the basal nucleus of Meynert, the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, and more lightly to the substantia innominata and the preoptic area. In the hypothalamus, label is found over the dorsomedial nucleus, the perifornical region, the lateral hypothalamus, the supramammillary area, and most heavily in the paramammillary nucleus. In the thalamus, all components of the nucleus centralis medialis and the nucleus reuniens receive fibers from the central nucleus and there is a light projection to the medial pulvinar nucleus. In the mesencephalon, there is heavy labeling dorsal to the substantia nigra ad over the peripeduncular nucleus and lighter labeling within the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area; the midbrain central gray is also labeled. More caudally, fibers from the central nucleus travel in the lateral tegmental reticular fields and contribute collaterals to the raphe nuclei, the cuneiform nucleus, and the central gray substance. Perhaps one of the heaviest terminal zones is the parabrachial region of the pons, both the lateral and the medial nuclei of which receive a prominent central nucleus projection. Only the ventral aspect of the adjacent locus coeruleus appears to receive a substantial input, but there is labeling also over the area of the nucleus subcoeruleus. Finally, there is heavy labeling around the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and over the parvocellular component of the nucleus of the solitary tract. A number of intra-amygdaloid connections between the basal and lateral nuclei of the amygdala and the central nucleus are also described. The present findings, taken together with recently reported widespread projections from the temporal association cortex to the amygdala, point out a potentially trisynaptic route between neocortical association regions and a variety of brainstem nuclei, many of which are related to autonomic function.
6173104	Afferent connections to the lateral hypothalamic region in the rat were studied using horseradish peroxidase (HRP). HRP was injected iontophoretically by a parapharyngeal approach. After HRP injections into the lateral hypothalamic area, labeled cells were found mainly in the medial prefrontal and infralimbic cortices, lateral and dorsal septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and lateral amygdaloid nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, peripeduncular nucleus, ventral tegmental area, mesencephalic and pontine central gray, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, lateral parabrachial area, raphe nuclei and the nucleus locus coeruleus. Labeled cells following HRP injections into the lateral preoptic area were found mainly in the lateral and dorsal septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, diagonal band, ventral part of the globus pallidus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central amygdaloid nucleus, mesencephalic and pontine central gray, dorsal raphe nucleus, parabrachial area and the nucleus locus coeruleus. The intrahypothalamic connections were also discussed.
6181103	Spinocerebellar tract (SCT) neurons projecting to lobules III to V of the cerebellar anterior lobe were identified by the retrograde horseradish peroxidase technique. SCT neurons projecting to lobule III with crossed ascending axons were located mainly in the central cervical nucleus (CCN), the medial part of lamina VII of L6 to the caudal segments, and the dorsal horn (lamina V) and ventral horn (lamina VIII) of the sacral-caudal segments. Spinal border cells with crossed ascending axons also projected to lobule III. SCT neurons projecting to this lobule with uncrossed ascending axons were located in the medial part of lamina VI of the cervical segments and the middle part of lamina VII of C6 to T1, lamina V of the lower cervical, thoracic and the lumbar segments, Clarke's column including marginal neurons, and the medial part of lamina VI of L5 and L6. These neuronal groups also projected to lobule IV, except for those present caudal to L6 (in the medial part of lamina VII, and laminae V and VIII of the sacral-caudal segments). A far smaller number of similar neurons projected to lobule V. Injections of HRP restricted to the vermal region labeled mainly neurons in the CCN and Clarke's column while restricted injections to the intermediate-lateral regions labeled ipsilaterally spinal border cells, lamina V neurons, and Clarke column neurons, especially of the lumbar segments as well as marginal neurons of this column.
6181986	Effects of three consecutive days injections of thyroxine (T4) of different doses (1, 2 and 4 micrograms/g of body weight) on different parts of the brain of Singi fish were studied. T4 enhanced the cranio-somatic index and the weight of different substructures of brain, viz., cerebrum, cerebellum midbrain and medulla oblongata, of Singi fish at 25 degrees C. Compared to the control, the protein content of cerebrum increased with all doses of T4 (1, 2 and 4 micrograms/g) and the RNA content of this region increased only with higher doses (2 and 4 micrograms/g). Cerebellum appeared to be relatively less responsive than cerebrum; T4 at the dose of 4 micrograms/g was only effective in increasing the protein content of the cerebellum, although the RNA content of this region was enhanced with both 2 and 4 micrograms of T4 per g. In midbrain and medulla oblongata, the protein content was elevated only with higher doses (2 and 4 micrograms/g) and RNA content was enhanced with all doses of T4 used. T4 injections did not cause any alteration of the DNA content of cerebrum and cerebellum, but in midbrain this cellular constituent increased in amount with all doses of T4 and in medulla oblongata it was increased with the dose of 2 or 4 micrograms of T4 per g body weight.
6182963	The origins and acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) content of neurons projecting to the AChE-rich basolateral amygdala were studied by infusing Evans Blue (EB), a retrogradely transported fluorescent label, into that neural region and, following microscopic evaluation of labelled somata, staining the same tissue sections for AChE according to the pharmacohistochemical regimen. The following basal forebrain areas contained cells labelled with EB: the lateral preoptic area, ventral pallidum, nuclei of the diagonal band, medial septal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and substantia innominata. The majority of the basal forebrain neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdala stained intensely for AChE, suggesting that they were cholinergic. In the brainstem, EB-labelled neurons staining intensely for AChE were found less frequently, but a few were observed in the nucleus tegmenti pendunculopontis, locus ceruleus, subcerulear region, and reticular formation. Cells accumulating EB after basolateral amygdala infusion but demonstrating no, weak, or moderate AChE activity were seen in the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, temporal, and insular cortices; the mediodorsal, paraventricular, and parataenial nuclei of the thalamus; the periventricular gray substance; the ventromedial mesencephalic tegmentum; the lateral and compact portions of the substantia nigra; the dorsal raphe; the dorsal tegmental nucleus; and the dorsal parabrachial nucleus. On the basis of staining intensity, intracellular organization of the AChE reaction product, and previous results in the literature, we conclude that the major cholinergic input to the basolateral amygdala derives from the basal forebrain.
6189023	Cells of origin of the descending afferents to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) were examined following iontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). HRP-positive neurons were found ipsilaterally and mainly in the following structures: the infralimbic cortex (area 25), septal area including the nucleus of the diagonal band, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, medial and lateral preoptic areas, preoptic magnocellular nucleus, substantia innominata, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central amygdaloid nucleus. Of these, neurons of the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, preoptic magnocellular nucleus and substantia innominata were preferentially labeled when the enzyme was deposited in the lateral part of the LHA.
6192157	The distribution of immunoreactive substance P (sP)-containing structures in the newt brain and spinal cord was explored with an indirect immunofluorescence method. Five sP-positive elements were detected: perikarya, dots, fibers, pericellular appositions, and pipe-shaped structures. Perikarya were seen at the levels of the spinal ganglia, spinal cord, raphe nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, mesencephalon, preoptic area, infundibulum, dorsocaudal part of the ventral hypothalamus, habenula, and corpus striatum. Pericellular terminals were observed in periventricular areas, known to be rich in catecholaminergic cells; pipe-shaped structures were observed from the corpus striatum to diencephalon, and in mesencephalon. The olfactory nerve and nuclei were devoid of sP-positive elements. Six sP-immunofluorescent pathways were detected. One of them is composed of axons with huge varicosities and extends from the lateral spinal cord area to the mesencephalon. This pathway has not been described as yet in other animals and could be peculiar to the newt.
6194854	During the course of a larger study of the afferent and efferent connections of the entorhinal cortex in the macaque monkey we have found evidence for a hitherto undescribed projection to the entorhinal cortex from the superior temporal gyrus. The evidence is derived principally from experiments in which small volumes of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were injected into different parts of the entorhinal cortex, but has been confirmed by 3H-amino acid autoradiography. After WGA-HRP injections into the entorhinal cortex, retrogradely labeled neurons have been seen mainly in layer III, but also to some extent in layer VI, throughout much of the superior temporal gyrus. The projection appears to be topographically organized in the sense that the ventral insular cortex and the adjoining temporal operculum have been found to project to the periamygdaloid cortex and the lateral division of the entorhinal cortex; the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus and the cortex along the dorsal bank of the superior temporal gyrus project further caudally to the medial division of the entorhinal cortex; and the cortex surrounding the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus projects to the perirhinal cortex. Following an injection of 3H-amino acids into the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus, terminal labeling has been seen over layers I and II of the entorhinal cortex and over layer I in the most lateral portion of the presubiculum. While the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in our WGA-HRP experiments encompasses several cytoarchitectonically distinguishable areas in the superior temporal gyrus, the most heavily labeled field appears to coincide with what Gross and his colleagues have termed the 'superior temporal polysensory area' on the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus.
6196645	Using crude synaptosomal fractions (P2 fractions) and 125I-Bolton and Hunter substance P (125I-BHSP) as a ligand, the characteristics of specific binding sites were examined in various brain structures and in the spinal cord (dorsal and ventral parts) of the rat. Scatchard plots revealed the occurrence of a single class of binding sites in the various structures studied with comparable Kd values (from 0.46 to 1.10 nmol/l in the brain and 0.51, 0.56 nmol/l in the spinal cord dorsal and ventral parts respectively) and of marked differences in the number of binding sites (Bmax) (septum greater than striatum greater than hippocampus, hypothalamus greater than mesencephalon greater than cerebral cortex and dorsal part of the spinal cord greater than ventral part). In the brain no correlation was found between the number of 125I-BHSP binding sites and the amount of substance P levels (substance P-like immunoreactivity) in synaptosomes, particularly in the hippocampus and the substantia nigra since the former structure was characterized by its low substance P content and its high number of binding sites and the reverse was observed in the substantia nigra. The ability of several C- and N-terminal fragments of substance P and of tachykinins to compete with 125I-BHSP binding to synaptosomes from the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and the dorsal part of the spinal cord was then determined. Results obtained were closely similar from one structure to another and comparable to those previously reported using whole brain synaptosomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
6199226	Afferent fibers to the rat cingulate cortex were studied by the retrograde labeling technique using horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin conjugate as the tracer. The results showed that the posterior cingulate cortex, but not the anterior, received input from the anterior dorsal and anterior ventral nuclei of the anterior thalamic group of nuclei (part of the so-called limbic thalamus), and from the subicular complex. The anterior cingulate cortex, but not the posterior, received input from the mediodorsal and ventral thalamic nuclei. Both posterior and anterior cingulate cortex received input from the hippocampus pars anterior; claustrum; globus pallidus; nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (a particularly reliable source of afferent fibers); anterior medial, lateral, rhomboid, and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus; region of the medial forebrain bundle; periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; the dorsal and median raphe; and the locus ceruleus. Corticocortical projections were seen anterior, posterior, and lateral to the injection site, and in the homologous contralateral cingulate cortex. The results demonstrate a prominent source of cingulate afferent fibers from the subicular complex, provide evidence for a functional division of anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in the rat, and provide information about the relative anatomic importance of cingulate afferent fibers from those different regions.
6199464	Five neuropeptides (cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SRIF), neurotensin (NT) and substance P (SP)) were measured in 14 brain areas (4 cortical areas, hippocampus, amygdala, 3 striatal areas, 2 thalamic areas and 3 subcortical areas-- septum, substantia innominata and hypothalamus) in 12 brains with neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer type change and in 13 control brains. Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was assessed in 6 of these areas. Levels of SRIF, but not those of the other peptides, were reduced in several cortical areas in Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). The distribution and magnitude of the reduction in SRIF were less than that of CAT activity and the temporal cortex was the only region in which there was a significant relationship between CAT and SRIF deficits. Peptide levels were unchanged in hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and striatum (except for an increase in SP in the putamen). SRIF levels were increased in substantia innominata in ATD. NT and SRIF were significantly, and VIP and SP non-significantly, reduced in the septum in ATD. Thus, apart from these alterations in the septum, SRIF was the only neuropeptide for which major changes were identified and these did not follow either the pattern of neuropathological change (e.g. in amygdala and hippocampus) or of CAT deficits (e.g. in substantia innominata).
6199701	Analysis of indole amine metabolism within acute (Walker 256 carcinosarcoma) and chronic (methycholanthrene-induced sarcoma) animal models of cancer anorexia demonstrated elevated levels of plasma free tryptophan, whole brain tryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in anorectic tumor-bearing rats. Whole brain levels of catecholamines were not changed within either tumor line. Regional central nervous system determination of tryptophan metabolism in rats bearing Walker 256 tumors revealed elevated tryptophan in the hypothalamus, corpus striatum, mesencephalon, diencephalon, cerebellum and cortex, increased serotonin in the diencephalon and cerebellum and elevated 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the diencephalon, hippocampus, pons-medulla, cerebellum and cortex. Although tryptophan was significantly increased only in the corpus striatum and diencephalon of the more chronic methycholanthrene tumor model, serotonin concentration was elevated in the corpus striatum, diencephalon, hippocampus, pons-medulla, cerebellum and cortex, while levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were significantly increased in all these areas as well as in the mesencephalon. Since similar changes in indole activity were not observed in pair-fed control rats, it is concluded that the elevated serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in tumor-bearing rats did not result from undernutrition alone. Assay of regional catecholamines revealed few food-relevant changes, with norepinephrine being elevated in the corpus striatum and decreased in the pons-medulla of tumor-bearing rats. Therefore, these experiments suggest that the increased serotonin metabolism observed in tumor-bearing rats may be involved in the etiology of the anorexia of cancer.
6203617	The amount of substance P immunoreactivity (SPI) was measured by radioimmunoassay from the cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and hippocampus from autopsy brains. The whole material consisted of 42 parkinsonian patients and 31 controls. The amount of SPI was significantly decreased in the substantia nigra of the parkinsonian brain. There was also a significant decrease of SPI in the putamen of those parkinsonian patients, who had not received levoDOPA treatment. The levels of SPI in the other brain regions studied did not show any difference between parkinsonian patients and controls. The results obtained suggest that substance P (SP) may have a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.
6204013	Noradrenaline (NA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine, DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured in 22 regions of postmortem brains from four histologically verified cases with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) and nine histologically normal controls. Compared with the controls, concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the ATD brains were significantly reduced in nine regions (superior frontal gyrus, insula, cingulate gyrus, amygdala, putamen, medial and lateral segments of globus pallidus, substantia nigra, lateral nucleus of thalamus) and in eight regions (amygdala, substantia innominata, caudate, putamen, medial and lateral segments of globus pallidus, medial and lateral nuclei of thalamus), respectively. NA concentrations of the ATD brains were significantly reduced in six regions (cingulate gyrus, substantia innominata, putamen, hypothalamus, medial nucleus of thalamus, raphe area). In contrast, significant reductions of DA and HVA concentrations in the ATD brains were found only in putamen and amygdala, respectively. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the ATD brains decreased significantly in locus coeruleus, while the HVA/DA ratio increased significantly in putamen and medial segment of globus pallidus. These findings suggest that the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems are affected, while the dopaminergic system is relatively unaffected in ATD brains.
6208970	The terminal areas and cells of origin of the projection from the dorsal column nuclei to the mesencephalon were investigated by the intra-axonal transport method. Following injection of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate into the dorsal column nuclei, anterograde labeling was observed in several regions of the midbrain. The main terminal area was situated at the level of transition between the superior and inferior colliculus on the side contralateral to the injection site and comprised the intercollicular nucleus and part of the external and pericentral nuclei of the inferior colliculus and of the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, but there were also projections to the caudal half of the deep and intermediate gray layers of the superior colliculus, the anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and nucleus ruber. Injections restricted to either the gracile nucleus or the cuneate nucleus revealed a somatotopic termination pattern in the intercollicular nucleus, superior colliculus and pretectal nuclei. The retrograde labeling seen after injection of tracer into the midbrain terminal areas showed that the cells of origin were located mainly in the rostral and caudal parts of the dorsal column nuclei, whereas the middle cell nest neurons were unlabeled, thus supporting previous observations that the neurons projecting to the midbrain constitute a population separate from that projecting to the thalamus. Cell counts revealed that the midbrain projection is of a considerable magnitude, involving between 10,000 and 15,000 neurons; its functional significance is, however, largely unknown.
6247008	Discrete localization of enkephalin immunoreactive sites in the rat forebrain was undertaken using animals with and without colchicine pretreatment. Both the immunofluorescence and unlabeled PAP antibody techniques were employed using antisera directed against methionine-enkephalin. We have found several areas of enkephalin fiber and cell localizations not previously described, as well as confirming the results of other researchers. Thus, we found large amounts of perikaryal enkephalin immunoreactivity in the lateral septal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the preoptic nuclei, the ventral premammillary nucleus, prelateral mammillary nucleus, the medial mammillary nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, the periventricular, ventromedial, dorsomedial and posterior nuclei of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, and the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body. High concentrations of immunoreactive neuronal fibers not immediately associated with enkephalin perikarya were seen in the nucleus accumbens, medial forebrain bundle, globus pallidus, mammillothalamic tract, the subthalamic nucleus, and the caudal portion of the zona incerta. Many of the areas presented in this study correspond with areas known to exert some regulation over neuroendocrine function as well as various motor and sensory functions. Nuclei with high immunoreactive fiber content also correspond in many instances with areas reported to have high concentrations of opiate receptors. Possible enkephalin-containing tracts and the relationships of enkephalin-containing cells in fiber bundles are also pointed out.
6256036	L-[3H]Glutamate exhibited specific binding to fresh membranes of cat CNS under physiological conditions of pH and temperature. This binding occurred in the absence of sodium ions. Kinetic analysis of the data for cerebellum suggested the presence of two distinct binding sites: a high-affinity process (Kd = 0.33 microM) with a capacity of 15 pmol/mg protein and a low-affinity process (Kd = 1.8 microM) which had a capacity of 65 pmol/mg protein. Several structural analogues of glutamic acid were able to appreciably inhibit the binding of [3H]glutamate. The distribution of glutamate binding between 12 regions of the CNS was measured. The amygdaloid complex exhibited the highest binding followed by hippocampus > hypothalamus identical to visual cortex identical to thalamus identical to caudate nucleus > olfactory bulb identical to tectum identical to cerebellum > dorsal pons identical to medulla > cervical spinal cord. These findings are consistent with the binding of [3H]glutamate being to its receptor.
6264046	Kininase activity, which inactivates kinins, was measured in seven regions of the rat brain (i.e., the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata), and in the spinal cord with a bioassay method using bradykinin as the substrate. Specific kininase activities in the cerebellum and striatum were higher than those in the other five regions or the spinal cord. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, which was measured fluorometrically using Hip-His-Leu as substrate, showed high activity in the striatum and cerebellum. These findings suggest that the presence of high concentrations of peptidases plays a role in the degradation of kinins and/or other peptides in these areas.
6265819	beta-Endorphin-containing neurons in the rat central nervous system were localized using three improvements of the unlabelled antibody-enzyme bridge immmunocytochemical technique. These improvements were (1) the use of brains from colchicine-treated rats; (2) the proteolytic pretreatment of sections with pronase, and (3) a 'double-bridge' staining procedure. In addition to the known localization of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in perikarya in the medial basal hypothalamus, we have observed nerve fibers and terminals with beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity to be more widely distributed than reported in previous studies. This includes discrete areas of the septal, preoptic, hypothalamic, thalamic and subthalamic regions, the amygdala, the periaqueductal gray, the inferior colliculus, the nucleus tegmenti pontis, the nucleus raphe dorsalis, several regions of the reticular formation, the locus ceruleus, the parabrachial nuclei, the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the solitary tract and the nucleus of the solitary tract. The distribution of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity is in good agreement with many of the physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral effects attributed to this peptide such as analgesia, the regulation of the release of pituitary hormones, thermoregulation and feeding behavior. This implicates beta-endorphin as an important neurotransmitter or modulator with specific functions within the central nervous system.
6274923	A series of neuroanatomical, biochemical, and histochemical studies have been conducted to determine the sources of cholinergic afferents to the main olfactory bulb (MOB) in the hamster. Following horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections that are restricted to the MOB, retrograde neuronal labeling is observed bilaterally in the anterior olfactory nucleus, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei, and ipsilaterally in the ventral hippocampal rudiment, dorsal peduncular cortex, piriform cortex, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, anterior pole of the medial septal area and vertical limb of the diagonal band, nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB), and hypothalamus. Spread of HRP into the accessory olfactory bulb results in additional neuronal labeling ipsilaterally in the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, medial amygdaloid nucleus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and bilaterally in the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus. Retrograde tracing studies also have been conducted in cases with lesions in the basal forebrain or hypothalamus to assess the extent to which such lesions interrupt fibers of passage from other sources of centrifugal afferents, and the effects of such lesions on choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity and catecholamine content in the MOB and on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the forebrain have been evaluated. Lesions in the basal forebrain reduce or eliminate CAT and AChE activity in the MOB in direct relationship to the extent of damage to the HDB. Norepinephrine (NE) content in the MOB also is reduced by basal forebrain lesions, but in relationship to damage of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The hypothalamic lesions have no effect on AChE activity in the forebrain or on CAT activity in the MOB, but they eliminate retrograde labeling in the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei and reduce the NE content of the MOB to undetectable levels. The dopamine content of the MOB is not reduced by any of the lesions. Anterograde tracing studies have been conducted to compare the rostral projection patterns of the HDB with the distribution of AChE activity. Most of the rostrally directed axons travel in association with the MFB. A small component of axons travels in association with the lateral olfactory tract. Within the MOB, the axons terminate predominantly in the glomerular layer and in the vicinity of the internal plexiform layer. The projection and termination patterns of the HDB correspond well with the distribution of AChE activity. These various results indicate that the HDB is the major source of cholinergic afferents to the MOB.
6276509	Specific [3H]strychnine binding was used to identify the glycine receptor macromolecular complex in human spinal cord, substantia nigra, inferior olivary nucleus, and cerebral cortex. In material from control patients a high-affinity KD (3--8 nM) was observed in the spinal cord and the substantia nigra, both the pars compacta and the pars reticulata. This is very similar to the values observed in the rat and bovine spinal cord (8 and 3 nM, respectively) and rat substantia nigra (12 nM). In the human brain the distribution of [3H]strychnine binding (at 10 nM) was: spinal cord = substantia nigra, pars compacta greater than substantia nigra, pars reticulata = inferior olivary nucleus greater than cerebral cortex. The binding capacity (Bmax) of the rat brain (substantia nigra or spinal cord) was approximately 10-fold that of the human brain. [3H]Strychnine binding was significantly decreased in the substantia nigra from Parkinson's disease patients, both in the pars compacta (67% of control) and the pars reticulata (50% of control), but not in the inferior olivary nucleus. The results were reproduced in preliminary experiment in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. In the substantia nigra from patients who died with Huntington's disease, [3H]strychnine binding tended to be high (150% of control, NS) in both the pars compacta and the reticulata. [3H]Strychnine binding was unaltered in the substantia nigra of patients with senile dementia. Together with previous neurophysiological and neuropharmacological findings, those results support the hypothesis of glycine receptors occurring on dopamine cell bodies and/or dendrites in the substantia nigra.
6280100	By employing both in vivo and in vitro labeling techniques, opiate receptors were labeled with tritiated diprenorphine in the monkey brain and localized by light microscopic autoradiography. Both methods of labeling gave similar results, allowing a description of discrete areas having opiate binding sites. High concentrations of opiate receptors were found in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, lateral parabrachial nucleus, substantia grisea centralis, several nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus, substantia innominata and in the amygdala. In the monkey pituitary, receptors were found in the neurohypophysis. These results correlate well with those found in autoradiographic studies of the rat brain although there are a few notable differences. Many of the opiate receptor distributions can be correlated with anatomical loci of brain functions known to be influenced by administration of opiate compounds.
6290940	Localization of luteotrophic hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was examined by immunocytochemistry in untreated male rats and rats that received an anterior hypothalamic deafferentation. Gonadotrophic function was assessed by examining testicular weight and morphology. All of the antisera used in this study were able to reveal LHRH cell bodies and fibers. Cells from the medial preoptic area, (particularly the preoptic periventricular or median preoptic nuclei) and lateral anterior hypothalamus sent axons to the median eminence. The fiber tracts were loosely organized into (1) a tract that coursed through the organum vasculum of the lamina terminalis between the optic nerves and along the ventral surface of the optic chiasm; (2) a tract that coursed to the organum vasculum from the preoptic area and then traversed along the floor of the third ventricle; (3) a tract that coursed from the medial preoptic area to the median eminence along the lateral walls of the third ventricle; and (4) a tract that arose from the more caudal portions of the LHRH cell field in the lateral preoptic and lateral anterior hypothalamus, coursed along with the fibers of the medial forebrain bundle and turned medially at the caudal hypothalamus to enter the median eminence. An anterior cut which served most of the connections between the medial preoptic area and hypothalamus but did not penetrate through the optic chiasm served tract 3 and most of tracts 2 and 4, but spared the subchiasmatic projection (tract 1). The fibers that remained in the median eminence were sufficient to retain gonadotrophic function. This study provides an explanation for the variable effects of deafferentation and lesions of the anterior hypothalamus and preoptic area on gonadotrophic function.
6295045	There is an account of the basis neuronal connectivities of the spinal cord with the Sherringtonian principles of divergence and convergence. Neurones act synaptically either as excitatory or as inhibitory, depending on the specific transmitter substances liberated. Inhibitory neurones usually act either in a feedback or a feedforward manner. Voluntary movement is considered in relation to the instructions delivered to the motor cortex in order to produce the discharges down the pyramidal tract that evoke the required movement. There is an account of the three lines of evidence which indicate that in voluntary movements the primary neural event arises in discharges of neurones of the supplementary motor area (SMA). There are three main circuits from the SMA that activate subroutines concerned in the preprogramming of movements: (1) SMA to the basal ganglia, thence to the thalamus with a collateral line through the substantia nigra, thence to the association cortex; (2) SMA to cerebellar hemisphere via the pontine nuclei, thence to the nucleus dentatus, to the thalamus, to the association cortex, and (3) SMA to association cortex both frontal and parietal. According to the SMA hypothesis the liaison brain for intention is located in the SMA, there being reciprocity of informational flow from the mental events of intention to the neuronal events in the SMA.
6299756	Utilizing in vitro autoradiographic techniques, we have studied the distribution of high affinity [3H]kainic acid ([3H]KA) binding sites in intact sections of the rat forebrain. These sites have the same kinetic and pharmacological characteristics as the [3H]KA site described in tissue homogenates. Moderate to high levels of specific binding were observed in several discrete brain regions. These include lamina I, V and VI of the neo- and cingulate cortex, superficial layers of the pyriform cortex, striatum, external plexiform and granule cell layers of the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, the stratum lucidum of CA3 of the hippocampus, molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the hypothalamic median eminence, and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. Low levels of specific binding were associated with other discrete regions such as the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial geniculate, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, nuclei of the central grey, interpeduncular nucleus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Moderate uniform levels of specific binding were observed over the hypothalamus, zona incerta and the amygdala. One of the important factors in KA neurotoxicity seems to be the presence of KA receptors, and regions that are susceptible to the toxic effects of KA after local administration, such as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala and pyriform cortex, have moderate to high levels of binding. Thus, these data provide a useful map for studying the relationship between receptor-mediated and seizure-induced neuronal damage following KA administration.
6308502	Adult male rats had electrolytic lesions placed bilaterally in the medial forebrain bundle and were subsequently implanted with stimulating electrodes in one of the following limbic regions: (1) dorsal hippocampus; (2) ventral hippocampus; (3) medial septal nucleus; (4) basolateral amygdala; (5) mesencephalic reticular formation. Following electrical stimulation, blood was drawn by acute venesection, under either, for plasma corticosterone determinations. In non-lesioned animals, electrical stimulation in all of the limbic regions led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels. In rats with lesions in the medial forebrain bundles, the adrenocortical response to stimulation in the dorsal hippocampus, the basolateral amygdala or the reticular formation was markedly attenuated. On the contrary, the same lesions were without effect upon the corticosterone secretory response to medial septal stimulation, and had only a slight inhibitory effect upon the response to electrical stimulation in the ventral hippocampus. The results demonstrate that the medial forebrain bundle plays a major role in the transmission of impulses to the mediobasal hypothalamus, originating in the dorsal hippocampus, basolateral amygdala or mesencephalic reticular formation, which activate adrenocortical secretion; its role in the transmission of cues arising in the ventral hippocampus or medial septum is, however, minor.
6312371	The enkephalin-related heptapeptide, Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe, forms the C-terminus of a biosynthetic precursor that contains both Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin sequences. We have studied the distribution of heptapeptide-like immunoreactivity in rat brain by immunohistochemistry using a C-terminal specific antiserum. The results were compared with those obtained using an antiserum specific for the C-terminus of Met-enkephalin which does not react with C-terminally-extended variants. Both antisera specifically stained cell bodies and fibres in many regions of the rat central nervous system. Colchicine was needed for the demonstration of cell bodies with the Met-enkephalin antiserum, but not for the heptapeptide antiserum. In the nucleus of the solitary tract, in the commissural nucleus, the nucleus raphe obscurus and in the hypothalamus, studies of serial sections and re-staining experiments indicated that the two antisera stained the same cell bodies. However, in the olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, central nucleus of the amygdala, nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis, pre-lateral mamillary nuclei, ventral hypothalamus, hippocampus, peri-aqueductal grey and the granular layer of the cerebellum, cells were stained by the heptapeptide antiserum but not the Met-enkephalin antiserum. The two antisera revealed similar patterns of staining of nerve fibres in many regions including hypothalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral septum, thalamus, mid-brain and spinal cord. But in other areas notably, pallidum, caudate-putamen, substantia inominata, nucleus of the solitary tract and commissural nucleus, there were abundant fibres and terminals revealed by the Met-enkephalin antiserum but not by the heptapeptide antiserum. The results are discussed with respect to possible patterns of enkephalin biosynthesis; it is suggested that in some neurones immunoreactive enkephalin precursors terminating in the heptapeptide sequence are processed to produce the heptapeptide which is stored in terminals and is available for release as an endogenous opioid agonist in its own right. In other cases, however, it is suggested that the heptapeptide might be cleaved by removal of -Arg-Phe to yield Met-enkephalin which is the primary opioid product of this class of neurone.
6315152	The cellular origin and degree of collateralization of the pallidointralaminar and pallidonigral projections in squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) were studied using Evans blue (EB) and a mixture of DAPI-Primuline (DP) as fluorescent retrograde tracers. In a first series of experiments EB was injected into the VA/VL thalamic nuclei whereas DP was delivered into the CM/Pf complex. After these injections numerous EB-labeled cells were scattered throughout the central 'motor' zone of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), compared to a smaller number of DP-positive neurons forming two small but distinct clusters in central GPi. The majority of the neurons within these two clusters were double-labeled. In addition, EB-labeled cells were disclosed in the lateral two-thirds of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), whereas DP-positive neurons occurred in a wide variety of structures including the nucleus reticularis thalami, the SNr, the periaqueductal gray, the superior colliculus, the midbrain raphe nuclei, the pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) area (bilaterally), and the locus coeruleus. In a second series of experiments, EB was injected into the CM/Pf complex whereas DP was delivered into the TPP area of the midbrain tegmentum. After these injections two small clusters of EB-labeled cells and a larger number of more uniformly distributed DP-positive cells occurred in the core of GPi. The cell clusters were similar in size and location to those observed after VA/VL-CM/Pf injection, but contained only a minority of double-labeled neurons. The distribution of non-pallidal cells projecting to CM/Pf complex was similar to that reported above, whereas retrogradely labeled cells resulting from TPP injection were disclosed in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the central amygdaloid nucleus, the preoptico-hypothalamic complex, the lateral habenula, the ventral tegmental area, and the SNr where some double-labeled cells were present. In a third series of experiments DP alone was injected into the entire substantia nigra (SN), involving both pars compacta and pars reticulata. The SN injection produced retrograde cell labeling in numerous structures such as the striatum, the rostral intralaminar nuclei, the subthalamic nucleus, the TPP area (bilaterally), the dorsal raphe nucleus and the locus coeruleus. At pallidal levels, a moderate number of DP-labeled cells occurred within the dorsal half of the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), whereas the GPi was virtually devoid of labeled neurons. The GPi appeared nevertheless surrounded ventromedially by numerous large-sized DP-positive cells belonging to the substantia innominata.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6315779	The subcortical sources of afferents to occipital and parietal cortex were studied in two chimpanzees with the aid of retrogradely transported horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In chimpanzee 1, HRP was injected into right cortical areas 17 and 18; chimpanzee 2 received HRP into right areas 17, 18, 19, and 39. The following subcortical structures were found to project to area 17 and/or area 18: locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, nucleus annularis, nucleus centralis superior, pontine reticular formation, mesencephalic reticular formation, dorsal hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus basalis of Meynert, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, claustrum, nucleus basalis lateralis amygdalae, lateral geniculate nucleus, inferior pulvinar, lateral pulvinar, nucleus limitans, medial magnocellular part of the nucleus ventralis anterior, nucleus paracentralis, and nucleus centralis medialis thalami. Some of these structures may also project to area 19 and/or area 39. The following thalamic nuclei were found to project to area 19 and/or area 39 but not to areas 17 and 18: nucleus lateralis posterior, nucleus centralis lateralis, nucleus medialis dorsalis, nucleus ventralis lateralis, nucleus ventralis anterior nucleus lateralis dorsalis, and nucleus anterior ventralis. In several Instances, the HRP-labeled cells traversed specific nuclear borders, extending uninterruptedly from one classically defined nucleus into another. These results in the chimpanzee largely confirm data from a number of other mammalian taxa on the subcortical sources of afferents to the posterior cortex. Because of the close biological relationship between chimpanzee and man, we feel confident that such projections are also features of the human brain.
6324205	The 125I-labeled agonist analog [1-sarcosine]-angiotensin II ( [Sar1]AII) bound with high specificity and affinity (Ka = 2 X 10(9) M-1) to a single class of receptor sites in rat brain. This ligand was used to analyze the distribution of AII receptors in rat brain by in vitro autoradiography followed by computerized densitometry and color coding. A very high density of AII receptors was found in the subfornical organ, paraventricular and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, and area postrema. A high concentration of receptors was found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, lateral olfactory tracts, nuclei of the accessory and lateral olfactory tracts, triangular septal nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, locus coeruleus, and inferior olivary nuclei. Moderate receptor concentrations were found in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, medial habenular nucleus, lateral septum, ventroposterior thalamic nucleus, median eminence, medial geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, subiculum, pre- and parasubiculum, and spinal trigeminal tract. Low concentrations of sites were seen in caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and gray matter of the spinal cord. These studies have demonstrated that AII receptors are distributed in a highly characteristic anatomical pattern in the brain. The high concentrations of AII receptors at numerous physiologically relevant sites are consistent with the emerging evidence for multiple roles of AII as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system.
6324960	Using [3H]para-aminoclonidine, alpha 2 adrenergic binding sites have been mapped in the rat and human CNS using in vitro labeling autoradiographic techniques. In both the rat and human thoracic spinal cord, high densities of alpha 2 binding sites were associated with the substantia gelatinosa and the intermediolateral cell column. In the rat medulla, high binding site density was observed in the medial nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, raphe pallidus and the substantia gelatinosa of the trigeminal nucleus, while lower levels of specific binding were found in the lateral and ventrolateral medulla. In the human, a similar distribution was observed. However, significantly lower levels of specific binding were seen in the medial nts as opposed to the dmv. In the rat, high levels of specific binding were seen at pontine and midbrain levels in the locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus and periaqueductal gray. In the forebrain, several hypothalmic and limbic regions, including the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the central, medial and basal nuclei of the amygdala, lateral septum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and pyriform, entorhinal and insular cortex were labeled. Each of these regions are involved in either modulating autonomic functions directly or integrating somatosensory and/or affective function with autonomic mechanisms. Further, these regions are interrelated by reciprocal connections, and neurons that utilize noradrenaline or adrenaline as their neurotransmitter form a vital part of these connections. Thus, these functional, anatomical and neurochemical correlates of the alpha 2 binding site distribution establish a neurological basis for the complex pharmacological effects of centrally acting alpha 2 agonists.
6326001	The origins of projections within the medial forebrain bundle from the lower brainstem were examined with the horseradish peroxidase technique. Labeled cells were found in at least 15 lower brainstem nuclei following injections of a conjugate or horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin at various levels of the medial forebrain bundle. Dense labeling was observed in the following cell groups (from caudal to rostral): A1 (above the lateral reticular nucleus); A2 (mainly within the nucleus of the solitary tract); a distinct group of cell trailing ventrolaterally from the medial longitudinal fasciculus at the level of the rostral pole of the inferior olive; raphe magnus; nucleus incertus; dorsolateral tegmental nucleus (of Castaldi); locus coeruleus; nucleus subcoeruleus; caudal part of the dorsal (lateral) parabrachial nucleus; and raphe pontis. Distinct but light labeling was seen in raphe pallidus and obscurus, nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, nucleus gigantocellularis pars ventralis, and the ventral (medial) parabrachial nucleus. Sparse labeling was observed throughout the medullary and caudal pontine reticular formation. Several lower brainstem nuclei were found to send strong projections along the medial forebrain bundle to very anterior levels of the forebrain. They were: A1, A2, raphe magnus (rostral part), nucleus incertus, dorsolateral tegmental nucleus, raphe pontis and locus coeruleus. With the exception of the locus coeruleus, attention has only recently been directed to the ascending projections of most of the nuclei mentioned above. Evidence was reviewed indicating that fibers from lower brainstem nuclei with ascending medial forebrain bundle projections distribute to widespread regions of the forebrain. It is concluded from the present findings that several medullary cell groups are capable of exerting a direct effect on the forebrain and that the medial forebrain bundle is the major ascending link between the lower brainstem and the forebrain.
6326002	The origins of projections within the medial forebrain bundle from the upper brainstem were examined with the horseradish peroxidase technique. Labeled cells were found in approximately 15 upper brainstem nuclei following injections of a conjugate of horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin at various levels of the medial forebrain bundle. Labeled nuclei included (from caudal to rostral): dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei; Kolliker-Fuse nucleus; dorsolateral tegmental nucleus; A7 (lateral pontine tegmentum medial to lateral lemniscus); median and dorsal raphe nuclei; distinct group of cells oriented mediolaterally in the dorsal pontine tegmentum below the central gray; B9 (ventral midbrain tegmentum dorsal to medial lemniscus); retrorubral nucleus; nucleus of Darkschewitsch, interfascicular nucleus; rostral and caudal linear nuclei; ventral tegmental area; medial part of substantia nigra, pars compacta; and the supramammillary nucleus. With the exception of the ventral parabrachial nucleus, Kolliker-Fuse, A7, B9 and substantia nigra, pars compacta, each of the nuclei mentioned above sent strong projections along the medial forebrain bundle to the rostral forebrain. Sparse labeling was observed throughout the pontine and midbrain reticular formation. With the exception of the dorsal raphe nucleus, projections to the most anterior regions of the medial forebrain bundle (level of the anterior commissure) essentially only arose from presumed dopamine-containing nuclei-retrorubral nucleus (A8 area), interfascicular nucleus, rostral and caudal linear nuclei, substantia nigra pars compacta, and ventral tegmental area. Evidence was reviewed indicating that major forebrain sites of termination for these dopaminergic nuclei are structures that have been collectively referred to as the 'ventral striatum'. It is concluded from the present findings that several pontine and mesencephalic cell groups are in a position to exert a strong, direct effect on structures in the anterior forebrain and that the medial forebrain bundle is the main communication route between the upper brainstem and the forebrain.
6328530	Light microscopy autoradiography has been used to visualize neuroanatomical patterns of brain opiate receptor upregulation in response to chronic naltrexone administration. Slide-mounted brain sections of frozen rat brain were labeled in vitro with dihydro[3H]morphine, a relatively selective mu opioid ligand. The greatest relative increases in opiate receptor density were observed in the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, striatal patches, nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus, layers I and III of neocortex, substantia nigra compacta, midbrain periaqueductal gray regions, and the parabrachial nuclei of the brainstem. The substantia nigra reticulata, surrounding areas of striatal patches, and the locus ceruleus, were not affected by this drug treatment. These findings demonstrate that chronically administered naltrexone differentially regulates opiate receptors throughout the brain. In particular, three brain systems appear to be target areas of receptor upregulation : (i) the dopamine A9/A10 systems, (ii) the limbic system, and (iii) structures that receive input from afferent sensory pathways. Two possible mechanisms to account for this finding are (i) that the drug does not have uniform effects throughout the brain or (ii) that the receptors themselves may be associated with different functional systems. Receptor density changes are paralleled by increases in methionine-enkephalin content in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, periaqueductal gray, and hypothalamic areas of chronic naltrexone-treated rats relative to control rats. Thus opiate receptors and opioid peptides appear to be subject to regulatory mechanisms similar to those that modulate other neurotransmitters and their receptors. These results document in a visual manner brain patterns of opiate receptor upregulation .
6358277	The immunocytochemical distribution of [Leu]enkephalin and an adrenal enkephalin precursor fragment (BAM-22P) immunoreactivity was investigated in the diencephalon and brainstem of rats pretreated with relatively high doses of colchicine (300-400 micrograms/10 microliters intracerebroventricularly). The higher ranges of colchicine pretreatment allowed the visualization of extensive enkephalin-containing systems in these brain regions, some of which are reported for the first time. Immunoreactive perikarya were found in many hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, the colliculi, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nuclei, trigeminal motor and spinal nuclei, nucleus raphe magnus and other raphe nuclei, nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, vestibular nuclei, several noradrenergic cell groups, nucleus tractus solitarius, as well as in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In addition to the above regions, immunoreactive fibers were also noted in the habenular nuclei, trigeminal sensory nuclei, locus coeruleus, motor facial nucleus, cochlear nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and hypoglossal nucleus. When adjacent sections of those stained for [Leu]enkephalin were processed for BAM-22P immunoreactivity, it was found that these two immunoreactivities were distributed identically at almost all anatomical locations. BAM-22P immunoreactivity was generally less pronounced and ws preferentially localized to neuronal perikarya. The results of the present as well as the preceding studies (Khachaturian et al., '83) strongly suggest substantial structural similarity between the adrenal proenkephalin precursor and that which occurs in the brain. Also discussed are some differences and parallels between the distribution of [Leu]enkephalin and dynorphin immunoreactivities.
6362780	The topographical distribution of cholinergic cell bodies has been studied in the rat brain and spinal cord by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-pharmacohistochemistry using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). The ChAT-containing cells and the cells that stained intensely for AChE 4-8 hr after DFP were mapped in detail on an atlas of the forebrain (telencephalon, diencephalon) hindbrain (mesencephalon, rhombencephalon) and cervical cord (C2, C6). Striking similarities were observed between ChAT-positive cells and neuronal soma that stained intensely for AChE both in terms of cytoarchitectural characteristics, and with respect to the distribution of the labelled cells in many areas of the central nervous system (CNS). In the forebrain these areas include the caudatoputamen, nucleus accumbens, medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic nucleus and nucleus basalis magnocellularis. In contrast, a marked discrepancy was observed in the hypothalamus and ventral thalamus where there were many neurons that stained intensely for AChE, but where there was an absence of ChAT-positive cells. No cholinergic perikarya were detected in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and dorsal diencephalon by either histochemical procedure. In the hindbrain, all the motoneurons constituting the well-established cranial nerve nuclei (III-VII, IX-XII) contained ChAT and exhibited intense staining for AChE. Further, a close correspondence was observed in the distribution of labeled neurons obtained by the two histochemical procedures in the midbrain and pontine tegmentum, including the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, some areas in the caudal pontine and bulbar reticular formation, and the central gray of the closed medulla oblongata. On the other hand, AChE-intense cells were found in the nucleus raphe magnus, ventral part of gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and flocculus of the cerebellum, where ChAT-positive cells were rarely observed. According to both techniques, no positive cells were seen in the cerebellar nuclei, the pontine nuclei, or the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Large ventral horn motoneurons and, occasionally, cells in the intermediomedial zone of the cervical cord displayed ChAT-immunoreactivity and intense AChE staining. On the other hand, AChE-intense cells were detected in the dorsal portion of the lateral funiculus, but immunoreactive cells were not found in any portion of the spinal cord white matter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6365253	Met-enkephalin immunoreactivity was investigated with an indirect immunoperoxidase technique in the cervical spinal cord, brainstem and midbrain of the cat, paying special attention to pain-related nuclei. Different technical conditions were used to reveal preferentially met-enkephalin-containing fibres and terminals or perikarya. Immunoreactive fibres and terminals were revealed optimally in sections from control animals incubated with detergent (Triton X-100). Immunoreactive perikarya were revealed in colchicine treated animals. Comparison between different routes of administration showed that local injections of colchicine are needed to reveal optimally immunoreactive perikarya in nuclei located far from the ventricles. Met-enkephalin-containing fibres and terminals are widely distributed in the posterior brain and spinal cord. The densest network of immunoreactive fibers are observed in the superficial layers of the cervical spinal cord and the caudal trigeminal nucleus, in the nucleus of the solitary tract, the nucleus of the facial nerve, the nucleus of the prepositus hypoglossi, the nucleus raphe pallidus, the medial vestibular nucleus, the interpedoncular nucleus and the substantia nigra. A moderate staining of fibres is observed in various nuclei including the ventral horn of the spinal cord and caudal trigeminal nucleus, the brainstem and midbrain reticular formation, the inferior olivary complex, the nucleus of the descending trigeminal tract and the periaqueductal grey. Met-enkephalin-containing perikarya are present in all the nuclei cited before, except in the inferior olivary complex. The densest aggregation of enkephalin-like perikarya is observed in the nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe obscurus, nucleus raphe pallidus, nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars alpha and nucleus reticularis lateralis. The general distribution of enkephalin-containing structures in the cervical spinal cord, brainstem and midbrain of the cat appears very similar to that of the rat except in the substantia nigra where met-enkephalin cell bodies are found in the cat but not in the rat. In particular the pain-related nuclei present a similar distribution of the peptide in the two species; however, met-enkephalin-containing cell bodies are much more numerous in the cat than in the rat (notably in the reticular formation). Similar types of met-enkephalin innervation occur in the dorsal and intermediate grey of the spinal cord and of the caudal trigeminal nucleus supporting further that the functional organizations of these regions are closely related.
6371576	The authors have developed a method which makes it possible, for the first time, to visualize the delta sleep-inducing peptide in histological preparations and study it under the light and fluorescence microscope. Their research builds on Monnier 's discovery, in 1963, of a humoral hypnogenic factor in rabbits which was subsequently isolated and identified as a nonapeptide. Dubbed delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP), this factor was later detected in rat brain by radioimmunoassay but has eluded histological visualization until recently. In their work, the authors used an anti-DSIP antiserum suitable for immunohistological purposes. Two indirect immunohistological methods (PAP and immunofluorescence) allowed them to visualize, for the first time, structures containing specific DSIP-like immunoreactivity in some areas of the rat brain: indusium griseum, nucleus septi lateralis, hippocampus, striae longitudinales of Lancisi , bandeletta diagnalis of Broca, pallidum, hypothalamus, hypophysis and neocortex. Some DSIP pathways seem likely: (1) indusium griseum - striae longitudinales - hippocampus; (2) nucleus septi lateralis - striae longitudinales , bandeletta diagonalis - hippocampus; (3) neurons of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus - gyrus dentatus; (4) pallidum - commissura of Ganser - hypothalamus. The possible correlations between DSIP neurons and neurons with other neurotransmitters are discussed. In preliminary clinical trials, DSIP has shown promise for the treatment of insomnia and the opiate and alcohol withdrawal syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
6372946	Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) neurons and their projections were studied by immunocytochemistry in the brains of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus lucifugus: Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae ) as a first step in the study of relationships between these neurons and the seasonal reproductive events characteristic of this species. The majority of immunoreactive neurons in adult male, adult female, and fetal bats were ovoid bipolar cells with one thin and one thicker process, both of which gave rise to fine varicose fibers. LH-RH-immunoreactive perikarya were concentrated in the region of the arcuate nuclei in all bats examined. Perikarya were also consistently found dispersed in the mammillary region, anterior hypothalamus, preoptic areas, septum, diagonal band of Broca, and olfactory tracts; they were occasionally observed in the dorsal hypothalamus, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), habenula, amygdala, and cingulate gyrus. LH-RH-immunoreactive fibers projected heavily to the median eminence, infundibular stalk, and posterior pituitary. In extrahypothalamic areas, these fibers were especially abundant in the stria medullaris/habenula and stria terminalis/amygdala, but also contributed to the diagonal band of Broca and the olfactory tracts. Immunoreactive fibers that may be components of many different pathways clustered in the rostral septum and permeated the medial hypothalamus. LH-RH-containing fibers frequently entered the subfornical organ, but were observed less often in the OVLT and only occasionally in the pineal. The organization of the LH-RH system in the little brown bat resembles that of primates, but differs considerably from that in the rat. Anatomical characteristics of the LH-RH system in bats thus suggest that this animal may be a particularly suitable species for further study of neuroendocrine control of reproductive function as it may relate to primates, including humans.
6379499	The results of this study of the distribution of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in four human "senile" and "presenile" brains by immunofluorescence microscopy (Coons' Method) showed specifically fluorescing varicosities containing fibres in the following areas: nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus, pallidum (mainly the external segment), septal nuclei, substantia innominata, hypothalamus, hypophysis, substantia nigra, nucleus interpeduncularis, locus coeruleus and other nuclei of the brain stem, most of the nuclei of the cranial nerves (mainly the sensitive) and spinal cord (mainly the substantia gelatinosa of the posterior horn). Fibres were observed surrounding cell bodies in the substantia nigra, in the nucleus raphe and in the anterior horn of the spinal cord (motor cells). Cylindrical ("pipe-shaped") structures formed by enkephalin-like immunoreactive fibres were seen in the pallidum, between the pallidum and the nucleus accumbens, and in the substantia nigra. A complete map of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity, based on Riley's Atlas of the human brain, is included. The distribution of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity showed many similarities to that in animal species that have been studied by immunohistochemistry (rat, primate) except for a lack of detectable enkephalin immunoreactivity in the amygdala in our material. No conclusions about the possible relationship of this finding to the clinical condition of dementia can be drawn without further work.
6383121	The distribution of serotonin immunoreactivity in the brain of the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) was studied, using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) immunohistochemical method with serotonin antiserum. The somata of the serotonin neurons were mainly located in the raphe regions of the brain stem from the level of the caudal mesencephalon to that of the spinomedullary junction. A small number of serotonin neurons were also distributed as cerebrospinal-fluid contacting neurons in the preoptic recess organ (PRO), the paraventricular organ (PVO), and the nucleus infundibularis dorsalis (Nid). In the raphe region, these serotonin neurons formed nearly-continuous bilaterally-symmetrical cell columns along the midline of the brain stem, divided into lateral and medial groups. The medial group was further subdivided into rostral and caudal parts. Processes of the serotonin neurons were widely distributed in the central nervous system, forming dense networks in various regions. The greatest concentrations of these fibers were in the nucleus medialis septi, lateral portion of striatum, nucleus corporis geniculi, nucleus entopeduncularis, periventricular gray of ventral hypothalamus, optic tectum, nucleus isthmi, nucleus interpeduncularis, dorsal edge of medulla oblongata, and fasciculus solitarius.
6383617	Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and their pathways in the rat brain were localized by immunocytochemistry in 6- to 18-day-old female animals, by use of thick frozen or vibratome sections, and silver-gold intensification of the diaminobenzidine reaction product. GnRH-immunoreactive perikarya were observed in the following regions: olfactory bulb and tubercle, vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca, medial septum, medial preoptic and suprachiasmatic areas, anterior and lateral hypothalamus, and different regions of the hippocampus (indusium griseum, Ammon's horn). In addition to the known GnRH-pathways (preoptico-terminal, preoptico-infundibular, periventricular), we also observed GnRH-immunopositive processes in several major tracts and areas of the brain, including the medial and cortical amygdaloid complex, stria terminalis, stria medullaris thalami, fasciculus retroflexus, medial forebrain bundle, indusium griseum, stria longitudinalis medialis and lateralis, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray of the mesencephalon, and extracerebral regions, such as the lamina cribrosa, nervus terminalis and its associated ganglia. By use of the silver-gold intensification method we present Golgi-like images of GnRH perikarya and their pathways. The possible distribution of efferents from each GnRH cell group is discussed.
6384954	The distribution of CRF-immunopositive cell bodies and fibers was examined in the central nervous system of normal adult male rats and in the brains and spinal cords of animals that had been pretreated with intraventricular or local injections of colchicine, or had been hypophysectomized (HPX) 3 weeks before sacrifice. The detection of CRF immunoreactivity was also facilitated by silver-gold intensification of the diaminobenzidine end-product. CRF-immunoreactive perikarya, neuronal processes and terminals were present in all major subdivisions of the rat central nervous system. In addition to the paraventriculo-infundibular (PV-IN) system [27], cell bodies with CRF immunoreactivity were found in the following regions: olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, amygdala, septum, bed nuclei of the stria terminalis and anterior commissure, nucleus accumbens, supraoptic, medial preoptic and periventricular preoptic nuclei, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray of the mesencephalon and pons, raphe nuclei, lateral tegmental nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, cuneiform nuclei, locus ceruleus, medial vestibular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal vagal complex and most of the central sensory nuclei. Nerve processes with CRF immunoreactivity were observed in all of the above areas as well as in the stria terminalis, thalamus, caudate-putamen, zona incerta, and the cerebellum. Scattered cell bodies were observed in the spinal cord in the marginal zone of the dorsal horn, in laminae VI, VII and X and in the sympathetic intermediolateral column. Horizontal transection of the cord revealed that the majority of the fibers formed an ascending system located in the lateral funiculus, close to the sponithalamic tract. The widespread, but selective distribution of neurons containing CRF immunoreactivity supports the neuroendocrine role of this peptide and suggests that CRF, similarly to other neuropeptides, may also function as a neuromodulator throughout the central nervous system.
6389041	Studies of single-cell discharge in the basal ganglia of behaving primates have revealed: characteristic patterns of spontaneous discharge in the striatum, external (GPe) and internal (GPi) globus pallidus, pars reticulata and pars compacta of the substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus (STN); phasic changes in neural discharge in relation to movements of specific body parts (e.g. leg, arm, neck, face); short-latency (sensory) neural responses to passive joint rotation; a somatotopic organization of movement-related neurons in GPe, GPi, and STN; a clustering of functionally similar neurons in the putamen and globus pallidus; greater representation of the proximal than of the distal portion of the limb; changes in neural activity in reaction-time tasks, suggesting a greater role of the basal ganglia in the execution than in the initiation of movement in this paradigm; a clear relation of neuronal activity to direction, amplitude (?velocity) of movement, and force; a preferential relation of neural activity to the direction of movement, rather than to the pattern of muscular activity. Some of these findings suggest that the basal ganglia may play a role in the control of movement parameters rather than (or independent of) the pattern of muscular activity. Loss of basal ganglia output related to amplitude may account for the bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease. The presence of somatotopic organization in the putamen and globus pallidus, together with known topographic striopallidal connections, suggests that segregated, parallel cortico-subcortical loops subserve 'motor' and 'complex' functions.
6396104	Inactive renin in rat brains was investigated according to the following experiments. Treatment with either trypsin or glandular kallikrein of the brain tissue caused a rapid and apparent increase in the renin activity at either 0 or 27 degrees C. The molecular weight of the active renin was estimated to be 40,000 daltons, while that of the trypsin-activatable inactive renin was found to be 48,000 or 61,000 daltons on a column chromatography with Sephadex G-100. The contents of the active renin was the highest in the hypothalamus, followed by striatum, thalamus, midbrain, cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata and cerebellum, while the contents of the trypsin-activatable inactive renin was the highest in the hypothalamus, followed by striatum, thalamus, midbrain, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata. These results suggest that inactive renin(s) exist in the brain. It seems likely that the brain renin-angiotensin system is modulated by the conversion of inactive to active renin(s).
6436341	Afferents to the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VT) were investigated in mice, rats, and cats. Unilateral and bilateral injections or iontophoretical applications of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into the region of the VT. The entire cerebrum was then screened for labeled neurons. Following injections situated principally within the VT, in all three species many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the mamillary bodies and the lateral habenular nuclei. Fewer labeled cells were observed in the prefrontal cortex, the basal forebrain, various hypothalamic nuclei, the interpeduncular nucleus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, nucleus of Darkschewitsch and interstitial nucleus of Cajal, vestibular nucleus, and nucleus praepositus hypoglossi. Scant but consistent labeling occurred in the cingular, retrosplenial, and insular cortices, within the medial forebrain bundle, fields of Forel, zona incerta, ventral tegmental area of Tsai, substantia nigra, pretectal area, periaqueductal gray, dorsal tegmental nucleus, locus ceruleus, and raphe complex. Our results show a high similarity in the distribution of afferent connections converging on the VT of mice, rats, and cats. They indicate furthermore that the VT is reached by a variety of cortical and subcortical afferents, which belong either to the limbic system or to brain stem regions related to motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. It is suggested that the VT subserves as a midbrain core structure of the limbic system, which is responsible for the transfer of motor, sensory, and autonomic informations arising within the brain stem to limbic forebrain structures.
6436816	Enkephalin convertase, an enkephalin-forming carboxypeptidase, is potently inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA). We have localized enkephalin convertase in rat brain by in vitro autoradiography with [3H]GEMSA. [3H]GEMSA-associated silver grains are highly concentrated in the median eminence, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, dentate gyrus, hippocampus, central nucleus of the amygdala, preoptic hypothalamus, magnocellular nuclei of the hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal tract. This distribution corresponds closely with immunocytochemical localizations of enkephalin-containing cells and axons, indicating that enkephalin convertase is selectively involved in enkephalin biosynthesis.
6480903	The projections to the frontal cortex from the various subdivisions of the posterior parietal region in the rhesus monkey were studied by means of autoradiographic technique. The rostral superior parietal lobule (area PE) projects to the dorsal areas 4 and 6 on the lateral surface of the frontal lobe as well as to the supplementary motor area (MII) on its medial surface. The caudal area PE sends its connections to dorsal area 6 and MII. The projections from the medial parietal cortex (areas PEc and PGm) are similar to those of the superior parietal lobule but they tend to concentrate in the more rostral part of dorsal area 6, MII, and in the cingulate gyrus (area 24). The most caudal part of the medial parietal cortex also projects to area 8. The anteriormost part of the inferior parietal lobule (area PF) projects to the ventral area 6, including the caudal bank of the lower branch of the arcuate sulcus, to the ventral area 46 below the sulcus principalis, and to the frontal and pericentral opercular cortex. The middle inferior parietal lobule (areas PFG and PG) projects to the ventral part of area 46 and area 8, whilst the posteriormost inferior parietal lobule (caudal PG and area Opt) is connected with both dorsal and ventral area 46, dorsal area 8, as well as the anteriormost dorsal area 6, and the cingulate gyrus (area 24).
6480917	Cortical projections to cell groups surrounding the oculomotor complex were studied by using the retrograde and anterograde capabilities of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique in old and new world monkeys. Fluid HRP injections or transcannular solid polyacrylamide HRP gel implants were made into the oculomotor nucleus (OMN) and adjacent nuclei to label retrogradely corticofugal neurons that project to this region, and cortical HRP gel implants were made in various areas of the frontal lobe to label anterogradely the trajectories and terminations of cortico-paraoculomotor projections and thus to confirm the retrograde findings. Projections to the paraoculomotor cell groups in the medial dien-mesencephalic tegmentum originate almost exclusively from the frontal lobe. Both retrograde and anterograde studies confirmed that the prearcuate cortex in the concavity of the arcuate sulcus, including the frontal eye field, and, to a lesser extent, suprarcuate rostral dorsal area 6 cortex and the dorsomedial convexity (area 9), project to the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) in the dorsal region of the prerubral field, nucleus of Darkschewitsch (ND), medial accessory nucleus of Bechterew (NB) and dorsomedial parvocellular red nucleus (dmPRN). The premotor area 6 and motor area 4 cortex, on the other hand, give rise to projections that target a larger portion of the parvocellular red nucleus, extending rostrally into the ventral region of the prerubral field, and a rather intense projection to the ND. The interstitial nucleus of Cajal (IC) was distinguished more by its light, or lack of, projections from the frontal cortex. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL, area 7) which has certain common physiological properties with the frontal eye field (FEF area 8) related to the oculomotor system, lacked retrogradely labeled neurons in all cases where transcannular gel implants into the OMN eliminated the possibility of HRP uptake in the corpus callosum or other structures traversed in needle injections, suggesting that the IPL affects eye movement primarily through its rostrally directed corticocortical associational connections with the FEF. In additional cases, the ND-NB-dmPRN configuration of cells that receives FEF input is shown to project to the inferior olivary complex (i.e., is pre-olivo-cerebellar), whereas riMLF and IC give rise to descending projections in the MLF, which target extraocular muscle motor nuclei, vestibular complex, and spinal cord. The results are discussed in terms of the potential role of the cerebral cortex in eye movement mechanisms.
6483188	We have investigated the localization of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the brainstem of eight patients free of neurological disease following quantitative autoradiography of microtome sections of postmortem tissue labeled in vitro with N-[3H]methyl scopolamine as a ligand. Receptor densities were quantified by microdensitometry with the aid of a computer assisted image analysis system. Our results reveal a heterogeneous distribution of receptor sites. High concentrations of muscarinic cholinergic receptor sites were associated with many nuclei and areas of the brainstem including the nucleus facialis (VII), hypoglossus (XII), ambiguus, the motor trigeminal nucleus (V), the nucleus solitarius, the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, the superior and inferior colliculi, the sensory trigeminal nucleus (substantia gelatinosa), the pontine nuclei, the parabrachial nuclei, some tegmental nuclei and the periaqueductal gray matter. Very high concentrations of N-[3H]methyl scopolamine binding sites were also localized in the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus paranigralis and the nucleus ovalis. Receptor densities varied between individual brains although the relative distribution of the densities in the different nuclei was the same for all of the brains examined. Most of the brainstem nuclei containing muscarinic cholinergic receptors were enriched in high affinity agonist binding sites as shown by characteristic displacement of the ligand with carbachol. Exceptions were the substantia nigra, the nucleus olivaris inferior and the substantia gelatinosa of the fifth nerve. Receptor density values and pharmacological characteristics obtained in the cortex and basal ganglia in our cases are in good agreement with previously reported values in humans, using conventional biochemical methods. This indicates that procedures used in the autoradiographic technique are not detrimental to the pharmacological characteristics and densities of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Our results thus clearly show the feasibility of using these techniques for the localization and quantification of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human brain postmortem material. Furthermore, our findings indicate the potential involvement of the muscarinic cholinergic effect of acetylcholine in the normal function of many brainstem centers, including motor and sensory nuclei, visual and auditory relay nuclei and cardiovascular and respiratory-related nuclei.
6488288	Immunoreactive neurons were mapped in the central nervous system of colchicine-treated and untreated guinea pigs with the use of two antisera to the molluscan neuropeptide FMRFamide. These antisera were especially selected for their incapability to react with peptides of the pancreatic polypeptide family. Only one group of perikarya was stained by both antisera; this group was mainly located in the nucleus dorsomedialis hypothalami and extended to the nucleus paraventricularis and nucleus periventricularis hypothalami. The perikarya were found to project fibers to all regions of the hypothalamus, to the septum, nucleus proprius striae terminalis, nucleus paraventricularis thalami, nucleus centralis thalami, nucleus reuniens, medial, central and basal amygdala, area praetectalis, area tegmentalis ventralis of Tsai, substantia grisea centralis mesencephali, formatio reticularis mesencephali, nucleus centralis superior, locus coeruleus, nuclei parabrachiales, nucleus raphe magnus, A 5-region, vagus-solitarius complex, ventral medulla, nucleus spinalis nervi trigemini, and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. In many brain regions FMRFamide-immunoreactive processes were found in close contact with blood vessels.
6493441	The effect of intermittent normobaric hypoxia and of biological pyrimidines (uridine and cytidine) on the specific activities of some enzymes related to cerebral energy metabolism were studied. Measurement were carried out on the following: homogenate in toto; purified mitochondrial fraction; crude synaptosomal fraction, in different areas of rat brain: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. Intermittent normobaric hypoxia (12 hours daily for 5 days) caused modifications of the enzyme activities in the homogenate in toto (decrease of hexokinase in cerebellum; increase of pyruvate kinase in medulla oblongata), in the purified mitochondrial fraction (increase of succinate dehydrogenase in the corpus striatum) and in the crude synaptosomal fraction (decrease of cytochrome oxidase activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum; decrease of malate dehydrogenase in hippocampus and cerebellum; decrease of lactate dehydrogenase in cerebellum). Daily treatment with cytidine or uridine altered some enzyme activities either affected or unaffected by intermittent hypoxia.
6493629	After injecting horseradish peroxidase into the facial nucleus regions containing orbicularis oculi motoneurons, labeled neuronal cell bodies were found in the lateral medullary reticular formation, pretectal olivary nucleus, sensory trigeminal nuclei, lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei, ventromedial reticular formation medial to the facial nucleus, red nucleus and its surroundings, anterior horn of the upper cervical cord, medullary raphe nuclei, oculomotor nucleus and its surroundings, nuclei of Darkschewitsch, Cajal and Edinger-Westphal, ventral part of the midbrain central gray, pontine tegmentum, lateral vestibular nucleus and deep layers of the superior colliculus.
6501866	The afferents to the nucleus posterior thalami were investigated in the rat using the methods of retrograde and anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The main afferents arise from the following structures: sensorimotor cortex, zona incerta, thalamic ventrobasal complex, pretectum, intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus, nucleus suprageniculatus, nucleus ruber and perirubral area, mesencephalic reticular formation, nucleus interstitialis of Cajal, nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus, nucleus reticularis pontis, sensorial and spinal tract trigeminal nuclei. There is some confusion about the anatomical localization and appellation of the posterior thalamic region among mammals. In most of them, however, the pattern of afferents to this area appears to be relatively homogeneous. We conclude that the projections to the thalamic posterior nucleus of the rat are similar to those reported in other mammals. This nucleus has been suspected of playing a role in the processing of somaesthetic or visual informations. On the basis of the multimodal nature of its afferents, a specific role of this nucleus is excluded. Instead, a non-specific function of modulation or integration is suggested.
6514182	The localization and distribution of somatostatin (growth hormone release-inhibiting hormone; somatotropin release-inhibiting factor) have been studied with the indirect immunofluorescence technique of Coons and collaborators and the immunoperoxidase method of Sternberger and coworkers using specific and well-characterized antibodies to somatostatin, providing semiquantitative, detailed maps of somatostatin-immunoreactive cell profiles and fibers. Our results demonstrate a widespread occurrence of somatostatin-positive nerve cell bodies and fibers throughout the central nervous system of adult, normal or colchicine-treated, albino rats. The somatostatin cell bodies varied in size from below 10 micron up to 40 micron in diameter and could have only a few or multiple processes. Dense populations of cell somata were present in many major areas including neocortex, piriform cortex, hippocampus, amygdaloid complex, nucleus caudatus, nucleus accumbens, anterior periventricular hypothalamic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, nucleus arcuatus, medial to and within the lateral lemniscus, pontine reticular nuclei, nucleus cochlearis dorsalis and immediately dorsal to the nucleus tractus solitarii. Extensive networks of nerve fibers of varying densities were also found in most areas and nuclei of the central nervous system. Both varicose fibers as well as dot- or "dust-like" structures were seen. Areas with dense or very dense networks included nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus, nucleus amygdaloideus centralis, most parts of the hypothalamus, nucleus parabrachialis, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus tractus spinalis nervi trigemini and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. One exception is the cerebellum which only contained few somatostatin-positive cell bodies and nerve fibers. It should be noted that somatostatin-positive cell bodies and fibers did not always conform to the boundaries of the classical neuroanatomical nuclei, but could often be found in areas between these well-established nuclei or occupying, in varying concentrations, only parts of such nuclei. It was difficult to identify with certainty somatostatin-immunoreactive axons in the animals studied. Some pathways could, however, be demonstrated, but further experimental studies are necessary to elucidate the exact projections of the somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons in the rat central nervous system.
6527773	The distribution of serotonin binding sites was studied in the rat hippocampal region by using contact-film autoradiography after in vitro incubations of brain sections with 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine, [3H]spiperone, and [3H]ketanserin, respectively. Biochemical studies of the 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding to sections cut through the hippocampal region showed that at saturating concentrations of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine (2-2.5 nM) the specific binding was at least 50% of the total. The 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding sites were found to be heterogeneously distributed within the hippocampal region with the highest densities present in the following parts: layers I and II and layers IV through VI of the entorhinal area, the radial layer of the subiculum and subfield CA1 of the Ammon's horn and the molecular layer of the area dentata. Moderate to low densities of binding was observed in layer III of the entorhinal area, the pre- and parasubiculum, the stratum pyramidale of the Ammon's horn, and the granular cell layer of the area dentata. Removal of the 5-hydroxytryptamine nerve terminals by systemic injections of the 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotoxin parachloroamphetamine resulted in no detectable reductions of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding in any brain region. Lesions of hippocampal cell bodies by intrahippocampal injections of ibotenic acid prevented the binding of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine within the area of the cell loss. Comparisons between the distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine immunoreactive nerve terminals and the 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding sites showed that in some areas of sparse 5-hydroxytryptamine innervation the 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding was close to background (e.g. the pyramidal cell layer, the stratum lucidum) whereas in areas with little 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding (e.g. layer III of the lateral entorhinal area, the presubiculum) a very dense 5-hydroxytryptamine innervation was found. The hippocampal 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine binding was displaced neither by ketanserin (1 microM) nor by spiperone (1 microM), two drugs that bind to cortical 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors in the rat brain. Furthermore, the pattern of hippocampal [3H]spiperone binding differed considerably from that of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine. The [3H]ketanserin binding in the hippocampal region did not exceed background levels, except in the hilus of area dentata in the ventral hippocampus and entorhinal layer VI at the same level, where moderate binding was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6532518	The cholinergic projections to the limbic telecephalon in the rat were investigated by use of fluorescent tracer histology in combination with choline-O-acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry (pharmacohistochemical regimen). Propidium iodide or Evans Blue was infused into the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, dorsal retrohippocampal region, amygdala, and the entorhinal, perirhinal, pyriform, insular, and cingular cortices. Retrogradely transported fluorescent labels and ChAT and/or AChE were microscopically analyzed on the same brain section. Virtually all of the cholinergic projections to the limbic telencephalon derived from the basal forebrain cholinergic system composed of neurons associated with the medial septal nucleus, nuclei of the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, the magnocellular preoptic area, the subpallidal substantia innominata and its rostral extension into the regions of the ventral pallidum laterally and the lateral preoptic area medially, and the nucleus basalis. The cingulate cortex received a small cholinergic projection from the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus in the brainstem. All of the presumed cholinergic innervation of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and dorsal retrohippocampal area and the majority of cholinergic afferents to posterior cingulate and entorhinal cortices derived from the medial septal nucleus, vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic area, and rostral substantia innominata. Putative cholinergic afferents to the amygdala and to pyriform, insular, perirhinal, and anterior cingulate cortices orginated from ChAT-positive cells concentrated more caudally in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Within the basal forebrain, no simple topographic pattern emerged to explain the cholinergic innervation of the limbic telencephalon, although an essentially reverse rostrocaudal organization was observed for afferents to the cingular region. It was noted, however, that most regions of the limbic telencephalon received cholinergic input from rostral portions of the basal forebrain cholinergic system, an observation inviting speculation that anterior aspects of the basal forebrain provide cholinergic afferents primarily to limbic structures in the telencephalon whereas more caudal portions are the source of cholinergic fibers preferentially innervating non-limbic regions. Of the total number of projection neurons innervating a given region of the limbic telencephalon, a greater proportion was ChAT-positive if phylogenetically newer target structures were innervated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6546776	Saturable, high affinity binding of tritiated pirenzepine [( 3H]-PZ) was obtained in slide mounted tissue sections prior to performing autoradiographic localization of these binding sites. The binding in tissue sections of rostral rat forebrain gave a KD of 18nM and a Bmax of 51 fmoles/mg tissue. These binding characteristics are similar to those previously obtained in homogenate membrane preparations and indicate the binding is taking place in a similar manner. The distribution of the binding sites labeled with [3H]-PZ represented a subpopulation of those which could be labeled with tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]-QNB). Thus, [3H]-PZ and [3H]-QNB both label regions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and dorsal horn of the spinal cord, while sites in the cerebellum, nucleus tractus solitarius, facial nucleus and ventral horn of the spinal cord are labeled with [3H]-QNB and not by [3H]-PZ. These observations indicate separate regions of the brain where antagonists bind to subtypes of muscarinic receptors.
6601247	The distribution of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-immunoreactive cells and fibers has been examined in the brains of normal adult rats, and in the brains of animals that had been pretreated with intraventricular injections of colchicine, or had been adrenalectomized 3-60 days before perfusion. The results suggest that CRF immunoreactivity is localized in at least three functionally distinct systems. First, most of the CRF-stained fibers in the neurohemal zone of the median eminence, which presumably modulate the release of ACTH and beta-endorphin from the pituitary, appear to arise in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). About 2,000 CRF-stained cells are distributed throughout all eight parts of the PVH, although a majority (80%) of the cells are concentrated in the parvocellular division, and a smaller number (about 15%) are found in parts of the magnocellular division in which oxytocinergic cells predominate. This appears to be the only CRF-stained pathway in the brain that is affected (increased staining intensity) by adrenalectomy. Second, a series of cell groups in the basal telencephalon, hypothalamus, and brain stem that are known to play a role in the mediation of autonomic responses contain CRF-stained neurons. These areas, which are interconnected by stained fibers in the medial forebrain bundle and the periventricular system, include the central nucleus of the amygdala, substantia innominata, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and lateral preoptic areas, lateral hypothalamic area, central gray, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, locus ceruleus, parabrachial nucleus, dorsal vagal complex, and regions containing the A1 and A5 catecholamine cell groups. And third, scattered CRF-stained cells are found throughout most areas of the cerebral cortex. Most such cells are confined to layers II and III in the neocortex, and their bipolar shape suggests that they are interneurons. These cells are most common in limbic regions including prefrontal areas, the cingulate gyrus, and areas bordering the rhinal fissure. Scattered immunoreactive cells are also found in dorsal parts of the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn. These results suggest that the PVH plays a critical role in the modulation of ACTH and beta-endorphin release from the pituitary, and that CRF-containing pathways in the brain are involved in the mediation of autonomic responses.
6608070	Horseradish peroxidase, 13% Sigma Type VI, was administered iontophoretically to the lateral preoptic area (LPA) of male hooded rats. Animals were perfused intracardially on the following day and brains were removed and sliced in the coronal plane into 50 microns sections. Alternate sections were processed with DAB and BDH for the brown and blue reaction products and later examined by bright and dark field microscopy for the presence and location of retrogradely labeled neurons. Results indicate that there are a significant number of limbic efferent connections to the LPA. Afferents to the LPA originate in the prefrontal corex, nucleus accumbens, diagonal band and olfactory structures, lateral and medial septum, stria hypothalamic tract and stria terminalis, the magnocellular and medial preoptic nuclei, along the extent of the medial forebrain bundle in the LPA and LH, anterior and basolateral amygdala, ventromedial caudate-putamen, stria medullaris and lateral habenula, the stellatocellular-periventricular, ventromedial, arcuate and anterior hypothalamic nuclei, the perifornical area, zona incerta, ventral medial thalamic area, ventral tegmental area of Tsai, interpeduncular nucleus, reticular zone of the substantia nigra, mesencephalic periaqueductal gray and reticular formation, all aspects of the raphe nuclei and the locus coeruleus. Results are discussed in terms of known anatomical and neurophysiological data and the similar limbic inputs observed for lateral hypothalamic neurons which are found along the extent of the medial forebrain bundle.
6616269	The connections of the medium (10-20 microns) and large (20-35 microns) cells of the islands of Calleja Complex (ICC) were studied in the albino rat with anterograde and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and fluorescent tracers. The medium and large size cells were found to project to the ipsilateral olfactory tubercle, ventral pallidum, septum, piriform cortex, periamygdaloid cortex, cortical nuclei of the amygdala, ventral endopiriform nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, Forel's field H, ventral tegmental area, supramammillary complex, and nuclei gemini of the hypothalamus, midline, intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei, and lateral habenula. Afferents of the ICC appear to include the same nuclei with the exception of the lateral habenula. In addition, the dorsal raphe projects to the ICC. These connections are consistent with the concept that the ICC is a striato-pallidal structure.
6621812	This study concerns the cholinergic involvement in three experimental procedures which produce analgesia. Rats were given one of seven treatments: saline (1.0 ml/kg, i.p.); morphine sulfate (3.5, 6.0 or 9.0 mg/kg, i.p.); physostigmine salicylate (0.65 mg/kg, i.p.); warm water swim (3.5 min at 28 degrees C); and cold water swim (3.5 min at 2 degrees C). Each rat was tested on a hot plate (59.1 degrees C) once prior to and 30 min after treatment. Immediately after the last test the rats were killed with focussed microwave radiation. Levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch) in six brain areas (brain stem, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and striatum) were analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Morphine (9.0 mg/kg), physostigmine and cold water swimming caused significant analgesia. Morphine elevated the levels of ACh in the cerebellum and striatum, cold water swimming--in the cerebellum, striatum and cortex, and physostigmine--in the striatum and hippocampus. Levels of choline were elevated by morphine in the cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus, while cold water swimming elevated levels of choline in the cerebellum, cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Physostigmine did not change levels of choline in any of the brain areas studied. These data suggest that the analgetic effects of morphine or cold water swimming may be mediated by components of the cholinergic system that differ from those involved in the analgetic effects of physostigmine.
6634888	Changes in contents of noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4) in brain regions (the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebral cortex, pons plus medulla oblongata and basal ganglia) of male Wistar rats were evaluated after 1, 3 or 5 days of exposure to the activity-stress paradigm, wherein rats were housed in a cage with a running-wheel and restricted to 1-hr of feeding per day. When compared to the non-stressed control rats, contents of MHPG-SO4 in all the brain regions except of the basal ganglia in the stressed rats increased as rapidly as 1 day and continued to increase throughout the 5-day activity-stress period. Contents of NA did not change significantly in most of these brain regions. The daily increase in regional NA turnover by continuous exposure to the activity-stress paradigm was related to the large increases in running activity and gastric ulcers, and to body weight loss at the 3-day and 5-day testing periods. These data suggest that pathological states produced by a 5-day activity-stress paradigm may reflect concomitant disturbances of noradrenergic function in various brain regions. The activity-stress paradigm is regarded as an intense and progressive stress, because it induces an increase in NA response in extended brain regions.
6634905	Male Wistar rats were exposed to immobilization stress for various periods (1 to 5 hr) with or without an IP injection of probenecid at 400 mg/kg. The regional characteristics of stress-induced increases in noradrenaline (NA) release in the rat brain related to the time-course of stress were demonstrated by measuring levels of the major metabolite of NA, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4). Increases in MHPG-SO4 levels occurred mainly within the first hr of stress in the hypothalamus, amygdala and thalamus, while the peak elevations of the metabolite levels were delayed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, pons + medulla oblongata and basal ganglia. According to the accumulation of MHPG-SO4 during each 1-hr period of stress, regional characteristics of NA release were classified into the following four types based upon regions where the most marked increase in MHPG-SO4 levels occurs mainly: (1) within the first hr of stress (the hypothalamus, amygdala and thalamus), (2) during the first and second hr (the hippocampus and cerebral cortex), (3) during the third hr (the basal ganglia) and (4) to the same extent from the first to the fourth hr of stress (the pons + medulla oblongata). These results suggest that noradrenergic neurons in different brain regions respond differentially to stress and reflect their own characteristic patterns depending upon nature and time-course of the stressor.
6646427	The efferent connections of the brain stem nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus were studied in the rat using the techniques of anterograde and retrograde transport of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, laying particular emphasis on that part of pedunculopontinus which receives direct descending projections from the basal ganglia and related nuclei. In a preliminary series of experiments horseradish peroxidase was injected into either the entopeduncular nucleus or the subthalamic nucleus and, following anterograde transport of enzyme, terminal labelling was identified in nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus, surrounding the brachium conjunctivum in the caudal mesencephalon. In a subsequent series of experiments, horseradish peroxidase was injected into that region of nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus which receives entopeduncular and subthalamic efferents and its efferent projections were studied by anterograde transport of the enzyme. The results indicate that nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus gives rise to widely distributed efferent projections which terminate rostrally in mesencephalic, diencephalic and telencephalic structures and caudally in the pontine tegmentum. In the mesencephalon, terminal labelling was found in the pars compacta of the ipsilateral substantia nigra and sometimes in the adjoining ventral tegmental area. Labelling was also found in the ipsilateral half of the periaqueductal grey. In the diencephalon terminal labelling occurred bilaterally in the subthalamic nucleus and ipsilaterally in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. Further rostrally, terminal labelling was particularly evident in the ipsilateral pallidal complex, especially in the caudal two-thirds of the entopeduncular nucleus and the ventral half of the caudal third of the globus pallidus. Caudal to pedunculopontine injection sites dense labelling was observed in the reticular formation of the pontine tegmentum. In a final series of experiments, confirmation of apparent pedunculopontine efferent projections was sought using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Enzyme was injected into sites possibly receiving pedunculopontine efferents and the peribrachial area of the brain stem was examined for retrograde cell labelling. In this way, pedunculopontine projections were confirmed to the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, parafascicular nucleus and pontine reticular formation. Injections into the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus gave rise to retrograde cell labelling bilaterally in pedunculopontinus. In addition, retrograde transport studies alone demonstrated projections from pedunculopontinus to the cerebral cortex and to the spinal cord. It is concluded that the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus has reciprocal relationships with parts of the basal ganglia and some functionally related nuclei (in particular, the pallidal complex, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6664490	The cellular origin and degree of collateralization of the subcortical afferents to the caudate nucleus and the putamen in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) were studied using the following combinations of fluorescent retrograde tracers: Evans blue and DAPI-Primuline, Fast blue and Nuclear yellow, True blue and Nuclear yellow. After the injections, cells containing the tracer delivered in caudate nucleus (caudate-labeled cells) and others labeled with the complementary tracer injected in putamen (putamen-labeled cells) occur in large number in intralaminar nuclei, substantia nigra pars compacta, midbrain raphe nuclei and central midbrain tegmentum. In addition, a small to moderate number of putamen-labeled cells is found in external pallidum, pulvinar and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei, and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, whereas some caudate and putamen-labeled cells are scattered in ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus. However, ver few double-labeled cells are present in all these structures. In rostral intralaminar nuclei, the labeled cells are not confined to the know cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the nuclei but impinge slightly upon ventrolateral and mediodorsal nuclei. At this level, the caudate-labeled cells lie more dorsally and medially relative to putamen-labeled cells, but a high degree of intermingling exists and some double-labeled cells occur particularly in nucleus centralis lateralis. In caudal intralaminar nuclei, caudate-labeled cells are strictly confined to parafascicular nucleus and putamen-labeled cells present only in centre median, without any overlap between the two neuronal populations. In substantia nigra pars compacta, clusters of caudate-labeled cells are closely intermingled with clusters of putamen-labeled cells according to a complex mosaic-like pattern that varies along the rostrocaudal extent of the structure. Overall, however, caudate-labeled cells predominate rostrodorsally and putamen-labeled cells are more abundant caudoventrally in substantia nigra pars compacta, with only a few double-labeled cells. Some caudate and putamen-labeled cells are also scattered in contralateral substantia nigra pars compacta. In dorsal raphe nucleus, putamen labeled cells tend to occupy a more lateral position relative to caudate-labeled cells, with again very few double-labeled neurons. The caudate and putamen-labeled cells are less numerous and more closely intermingled in nucleus centralis superior. Numerous striatal afferent cells are also found bilaterally in the peribrachial region of midbrain tegmentum, comprising the pedunculopontine nucleus area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6664491	Afferent projections to the inferior colliculus in the North American opossum have been examined using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Projections to primarily the contralateral inferior colliculus arise in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, the auditory nerve nucleus and the spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis, while ipsilateral projections arise in the superior paraolivary nucleus, the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, the paralemniscal nucleus, the deep layer of the superior colliculus and the parabrachial nucleus. Bilateral projections to the inferior colliculus originate within the dorsal column nuclei, the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars ventralis, the lateral and medial superior olivary nuclei, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the auditory cortex. Nissl, fiber and Golgi-stained preparations were used to study the neuronal organization of those auditory nuclei with projections to the inferior colliculus. Anterograde axonal degeneration and transport techniques revealed that the inferior colliculus is innervated differentially by the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus, the superior olivary complex and the auditory neocortex. Axons from the contralateral dorsal cochlear nucleus and the ipsilateral superior olivary complex innervate both the central nucleus and external cortex, whereas those from ventral cochlear nucleus and contralateral, superior olivary complex project to only the central nucleus. Projections from auditory cortex form the complement of those from the cochlear nuclei and superior olivary complex, that is, they terminate in a thin band overlying the dorsal cortex and the superficial layer of external cortex. Our results have been compared with those obtained from eutherian mammals and it is clear that there are striking similarities in neuronal organization and connectivity. Since the opossum is born 12 days after conception and has an extended development in an external pouch, it may be suited for developmental studies of the mammalian auditory connections and the behaviors dependent of them.
6683583	The distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the brain is studied during the development of morphine tolerance and through a period of withdrawal to elucidate the possible role of this enzyme in producing physical dependence in mice. Tolerance and physical dependence are produced in male albino mice by giving morphine sulphate subcutaneously at eight hourly intervals, in an increasing dose of 10 mg/kg body weight every 24 hours, for 15 days. The animals are considered addicted, when they received an otherwise lethal dose, 150 mg/kg three times a day. The enzyme shows a marked elevation in the overall distribution during the development of physical dependence. The habenular complex, nuclei anterioventralis and medialis thalami, nucleus caudatus putamen, amygdaloideus lateralis, septal nuclei, nucleus nervi hypoglossi, nucleus reticularis lateralis, tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus tractus diagonalis brocae, stratum pyramidale hippocampi, nucleus paraventricularis thalami, nucleus dorsalis nervi vagi, nucleus tractus spinalis nervi trigemini and nucleus reticularis thalami show an increase in the enzyme activity. This enhancement is not linear with the increase in dosage. Withdrawal is characterised by a sudden fall in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the above mentioned areas of brain.
6685650	The steady-state levels and utilization (alpha-MPT-induced disappearance) of noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) were measured in distinct mouse brain nuclei after acute morphine challenge, in mice rendered tolerant to morphine, and during the naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal syndrome. Mouse brain nuclei containing mainly the cell body areas and some terminal projections of major NA- and DA-containing pathways were selected (nucleus tractus solitarii, locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, area tegmentalis ventralis and nucleus caudatus, nucleus accumbens, gyrus dentatus hippocampi, nucleus raphe dorsalis respectively). Acute morphine treatment reduced the utilization of NA in all brain nuclei but the substantia nigra. In morphine-tolerant mice, all changes characteristic for acute morphine treatment disappeared. Instead, an increased NA utilization was observed in the nucleus tractus solitarii and the area tegmentalis ventralis in the tolerant animals. During morphine withdrawal, an abrupt decrease was observed in the utilization of NA in the nucleus tractus solitarii, whereas the NA utilization in the gyrus dentatus abruptly increased, as compared to the tolerant state. Acute morphine challenge decreased the utilization of DA in the nucleus caudatus, locus coeruleus and nucleus raphe dorsalis. In the tolerant mouse, an increased utilization of DA was observed in the nucleus tractus solitarii. During morphine withdrawal, DA utilization was decreased in the substantia nigra and the area tegmentalis ventralis, while in the nucleus accumbens withdrawal resulted in an increase of DA utilization. The data suggest that acute effects of morphine as well as morphine tolerance/dependence are accompanied by, and likely to be associated with, distinct changes in the catecholamine metabolism of specific mouse brain nuclei.
6699210	The organization of the magnocellular basal nucleus (MBN) projection to cerebral cortex in the rat has been studied by using cytoarchitectonic, immunohistochemical, and retrograde and anterograde transport methods. The distribution of retrogradely labeled basal forebrain neurons after cortical injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was essentially identical to that of neurons staining immunohistochemically for choline acetyltransferase. These large (20-30 micrometers perikaryon diameter) multipolar neurons were found scattered through a number of basal forebrain cell groups: medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, substantia innominata, and globus pallidus. This peculiar distribution mimics the locations of pathways by which descending cortical fibers enter the diencephalon. Each cortical area was innervated by a characteristic subset of MBN neurons, always located in close association with descending cortical fibers. In many instances anterogradely labeled descending cortical fibers appeared to ramify into diffuse terminal fields among MBN neurons which were retrogradely labeled by the same cortical injection. Double label experiments using retrograde transport of fluorescent dyes confirmed that MBN neurons innervate restricted cortical fields. Anterograde autoradiographic transport studies after injections of 3H-amino acids into MBN revealed that MBN axons reach cerebral cortex primarily via two pathways: (1) The medial pathway, arising from the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and medial substantia innominata and globus pallidus MBN neurons, curves dorsally rostral to the diagonal band nucleus, up to the genu of the corpus callosum. Most of the fibers either directly enter medial frontal cortex or turn back over the genu of the corpus callosum into the superficial medial cingulate bundle. Many of these fibers enter anterior cigulate or retrosplenial cortex, but some can be traced back to the splenium of the corpus callosum, where a few enter visual cortex but most turn ventrally and sweep into the hippocampal formation. Here they are joined by other fibers which, at the genu of the corpus callosum, remain ventrally located and run caudally through the dorsal fornix into the hippocampus. (2) The lateral pathway arises in part from medial septal, diagonal band, and magnocellular preoptic neurons whose axons sweep laterally through the substantia innominata to innervate primarily piriform, perirhinal, and endorhinal cortex. Some of these fibers may also enter the hippocampal formation from the entorhinal cortex via the ventral subiculum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6717804	The regional distribution and cellular localization of iron throughout the rat brain was determined with iron histochemistry. Densitometry was used to measure the intensity of stain of 51 iron-concentrating sites. Among the areas of highest iron content are the circumventricular organs, islands of Calleja, globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra pars reticulata, interpeduncular nucleus, dentate nucleus, and interpositus nucleus. Iron occurs most commonly in oligodendrocytes and in the fibrous network of the neuropil, but is also found in the interstitial spaces of circumventricular organs and in the tanycytes of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median eminence, and walls of the third ventricle. In diverse areas throughout the brain--among them, the islands of Calleja, dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, lateral septal nucleus, and central amygdala--iron is found in association with the perikarya and neuronal processes of nerve cells. The overlapping distribution patterns of iron and gamma-aminobutyric acid, enkephalin, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone suggest that the distribution of iron is related to its association with the metabolism of one or more neurotransmitters or neuroactive compounds.
6725639	The course and composition of the cingulum bundle was examined by using the autoradiographic tracer technique in the rhesus monkey. The cingulum bundle is observed to consist of three major fiber components originating from thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and cortical association areas. Following isotope injections in the anterior and lateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, labelled fibers form an arch in the white matter behind the cingulate sulcus and occupy the ventral sector of the cingulum bundle. The fibers from the anterior thalamic nucleus coursing in the cingulum bundle extended rostrally to the frontal cortex and caudally to area 23 and the retrosplenial cortex. In contrast, the fibers from lateral dorsal nucleus reached the retrosplenial cortex as well as the parahippocampal gyrus and presubiculum. Efferent fibers from the cingulate gyrus occupy a dorsolateral sector of the cingulum bundle. Those fibers from area 24 of the cingulate gyrus are directed to the premotor and prefrontal regions as well as area 23 and retrosplenial cortex. The fibers from area 23 extend rostrally to the prefrontal cortex and caudoventrally to the presubiculum and parahippocampal gyrus. Finally, an association component originates mainly from prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal region. These fibers occupy a more dorsal and lateral periphery in the cingulate white matter. Cingulum bundle fibers from the prefrontal cortex extend up to the retrosplenial cortex while those from the posterior parietal cortex extend caudally to the parahippocampal gyrus and presubiculum, and rostrally up to the prefrontal cortex.
6726329	Using a specific radioimmunoassay, we have found that immunoreactive (ir) alpha-neo-endorphin has a widespread and unique distribution in the rat brain and spinal cord. The highest concentration in brain is in the substantia nigra (1692.1 fmol/mg of protein). Very high concentrations of ir-alpha- neo-endorphin (greater than 500 fmol/mg of protein) are also found in the lateral preoptic nucleus, dentate gyrus, parabrachial nuclei, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, median eminence, and anterior hypothalamic nucleus. Relatively high concentrations of ir-alpha-neo-endorphin (250 to 500 fmol/mg of protein) are present in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsomedial nucleus, central amygdaloid nucleus, periaqueductal gray matter, suprachiasmatic nucleus, periventricular nucleus, hippocampus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, arcuate nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus, zona incerta, dorsal premamillary nucleus, medial forebrain bundle (hypothalamic and preoptic), nucleus of the diagonal band, locus ceruleus, lateral septal nucleus, and nucleus ambiguus . Moderate levels (100 to 250 fmol/mg of protein) are found in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, ventral premamillary nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, motor hypoglossal nucleus, caudate-putamen, periventricular thalamic nucleus, subcommissural organ, sensory trigeminal nucleus, perifornical nucleus, area postrema, supraoptic nucleus, cuneate nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, and organum vasculosum laminae terminalis. Low concentrations of ir-alpha-neo-endorphin (less than 100 fmol/mg of protein) are found in many cortical structures, claustrum, thalamic nuclei, habenular nuclei, lateral geniculate body, red nucleus, superior and inferior colliculi, paramedian reticular nucleus, pontine nuclei, superior olive, vestibular nuclei, motor facial nucleus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and subfornical organ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
6733468	The efferent and afferent connections of the supplementary motor area (SMA) were studied in 6 squirrel monkeys using [3H]leucine and horseradish peroxidase, respectively. Efferent projections, common to all leucine-injected animals, were found to the cortical areas 9,8,44,4,2,5,7,24 and 23. Subcortically , efferents were found to the putamen, caudate nucleus, claustrum, the thalamic nuclei reticularis, ventrialis anterior, ventralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, centralis lateralis, paracentralis , centrum medianum, parafascicularis, centralis superior lateralis, centralis inferior and lateralis posterior, the subthalamic nucleus, field H of Forel, nuel . ruber, reticular formation of midbrain, pons and medulla, the pontine gray and nucl . reticularis tegmenti pontis. Afferent connections exist with the cortical areas 9,8,6,44,4,1,2,5,7, 24 and 23, insula, fronto-parietal operculum and superior temporal sulcus. Subcortical afferent connections exist with the claustrum, nucleus of the diagonal band, nucl . basalis Meynert, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, the thalamic nuclei ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, centralis lateralis, paracentralis , centrum medianum, centralis superior lateralis, centralis inferior, lateralis posterior and pulvinaris , the posterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, nucl . ruber pars parvicellularis , reticular formation of midbrain and pons, locus coeruleus and nucl . centralis superior Bechterew. The projections are discussed with respect to the possible role SMA plays in the voluntary initiation of motor actions.
6736295	Tritiated tracer was injected into the head of the caudate nucleus in cats. Following such injections, labeling is present within extensive regions of both the globus pallidus and entopeduncular nucleus, where it presents a mottled or meshlike appearance. These projections are topographically organized in that there is simple correspondence between the mediolateral, dorsoventral, and rostrocaudal origin of the caudate projection and its input to the globus pallidus and entopeduncular nucleus. Transported tracer is also present within the substantia nigra, where it is most abundant within the pars reticularis. However, distinct labeling also overlies cells of the pars compacta, and lesser amounts of labeling are present within the pars lateralis and within the retrorubral area. Following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the caudate nucleus, and subsequent tissue processing by the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) method of Mesulam ('78), labeled anterograde fibers are present in abundance within the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, and all subdivisions of the substantia nigra, thus confirming the autoradiographic findings. Also, it is especially obvious in this HRP material that, contrary to previous degeneration studies, both the rostromedial and caudolateral parts of the pars lateralis of the substantia nigra contain numerous anterogradely labeled fibers. Retrogradely labeled neurons are also present within the substantia nigra of these same tissue sections, where they are most abundant within the pars compacta, but lesser numbers of labeled neurons are also present within the pars reticularis, pars lateralis, retrorubral area, and ventral tegmental area on the ipsilateral side, and all of these same subdivisions of the substantia nigra on the contralateral side. Also, within the subthalamic nucleus in these experiments, there are anterogradely labeled fibers, as well as retrogradely labeled neurons, which are interpreted to represent a reciprocal connection between the subthalamic nucleus and the striatum. In a separate series of experiments, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the motor cortex-specifically into the anterior sigmoidal gyrus. Following such injections, labeled neurons representing afferents to the motor cortex are found in all subcortical nuclei commonly known as the "basal ganglia," including the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia innominata, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, medial septal nucleus, claustrum, and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus.
6736636	The ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) of albino rats (Wistar strain) has been described histologically and histochemically. Special attention was paid to the identification of cell classes in Nissl and Golgi preparations, the afferent and efferent connections of vLGN cells and the demonstration of enzymes of energy and transmitter metabolism. Topographical aspects were taken into consideration, too. The main results can be summarized as follows: In the rat vLGN, three subnuclei can be distinguished: the lateral and medial subnucleus and the intergeniculate leaflet. In the rostral vLGN, the lateral and medial subnucleus is separated by a vertical fibre bundle which contains retinal axons. Our own experiments and findings of other groups revealed that the rat vLGN is connected with numerous brain structures. There is no efferent projection to cortical regions. Afferent fibres reach the vLGN from retina, visual cortex, superior colliculus, pretectal region, zona incerta, contralateral vLGN, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, mesencephalic reticular formation, vestibular and dorsal tegmental nuclei. An efferent projection has been found to superior colliculus, pretectal region, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, contralateral vLGN, zona incerta, pontine nuclei, suprachiasmatic nucleus, lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system and intralaminar nucleus of thalamus. Comparative findings suggest that the lateral subnucleus is involved in "specific projections", whereas the medial subnucleus projects to "unspecific zones". For detailed information see text. Five classes of neurons can be distinguished in Golgi and Nissl preparations. Class 1 cells are medium-sized to large with smooth thick proximal but branched spiny distal dendrites. They are confined to the lateral subnucleus and the intergeniculate leaflet. In the lateral subnucleus, class 1 cells could be identified as geniculo-tectal relay neurons (Brauer and Schober, 1982). All other classes of neurons are spineless or sparsely spined. Class 2 cells (giant neurons) of unknown function could be found in the lateral and medial subnucleus. Class 3 cells (medium-sized multipolar neurons) can mainly be found in the medial subnucleus. They are good candidates for neurons projecting to the contralateral vLGN. Class 4 cells (bipolar neurons) occupy the ventromedial part of the medial subnucleus and are very similar to cells localized in the adjacent zona incerta. Cells belonging to this type could found to be labelled by the HRP reaction product after injection of this enzyme in the pontine region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
6738748	Efferent connections of the centrum medianum and parafascicular nucleus (CM-Pf complex) were investigated by the anterograde autoradiographic method in cat. Projections from CM-Pf complex ascend to the ventral nuclear complex and non-specific thalamic nuclei, preoptic, dorsal, lateral and posterior fields of the hypothalamus and to the subthalamic region. The descending pathways arise only from the caudomedial parts of the CM-Pf complex. They are projected to the pretectum, superior colliculus, pontine reticular formation, locus coeruleus, nucleus parabrachialis and periaqueductal grey of the midbrain and pons, as well as to the raphe nuclei, magnocellular reticular field and the inferior olive of the medulla. Previous studies suggest that the caudomedial CM-Pf part is not projected directly to the cortex and striatum.
6738860	In an attempt to evaluate the cellular organization and efferent projections of the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta, several experiments were performed in the rat. From measurements of neurons in the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta in Nissl-stained sections, the nucleus was observed to contain many large neurons which made it possible to demarcate this nucleus from surrounding pontomesencephalic reticular formation. Two other neuronal populations, medium and small neurons, were also seen in the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta. Detailed measurements showed that 90% by volume of all neurons in the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta were large and medium-sized neurons. After injections of [3]leucine into the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta, transported label was observed in dorsally and ventrally coursing ascending fibers. The dorsally coursing fibers entered the centrolateral nucleus and centre median-parafascicular complex of the thalamus. The ventrally coursing fibers produced accumulation of silver grains in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus. Crossed fibers of the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta were observed sparsely at the levels of the thalamus and posterior commissure, and to a greater degree through the supraoptic commissure of Meynert. Much less anterograde labeling was seen in the equivalent terminal sites on the contralateral side of the brain. By electron microscopic autoradiography major terminal sites of axons of the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta were examined in rats injected with [3H]leucine in the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta and later injected with horseradish peroxidase in the striatum and pallidum. Statistical data showed preferential radiolabeling of terminals forming asymmetrical synaptic contact with dendrites in the centrolateral nucleus, centre median-parafascicular complex and subthalamic nucleus. Apparent terminations in the substantia nigra pars compacta proposed in earlier studies and shown in the present light microscopic autoradiograms were not supported by this ultrastructural analysis. Several radiolabeled terminals of the asymmetrical type contacting horseradish peroxidase labeled dendrites in the thalamus confirmed direct input from the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta to the thalamostriate projection neurons. [3H]choline injections into the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus produced retrograde perikaryal labeling of large neurons in the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta.
6744032	In various areas of rat and human brain and spinal cord the distributions of opioid peptides derived from the proenkephalin A precursor, the heptapeptide [Met]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 (MERF), the octapeptide [Met]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (MERGL), and bovine adrenal medulla dodecapeptide (BAM-12P), were determined by a combination of radioimmunoassay, gel filtration, and high-performance liquid chromatography. In the human central nervous system the highest concentrations were seen in the striatum (pallidum greater than caudate nucleus greater than putamen) and in substantia nigra, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray. Similarly, in rat brain high levels were found in striatum and hypothalamus. Bovine adrenal medulladocosa peptide (BAM-22P) only occurred in the rat brain, but could not be detected in human brain. No MERF, MERGL, BAM-12P, or BAM-22P could be found in either rat or human pituitary. In contrast to MERF, MERGL and BAM-12P, peptides derived from the proenkephalin B precursor, dynorphin1-8 and dynorphin B, showed high concentrations only in substantia nigra and pallidum, but quite low levels in the other regions of human brain and spinal cord. The present study provides evidence that the proenkephalin A precursor known from adrenal medulla also exists in the rat and human central nervous system. Moreover, the identification of BAM-12P in these tissues indicates that cleavage of the precursor molecule must also involve sites different from those with paired basic amino acids.
6754769	The anatomical distribution of neurotensin perikarya and fibers in rat brain, spinal cord, and pituitary has been studied by immunohistochemistry. Neurotensin immunoreactivity is widely distributed throughout the brain, especially in forebrain and midbrain limbic structures, but also in the pons, medulla, and spinal cord. Areas with low immunoreactivity, or lack of it, stand out and include most of the hippocampus, isocortex, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, somatomotor nuclei, cerebellum, and dorsal column nuclei. Strong neurotensin immunoreactivity is found in accumbens-caudate-putamen, central and medial amygdaloid nuclei, ventrolateral septum, pars lateralis of the nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular, periventricular, and lateral hypothalamus, median eminence, thalamic intralaminar and periventricular nuclei, ventral tegmentum, central gray, certain raphe nuclei, locus ceruleus, nucleus parabrachialis medialis and lateralis, nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema, spinal and trigeminal substantia gelatinosa, as well as certain cells in the anterior pituitary. The anatomical data suggest the existence of neurotensin circuits for (1) the control of autonomic-endocrine functions, involving the nucleus tractus solitarii, area postrema, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus parabrachialis, nucleus paraventricularis, nucleus centralis amygdalae, and pars lateralis of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; and (2) for the transmission and modulation of certain somatosensory qualities, involving the spinal substantia gelatinosa, trigeminal sensory nuclei, and thalamic intralaminar nuclei.
6757282	Immunocytochemical procedures on thick, unembedded tissue sections were used to study the localization of LHRH neurons and fibers in the diencephalon and mesencephalon of rhesus and pigtailed macaques. Cell bodies were visualized in large numbers. Much of their dendritic arborization was also filled with reaction product. Cell bodies were present in the preoptic area, the periventricular hypothalamic zone from the level of the anterior hypothalamus to the premammillary nuclei, the infundibular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, several septal nuclei, the nervus terminalis, and the amygdala. The localization of LHRH cells in several of these areas represents new observations. LHRH axons were observed to innervate the portal vessels in the median eminence, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, the median eminence, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, the medial mammillary nuclei, the epithalamus, and the amygdala. These observations are discussed in relationship to the regulation of gonadotropin secretion in the primate.
6760710	The immunocytochemical localization of neurons containing the 41 amino acid peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the rat brain is described. The detection of CRF-like immunoreactivity in neurons was facilitated by colchicine pretreatment of the rats and by silver intensification of the diaminobenzidine end-product. The presence of immunoreactive CRF in perikarya, neuronal processes, and terminals in all major subdivisions of the rat brain is demonstrated. Aggregates of CRF-immunoreactive perikarya are found in the paraventricular, supraoptic, medial and periventricular preoptic, and premammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus, the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis and of the anterior commissure, the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus accumbens, the central amygdaloid nucleus, the olfactory bulb, the locus ceruleus, the parabrachial nucleus, the superior and inferior colliculus, and the medial vestibular nucleus. A few scattered perikarya with CRF-like immunoreactivity are present along the paraventriculo-infundibular pathway, in the anterior hypothalamus, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the periaqueductal gray of the mesencephalon and pons. Processes with CRF-like immunoreactivity are present in all of the above areas as well as in the cerebellum. The densest accumulation of CRF-immunoreactive terminals is seen in the external zone of the median eminence, with some immunoreactive CRF also present in the internal zone. The widespread but selective distribution of neurons containing CRF-like immunoreactivity supports the neuroendocrine role of this peptide and suggests that CRF, similarly to other neuropeptides, may also function as a neuromodulator throughout the brain.
6765220	uinea pig antiserum specific to the purified bovine choline acetyltransferase was used to demonstrate the localization of this enzyme in rabbit forebrain by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical method. Choline acetyltransferase was localized in olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, septum, diagonal band, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus, habenula, cerebral cortex, hippocampal region, corpus callosum, internal capsule, fornix, longitudinal striae and other areas. The findings reflect the distribution of cholinergic axons and, possibly, their terminals. These observations correlate well with biochemical determinations of choline acetyltransferase and with previously proposed cholinergic pathways.
6769979	The distribution of neurons in the basal telencephalon, the diencephalon, and the brainstem that project to the hippocampal formation has been analyzed in mature cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by the injection of horseradish peroxidase into different rostro-caudal levels of the hippocampal formation. After injections which involve Ammon's horn, the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex, retrogradely labeled neurons are found in the following regions: in the amygdala (specifically in the anterior amygdaloid area, the basolateral nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex); in the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band; in the ventral part of the claustrum; in the substantia innominata and the basal nucleus of Meynert; in the rostral thalamus (specifically in the anterior nuclear complex, the laterodorsal nucleus, the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, and the nucleus centralis medialis); in the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas, and especially in the supramammillary and retromammillary regions; in the ventral tegmental area, the tegmental reticular fields, the raphe nuclei (specifically in nucleus centralis superior and the dorsal raphe nucleus), in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the central gray, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, and in the locus coeruleus.
6770083	1. The central nervous structures involved in the gastrosecretory effect of insulin hypoglycaemia were investigated in twenty urethane-anaesthetized rats, previously provided with a chronic gastric fistula, by means of the 2-deoxy-D-[(14)C]glucose autoradiographic technique.2. Gastric secretion increased in animals in which plasma glucose concentration was reduced to a range of 84-133 mg/100 ml. (mean +/- S.E. of mean, 94 +/- 3) as compared to a range of 125-215 mg/100 ml. (mean +/- S.E. of mean, 162 +/- 8) in animals with normal gastric secretion.3. In fourteen of nineteen structures examined the rate of glucose utilization remained constant over the range of plasma glucose concentrations of 84-215 mg/100 ml. These structures included the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the mamillary nuclei, the medial geniculate nuclei, globus pallidus, zona incerta, nucleus ambiguus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, medial nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal tegmental nucleus, red nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, hippocampus and amygdaloid complex.4. A significant inverse correlation between plasma glucose concentration and the rate of glucose consumption was found in the lateral nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal nucleus of the vagus, perifornical area where fibres of the medial forebrain bundle course, the superior olivary nucleus and the interstitial nucleus of the stria terminalis.5. Except for the superior olivary nucleus and the interstitial nucleus of the stria terminalis, all the structures affected by low plasma glucose concentration have previously been shown to participate in the gastrosecretory response to blockade of glucose utilization by pharmacological doses of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, indicating that these same nuclei are also activated by hypoglycaemia.
6778968	Effects of TRH and pentobarbital alone, and in combination, on local cerebral glucose utilization of rats were studied by the autoradiographic 2-deoxy[14C]glucose method. TRH (5 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the rate of cerebral glucose utilization slightly in the whole brain. Locally, significant depression was observed in the following structures: frontal and visual cortices, hippocampus Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus, medial and lateral geniculate bodies, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, substantia nigra, pontine gray matter, superior colliculus, superior olivary nucleus, vestibular nucleus, lateral lemniscus and cerebellar cortex. Pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.v.) produced a marked and diffuse reduction in the rate of glucose utilization throughout the brain. TRH given 15 min after the administration of pentobarbital markedly shortened the pentobarbital sleeping time and caused some reversal of the depression in local cerebral glucose utilization produced by pentobarbital. These effects were almost completely abolished by pretreatment with intracerebroventricular injection of atropine methyl bromide (20 microgram/rat). These results indicate that although TRH acts to cause a reduction in the rate of cerebral glucose utilization, it reverses the depression induced by pentobarbital, via a cholinergic mechanism, in a number of structures, some of which are related to monoaminergic systems and the reticulo-thalamo-cortical activating system.
6785843	Vasopressin, oxytocin and neurophysin were localized in the brains and spinal cords of four primates (tree shrew, squirrel monkey, rhesus monkey and human) using antisera to these peptides and the unlabelled antibody-enzyme peroxidase antiperoxidase method. Magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus stained positively for vasopressin, oxytocin or neurophysin. Parvocellular neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) stained positively for vasopressin and neurophysin but not for oxytocin, in all four species. Magnocellular oxytocin, vasopressin and neurophysin neurons project to permeable capillaries in the neurohypophysis, as well as to various extrahypothalamic neural target areas including the central amygdala, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, lateral reticular nucleus, dorsal horn, central grey and intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord. In target areas, terminals contact somata and dendrites. Parvocellular vasopressin and neurophysin neurons of the SCN do not project to the neurohypophysis, and project only to neural target areas, including the lateral septum, mediodorsal thalamus, lateral habenula, mesencephalic central grey, medial amygdala and ventral hippocampus. (Due to the relatively poor tissue preservation in human autopsy specimens not all projections found in the other primates could be confirmed in humans.) These findings confirm and correlate well with previous descriptions made in rodents, and indicate that vasopressin, oxytocin and neurophysin projections to neural targets are present in primates. Peptides released from these projections probably do not enter the bloodstream, but are rather involved in neural mechanisms.
6808031	The efferent connections of the posterior hypothalamus have been analyzed autoradiographically in a series of eight cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brains with injections of 3H-amino acids in different regions of the mamillary complex and the surrounding areas. The medial mamillary nucleus was found to project through the mamillothalamic tract to the ipsilateral anteroventral, anteromedial, and interanteromedial nuclei, and by way of the mamillotegmental tract principally to the deep tegmental nucleus (of Gudden). It also appears to contribute fibers to the medial forebrain bundle, some of which reach as far rostrally as the medial septal nucleus. The lateral mamillary nucleus projects through the mamillothalamic tract bilaterally upon the anterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and through the mamillotegmental system to the dorsal tegmental nucleus; it also appears to contribute fibers to the medial forebrain bundle. The supramamillary area has extensive ascending and descending connections that are distributed with the medial forebrain bundle to the hypothalamus and rostral midbrain; in addition, it gives rise to an unusually well-defined projection to field CA2 of the hippocampus and to a narrow zone overlying the outer part of the granule cell layer and the adjoining part of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We have not been able to distinguish the connections of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus from those of the caudal part of the lateral hypothalamic area: they both appear to contribute substantially to the ascending components of the medial forebrain bundle, and through its descending projection to the tegmental fields of the midbrain, the nucleus centralis superior of the raphe complex, the locus coeruleus, and the central gray as far caudally as the facial nerve. Their further projections to the spinal cord were not examined. Viewed broadly, and in the light of previous work, our observations confirm, once again, the constancy of the connections of the hypothalamus in the mammalian brain, and the pivotal position that the posterior hypothalamus occupies in the elaborate system of connections that links the limbic areas of the forebrain with the complex of structures that Nauta has aptly designated the "midbrain limbic region."
6809940	The dynamics of agent replication were studied at 8 levels of spinal cord and in 9 areas of brain of mice infected intraperitoneally with the 139A strain of scrapie agent. Replication in the CNS was first detectable at 2 levels of spinal cord between thoracic vertebrae 4 and 9. The onset of replication was progressively delayed by up to 4 weeks at increasingly lower levels of spinal cord. A similar trend was seen at higher levels of spinal cord and in brain. In brain, agent replication occurred first in medulla, then in the pons and midbrain, thalamus and hypothalamus and, finally, striatum, septum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These results are highly suggestive of spread of infection from peripheral sites of agent replication along autonomic fibres to midthoracic cord, followed by an ascending and descending spread of agent at an apparent rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mm/day until the whole CNS is infected. However, experiments involving sympathectomy gave inconclusive results and the evidence for neural spread of scrapie in the peripheral nervous system is circumstantial.
6816390	The organization of projection neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and in adjacent parts of the raphe nuclei medial to it (the central and rostral linear, and interfascicular nuclei), the mammillary body (the supramammillary region and the tuberomammillary nucleus), and the substantia nigra have been examined in the rat with Kuypers' retrograde double labeling method, and with a combined retrograde labeling (with true blue)-immunohistochemical method for the demonstration of dopaminergic neurons. First, the distribution, within the VTA and adjacent regions, of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells that project to terminal fields in the telencephalon (nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, pre- and supragenual fields of the anterior limbic cortex, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and entorhinal area), in the diencephalon (lateral habenula), and in the brainstem (locus coeruleus, and parabrachial nucleus) was determined. Then, 15 different combinations of injections of the tracers bisbenzimide and true blue into different terminal fields were made to determine whether individual cells in the region of the VTA send collaterals to more than one site. Taken together, the results indicate that essentially separate groups of cells in the VTA and adjacent regions of the raphe project to each terminal field. In addition, each group can be further divided into dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic components, although the proportion of dopaminergic cells in each group can vary from over 80% (e.g., to the nucleus accumbens) to less than 1% (to the lateral habenula and to the locus coeruleus). In addition, it was found that the supramammillary region, which contains a dense extension of the A10 cell group in its medial part, and the tuberomammillary nucleus, project to, or through, most of the regions injected with retrograde tracers. Virtually all of the projections from the VTA and adjacent regions are partially crossed, the percentage of cells on the uninjected side ranging from over 40% (e.g., for locus coeruleus injections) to only about 2% (e.g., for amygdalar injections). Most of the groups of projection neurons in the region of the VTA are considerably intermixed with the exception of those that project to the lateral septum, to the lateral habenula, and to the hippocampal formation, which are concentrated in ventral and medial parts of the VTA, and in the raphe nuclei medial to the VTA. It was concluded that in the ventral part of the midbrain, essentially separate groups of aminergic and non-aminergic neurons in both the reticular formation (VTA) and in the adjacent nuclei of the raphe project bilaterally to a variety of similar terminal fields in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and brainstem. Further work at the single cell level is needed to determine whether these cell groups are differentially innervated by known inputs to the VTA and adjacent regions, most of which appear to descend through the medial forebrain bundle from sites in the limbic system and hypothalamus.
6819376	In the regional distribution of I-3H-quinuclindinyl benzilate (3H-QNB) binding in human brains of neurologically unaffected cases, it was highest in the caudate nucleus which was followed by the putamen, amygdala, cerebral corteces and olfactory bulb and lowest in the substantia nigra. As to the regional distribution of 3H-spiroperidol binding in human control brains, it was highest in the caudate nucleus and was followed by the cerebral corteces, amygdala and lowest in the cerebellar cortex. In a case of striatonigral degeneration (SND), 3H-QNB binding in the putamen and thalamus was lowered and 3H-spiroperidol binding was decreased in the putamen, frontal and parietal corteces, Ammon's horn, amygdala and substantia nigra as compared to human brains of control cases. These results were noteworthy since no pathological changes were observed in the thalamus, cerebral corteces, amygdala and Ammon's horn in this case. The 3H-spiroperidol binding was increased by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra of rat brains by 17% as compared to the contralateral intact side. Conversely, 3H-spiroperidol binding was decreased by injection of kainic acid (KA) into the striatum of rat brains by 43% as compared to the contralateral intact side. This meant that dopamine receptors labelled by 3H-spiroperidol were at least partially localized at the postsynaptic site of the nigrostriatal dopamine neuron.
6828527	The local cerebral metabolism on glucose (l-CMRg) was evaluated in animals given methylphenidate (15 mg/kg) in order to investigate possible mechanisms of action of the drug. Significant increases in l-CMRg (p greater than 0.05) were found in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, inferior olive, red nucleus, lateral cerebellar cortex, ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus and the midbrain reticular formation. Significant decreases (p greater than 0.05) in l-CMRg were found in the motor cortex. These results suggest possible mechanisms for methylphenidate's action in attention deficit disorders.
6834064	Regional differences in peroxide levels in rat brain are relatively small but the highest levels were found in the substantia nigra. Lipid peroxides of rat whole brain were significantly increased (22%) immediately after exposure to oxygen at high pressure (OHP). However, this increase was transient. No significant difference from control was observed 3 h after exposure to OHP. The greatest increases were in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. The olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, corpus callosum, septum, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and inferior colliculus all showed moderate but significant increases, whereas the accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and amygdala showed no significant change. This regional difference in lipid peroxidation may indicate a regional susceptibility to the damaging effects of free radical reactions.
6840246	Three squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) received horseradish peroxidase injections in the anterior cingulate cortex at the level of the genu of the corpus callosum, a region yielding vocalization when electrically stimulated. Retrogradely labeled neurons were found at the cortical level within the dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10), orbital cortex (area 11), premotor cortex (areas 44, 6b, and 8), frontoparietal operculum, insula, cortex of the superior temporal sulcus, piriform cortex, subiculum, posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortex. Subcortical telencephalic projections came from the the claustrum, diagonal band of Broca, nucleus basalis Meynert, nuclei basalis lateralis and accessorius amygdalae, and cells at the periphery of globus pallidus. Diencephalic structures projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex were the thalamic nuclei anterior medialis, anterior ventralis, ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars medialis, medialis dorsalis, pulvinaris medialis, centralis superior lateralis and limitans; the intralaminar nuclei paracentralis, centralis lateralis and parafascicularis; and the midline nuclei periventricularis, parataenialis, centralis superior, centralis inferior, centralis medialis, and reuniens. In the hypothalamus, projections came from the periventricular, lateral and posterior part, as well as the supramamillary nucleus. Midbrain afferent fibers came from the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, medial substantia nigra, reticular formation, area praerubralis, nucleus peripeduncularis, and periaqueductal gray. The most posterior labeled neurons were found in the locus ceruleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, nucleus annularis, nucleus centralis superior Bechterew, nucleus dorsalis raphae and the most dorsomedial part of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Some of those projections have functional significance in the light of the hypothesis that the cingular cortex is involved in the volitional control of emotional reactions on the one hand and the influence of primary emotional reactions on intentional behavior on the other.
6841675	Afferents of the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) were retrogradely labelled by using a transcannula HRP gel technique in conjunction with tetramethylbenzidine neurohistochemistry to determine the sources of inputs to the nucleus which could potentially influence the descending antiociceptive raphe-spinal system. Large numbers of HRP-labelled neurons were seen in the frontal cortex, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, zona incerta, nucleus parafascicularis prerubralis (NPfPr), pretectum, dorsal and lateral periaqueductal gray, nucleus cuneiformis (NC), deep superior colliculus (dSC), a paraoculomotor cell group which may be the medial accessory nucleus of Bechterew, dorsal column nuclei, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. Smaller numbers of labelled cells were also observed in the preoptic area, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, ventral peri(third)ventricular gray, nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis, medial and lateral vestibular nuclei, and a subdivision of the hypoglossal nucleus. Confirmational anterograde autoradiographic studies were performed by injecting tritiated leucine into two of the principal sources of afferents to NRM: NPfPr, and dSC/NC. The results are compared with control HRP gel implants in the inferior olive, spinal cord, nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, and medial facial nucleus. Comments are also made concerning the parcellation of the ventromedial medulla and the possible role of both NRM and its afferents in central analgesic mechanisms.
6871685	The specific [3H]QNB binding and high-affinity uptake of [14C]choline in 8 brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, midbrain, cerebellum and brainstem) after repeated administration of DFP and atropine to guinea-pigs were simultaneously measured. Following repeated DFP administration, AChE was markedly depressed in each brain region. In these animals, there was a significant decrease in specific [3H]QNB binding in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, whereas the [3H]QNB binding in the rest of brain regions was unchanged. Scatchard analysis revealed a 36% decrease in the Bmax value for the striatal [3H]QNB binding without a change in the Kd value, suggesting a change in the receptor density. In contrast, repeated atropine administration produced a significant enhancement in the [3H]QNB binding only in the hippocampus and striatum. The Bmax value in the striatum increased by 21% without a change in the Kd value. In addition to the receptor alteration, high affinity uptake of [14C]choline in the hippocampus and striatum was significantly decreased by DFP treatment, while that in the striatum increased by atropine treatment. Thus the present study has demonstrated that a prolonged activation and blockade of central muscarinic receptors resulted in specific adaptation in both the receptor density and ACh availability at the synapses in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum.
6875644	It has been shown that the nucleus accumbens receives input from the amygdala and that mesolimbic dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) modulates the response of accumbens neurons to amygdala input. Since the nucleus accumbens projects to the ventral pallidum, the purpose of this study was to investigate, using electrophysiological techniques, whether or not the nucleus accumbens relays the projection from the amygdala to the ventral pallidum and whether or not the mesolimbic dopamine projection interacts with this pathway. Extracellular single-unit recordings were obtained from the ventral pallidum of urethan-anesthetized rats, and the responses of these neurons to electrical stimulation of the amygdala were investigated. Of 392 neurons tested, 36% were inhibited and 11% were excited following amygdala stimulation. Latency of onset of inhibitory responses showed a bimodal distribution with peaks in the ranges of 4-6 ms and 16-18 ms, respectively. Fifty-four percent of inhibitory responses with latencies greater than 12 ms were attenuated by 1) injection of procaine hydrochloride into the nucleus accumbens, or 2) injection of d-amphetamine into the nucleus accumbens, or 3) stimulation of VTA with a train of 10 pulses (10 Hz) prior to stimulation of amygdala. Acute administration of haloperidol intraperitoneally or injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the ipsilateral VTA, 2 days prior to the recording experiment, reduced the attenuating effects of intra-accumbens injection of d-amphetamine and VTA conditioning stimulations on the inhibitory response of ventral pallidal neurons to amygdala stimulation. These results support the hypothesis that the nucleus accumbens provides a link between the amygdala and the ventral pallidum. Since the amygdala is a limbic structure and the ventral pallidum has possible connections with the extrapyramidal motor system, it is suggested that the amygdala to nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum projection may be a bridge between the limbic and motor systems. We also suggest that this relay of output from the amygdala to the ventral pallidum via the nucleus accumbens is under the modulating influence of the mesolimbic dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area.
6877597	Afferent projections to the periaqueductal gray matter in the rat have been studied by use of the retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase. Iontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase were made in dorsal, lateral and medial areas of the periaqueductal gray, primarily at intercollicular levels. The pattern of projections was similar in all of the injections restricted to the periaqueductal gray. Within the brainstem, numerous reticular formation nuclei were labeled, including nucleus reticularis lateralis, nucleus raphe magnus, pallidus and obscurus, the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis, the paralemniscal nucleus and the dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei. At diencephalic levels, dense projections were seen from the parafascicular nucleus, dorsal premamillary nucleus, zona incerta, dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus and the retrochiasmatic area, in the ventral portion of the anterior hypothalamus. At forebrain levels, occasional cells were seen in the medial preoptic area, lateral septum and the anterior cingulate cortex. Control injections of horseradish peroxidase into structures adjacent to the periaqueductal gray matter included three well localized deposits in the dorsal raphe. Retrogradely-labeled cells were found in lateral reticular nucleus of the medulla, nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis, locus ceruleus, dorsal and ventral parabrachial nuclei, substantia nigra and the lateral hypothalamus. No labeled cells were found in the habenular nuclei. It is suggested that many of the descending hypothalamic and forebrain afferents may be relay centers for descending hippocampal formation efferents. Many of the periaqueductal gray afferent systems receive a direct projection from the hippocampal formation and could therefore coordinate influences from this limbic center with information on homeostatic mechanisms controlled by the hypothalamus. The numerous brainstem afferents to the periaqueductal gray could be involved in relay of ascending sensory information important for initiating any of several behavioral responses known to be controlled by the periaqueductal gray. In addition, certain raphe afferents might play a part in a feedback loop of the pain suppression circuit of which the periaqueductal gray is an important component.
6877601	The afferent connections of the mesencephalic reticular formation were studied experimentally in the rat by the aid of the retrograde horseradish peroxidase tracer technique. The results suggest that the rostral portion of the mesencephalic reticular formation receives its main input from the cerebral cortex, the zona incerta and the fields of Forel, the central gray substance, the nuclei reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis, and the deep cerebellar nuclei. Substantial input to the same territory of the mesencephalic reticular formation appears to come from the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra, the parabrachial area, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, whereas several other brain structures, among which the locus coeruleus and the raphe complex, seem to represent modest but consistent additional input sources. The afferentation of more caudal portions of the mesencephalic reticular formation appears to conform to the general pattern outlined above with only three exceptions; the cerebral cortex, the deep cerebellar nuclei and the spinal trigeminal nucleus seem to be relatively modest sources of projections to these levels. Considering that the mesencephalic reticular formation is a critical structure in the "ascending activating systems" the present results, confirming and extending those of many other investigators, characterize a set of pathways that seem to be an important part of the anatomical substrate of the sleep-walking cycle.
6886073	The neuronal distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase (GABA-T), the enzyme which metabolizes GABA, has been mapped in rat brain. The method involves staining for newly synthesized GABA-T by the previously established nitro blue tetrazolium technique in animals killed 8-48 hours after administration of gabaculine, an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-T. Neuronal staining is obscured by staining of other elements if initial suppression is inadequate or survival times postgabaculine are too long. With appropriate conditions, GABA-T-positive neuronal somata can be widely detected. The stained cells include neuronal groups previously reported to be GABAergic on the basis of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-colchicine immunocytochemistry and other methods, i.e.: Purkinje, basket, Golgi, and stellate neurons of the cerebellum; basket and stellate neurons of the hippocampus; granule and periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb; magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus; and neurons of the striatum, pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, cortex, medial septal area, diagonal band, substantia innominata, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, substantia nigra, and dorsal raphe. Other cells that stain intensely for GABA-T and may be GABAergic include neurons in the midlateral septal area, accumbens, the central medial and basal nuclei of the amygdala, zona incerta, the brainstem reticular formation, central gray, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and various thalamic nuclei including the periventricular, intralaminar, rhomboid, and subparafascicular. Known non-GABA neuronal groups are negative for GABA-T staining under these conditions, reinforcing the hypothesis that GABA neurons are far more GABA-T intensive than other neurons.
6891754	The activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was studied in the brain of Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 200-250 g. In this study, animals were maintained at a temperature of 21 +/- 1 degree C and a 12:12 h light--dark cycle for a minimum of 3 weeks prior to any experimentation. Animals were sacrificed at 06.00 h and 18.00 h and the brain cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata and cerebellum were isolated and assayed for ODC activity. The data show significant diurnal variations (P less than 0.05) in hypothalamus, midbrain, medulla oblongata and cerebellum, with peak values during the active phase of the animal. Other brain parts studied did not show any significant diurnal variations.
6914676	In anaesthetized cats, right cardiac vagal branches were electrically stimulated and recordings of evoked 'slow wave' and single neurone activity were made in the brain stem. Short-latency 'slow wave' and multi-neuronal activity evoked by excitation of myelinated vagal afferent fibres were recorded in the medial and lateral subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarius, the area postrema, the dorsal vagal motor nucleus, the lateral reticular formation and the nucleus ambiguus. Long-latency responses evoked by vagal non-myelinated fibres were recorded in the medial subnucleus of the nucleus tractus solitarius, the area postrema, dorsal vagal motor nucleus, the parahypoglossal area and the lateral reticular formation dorsal to the nucleus ambiguus. A specific study was made of seventy-two single neurones activated by non-myelinated afferent fibres in the cardiac branch. Thirty-four were shown to be synaptically activated, twenty-one were activated nonsynaptically and seventeen could not be classified. One neurone was also activated by myelinated cardiac afferent fibres, and two by thoracic vagal (including pulmonary) afferent fibres. Neurones were not spontaneously active. Indirect evidence suggests that the majority of the recordings of nonsynaptically activated neurones were likely to be from cell bodies. Neurones were located from the level of the obex to 3.0 mm rostral to it in the medial subnucleus of the nucleus tractus solitarius (45), and in the lateral subnucleus (2), the area postrema and its border with the medial subnucleus of the nucleus tractus solitarius (13), the dorsal vagal motor nucleus (9), the parahypoglossal area (1) and the lateral reticular formation dorsal to nucleus ambiguus (2). Recordings were made from fifteen neurones activated by myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagal branches, and twelve were excited synaptically. The neurones were located in the medial (8) and lateral (3) subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarius, the dorsal vagal motor nucleus (1) and the lateral reticular formation (1). Four neurones were also excited by vagal afferent fibres in the thoracic vagal nerve immediately caudal to the caudal cardiac branch.
6950419	Immunoreactive calcitonin (CT), indistinguishable from human CT-(1-32) and its sulfoxide, has been identified in extracts of the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the thyroid obtained from human subjects at autopsy. DCT concentrations were highest in a region encompassing the posterior hypothalamus, the median eminence, and the pituitary; intermediate in the substantia nigra, the anterior hypothalamus, the globus pallidus, and the inferior colliculus; and low in the caudate nucleus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Specific CT binding measured with 125I-labeled salmon CT was highest in homogenates of the posterior hypothalamus and the median eminence, shown to contain the highest concentrations of endogenous CT in the brain; CT binding was less than 12% of hypothalamic binding in all of the other regions of the brain examined and was negligible in the pituitary. Half-maximal binding was achieved with 0.1 nM nonradioactive salmon CT-(1-32), and the binding was directed to structural or conformational sites, or both, in the COOH-terminal half of salmon CT. The rank order of the inhibition of the binding by CT from different species and analogues of the human hormone was the same as in receptors on a human lymphoid cell line (Moran, J., Hunziker, W. & Fischer, J. A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 3984-3988). The functional role of CT and of its binding sites in the brain remains to be elucidated.
6974034	Horseradish peroxidase, 13% Sigma Type VI, was administered iontophoretically to the mid lateral hypothalamus (LH) of male hooded rats. Animals were perfused intracardially on the following day and brains were removed and sliced in the coronal or sagittal planes into 30-50 micrometer sections. Sections were processed with DAB and BDH for the brown and blue reaction products and later examined by bright and dark field microscopy for the presence and location of retrogradely labeled neurons. Results indicate that a significant number of afferent connections to the LH originate in the olfactory and accumbens nuclei, pyriform cortex, olfactory tracts, magnocellular and medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic regions, stria terminalis, stria hypothalamic tract, diagonal tract of Broca, caudate-putamen and globus pallidus, internal capsule, lateral septal nuclei, lateral preoptic area and anterior medial forebrain bundle, the various amygdaloid nuclei, zona incerta, perifornical region, dorsal and ventral medial hypothalamic areas, supraoptic, paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus and medial forebrain bundle, ventral thalamic nuclei, the fields of Forel, arcuate and mammillary nuclei, adjacent to the fasciculus retroflexus, in the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, mesencephalic reticular formation, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus and parabrachial region. Results are discussed in terms of previous anatomical and neurophysiological data, probable pathways, and the function of LH neurons.
6986435	The distribution of glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI, D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol isomerase) in mouse nervous tissue has been determined at the light microscopic level by immunofluorescence and histochemical procedures. The fluorescence procedure, which utilizes anti-GPI antibodies, detected lower levels of GPI than the histochemical procedure, which relies upon the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The distribution of GPI in nervous tissue is very similar to that of hexokinase. High levels of GPI were found in the Purkinje cells, the molecular layer, and the glomeruli of the granular layer in the cerebellar cortex; the pontine nuclei and the inferior olivary nuclei of the pons and medulla; the neurons of the thalamus and hypothalamus; the pyramidal cells, the dentate nuclei, and Ammons' horn of the cerebral cortex; the ventral horn cells of the spinal cord; and ventricular cells, choroid plexus cells, and the leptomeninges. The neuropil throughout the central nervous system (CNS) stained uniformly with moderately high levels of GPI. No GPI was observed in the myelin sheaths of the CNS.
6986955	Immunoperoxidase technique and light microscopy were used to investigate the distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in mouse and rat brain. Both 50 micrometers unmounted cryostat and 6 micrometers deparaffinized sections were studied in coronal or sagittal plane. At least 4 different major VIP systems were found: (1) an intracerebral cortical system; (2) one innervating the central amygdala and nucleus of the stria terminalis; (3) a pathway originating in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypo thalamus; and (4) another originating in the central grey of the midbrain. Specific cell body staining was seen in the limbic and neocortex, in the basal-caudal portion of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and in the central grey of the midbrain. Heavy terminal field patterns were noted in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, central amygdaloid nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and nucleus accumbens. Fiber density was moderate in the tuberculum olfactoriu, anterior hypothalamus including the medial preoptic area, mediobasal hypothalamus (especially dorsomedial region), periventricular thalamus, lateral lemniscal system, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus solitarius, and area postrema. Fibers could be traced dorsally from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Scattered cell bodies and fibers were found in a number of other forebrain and brain stem areas with only a rare fiber seen in median eminence.
6989900	Using 100-micron thick Vibratome sections and a modification of the peroxidase--antiperoxidase method of immunocytochemical staining we achieve a Golgi-like image of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) cells and fibers in mouse brain. Five LHRH pathways are described: 1) A dense projection of fibers from LHRH cells in the medial preoptic and septal areas to the wall of the third ventricle; 2) a projection of fibers from neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus of the anterior commissure to the subfornical organ; 3) projections of fibers from neurons in the medial septal nucleus and the diagonal band of Broca to the olfactory bulb; 4) fibers which travel within or just lateral to the wall of the third ventricle from the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis to the median eminence; 5) cells and fibers located just dorsal to the optic tracts which project rostrally to the preoptic area and caudally to the level of the median eminence where they course medially to converge and enter the median eminence.
6994891	Vibratome sections of male hamster brains were treated immunohistochemically with LHRH antiserum, and the anatomical distribution of LHRH immunoreactive cells and nerve fibers was assessed. LHRH-cell bodies are found in the ventral hypothalamus that includes its preoptic, anterior and central parts, in the septum, the olfactory tubercle, the main and accessory olfactory bulb, and the prepiriform cortex. In addition, extracerebral LHRH-neurons and ganglia exist in LHRH-positive nerves at the ventromedial surface of the olfactory tubercle and bulb as well as in olfactory nerves. Dense networks of LHRH-immunoreactive fibers are found in all regions where LHRH-cell bodies exist. Intraseptal connections reach the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, the subfornical organ, and the lateral ventricle. Dorsolateral projections from the septum can be traced via the fimbria hippocampi and alveus to the ventral hippocampus, via the stria terminalis to the amygdala and piriform cortex. Ventrolateral projections extend from the level of the olfactory tubercle and preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area via the ventral amygdalofugal pathway to the prepiriform and piriform cortex as well as the amygdala. Dorsal supracallosal projections via the stria longitudinalis are seen in the induseum griseum and the cingulate cortex. Caudal efferents reach the havenula, interpeduncular nucleus, midbrain raphe, and central gray of the rostral fourth ventricle via the stria medullaris and fasciculus retroflexus and by a ventral projection via the periventricular and subventricular hypothalamus. A major portion of this ventrocaudal projection gives rise to a dense network in the median eminence. Anatomical relationships of LHRH-fibers to certain regions of the inner ventricular and outer brain surface are noted.
6997242	An immunohistochemical assay for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) has been developed, validated by parallel radioimmunoassay and a series of tests with monoamines or related molecules, and applied to the detection of 5HT in rat brain sections. The procedure seems to be more sensitive and specific than the classical Falck-Hillarp technique. Among amines and related compounds tested, only 5-methoxytryptamine has been found to cross-react. 5HT-immunoreactive neurons and/or fibres have been observed in the spinal cord, brain stem, hypothalamic nuclei, epiphysis and subcommissural organ, thalamus, striatum, corpus callosum, amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, and cerebral cortex.
7019273	The immunocytochemical localization of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity (ELI) throughout the rat central nervous system (CNS) was investigated. The detection of ELI-containing structures was facilitated through the use of (1) brains from colchicine-treated rats, (2) the proteolytic pretreatment of sections with pronase and (3) the "double-bridge" staining technique. Our findings confirm the presence of ELI in perikarya, neuronal processes and terminals in many areas of the CNS. In addition, the localization of ELI-containing perikarya is reported for the first time in the following areas: the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tubercle, the lateral preoptic nucleus, several nuclei within the amygdaloid nuclear complex, the hippocampus, the neocortex, the cingulate cortex, the posterior mammillary nucleus, the medial nucleus of the optic tract, the brachium of the inferior colliculus, the ventral tegmental nucleus, the locus ceruleus, the sub-ceruleal region, the lateral trapezoid nucleus, the nucleus reticularis lateralis, and lamina VII of the cervical spinal cord. Our results demonstrate ELI in neurons which are heterogeneous in size, some probably functioning as interneurons and others as projection neurons in different areas of the CNS. The location of these neurons within the brain suggests that these pentapeptides serve diverse functions which include, in addition to nociception, the regulation of neuroendocrine, respiratory, auditory, vestibular, and olfactory functions.
7019274	The topographical distribution of enkephalin in the central nervous system of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, has been studied by the immunoperoxidase technique with antiserum to leucine-enkephalin. Immunoreactive enkephalin perikarya, fibers and probably terminals are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, which agrees well with the distribution of enkephalins in the mammalian brain. Enkephalin-containing perikarya are found in the subpallium (septum, nucleus accumbens, striatum, amydgala), preoptic and hypothalamic region, ventromedial nucleus and ventromedial area of thalamus, pretectal geniculate nucleus and posterodorsal nucleus of pretectum, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, locus ceruleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, medial parvocellular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Enkephalinergic fibers and terminals are found in the above-mentioned areas as well as in the pallium (medial and dorsal cortex, dorsal ventricular ridge), dorsomedial and anterior dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus, habenula, nucleus of the stria medullaris, torus semicircularis, mesencephalic tegmental area, interpeduncular nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, central gray, reticular formation, raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, isthmus region, and nucleus of the trapezoid body. Enkephalinergic pathways appear to exist between the septum and the medial cortex, nucleus accumbens and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, striatum and certain mesencephalic structures, hypothalamus and tegmentum, and between nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and torus semicircularis. In the pituitary, cells of the pars intermedia, and certain cells of the rostral pars distalis also show immunoreactivity to enkephalin antiserum. The distribution of enkephalin immunoreactivity throughout the hypothalamus and in the median eminence suggests involvement in neuroendocrine regulation. Presence of enkephalin in many extrahypothalamic brain areas indicates its important role in various sensory functions and in behavioral and autonomic integration.
7024329	The distribution of Met-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in the brains of 2-week-old domestic chicks was studied with immunohistofluorescence and the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, using antibodies to Met-enkephalin generated in rabbits. Immunoreactive cell bodies were found in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon in areas as yet uncharacterized as discrete nuclei in birds (E-1, E-2, E-3, E-4, E-5); further cells were located in the diencephalic nucleus spiriformis lateralis, the midbrain medial intercollicular nucleus (E-6), the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis, the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and dorsal occulomotor nucleus; and in the nucleus of cranial nerve X and an uncharacterized area in the dorsolateral medulla (E-7). Immunoreactive fibers and/or terminals were located around the immunoreactive cell bodies and, in addition in the lateral septal area of the telencephalon; in the preoptic and hypothalamic areas of the diencephalon; in the anterior intercollicular area, periaqueductal central gray, area C, and the midventral tegmentum of the mesencephalon; in the nucleus solitarius, nucleus IX-X, nucleus intercalatus, nucleus intermedius, and ventrolateral areas of the rhombencephalon. The pattern of distribution of met-enkephalin in the chick is compared with that in the rat. A possible functional role for Met-enkephalin in neural mechanisms mediating some behaviors of the chick is suggested.
7029494	Using the indirect immunofluorescent technique, bovine pancreatic polypeptide (BPP)-like immunoreactive nerve fibers and cell bodies were observed widely distributed in rat brain. A detailed stereotaxic atlas of BPP-immunoreactive neurons was prepared. Large numbers of BPP-containing perikarya were observed in the acute nucleus, with scattered cells in the cerebral cortex, nucleus olfactorius anterior, nucleus tractus diagonalis, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, neostriatum, nucleus interstitialis stria terminalis, nucleus preopticus medialis, area retrochiasmatica, zona interna of the median eminence, substantia grisea centralis, locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarius, and in the region of the nucleus reticularis lateralis. Large numbers of varicose BPP-like nerve fibers were observed in the following nuclei: accumbens, interstitialis stria terminalis, preopticus medialis, preopticus suprachiasmaticus, suprachiasmaticus, periventricular thalamic and hypothalamic, paraventricularis, dorsomedialis, ventromedialis, arcuatus, parabrachialis dorsalis, tractus solitarius and the substantia gelatinosa trigemini. The present findings suggest that a BPP-like peptide may be involved in significant neuronal circuitry, possibly in a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role. However, the exact identity of this peptide and its physiological role remain to be determined.
7050764	Using immunohistochemical techniques, the distribution of met-enkephalin fibers and terminals was studied in the central nervous system of adult old-world monkeys. Areas which showed the greatest density of immunoreactivity included substantia gelatinosa, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus parabrachialis, substantia nigra, median eminence, globus pallidus (external segment), patches within the striatum and the region of nucleus accumbens and the olfactory area. Striking and discrete zones of enkephalin immunoreactive fibers and terminals which did not conform to known nuclear boundaries were observed in the latter areas. The distribution of enkephalin in the monkey is compared to what has been described in the rat central nervous system. In general, the two species are similar, however, differences were observed in some areas including the hypoglossal nucleus, substantia nigra and in the region of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory area. The results are discussed with regard to the possible functional significance of enkephalin localization in regions related to regulation of pain, mood, and autonomic function.
7054390	A recent analysis of a group of patients with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) disclosed that a rapid rise in serum sodium from a hyponatremic baseline preceded the clinical onset of the disorder. To test the view that electrolyte derangements may be crucial in the pathogenesis of CPM, rats were given hypertonic saline following a three-day period of hyponatremia. Symmetrical, predominantly demyelinative lesions were found the neocortex, claustrum corpus striatum, external capsule, anterior commissure, hippocampus and its fimbria, thalamus, brainstem, tegmentum, and superior vermis of the cerebellum. This report details the histopathology and topography of these lesions and compares them with human CPM. The findings support the view that rapid rise in serum sodium may be responsible for the development of CPM in man.
7061654	This paper describes a new and highly sensitive assay for phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) activity with noradrenaline as substrate in various rat brain regions by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Commercially available noradrenaline contained about 0.27% of contaminating adrenaline, which was removed to reduce the blank value. Enzymatically formed adrenaline was adsorbed on an aluminum oxide column, eluted with 0.5 M hydrochloric acid, separated by high-performance reversed-phase paired-ion chromatography and measured with electrochemical detection. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzylamine was added to the incubation mixture as an internal standard after the reaction. This assay was very sensitive and 0.5 pmol of adrenaline formed enzymatically could be detected. This assay method was applied to measure PNMT activity in various rat brain regions. The highest activity was observed in the hypothalamus, pons plus medulla oblongata, septum, lower brain stem, and cerebral cortex; the lowest activity was in the striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and limbic brain.
7074727	The alterations in local cerebral glucose utilization in 58 anatomically discrete regions which occur during a period of hemorrhagic hypotension have been investigated in conscious rats, using the quantitative autoradiographic 14C-deoxyglucose technique. Hemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial pressure reduced by approximately 50 mm Hg) effected significant increases in glucose utilization in eight areas of the central nervous system, namely, the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (glucose utilization increased by 38%), the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (by 36%), locus coeruleus (by 38%), lateral habenular nucleus (by 40%), periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (by 41%), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (by 97%), supraoptic nucleus (by 86%), and the interstitial nucleus of the stria terminalis (by 84%). In five of these eight areas (nucleus of the tractus solitarius, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and the interstitial nucleus of the stria terminalis), a significant relationship could be demonstrated between the level of glucose utilization and mean arterial blood pressure. In the majority of the CNS regions examined (neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus, extrapyramidal and motor areas), hemorrhagic hypotension was without significant effect upon local cerebral glucose utilization. The results provide direct evidence of the functional involvement of specific brain areas of conscious rats (thus obviating complicating anesthetic influences) in the response of the CNS to hemorrhagic hypotension.
7078723	The retrograde transport technique was utilized in the present study to investigate the afferent projections to the periaqueductal gray of the rat. Iontophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase were made into the periaqueductal gray of 22 experimental animals and into regions adjacent to the periaqueductal gray in 6 control animal. Utilization of the retrograde transport method permitted a quantitative analysis of the afferent projections not only to the entire periaqueductal gray, but also to each of its four intrinsic subdivisions. The largest cortical input to this midbrain region arises from areas 24 and 32 in the medial prefrontal cortex. The basal forebrain provides a significant input to the periaqueductal gray and this arises predominantly from the ipsilateral lateral and medial preoptic areas and from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca. The hypothalamus was found to provide the largest descending input to the central gray. Numerous labeled cells occurred in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, the posterior hypothalamic area, the anterior hypothalamic area, the perifornical nucleus and the area of the tuber cinereum. The largest mesencephalic input to the periaqueductal gray arises from the nucleus cuneiformis and the substantia nigra. The periaqueductal gray was found to have numerous intrinsic connections and contained a significant number of labeled cells both above and below the injection site in each case. Other structures containing significant label in the midbrain and isthmus region included the nucleus subcuneiformis, the ventral tegmental area, the locus coeruleus and the parabrachial nuclei. The medullary and pontine reticular reticular formation provide the largest input to the periaqueductal gray from the lower brain stem. The midline raphe magnus and superior central nucleus also supply a significant fiber projection to the central gray. Both the trigeminal complex and the spinal cord provide a minor input to this region of the midbrain. The sources of afferent projections to the periaqueductal gray are extensive and allow this midbrain region to be influenced by motor, sensory and limbic structures. In addition, evidence is provided which indicates that the four subdivisions of the central gray receive differential projections from the brain stem as well as from higher brain structures.
7086502	Experimental hydrocephalus was induced in rabbits by intracisternal injection of kaolin suspension, and the concentration of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and their metabolites was determined in several brain regions. The NA concentration had decreased in the cerebellum, hypothalamus, and pons plus medulla oblongata, and increased in the caudate nucleus at 2 days after kaolin injection (the stage of early intracranial hypertension). At 1 week (the stage of progressive hydrocephalus), the NA content had returned to control levels in all brain regions studied, and it decreased again at 4 weeks (the stage of chronic hydrocephalus) in the pons plus medulla oblongata. The DA level was unchanged throughout the 4-week period after kaolin injection. The concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MOPEG-SO4), the major metabolite of NA, was elevated in all brian regions except the caudate nucleus at all stages after kaolin injection. An increase in MOPEG-SO4 in the caudate nucleus was also observed 1 week after kaolin injection. The content of homovanillic acid (HVA), the major metabolite of DA in the rabbit brain, was decreased in the cerebral cortex at 2 days and at 1 week after kaolin injection, and in the caudate nucleus at 2 days and at 1 week, and 4 weeks. The level of HVA was increased in the hypothalamus at 2 days, in the cerebellum at 2 days and at 1 week, in the pons plus medulla oblongata at 2 days, 1 week, and 4 weeks, and in the midbrain at 4 weeks. These data suggest that, in experimental hydrocephalus in the rabbit, NA release is increased throughout the brain, while DA release is decreased in the cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus, and increased in the cerebellum, hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons plus medulla oblongata.
7088221	After injections of horseradish peroxidase into the central tegmental field of the midbrain reticular formation and centrum medianum of the thalamus in the cat, labelled neurons were found in the nucleus of solitary tract, cuneate and gracile nuclei, spinal nuclei of trigeminal nerve, external nucleus and brachium nucleus of inferior colliculus, nuclei of the lemniscus lateralis in the area pretectalis, nucleus of the posterior commissure and stratum intermediale of the superior colliculus and in reticular structures of medulla and pons. It is concluded that midbrain reticular formation receives the main input from visceral and the centrum medianum from the somatic sensory nuclei.
7097270	The dose-dependent effects of two putative gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic agonists, muscimol and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(4,5-e)-pyridin-3-ol (THIP), upon local cerebral glucose utilisation in 60 discrete regions of the CNS have been examined in conscious rats using the [14C]2-deoxyglucose quantitative autoradiographic technique. The intravenous administration of muscimol (0.15-5 mg/kg) and THIP (1-10 mg/kg) resulted in a heterogeneous pattern of significantly reduced glucose utilisation throughout the CNS. The regional hierarchy of changes in glucose utilisation was similar for both muscimol and THIP in all regions (with the exception of the superior colliculus), with muscimol being approximately six times more potent in all regions investigated. The regions in which glucose utilisation was extremely sensitive to change, displaying reductions of approximately 40% following muscimol (1.5 mg/kg) or THIP (10 mg/kg) administration, included all layers of the neocortex (frontal, sensory motor, posterior parietal, primary auditory and visual cortices), the lateral portion of the caudate nucleus, and some thalamic nuclei (lateral geniculate body, mediodorsal and ventrolateral nuclei). Regions displaying more modest reductions in glucose utilisation, approximately 20% following muscimol (1.5 mg/kg) and THIP (10 mg/kg) administration, included most extrapyramidal regions (substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, medial portion of the caudate nucleus), a number of cortical and subcortical limbic areas (cingulate and olfactory cortices, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, anterior thalamus), and medial raphe nucleus. In contrast, in a large number of regions (including cerebellum and related nuclei such as the inferior olivary, red and vestibular nuclei, white matter, pontine reticular formation, hypothalamus, lateral habenula and amygdala), there were only minimal (approximately 10%) reductions in glucose utilisation following muscimol (1.5 mg/kg) and THIP (10 mg/kg) administration. In no region of the CNS was a significant increase in glucose utilisation observed with any concentration of either muscimol or THIP. The regional distribution of alterations in glucose utilisation following muscimol and THIP administration, which does not correspond to the known topography of GABAergic neurones and receptors, provides a comprehensive description of the functional alterations, as reflected in rates of glucose utilisation, that occur in conscious rats after systemic administration of these two putative GABAergic agonists.
7099426	The cortical afferentation of the nucleus accumbens in the cat was studied with the aid of retrograde tracing techniques. Retrograde experiments were carried out with horseradish peroxidase or one of the fluorescent tracers Bisbenzimid, Nuclear Yellow and Fast Blue. In the anterograde experiments [3H]leucine and [35S]methionine were used as tracers. Following injections in the nucleus accumbens, retrogradely-labelled cells were found in the medial frontal cortex, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the posterior part of the insular cortex, the endopiriform nucleus, the amygdalo-hippocampal area, the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and the subiculum of the hippocampal formation. In the medial frontal cortex most of the labelled cells were found in layers III and V of the prelimbic area (area 32 of Brodmann), but retrogradely-filled neurons were also present in the infralimbic area and in the caudoventral part of the lateral bank of the proreal gyrus. Retrogradely-labelled cells in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices were located in the deep cellular layers. Following large injections in the nucleus accumbens, retrograde labelling in the subiculum extended from the most dorsal, septal pole to the most ventral, temporal pole. Injections of anterograde tracers were placed in the frontal cortex, the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and the hippocampal formation. The prelimbic area was found to project via the internal capsule to mainly the rostral half of the nucleus accumbens, whereas in the caudal half of the nucleus only a lateral region receives frontal cortical fibres. Following injections in the infralimbic area only fibres passing through the nucleus accumbens were labelled. Afferents from the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices reach the nucleus accumbens by way of the external capsule and terminate mainly in a ventral zone of the nucleus accumbens. Afferents from the entorhinal area are distributed to the entire accumbens, whereas the termination field of the perirhinal afferents is largely restricted to the lateral part of the nucleus accumbens. Both the frontal cortex and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices appear to project also to the nucleus caudatus and the tuberculum olfactorium. These cortical areas also project to the contralateral striatum. Both anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments demonstrated a topographical relationship between the subiculum and the nucleus accumbens. The ventral pole of the subiculum projects via the fornix to the medial part of the caudal half of the nucleus accumbens and to a small dorsomedial area in its rostral half. Successively more dorsal portions in the subiculum project to successively more ventrolateral parts in the rostral nucleus accumbens. The projection from the hippocampus was found to extend also to the tuberculum olfactorium. The results of the present study do not provide unambiguous criteria for the delimitation of the nucleus accumbens in the cat.
7107986	The origin of cerebellar afferents was studied in various types of reptiles, viz., the turtles Pseudemys scripta elegans and Testudo hermanni, the lizard Varanus exanthematicus, and the snake Python regius, with retrograde tracers (the enzyme horseradish peroxidase and the fluorescent tracer "Fast Blue"). Projections to the cerebellum were demonstrated from the nucleus of the basal optic root, the interstitial nucleus of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, the vestibular ganglion, and the vestibular nuclear complex, two somatosensory nuclei, viz., the descending nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and the nucleus of the dorsal funiculus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the reticular formation, and throughout the spinal cord. A distinct bilateral projection to the cerebellum was found to arise in a nucleus previously called nucleus parvocellularis medialis (Ebbesson, '67). In the present study this cell mass is termed the perihypoglossal nuclear complex, considering its comparable position and fiber connections to the perihypoglossal nuclei in mammals. In all reptilian species studied a contralateral cerebellar projection of a cell mass located in the caudal brainstem adjacent to the nucleus raphes inferior was observed. It seems likely that this cell mass represents the reptilian homologue of the mammalian inferior olive. Most of the spinocerebellar fibers appeared to arise in neurons located in area VII-VIII of the gray matter. In this respect the origin of the spinocerebellar projection in reptiles resembles the origin of the rostral and ventral spinocerebellar tracts in mammals. No indications for the existence of a column of Clarke or a central cervical nucleus in the reptilian spinal cord were obtained. On comparison of the cerebellum afferents in reptiles with the known connections of the cerebellum in amphibians, birds, and mammals, a basic pattern of cerebellar afferent projections appears to exist in these vertebrate classes, including retinal, vestibular, precerebellar, somatosensory, and spinal afferents.
7107988	The existence of crossed multisynaptic pathways that allow for the interdependent control of activity in one substantia nigra and its contralateral counterpart has been inferred from a number of recent biochemical and neurophysiological investigations. This prompted a reexamination of the connections of the substantia nigra with an emphasis on crossed inputs to and crossed projections from that nucleus. Male albino rats received 20-50-nl pressure injections of a 1% wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horse-radish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) solution into the substantia nigra or into surrounding areas as controls. Following a 24-hour survival period the animals were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine protocol for the visualization of HRP. The pattern of anterograde transport of WGA-HRP after substantia nigra injections, confirming for the most part previous reports, demonstrated ipsilateral nigral efferent projections to the striatum; globus pallidus; subthalamic nucleus; the lateral dorsal, paralamellar mediodorsal, ventromedial, and parafascicular thalamic nuclei; central gray, midbrain reticular formation; superior colliculus; and peribrachial area, including the pedunculopontine nucleus. Additionally, the nigral projections to the paralamellar mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamic nuclei and to the superior colliculus were demonstrated to be bilateral. Most of these connections were confirmed by the complementary retrograde experiment. In accordance with previous reports, intranigral WGA-HRP injections retrogradely labeled neurons located in the ipsilateral prefontal cortex, motor cortex, striatum, globus pallidus, central nucleus of the amygdala, anterior hypothalamic area, subthalamic nucleus, and dorsal raphe. Additionally, labeled perikarya were observed in the ipsilateral parafascicular thalamic nucleus, in the contralateral posterior lateral hypothalamic area, and in the ipsilateral and contralateral peribrachial-pedunculopontine area. These latter nigral afferents were confirmed with complementary WGA-HRP injections into each of the regions of origin. While bilateral peribrachial-pedunculopontine innervation of the substantia nigra has been reported in the cat there has been no previous demonstration of a crossed nigral afferent system from the contralateral posterior lateral hypothalamic area. The results are discussed with reference to the pathways that may mediate the interdependent control of the activity of neurons in the left and right substantia nigra. Additionally, the association of the substantia nigra with a variety of neuronal circuits, including the cerebellofugal, tectothalamic, thalamocortical, thalamostriatal, and basal ganglia pathways, are discussed.
7119152	Previous studies have demonstrated that the lateral spiriform nucleus (SpL) of the avian pretectum receives a major input from the ipsilateral basal ganglia (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73) and projects to the ipsilateral optic tectum (Brecha et al., '76). The present study has further detailed the anatomical organization of the afferent and efferent connections of SpL, with particular reference to (1) the sources of afferent inputs to SpL, (2) the projection targets of SpL, and (3) the laminar termination pattern of the SpL projection to the tectum. The SpL was found to receive clear-cut major inputs from only three nuclei: (1) the ipsilateral paleostriatum primitivum (PP) of the basal ganglia (the avian homologue of the mammalian globus pallidus), (2) the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALa) of the diencephalon, and (3) the ipsilateral nucleus tegmentipedunculopontinus (TPc) of the mesencephalon. Both TPc and ALa have previously been noted themselves to receive major inputs from the ipsilateral PP (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73). Two other cell groups may give rise to a slight projection to the ipsilateral SpL: (1) the posterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALp) of the diencephalon and (2) the nucleus semilunaris (SLu) of the isthmic brainstem. The ALp also receives a major input from PP (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73). Two other cell groups may give rise to a slight projection to the ipsilateral SpL: (1) the posterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALp) of the diencephalon and (2) the nucleus semilunaris (SLu) of the isthmic brainstem. The ALp also receives a major input from PP (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73), while SLu receives a major tectal projection (Hunt and Kunzle, '76a). The ipsilateral tectum was found to be the only projection target of SpL. The present data suggest that the SpL projection to the tectum is restricted to layers 8-13, with layers 11-13 receiving the heaviest projection from SpL. Among layers 8-10, layer 9 receives the lightest projection from SpL. The present results indicate that SpL receives only a limited number of inputs, which in all likelihood relay largely basal ganglia input to SpL. Since SpL projects only to the tectum, the sole function of SpL apparently is the transmission of ipsilateral basal ganglia influences to the avian optic tectum. Tectal layers 8-15 have been previously found to represent the layers of origin of the descending pathways of the avian tectum to hindbrain motor and "premotor" cell groups (Reiner and Karten, '82). In view of the purported involvement of the basal ganglia in motor functions, the basal ganglia pathway to the ipsilateral tectum via SpL may represent a major route by which the avian basal ganglia exert influences over motor functions.
7119161	Repetitive left mystacial vibrissae movements were produced by electrical stimulation of right motor cortex (MI) were a bipolar electrode in the alert, unanesthetized rat. Regional increases of (14C) 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake were mapped autoradiographically during these left vibrissae movements. Uptake of 2DG increased in a 2-4-mm-diameter area about the stimulating electrode in right MI and in a smaller region in left MI cortex. Columnar increases of 2DG uptake occurred bilaterally in somatosensory cortex in the face region of somatosensory cortex (SI). Bilateral increases of 2DG uptake occurred subcortically in dorsolateral caudate-putamen (CP) and subthalamic nucleus. Primary right-sided increases of 2DG uptake occurred in other basal ganglia structures including dorsal globus pallidus (GP), posterior, entopeduncular nucleus (EPN), ventrolateral substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and anterolateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Uptake of 2DG increased on the right side of the following thalamic regions: much of the ventrolateral (VL) nucleus, particularly dorsally; the anterodorsal reticular nucleus; dorsolateral posteromedial (POm) nucleus; the ventromedial nucleus; and dorsolateral parafasicular nucleus. The anterior and ventral posterior portions of VL were not activated. Caudal to thalamus right-sided 2DG uptake increased in the medial, ventral, and lateral pontine nuclei, deep layers of superior colliculus, lateral deep mesencephalic nucleus (DMN), and nucleus cuneiformis (NCU). UPtake of 2DG increased in right rostral parvocellular and red nucleus in a few animals. Discrete portions of the right internal capsule and right medial pyramidal tract increased 2DG uptake during MI stimulation. Uptake of 2DG increased on the left side of the brain during right MI stimulation in the left lateral nucleus (NL) of cerebellum and in several discrete regions of left cerebellar hemisphere granule cells including anterior paravermis, lobulus simplex, crus II, and the paramedian lobule. Uptake of 2DG increased in left nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve (ntV) ventrally in subnuclei interpolaris and oralis. Left lateral portions of the facial nucleus were activated in a few animals. The lateral portions of the facial nucleus are known to project to vibrissae musculature. All of the above structures may be involved in the motor-sensory processing responsible for vibrissae movements. Regions not previously suggested to play a major role in vibrissae movements include DMN and NCU. Though NCU has been called the "locomotor center" it may play a role in facial movements as well. Polysynaptic activation of GP, EPN, NL, and cerebellar hemisphere occurred since no connections between MI and these regions exist. A pathway from ntV to POm to MI and SI is suggested to provide proprioceptive input to motor-sensory cortex from the moving vibrissae since neither the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus nor the ventrobasal nucleus of the thalamus increased 2DG uptake during MI stimulation.
7130476	HRP was injected into various thalamic nuclei in order to investigate the brainstem projections to the thalamus in the lizard Varanus exanthematicus. Nucleus dorsomedialis receives afferents from the septal area, nucleus entopeduncularis anterior, nucleus periventricularis hypothalami, area triangularis, nucleus raphes superior, nucleus reticularis inferior, and locus coeruleus. Nucleus dorsolateralis receives afferents from septal area, nucleus dorsomedialis, nucleus entopeduncularis anterior, nucleus periventricularis hypothalami, and the torus semicircularis. Nucleus rotundus receives an input from the tectum mesencephali, the pretectal area, and from the mesencephalic reticular formation. Nucleus intermedius dorsalis receives afferents from the dorsal column nuclei and nucleus periventricularis hypothalami. Nucleus ventrolateralis receives afferents from the dorsal column nuclei, the trigeminal complex, locus coeruleus, and the reticular formation. Nucleus ventromedialis also receives afferents from the trigeminal complex and the reticular formation. Afferents to the habenula have been demonstrated from the septal area, nucleus entopeduncularis anterior, triangular area, nucleus periventricularis hypothalami, nucleus interpeduncularis, nucleus raphes superior, locus coeruleus, nucleus isthmi, nucleus dorsalis motorius nervi vagi, and the mesencephalic tegmentum. The laminar part of the torus semicicularis projects to nucleus medialis.
7133406	The influences of the interpositus nucleus on pyramidal tract neurons were investigated by stimulating, in unanesthetized cats, interpositus nucleus foci which activated single muscles in limbs, while recording unitary discharges of pyramidal tract neurons located in foci (area 4 gamma) from which contraction was obtained in the same muscles as those excited from interpositus nucleus (agonist pyramidal tract neurons), in their antagonist (antagonist pyramidal tract neurons), or in heteronymous muscles (heteronymous pyramidal tract neurons). It was found that agonist pyramidal tract neurons were inhibited from the interpositus nucleus, whereas antagonist pyramidal tract neurons displayed a pure excitatory or an excitatory-inhibitory pattern, and the heteronymous neurons were not significantly influenced. A direct activation of interposito-thalamic efferents could be responsible for these effects. In fact, unitary discharge changes of pyramidal tract neurons, elicited from interpositus nucleus stimulation, persisted after chronic intermediate cortex ablation and dentate nucleus lesions, and disappeared following coagulations in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. These results suggest that interpositus nucleus efferents, which activate a given muscle, via the rubrospinal pathway, could inhibit the discharge of pyramidal neurons controlling that muscle, via collaterals direct to the thalamic ventrolateral nucleus.
7150950	The Mesulam technique for horseradish peroxidase was used to study the subcortical afferent projections to a location in the hypothalamus that has been shown to control the complete cardiovascular (CV) response accompanying a specific emotional behavior. Major projections common to all baboons injected included the lateral septal nucleus; medial, cortical and basal amygdala; the anteroventral third ventricle area; the preoptic areas; the subiculum; the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus; periventricular gray and the central gray of the midbrain; the midbrain tegmentum; locus ceruleus, parabrachial and raphe cells in the pons; and in the medulla, raphe nuclei, the nucleus of the solitary tract, in and around the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and in the region of the nucleus ambiguus. Other projections in some but not all baboons included the subfornical organ and the midline and dorsomedial nuclei of the thalamus. The nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca was labeled to some degree with all injections but was most heavily labeled with the injection extending more laterally in the hypothalamus. These results fit well with physiological and behavioral studies dealing with neural control of emotional and CV responses and support the concept of an integrative area in the hypothalamus concerned specifically with the control of CV response accompanying emotion.
7155344	The anterior portion of rodent agranular insular cortex consists of a ventral periallocortical region (AIv) and a dorsal proisocortical region (AId). Each of these two cortical areas has distinct efferent connections, but in certain brain areas their projection fields are partially or wholly overlapping. Bilateral projections to layers I, III and VI of medial frontal cortex originate in the dorsal agranular insular cortex and terminate in the prelimbic, anterior cingulate and medial precentral areas; those originating in ventral agranular insular cortex terminate in the medial orbital, infralimbic and prelimbic areas. The dorsal and ventral regions of the agranular insular cortex project topographically to the ipsilateral cortex bordering the rhinal fissure, which includes the posterior primary olfactory, posterior agranular insular, perirhinal and lateral entorhinal areas. Fibers to these lateral cortical areas were found to travel in a cell-free zone, between cortical layer VI and the claustrum, which corresponds to the extreme capsule. The dorsal and ventral regions send commissural projections to layer I, lamina dissecans and outer layer V, and layer VI of the contralateral homotopical cortex, via the corpus callosum. Projections from the ventral and dorsal regions of the agranular insular cortex to the caudatoputamen are topographically arranged and terminate in finger-like patches. The ventral, but not the dorsal region, projects to the ventral striatum and ventral pallidum. The thalamic projections of the ventral and dorsal regions are largely overlapping, with projections from both to the ipsilateral reticular nucleus and bilaterally to the rhomboid, mediodorsal, gelatinosus and ventromedial nuclei. The heaviest projection is that to the full anteroposterior extent of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus. Brainstem areas receiving projections from the ventral and dorsal regions include the lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe nucleus. In addition, the ventral region projects to the periaqueductal gray and the dorsal region projects to the parabrachial and ventral pontine nuclei. These efferent connections largely reciprocate the afferent connections of the ventral and dorsal agranular insular cortex, and provide further support for the concept that these regions are portions of an outer ring of limbic cortex which plays a critical role in the expression of motivated, species-typical behaviors.
7172216	The hypothalamo-extrahypophyseal neurophysin pathways (HEH) and the three hypothalamic nuclei secreting neurophysins, the supraoptic (SON), paraventricular (PVN) and suprachiasmatic (SCN) nuclei, of normal and hypophysectomized rats were studied by application of the immunoperoxidase procedure. Eight well-defined HEH pathways were recognized. Their main sites of projection were: lateral septum and subfornical organ (1 and 2); tractus diagonalis (3); medial nucleus of the amygdala and lateral ventricle (4); nucleus periventricularis thalami, nucleus habenulae lateralis and periaqueductal gray (5); periaqueductal gray, pineal organ, collicular recess and subependymal region of the fourth ventral (6); dorsomedial nucleus and premammillary area (7); perimammillary region, corpus trapezoideum, ventral surface of medulla oblongata, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus commissuralis, substantia gelatinosa and formatio reticularis lateralis of the medulla oblongata and spinal cord (8). Neurophysin fibers of unknown origin were found in the frontal cerebral cortex. It was noted that in pathway 5 the amount of immunostainable material undergoes changes with age. The three neurophysin-secreting nuclei reacted differently following hypophysectomy. Among the HEH pathways the only one that seemed to be affected by hypophysectomy was that innervating the lateral septum. It is suggested that the neurons that survive hypophysectomy either do not project to the neural lobe or, alternatively, display axon collaterals projecting outside the neural lobe. Such a neuronal population could be the origin of the HEH pathways.
7174906	The afferent connections of the insula in the rhesus monkey were studied with axonal transport methods. Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the insula revealed labeled neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the lateral orbital region, the frontoparietal operculum, the cingulate gyrus and adjacent medial cortex, the prepiriform olfactory cortex, the temporal pole, the cortex of the superior temporal sulcus, the rhinal cortex, the supratemporal plane, and the posterior parietal lobe. Tritiated amino acid (TAA) injections in some of the cortical regions which contained retrogradely labeled neurons confirmed projections to the insula from prefrontal granular cortex, orbital frontal cortex, prepiriform cortex, temporal pole, rhinal cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal operculum, and parietal cortex. In these studies, cortical areas that projected to the insula also projected to the claustrum. However, the topographic and quantitative relationships between the projections into the insula and those into the claustrum were inconsistent. Moreover, the claustrum has additional connections which it does not share with the insula. A selected review of the literature suggests that the claustrum and insula differ widely also with respect to ontogenesis and functional specialization.
7177380	Efferent projections of the zona incerta were examined in the rat using the autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase methods, with special reference to the cytoarchitectonic structure of the zona incerta. Autoradiographic experiments showed that the incertofugal fiber systems reach ipsilaterally to the thalamus (lateral dorsal, central lateral, ventral lateral geniculate, parafascicular, subparafascicular and reuniens nuclei, and posterior nuclear complex), to the hypothalamus (dorsal, lateral and posterior hypothalamic areas), to the tectum (medial pretectal area, deep pretectal and pretectal nuclei, superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray) and to the midbrain tegmentum, pons and medulla oblongata (subcuneiform, cuneiform and red nuclei, nuclei of the posterior commissure and Darkschewitsch, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, oral and caudal pontine reticular nuclei, nucleus raphe magnus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, pontine gray and inferior olivary complex). Contralaterally, incertal efferent fibers reach to the zona incerta. Cells of origin of the incertofugal fiber systems to the tectum, thalamus, tegmentum and spinal cord were examined using the retrograde horseradish peroxidase method. Cells of origin of the incertotectal pathway are located mainly in the ventral and causal parts of the zona incerta and partly in the antero-polar, dorsal and postero-polar parts. Cells projecting to the thalamus (at least to the lateral dorsal and central lateral nuclei) are situated in the ventral and caudal parts of the zona incerta, but they are rare in the other incertal structures. Cells of origin of the incertotegmental system are located mainly in the dorsal, magnocellular and caudal parts and partly in the antero- and postero-polar parts, but they are not situated in the ventral part. Cells of the magnocellular part project more caudally to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord than those of the other parts of the zona incerta. Forel's field contains many cells projecting to the tegmentum. The results provide good evidence that the cells of origin of efferent projections are topographically organized and are related to cytoarchitectonic areas within the zona incerta.
7193065	Quiet attack was elicited by electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral midbrain tegmentum of the cat. The paw was not used other than to position or hold the rat during the bite. Bites were directed toward the head and neck region and were not accompanied by autonomic responses other than pupillary dilation and sometimes slight piloerection on the back. Horseradish peroxidase was deposited at the attack sites. Cells labeled with the peroxidase reaction product were located in gyrus propreus, gyrus genualis, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, bed nucleus of the anterior commissure, nucleus of the diagonal band, substantia innominata, anterior amygdaloid area, ventromedial hypothalamic area, paraventricular nucleus, perifornical hypothalamic area, lateral hypothalamic area, dorsal hypothalamic area, field of Forel, midbrain reticular formation, superior colliculus, ventral central grey, lateral central gray, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nuclei, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, oral pontine reticular nucleus, and the dorsal raphe. Other regions were less prominently labeled. Previous studies have shown most of these sites to have some involvement in attack.
7204659	The thalamocortical projections to limbic cortex in the cat have been studied with retrograde and anterograde axonal transport techniques. Five limbic cortical areas were identified on the basis of cytoarchitecture. The five areas are the anterior limbic area, the cingular area, the dorsal and ventral retrosplenial areas, and the presubiculum. Each of these cortical areas received small injections of horseradish peroxidase, and the afferent thalamic nuclei were identified by retrograde labelling of cells. The cortical projection of each of the anterior thalamic nuclei and the lateral dorsal nucleus was determined autoradiographically. Each of the anterior thalamic nuclei and the lateral dorsal nucleus projects to limbic cortex by two pathways. One group of fibers leaves the rostral thalamus by the fornix, pierces the corpus callosum, joins the cingulate fasciculus to reach limbic cortex. The other group travels through the lateral thalamic peduncle and internal capsule. The anterior ventral nucleus projects primarily to the dorsal retrosplenial area, particularly to layer I, the deep portion of layer II, and superficial portion of layer III. Sparse projections also exist to the ventral retrosplenial area, the cingular area, and the presubiculum. Very sparse projections to the anterior limbic area are seen. The anterior dorsal nucleus projects primarily to the ventral retrosplenial area, particularly layers I, the deep portion of layer II, and superficial layer III. sparse projections exist to the dorsal retrosplenial area and presubiculum, but apparently no projections exist to the cingular or anterior limbic area. The anterior medial nucleus projects primarily to layers I and superficial III of the ventral retrosplenial area. sparse projections exist to each of the other limbic cortical areas. The lateral dorsal nucleus projects extensively onto limbic cortex. Prominent projections occur to layer I, the external granular layer and lamina dessicans of the presubiculum, layers I and III-IV of the dorsal retrosplenial area, and layers I, III, and IV of the cingular area. Sparse projections occur to the ventral retrosplenial area and the anterior limbic areas. Thalamocortical projections also originate in the midline and intralaminar nuclei including the central medial, reuniens, rhomboid, paracentral, central lateral, and central dorsal nuclei. These data indicate that the anterior thalamic nuclei project upon limbic cortex in a complex manner. Further, the projections to limbic cortex from the anterior nuclei overlap with projections from the lateral dorsal nucleus. This overlap of thalamic projections onto limbic cortex suggests a convergence of information from nonprimary sensory systems with information from the classical limbic system.
7229134	The ascending auditory projections to central nucleus of inferior colliculus and its ventrolateral and dorsomedial subdivisions (ICVL and ICDM) have been studied in cat using both pressure and electrophoretic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The results indicate that the predominant ascending projections to inferior colliculus originate in (1) contralateral cochlear nucleus, (2) contralateral and ipsilateral lateral superior olive, (3) ipsilateral medial superior olive, (4) ipsilateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, (5) ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and (6) contralateral inferior colliculus. In addition, ipsilateral cochlear nucleus, ipsilateral and contralateral intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, ipsilateral, and to a lesser extent contralateral, periolivary nuclei project to inferior colliculus. Of these nuclei, the lateral superior olive projects exclusively to ICVL and ipsilateral cochlear nucleus and contralateral inferior colliculus project mostly, if not exclusively, to ICDM. Many of these projections demonstrate a cochleotopic organization and frequency a nucleotopic organization as well. A cochleotopic organization of the projections is apparent for cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex. A nucleotopic organization suggests that the heaviest terminations of contralateral inferior colliculus are medial and dorsal in inferior colliculus, of medial superior olive are dorsal and lateral, of superior olivary complex are rostral, of cochlear nucleus are caudal, and of ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus are caudal.
7237165	The efferent connections of the zona incerta (ZI) were studied experimentally in the rat by the aid of the autoradiographic tracer technique. Small microelectrophoretic injections of tritiated proline and leucine practically confined to the ZI were found to label a widespread, predominantly ipsilateral system of descending and ascending fibers distributed to reticular structures of the brain stem (mesencephalic reticular formation, nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta, parabrachial area, nuclei reticularis pontis oralis, pontis caudalis, gigantocellularis and medullae oblongatae, pars ventralis), precerebellar nuclei (nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, pontine nuclei and inferior olivary complex), the middle and deep layers of the superior colliculus, the pretectum (anterior, posterior and medial pretectal nuclei), perioculomotor nuclei (interstitial nucleus of Cajal, nucleus of Darkschewitsch and nuclei of th posterior commissure), the parvocellular portion of the red nucleus, the central gray substance, the nucleus tegmenti dorsalis lateralis, the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord, non-specific thalamic nuclei (parafascicular, centralis medius, paracentralis, centralis lateralis and ventromedial thalamic nuclei, nucleus reuniens), basal ganglia (entopeduncular nucleus and globus pallidus), hypothalamic structures (posterior hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas), and a subpallidal district of the substantia innominata. Isotope injections centered in Forel's field H1 resulted in the labeling of a similar set of projections. Some of the possible functional correlates of these connections are briefly discussed.
7263959	In the present study an attempt has been made to analyze the ascending reticular projections in the lizard Varanus exanthematicus by means of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. Reticular projections ascending to the telencephalon were found to arise in the mesencephalon, but not caudal to the mesorhombencephalic border. HRP injections into the dorsal thalamus have demonstrated retrogradely labeled cells in the mesencephalic reticular formation, particularly at the level of the oculomotor nerve and in the medial magnocellular zone of the rhombencephalic reticular formation, predominantly rostrally. HRP infiltrations at the mesodiencephalic border damaged most of the fibers passing beyond this junction, resulting in the uptake of HRP by the damaged axons and subsequent labeling of the cell bodies or origin of ascending reticular projections to the diencephalon and telencephalon. From a comparison of cell-labeling patterns in cases of HRP injections of, respectively, the dorsal thalamus and the mesodiencephalic border, it seems likely that the nucleus reticularis medius and more sparsely the nucleus reticularis inferior project to ventral diencephalic structures (ventral thalamus and hypothalamus), whereas the midbrain reticular formation and the rostral parts of the rhombencephalic reticular formation (nuclei reticulares isthmi and superior) project to both the dorsal thalamus and more ventral diencephalic structures. Projections arising throughout the rhombencephalic reticular formation, but predominantly in the nucleus reticularis inferior, were found to ascend to the midbrain reticular formation. The present experimental data in the lizard Varanus exanthematicus are comparable to the findings in mammals, with the exception of the reticulo-oculomotor pathways which have not been analyzed so far in reptiles. In addition to the aforementioned ascending reticular projections, the present study has demonstrated projections ascending from monoamine cell groups, various diencephalic structures, as well as from neuronal groups involved in somatosensory, auditory, and gustatory systems. Projections were found from the locus coeruleus and the nucleus raphes superior to the telencephalon, as well as from the substantia nigra and the presumable reptilian homologue of the mammalian ventral tegmental area to the basal forebrain and the dorsal thalamus. Bilateral projections were demonstrated from the principal trigeminal nucleus to the telencephalon, reminiscent of the quintofrontal tract of birds. Ascending projections to the diencephalon were found to originate bilaterally in the descending trigeminal nucleus and the dorsal funicular nucleus. Auditory projections to the midbrain arise bilaterally in the superior olivary complex and in the cochlear nuclear complex. Finally, the ascending gustatory pathway arising in the nucleus of the solitary tract was found to project to the "parabrachial region," which in its turn has extensive projections to the forebrain.
7264641	Rats were treated chronically with manganese chloride from conception onward for a period of over 2 years in order to study the effects of manganese and aging on the activities of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons and medulla, striatum, midbrain, and cerebral cortex (which included the hippocampus). Manganese-treated 2-month-old and 24- to 28-month-old rats and age-matched controls were studied. In control rats during aging the activities of GAD decreased in hypothalamus (19%), pons and medulla (28%), and midbrain (22%) whereas the activities of AChE decreased in all regions (20-48%), particularly in the striatum (44-48%). Changes in ChAT activities in aging were observed only in one region-a decrease (23%) in the striatum. Life-long treatment with manganese appeared to abolish partially the decreases in aging in AChE activities in hypothalamus, cerebellum and striatum, and striatal ChAT activity. Manganese treatment also seemed to abolish the age-related decreases GAD activities, since GAD activities in various brain regions of manganese-treated senescent rats were not significantly different from those of control young rats. These results are discussed in relation to other metabolic changes associated with aging and manganese toxicity.
7264716	We have localized muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat brainstem by a light microscopic autoradiographic method. Initially, we examined the kinetics and specificity of the binding of radiolabeled quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) in slide-mounted, frozen tissue sections to determine that we were labeling the muscarinic cholinergic receptors as they had been described previously in biochemical pharmacological studies. Subsequently, using optimal binding parameters to obtain high specific to nonspecific ratios, we labeled tissue sections and generated autoradiograms by the apposition of emulsion-coated coverslips. We found high concentrations of autoradiographic grains associated with many nuclei in the brainstem including the superior colliculus, nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, pontine nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, trigeminal nerve nucleus (V), the tegmental nuclei, nucleus of the facial nerve (VII), the locus coeruleus, the medial vestibular nucleus, cochlear nucleus, of the tractus solitarius, and nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve (XII). We conclude that muscarinic cholinergic effects of acetylcholine and important in the normal function of both the sensory and motor systems. We speculate on the possible mechanisms of action of certain cholinergic agents, such as the mechanism of anticholinergic compounds when used to treat motion sickness or anticholinesterase poisoning.
7267404	Secretin immunoreactivity in rat and pig brain has been identified and characterized utilizing a highly specific radioimmunoassay and fractionation on a high pressure liquid chromatographic system reverse phase column. One immunoreactive peak from each brain extract was observed. Secretin immunoreactivity from rat brain and duodenum coelute, but eluted slightly ahead of the immunoreactivity from pig brain and duodenum and from synthetic porcine secretin. Immunoreactive secretin is widely distributed in the thalamus, hypothalamus and olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, midbrain, septum, striatum, hippocampus, medulla and pons. The highest concentrations occur in the pineal and the pituitary gland.
7279106	Repeated audiogenic seizures (4 times a day for 14 days), in genetically selected sensitive mice, induce a significant decrease in GABA level in the following brain areas: nucleus caudatus, posterior colliculus, occipital and frontal cortex, cerebellum, substantia nigra, hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal cortex. No variations were observed in olfactory bulbs, pons medulla, hypothalamus, thalamus, or cochlear area.
7296290	The [14C]2-deoxy-D-glucose technique was used to test the effects of central muscarinic stimulation on local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in rats. Systemic administration of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (OXO, 0.7 mg/kg, ip) increased LCGU in brain regions involved in motor function: the sensorimotor cortex; the extrapyramidal motor system, including the striatum, globus pallidus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamus and ventral nucleus of the thalamus; the cerebellar vermis, fastigial nucleus and nucleus interpositus; and the vestibular nucleus. No effects were observed in the fibers of the pyramidal tract, internal capsule, cerebellar white matter and the dentate nucleus. Increases were not affected by methylatropine (1 mg/kg sc), but were completely antagonized by scopolamine (2.5 mg/kg, ip). The anatomic distribution and magnitude of the LCGU response to OXO were not simply correlated with the reported densities of muscarinic receptors.
7328202	The distribution of monoaminergic cell bodies in the brainstem of the cat has been examined with Falck-Hillarp fluorescence histochemical technique. Quantitative determinations indicate that the cat brainstem contains about 60,300 indolaminergic (IA) cells. The majority of these (about 46,700, or 77.5%) are located within raphe nuclei. The largest number is contained within nucleus raphe dorsalis (RD), accounting for around 24,300 IA cells, while raphe pallidus (RP) holds about 8,000 raphe centralis superior (RCS) 7,400, raphe magnus (RM) 2,400, raphe obscurus (RO) 2,300, linearis intermedius (LI) 2,100, and the raphe pontis (RPo) only some 280 IA cells. The IA cells represent, however, only part of the neuronal population of raphe nuclei, which, in addition, hold varying numbers of other medium-sized and small-sized neurons. Thus, quantification in Nissl-stained material indicate that the IA cells make up about 70% of the medium-sized cells in RD, 50% in RP, 35% in RCS and RO, 25% in LI, 15% in RM, and only 10% in RPo. The substantial numbers of small-sized perikarya observed in all raphe nuclei may represent interneurons. Significant numbers of IA cells were consistently located outside the raphe nuclei at all brainstem levels. In all, these amounted to approximately 13,600, or 22.5% of the total number of IA cells. Thus, IA cells occurred in the myelinated bundles, and sometimes in reticular formation, bordering the raphe nuclei; in the ventral brainstem forming a lateral extension from the ventral raphe (RP, RM, RPo, RCS, and LI) to the position of the rubrospinal bundle; in the periventricular gray and subjacent tegmentum of dorsal pons and caudal mesencephalon; in the locus coeruleus (LC) complex; around the motor trigeminal nucleus; caudal to the red nucleus; and in the interpeduncular and interfascicular nuclei. The wide distribution of IA cells leads to a considerable mixing with catecholaminergic (CA) cell groups. Our observations on CA cell distribution are essentially in accordance with previous reports. Quantifications indicate that the LC complex contains about 9,150 CA cells, unilaterally. A previously unnoticed group of scattered CA cells was found in relation to the vestibular nuclei and extending dorsally toward the deep cerebellar nuclei.
7350971	The content of total thiamine radioactivity in some nervous structures and liver of the rat was determined in a steady state condition, using [thiazole-2-14C]thiamine as a tracer. The contents were analyzed by a mamillary type compartmental model which enabled us to calculate the influx and efflux fractional rate constants, turnover times, turnover rates and relative accuracy. Total thiamine turnover rates of the central nervous system regions were found to be ordered in the following sequence: cerebellum (0.55 microgram/g.h) greater than medullar and pons greater than spinal cord and hypothalamus greater than midbrain (plus thalamic area) and corpus striatum greater than cerebral cortex (0.16 microgram/g.h). Sciatic nerve turnover rate was 0.58 microgram/g.h. The turnover times were mainly between 5 and 10 h (range 2.4--16.4 h). The influx rate constants could be ordered as follows: cerebellum greater than hypothalamus, pons and medulla greater than corpus striatum, spinal cord, midbrain (plus thalamic area) and sciatic nerve greater than cerebral cortex. The results show in general a good agreement between turnover rate values and brain regional sensitivity to thiamine deficiency, the most vulnerable areas to thiamine depletion being those with the highest turnover rates.
7352218	In the Chiari II deformity, the following defects can be visualized by computed tomography: partial or complete fusion of the corpora quadrigemina into a tectal beak or spur and invagination of the midline cerebellum to receive this spur; marked upward, transincisural growth of the cerebellum to produce a supratentorial, "extra-axial" mass effect (especially after shunting); enlargement of the pericerebellar cistern about the "towering" cerebellum, and infolding of the anterior border of the towering cerebellum to overlap the vermis and the more caudal portions of the cerebellum. Growth of the cerebellar hemispheres around the brain stem results in (a) overlapping of more of the cerebral peduncles than usual, which sometimes separates the midbrain from the hippocampus; (b) overlapping of more of the lateral aspect of the pons than usual, causing partial filling in of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cisterns, presenting as bilateral CPA masses, and (c) wedging of the cerebellar margin between the lateral aspect of the brain stem and the adjacent free tentorial margin, so that the cerebellar hemispheres acquire an anteriorly pointed configuration.
7370795	Efferent projections of the optic tectum were studied with the anterograde degeneration method in the longnose gar. Ascending projections were found bilaterally to 3 pretectal nuclei -- the superficial pretectal nucleus, nucleus pretectalis centralis and nucleus pretectalis profundus -- and to a number of targets which lie further rostrally -- the central posterior nucleus, dorsal posterior nucleus, accessory optic nucleus, nucleus ventralis lateralis, nucleus of the ventral optic tract, rostral part of the preglomerular complex, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior thalamic nucleus, nucleus ventralis medialis, nucleus intermedius, nucleus prethalamicus and rostral entopeduncular nucleus. Projections of the tectum reach the contralateral side via the supraoptic decussation and are less dense contralaterally than ipsilaterally. Descending projections resulting from tectal lesions include: (1) a tectal commissural pathway to the core of the torus longitudinalis bilaterally and the contralateral tectum and torus semicircularis; and (2) a pathway leaving the tectum laterally from which fibers terminate in the ipsilateral torus semicircularis, an area lateral to the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, lateral tegmental nucleus, nucleus latealis valvulae, nucleus isthmi and the reticular formation. A component of this bundle decussates at the level of the lateral tegmental nucleus to project to the contralateral reticular formation. On the basis of comparisons of these findings with the pattern of retinal projections in gars and other data, it is argued that the nuclei previously called the lateral geniculate and rotundus in fish are not the homologues of the nuclei of those names in land vertebrates but are rather pretectal cell groups. The overall organization of both retinal and tectal projections in gars is strikingly similar to that in land vertebrates; at present, the best candidate for a rotundal homologue is the dorsal posterior nucleus.
7397489	The neuroanatomical pathways of the rat disrupted in aphagia and adipsia were investigated using the Fink-Heimer and autoradiographic anterograde tracing procedures. Following lesions in the lateral hypothalamic complex (LHC) which produce aphagia and adipsia as well as the injection of labeled proline into the LHC, projections were seen in the nucleus accumbens, the preoptic area, the lateral habenular nucleus, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the nucleus reuniens, the parafascicular nucleus, the posterior hypothalamus, the zona incerta, the central gray matter, the tegmentum, the substantia nigra (pars compacta), the ventral tegmental area of Tsai and the parabrachial area. However, axonal degeneration and not radioactive label were observed in the mediodorsal thalamus, the superior colliculus, the medial pontine gray, the mesencephalic nucleus of the Vth nerve, the motor nucleus of V, the raphe nuclei and the crus cerebri fiber system. The LHC is discussed as a region which connects with other levels of the central nervous system known to be related to the act of ingestion.
7410590	As part of an experimental study of the ventral striatum, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method was used to examine the afferent and efferent neuronal connections of the nucleus accumbens. Following iontophoretic applications or hydraulic injections of HRP in nucleus accumbens, cells labeled by retrograde transport of HRP were observed in the ipsilateral telencephalon in the posterior agranular insular, perirhinal, entorhinal, and primary olfactory cortices, in the subiculum and hippocampal field CA1, and in the anterior and posterior divisions of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. In the diencephalon, labeled neurons were present ipsilaterally in the central medial, paracentral and parafascicular intralaminar nuclei, and in the midline nuclei parataenialis, paraventricularis, and reuniens. Retrograde labeling was observed in the ipsilateral brainstem in cells of the ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe. Many of these projections to nucleus accumbens were found to be topographically organized. Anterograde transport of HRP from nucleus accumbens demonstrated ipsilateral terminal fields in the ventral pallidum and substantia nigra, pars reticulata. The afferent projections to nucleus accumbens from the posterior insular and perirhinal neocortices, intralaminar thalamus, and the dopamine-containing ventral tegmental area are analogous to the connections of the caudatoputamen, as are the efferents from nucleus accumbens to the substantia nigra and ventral globus pallidus. These connections substantiate the classification of nucleus accumbens as a striatal structure and provide support for the recently proposed concept of the ventral striatum. Furthermore, the demonstration that a number of limbic system structures, including the amygdala, hippocampal formation, entorhinal cortex, and olfactory cortex are important sources of afferents to the nucleus accumbens, suggests that the ventral striatum may serve to integrate limbic information into the striatal system.
7410591	As part of an experimental study of the ventral striatum, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method was used to examine the afferent and efferent neuronal connections of the olfactory tubercle. Following iontophoretic applications or hydraulic injections of HRP in the tubercle, neurons labeled by retrograde transport of HRP were observed ipsilaterally in the telencephalon in the main olfactory bulb, the medial, lateral, ventral, and posterior divisions of the anterior olfactory nucleus, and in the orbital, ventral, and posterior agranular insular, primary olfactory, perirhinal, and entorhinal cortices. Labeled cells were also present in the basolateral, basomedial, anterior cortical, and posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nuclei, and bilaterally in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. In the diencephalon, ipsilateral HRP-containing neurons were observed in the midline nuclei paraventricularis, parataenialis, and reuniens, and in the parafascicular intralaminar nucleus. Retrograde labeling was present in the ipsilateral brainstem in cells of the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, and dorsal raphe. Many of the above projections to the tubercle were found to be topographically organized. Anterograde axonal transport of HRP from the olfactory tubercle labeled terminal fields ipsilaterally in all parts of the anterior olfactory nucleus, in the ventral pallidum, and in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata. Contralaterally, terminal fields were present in the dorsal and lateral divisions of the anterior olfactory nucleus. The projections to the tubercle from the orbital, ventral, and posterior agranular insular, and perirhinal neocortices, intralaminar thalamus, and dopamine-containing areas of the ventral mesencephalon are analogous to the connections of the caudatoputamen, as are the efferents from the tubercle to the ventral globus pallidus and substantia nigra. These connections substantiate the recent suggestion that the olfactory tubercle is a striatal structure, and provide support for the ventral striatal concept. In the present study of the olfactory tubercle, and in the first study in this series on the nucleus accumbens, the ventral striatum was found to receive projections from a number of limbic system structures, including the main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, amygdala, hippocampus, and subiculum, and the entorhinal and primary olfactory cortices. These findings suggest that the ventral striatum is concerned with integrating limbic information into the striatal system.
7410605	The cell bodies of origin of axons terminating in the median eminence have been identified by retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or 125I-wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The tracers were injected into the median eminence by pressure and under direct visual control, using a ventral surgical approach. The retrogradely labeled cells are exclusively located within the hypothalamus. The most heavily labeled cells are parvocellular neurons in the arcuate nucleus, the periventricular area, the medial part of the paraventricular nucleus, and the rostral paraventricular nucleus; a few cells are also located in the rostral part of the preoptic area immediately lateral and dorsal to the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT). Less heavily located cells are found in the magnocellular neurosecretory nuclei, including the lateral parts of the paraventricular and rostral paraventricular nuclei, the supraoptic nucleus, and the accessory magnocellular nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells are not found in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, except for a few lightly labeled cells in the posterior division of the nucleus. However, if the injected tracer spreads into the arcuate nucleus, labeled cells are present throughout the ventromedial nucleus. Labeled cells are not found in other parts of the hypothalamus, including lateral and posterior portions of the preoptic area, the anterior hypothalamic area, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or in catecholaminergic cell groups of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Control injections of HRP into the posterior pituitary and the ventromedial nucleus produce patterns of cell labeling which are very distinct from that seen with injections into the median eminence. Following injections into the posterior pituitary, the cells of the magnocellular neurosecretory nuclei are all heavily labeled, but small cells in the parvocellular neuronal groups are not labeled. Direct injections into the ventromedial nucleus resulted in labeled cells in widespread parts of the hypothalamus, as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the lateral septum, in parts of the amygdaloid complex and the subiculum, and in several cell groups in the midbrain, pons, and medulla.
7419757	The cells of origin of pathways descending to the spinal cord have been determined in several quadrupedal reptiles, viz., the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans and Testudo hermanni and the lizards Tupinambis nigropunctatus and Varanus exanthematicus, following a technique introduced by Kuypers and Maisky ('75). This technique was very effective in producing retrograde transport of HRP to a great many neurons in the hypothalamus and in the brain stem. Projections from the hypothalamus (the nucleus paraventricularis and the nucleus periventricularis hypothalami), the interstitial nucleus of the film, the nucleus ruber, the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal, the locus coeruleus, the subcoeruleus area, a conspicuous cell group comparable to Kuypers and Maisky's (75, '77) lateral pontine area, the magnocellular reticular formation, the ventrolateral, ventromedial, and descending vestibular nuclei, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract, reach at least as far as the lumbar intumescence. Projections from two somatosensory nuclei, i.e., the nucleus descendens nervi trigemini and the nucleus funiculi dorsalis, as well as the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis, have been demonstrated to at least the ninth spinal segment. The two deep cerebellar nuclei, particularly the medial cerebellar nucleus, were found to project contralaterally to the spinal cord, in the lizard Varanus exanthematicus at least as far as the seventh segment; in the turtles studied so far, only projections as far caudal as the fourth spinal segment could be demonstrated. Data on the funicular trajectory of various descending pathways could also be obtained. It seems likely that in the reptiles studied, in addition to rubrospinal and reticulospinal pathways, projections from the hypothalamus, the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal, the cell group comparable to the mammalian lateral pontine area, the locus coeruleus, and subcoeruleus area, and the nucleus of the solitary tract pass via the lateral funiculus. The pathways descending from the hypothalamus and brain stem to the spinal cord in the quadrupedal reptiles studied appear to show remarkable similarities to pathway in mammals as regards their cells of origin as well as their funicular trajectory. It seems likely that some of the projections demonstrated, viz., from the locus coeruleus, at least part of the cell group comparable to the lateral pontine area, as well as the cells in and around the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, are noradrenergic pathways.
7451678	In an attempt to determine the time of origin and the final localization of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, pregnant mice were injected with tritiated thymidine successively, four to six times daily, beginning on either day 10, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, or 14 of gestation, considering 6 a.m. on the day when vaginal plugs were found as day 0. Offspring were killed at 30 days of age, and serial sagittal sections of the cerebellum were prepared for autoradiography. Labeled and unlabeled Purkinje cells in the various regions of the cerebellum were counted, and unlabeled ones were considered to be formed earlier than the initiation of the injections. In the medial level of the vermis, the majority of the Purkinje cell population was formed on day 12 of gestation and a few on day 13, whereas the cells in the paravermian and hemispheric portions were formed on days 11 and 12. Thus, a slight lateromedial gradient of the time of Purkinje cell origin was demonstrated. Purkinje cells that were formed after day 12.5 were distributed more in the vermis than in the hemisphere, more in the ventral region of the vermis (lingula, ventral lobule of lobulus centralis, and nodulus) than in the dorsal region (culmen, declive, tuber, pyramis, and uvula), and deep in the vermian fissures, rather than on the surface of the lobules. These findings suggest that postnatally, early maturing regions of the cerebellum may have received many of the later formed Purkinje cells.
7463042	The m and p isomers of hydroxyphenylacetic acid have been identified and quantitated in whole rat brain and in several regions using a capillary column high resolution gas chromatography - mass spectrometry procedure. Their concentrations were: for m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (mean +/- S.E., number of determinations in parentheses)-whole brain, 2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/g (7); hypothalamus, 1.2 +/- 0.3 ng/g (5); caudate nucleus, 5.5 +/- 0.6 ng/g (5); brain stem, 1.8 +/- 0.1 ng/g (5); cerebellum, 1.2 +/- 0.1 ng/g (5) and the "rest," 1.7 +/- 0.1 ng/g (5); and for p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid-whole brain, 10.6 +/- 0.7 ng/g (7); hypothalamus, 4.5 +/- 0.1 ng/g (4); caudate nucleus, 28.3 +/- 1.6 ng/g (5); brain stem, 8.6 +/- 0.6 ng/g (5); cerebellum, 8.1 +/- 0.4 ng/g (5), and the "rest," 5.3 +/- 0.5 ng/g (5). This heterogeneous distribution parallels closely that exhibited by their respective precursor amines, m- and p-tyramine.
7472413	A novel NMDA receptor-like (NMDAR-L) cDNA was isolated that contained an open reading frame coding for a predicted polypeptide of 1115 amino acids that shares approximately 27% identity with NMDA receptor subunits. In situ hybridization experiments indicated that NMDAR-L mRNA was expressed in the developing rodent CNS. On postnatal day 1 (P1), NMDAR-L mRNA expression was pronounced in the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum and the thalamus, in layer V of the developing neocortex, in the superior and inferior colliculi, and various regions of the hindbrain, excluding the cerebellum. On P5, NMDAR-L mRNA was expressed in layer V of the neocortex, in the entorhinal cortex, in the subiculum, and in the thalamus. On P14, NMDAR-L mRNA was expressed in layers II-VI of the neocortex, in the entorhinal and piriform cortex, in the subiculum and CA1 field, and in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. In the adult brain, NMDAR-L mRNA was detected predominately in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. Injection of NMDAR-L cRNA into Xenopus oocytes did not lead to the expression of homomeric glutamate-activated channels. However, coinjection of the triple combination of NMDAR-L with NMDAR1 and NMDAR2B cRNAs led to a striking decrease in the current magnitude compared to currents obtained after coexpression of the double combination of NMDAR1 with NMDAR2B. While the function of NMDAR-L remains to be established, its developmental and regional expression pattern suggests that NMDAR-L may influence axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis during brain development.
7472433	The immunoreactivity for thioredoxin, which catalyzes protein disulfide reductions, has previously been shown to exist in nerve cells and their axons. Here we demonstrate the localization of thioredoxin mRNA as revealed by in situ hybridization in the rat brain. The gene is expressed in nerve cells of a variety of brain regions, for example, the cerebral cortex, the piriform cortex, the medial preoptic area, the CA3/CA4 region of the hippocampal formation, the dentate gyrus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the locus coeruleus, the ependyma of the 4th ventricle, and the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. This distribution implicates an important function in nerve cell metabolism, especially in regions with high energy demands and indicates a role of the choroid plexus in nerve cell protection from environmental influences. It was found that after mechanical injury induced by partial unilateral hemitransection the thioredoxin mRNA expression is upregulated in the lesioned area and spreads to the cortical hemispheres at the lesioned level. This induction suggests a function of thioredoxin in the regeneration machinery of the brain following mechanical injury and oxidative stress.
7476036	The distribution of the mRNAs encoding the dopamine D1, D2 and D5 receptors was determined in brain tissues obtained from intact female rhesus monkeys, using a ribonuclease protection assay. Tissue blocks from the frontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and substantia nigra were dissected and total RNA was extracted. Dopamine D2 and D5 receptor DNA fragments were generated from rhesus monkey genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. To generate dopamine receptor subtype-specific cRNA probes, DNA fragments corresponding to the carboxy terminus of the rhesus monkey D1 and D2 receptor genes and to the putative transmembrane domain regions (IV-VI) of the D5 receptor gene, were subcloned into the pGEM3Z/4Z vectors. Expression of D1 receptor mRNA exhibited significant regional differences: striatum > > > cerebral cortex > or = hippocampus > or = lateral thalamus. D1 receptor mRNA was found in low quantities in the medial thalamus, but was not consistently expressed in the substantia nigra area. In contrast, D2 receptor mRNA was detected in all regions that were studied: striatum > > > substantia nigra > > hippocampus > or = cerebral cortex > or = medial thalamus > or = lateral thalamus. D5 receptor mRNA was also expressed in all regions, with highest levels in the cerebral cortex, striatum and lateral thalamus, and moderate levels in the substantia nigra, medial thalamus and the hippocampus. The D5 receptor mRNA appears to be widely distributed in the monkey brain. Most interesting is the expression of D5 receptor mRNA in tissues of the substantia nigra area.
7476880	We used transcript-specific oligonucleotides to examine the localization in the rat nervous system of the corresponding mRNAs for the two P2X purinoceptor genes cloned recently from the rat vas deferens and PC12 cells. PC12 P2X purinoceptor mRNA was labeled in the olfactory tubercle, striatum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdala, cortex, and cerebellum, whereas the vas deferens P2X purinoceptor-specific probes labeled the cerebellum and, at lower levels of expression, the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex. Both types of P2X purinoceptor transcript were found on cell bodies in the nodose and superior cervical ganglia. The presence of these two purinoceptor transcripts in the brain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Two partial cDNAs, identical to sections of the PC12 or vas deferens P2X purinoceptor coding sequences, were amplified from neonatal brain and cerebellum poly(A)+ RNA, respectively. These findings are in broad agreement with earlier Northern blot studies on the PC12 P2X purinoceptor mRNA but differ from those for the vas deferens P2X purinoceptor mRNA, which had not previously been detected in adult brain. This difference is attributed to the low levels seen in the adult compared with the neonate and to the greater sensitivity of the methods used in the present study. The neonate medial habenula had low levels of transcripts for the PC12 but none for the vas deferens P2X purinoceptor. Because pharmacologically the recombinant PC12 P2X purinoceptor differs from the functional purinoceptor in the medial habenula, these results suggest the existence of other, unidentified, P2X purinoceptors in the rat nervous system.
7477894	Angiotensin II (250 pmol) infused into the cerebral ventricles of male rats induces the expression of c-fos in the subfornical organ, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, as well as in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. Electrolytic lesions of the anteroventral third ventricle, principally the subcommissural (ventral) median preoptic nucleus, inhibited the dipsogenic response to i.c.v. angiotensin II and also suppressed c-fos expression in supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract but not in the subfornical organ or dorsal median preoptic nucleus. The stimulating effect of i.c.v. angiotensin II on corticosterone was also reduced. Median preoptic nucleus lesions also suppressed the expression of c-fos following i.v. infusions of 6 micrograms angiotensin II in supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus but not in subfornical organ, dorsal median preoptic nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Median preoptic nucleus lesions reduced the dipsogenic effects of an intragastric infusion of hypertonic (1.5 M) saline and suppressed c-fos expression in supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus compared to sham-lesioned rats. However, c-fos expression was unaltered in subfornical organ, dorsal median preoptic nucleus lesions had no effect on the increased corticosterone induced by hypertonic saline. Subfornical organ lesions did not alter dipsogenic responses to i.c.v. angiotensin II, nor was the i.c.v. angiotensin II-induced expression of c-fos suppressed in the basal forebrain. These experiments show that the ventral median preoptic nucleus (but not the subfornical organ), part of the anteroventral third ventricle, is critical for the expression of c-fos in more caudal areas of the brain following i.c.v. angiotensin II. c-fos expression in supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus following i.v. angiotensin II is also dependent on an intact median preoptic nucleus, suggesting that supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus activation may be dependent on the median preoptic nucleus, and that suppression following i.c.v. infusions is not due to mechanical obstruction to infused peptide. However, there is a clear separation of the effects of i.c.v. and i.v. angiotensin II on brainstem structures. The median preoptic nucleus (but not the subfornical organ) seems essential for activation following the former but not the latter, suggesting alternative mechanisms for the effect of i.v. angiotension II on the brainstem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7477941	The [14C]-deoxyglucose quantitative autoradiographic method was used to map the metabolic changes induced by electrical stimulation and electrolytic lesion of the rostral pole of the thalamic reticular nucleus in the rat brain. Unilateral electrical stimulation of the thalamic reticular nucleus induced the following changes in glucose utilization: (i) local enhancement of metabolic activity within the stimulated thalamic reticular nucleus, (ii) increase in glucose consumption in the ipsilateral thalamic mediodorsal, centrolateral, ventromedial and ventrolateral nuclei, as well as in the nucleus accumbens, (iii) bilateral depression of metabolism in the locus coeruleus, periaqueductal gray, ventral tegmental area, and medial habenula, as well as contralateral metabolic depression in the substantia nigra reticulata, compacta and in the ventral pallidum. Unilateral electrolytic lesion of thalamic reticular nucleus elicited metabolic depression in the ipsilateral thalamic mediodorsal, centrolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial nuclei, and metabolic activation in the dorsal tegmental nucleus bilaterally. The existence of a descending thalamic reticular nucleus input to the periaqueductal gray is supported by the depressed activity measured in brain stem structures after thalamic reticular nucleus stimulation. The similar effects observed in the periaqueductal gray and substantia nigra contralateral to the stimulated thalamic reticular nucleus indicate a possible flow of information from one thalamic reticular nucleus to the contralateral basal ganglia via the periaqueductal gray. The opposite effects induced in the dorsal thalamic nuclei by thalamic reticular nucleus stimulation and lesion support the gating role of the thalamic reticular nucleus in the information flow between thalamus and cortex.
7477942	The effects of electrical stimulation and electrolytic lesion of the thalamic intralaminar centrolateral nucleus were studied in the rat brain by means of the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]deoxyglucose method. Unilateral electrical stimulation of the centrolateral nucleus induced: (i) local increase in metabolic activity within the stimulated centrolateral nucleus and the ipsilateral thalamic mediodorsal nucleus, (ii) metabolic depression in all layers of the ipsilateral frontal cortex, (iii) bilateral increase in glucose consumption within the periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus, and pontine reticular formation, and (iv) contralateral metabolic activation in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The unilateral electrolytic lesion of the thalamic centrolateral nucleus elicited metabolic depressions in several distal brain areas. The metabolic depression elicited in the mediodorsal, ventrolateral, and lateral thalamic nuclei, as well as in the caudate nucleus, the cingulate, and the superficial layers of forelimb cortex were ipsilateral to the lesioned side. The metabolic depression measured in the medulla and pons (medullary and pontine reticular formation, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, dorsal tegmental, cuneiformis, raphe and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei), the cerebellum (molecular and granular layers of the cerebellar cortex, interpositus and dentate nuclei), the mesencephalon (substantia nigra reticulata, ventral tegmental area and deep layers of the superior colliculus), the diencephalon (medial habenula, parafascicular, ventrobasal complex, centromedial and reticular thalamic nuclei), the rhinencephalon (dentate gyrus and septum), the basal ganglia (ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, entopeduncular and accumbens nuclei) and the cerebral cortex (superficial and deep layers of the frontal and parietal cortex, deep layers of the forelimb cortex) were bilateral. These functional effects are discussed in relation to known anatomical pathways. The bilateral effects induced by the centrolateral nucleus lesion reflect an important role of the centrolateral nucleus in the processing of reticular activating input and in the interhemispheric transfer of information. The cortical metabolic depression induced by centrolateral nucleus stimulation indicates the participation of this nucleus in attentional functions.
7494452	Distribution of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) type 2 receptor (IGF2R) is investigated in the rat lower brainstem by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Cells with IGF2R mRNA are distributed widely in a region-specific manner. It is expressed in: (1) motor nuclei such as the oculomotor nucleus, trochlear nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, abducens nucleus, facial nucleus, ambiguus nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and hypoglossal nucleus; (2) several sensory-related nuclei like the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, lateral and spinal vestibular nuclei, ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei and nucleus of the trapezoid body; and (3) other regions such as the red nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, pontine nuclei, three cerebellar nuclei (medial, interposed and lateral), Purkinje cells, cells in the granular layer of the cerebellum, locus coeruleus, several areas of the reticular nucleus and area postrema.
7499543	The surface morphology and cytoarchitecture of human cingulate cortex was evaluated in the brains of 27 neurologically intact individuals. Variations in surface features included a single cingulate sulcus (CS) with or without segmentation or double parallel sulci with or without segmentation. The single CS was deeper (9.7 +/- 0.81 mm) than in cases with double parallel sulci (7.5 +/- 0.48 mm). There were dimples parallel to the CS in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anastomoses between the CS and the superior CS. Flat maps of the medial cortical surface were made in a two-stage reconstruction process and used to plot areas. The ACC is agranular and has a prominent layer V. Areas 33 and 25 have poor laminar differentiation, and there are three parts of area 24: area 24a adjacent to area 33 and partially within the callosal sulcus has homogeneous layers II and III, area 24b on the gyral surface has the most prominent layer Va of any cingulate area and distinct layers IIIa-b and IIIc, and area 24c in the ventral bank of the CS has thin layers II-III and no differentiation of layer V. There are four caudal divisions of area 24. Areas 24a' and 24b' have a thinner layer Va and layer III is thicker and less dense than in areas 24a and 24b. Area 24c' is caudal to area 24c and has densely packed, large pyramids throughout layer V. Area 24c' g is caudal to area 24c' and has the largest layer Vb pyramidal neurons in cingulate cortex. Area 32 is a cingulofrontal transition cortex with large layer IIIc pyramidal neurons and a dysgranular layer IV. Area 32' is caudal to area 32 and has an indistinct layer IV, larger layer IIIc pyramids, and fewer neurons in layer Va. Posterior cingulate cortex has medial and lateral parts of area 29, a dysgranular area 30, and three divisions of area 23: area 23a has a thin layer IIIc and moderate-sized pyramids in layer Va, area 23b has large and prominent pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c has the thinnest layers V and VI in cingulate cortex. Area 31 is the cinguloparietal transition area in the parasplenial lobules and has very large layer IIIc pyramids. Finally, variations in architecture between cases were assessed in neuron perikarya counts in area 23a. There was an age-related decrease in neuron density in layer IV (r = -0.63; ages 45-102), but not in other layers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7505295	Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that microinjection of acetylcholine and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate agonists into the pontine inhibitory area (PIA) induce muscle atonia. The present experiment was designed to identify the PIA afferents that could be responsible for these effects, by use of retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), glutamate immunohistochemistry and NADPH-diaphorase staining techniques. Experiments were performed in both decerebrate and intact cats. Dense retrograde WGA-HRP labelling was found in neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) at the red nucleus (RN) level, ventral portion of paralemniscal tegmental field (vFTP), retrorubral nucleus (RRN), contralateral side of PIA (cPIA), pontis reticularis centralis caudalis (PoC), and most rostral portion of the nucleus parvicellularis (NPV) and nucleus praepositus hypoglossi (PH) at the level of the pontomedullary junction; moderate labelling was seen in pedunculopontine nucleus, pars compacta (PPNc), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), superior colliculus (SC), MRF and PAG at the level caudal to RN, medial and superior vestibular nuclei, and principle sensory trigeminal nucleus (5P); and light labelling was seen in dorsal raphe (DR) and locus coeruleus complex (LCC). The projection neurons were predominantly ipsilateral to the injection site, except for both vFTP and RRN, which had more projection cells on the contralateral side. Double labelled WGA-HRP/NADPH-d neurons could be found in PPNc and LDT. Double labelled WGA-HRP/glutamatergic neurons could be seen at high densities in MRF, RRN, vFTP, and cPIA, moderate densities in SC, LDT, PPNc, PoC, and NPV, and low densities in PH, 5P, DR, LCC, and PAG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7506716	The present study examined the areal and laminar distribution of direct projections from the anterior thalamic nuclei to the retrohippocampal region in the rat, with anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. The anteromedial nucleus (AM) projects to the temporal subiculum, medial entorhinal area, perirhinal area, and caudomedial part of the lateral entorhinal area. The interanteromedial nucleus (IAM) projects to the perirhinal area and the caudolateral part of the lateral entorhinal area. Furthermore, both the AM and IAM project to the temporal area 2, occipital area 1, and lateral occipital area 2. The projections from the AM and IAM to these retrohippocampal and neocortical regions terminate mainly in deep layers. The anteroventral nucleus (AV) projects to the subicular complex with a complex topographic organization. The most rostral part of the AV projects to layers I and III of the ventral presubiculum, the pyramidal cell layer of the temporal subiculum, and deep layers of the parasubiculum and medial entorhinal area. At the midrostrocaudal level of the AV, the lateral and the dorsal quadrants of the AV project, respectively, to layers I and III and to layers I and IV-VI of the ventral presubiculum, whereas the ventral and the medial quadrants project, respectively, to layers I and III and to layers I and IV-VI of the dorsal presubiculum. Furthermore, the lateral and dorsal quadrants project to the pyramidal cell layer of the temporal subiculum, whereas the ventral and medial quadrants project more septally. At the caudal third level of the AV, the dorsolateral part projects to layers I and III of the presubiculum with a patchy pattern and to the pyramidal cell layer of the septal subiculum. The anterodorsal nucleus projects mainly to deep layers of the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area. The results show that each subdivision of the anterior thalamic nuclei projects to a distinct field in the retrohippocampal region. This suggests that each of these projections may have a distinct modulatory influence upon the activity of retrohippocampal neurons that play important roles in limbic functioning such as memory and learning processes.
7510729	Outputs of the sexually dimorphic area (SDA) of the gerbil hypothalamus were identified by injecting Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin into the medial or lateral SDA (mSDA, lSDA) in males and females. They were verified by injecting Fluoro-Gold or rhodamine-labeled beads into over half the areas that contained labeled fibers. Both anterograde and retrograde tracing showed that the mSDA and lSDA project to many of the same sites but often to differing degrees. The mSDA projects more heavily than the lSDA to many of their forebrain targets including the ventral part of the lateral septal nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the medial tuberal area, and the anteroventral periventricular, arcuate, ventromedial and ventral premammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus. The lSDA projects more heavily than the mSDA to many of their mid- and hindbrain targets including the caudal, ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal gray, the retrorubral field, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, and the locus coeruleus. In many other areas of the brain, the projections of the mSDA and lSDA are similar in size. These areas include the substantia innominata, the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, the anterior amygdala, the posterior hypothalamus, the reuniens and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, and the pontine periaqueductal gray lateral to the fourth ventricle. The SDA pars compacta (SDApc), a small cell group embedded in the mSDA of males, projects to many fewer areas than the surrounding mSDA. It was strongly labeled when retrograde tracers were injected into the encapsulated part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, or the mSDA. It was also labeled from the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, the caudal part of the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the lSDA, the area lateral to the mSDA, the arcuate nucleus, the ventral premammillary nucleus, and the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Nothing resembling an SDApc was identified during retrograde tracing in females.
7510732	The distribution of cortical efferent connections to brainstem vestibular nuclei was quantitatively analysed by means of retrograde tracer substances injected into different electrophysiologically identified parts of the brainstem vestibular nuclear complex of five Java monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Three polysensory vestibular areas were found to have a substantial projection to the vestibular nuclei: area 2v located at the tip of the intraparietal sulcus, the parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) covering the most occipital part of the granular insula (Ig) and the retroinsular area (Ri or reipt), and the dorsolateral part of the somatosensory area 3a ("area 3aV" neck/trunk region). From physiological recording experiments, these three cortical fields were known to contain many neurons responding to stimulation of semicircular canals as well as to optokinetic (area 2v, PIVC) and somatosensory stimuli (PIVC, area 3a). These three regions form the inner cortical vestibular circuit. Besides these polysensory vestibular cortical fields, three other circumscribed cortical regions of the macaque brain were also found to project directly to the brainstem vestibular nuclei: a circumscribed part of the postarcuate premotor cortex (area 6pa), part of the agranular and the adjacent dysgranular cortex located around the cingulate sulcus (area 6c/23c), and a predominantly visual (optokinetic) association field located at the fundus of the lateral sulcus (area T3). These areas are known to have connections with the structures of the inner cortical vestibular circuit. Only a few efferent connections to the brainstem vestibular nuclei were found for the different parts of cytoarchitectonic area 7. Significant differences were found between the efferent innervation patterns of the axons originating in the six cortical areas mentioned and ending in the various compartments of the vestibular nuclear complex. Vestibular nuclei with a dominant output to the gaze motor system of the brainstem receive efferent connections preferably from the parietoinsular vestibular cortex. Vestibular structures with their primary output to skeletomotor centers, however, receive stronger efferent connections from areas 6pa and 3a. The ventrolateral nucleus, which sends efferent axons to both the oculomotor and skeletomotor systems of the brainstem and the spinal cord, also receives its main cortical efferents from the somatomotor area 6 and from area 3aV. Through these connections the cortical somatomotor system may directly influence vestibuloocular and vestibulocollic reflexes. It is speculated that the corticofugal connections to the vestibular brainstem nuclei are predominantly inhibitory, suppressing vestibular reflexes during cortically controlled goal-directed movements.
7512240	Net-like structures, visualized with the Golgi technique and several histochemical and immunocytochemical methods, have been described to ensheath somata, parts of dendrites and axon initial segments of various types of neurons. The origin and function of these perineuronal nets have been controversially discussed. Recently, it was confirmed that they are glia-associated. In the present study such perineuronal nets were demonstrated by using colloidal iron hydroxide staining for detection of polyanionic components and the plant lectins Vicia villosa agglutinin and Wisteria floribunda agglutinin with affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine. This paper shows their distribution patterns and the occurrence of regional specialization of these nets which might provide a basis to suggest functional implications of these structures. Perineuronal nets were found in more than 100 brain regions, such as neocortex, hippocampus, piriform cortex, basal forebrain complex, dorsal lateral septal nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, reticular thalamic nucleus, zona incerta, deep parts of superior and inferior colliculus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, some tegmental nuclei, cerebellar nuclei, dorsal raphe and cuneiform nuclei, central gray, trochlear nucleus, pontine and medullar reticular nuclei, superior olivary nucleus and vestibular nuclei. Neurons enwrapped by perineuronal nets not only differ in morphology but also in transmitter content. In neocortical and hippocampal regions there occurs a much higher number of perineuronal nets ensheathing non-pyramidal cells than in paleocortical structures. Most subcortical regions containing perineuronal nets were found to be integrated in motor functions. The findings are discussed with respect to known electrophysiological data of cell types described in our investigation as net-associated. There are some indications that such cells may represent fast firing types.
7515081	We examined interconnections between a portion of the prefrontal cortex and the premotor areas in the frontal lobe to provide insights into the routes by which the prefrontal cortex gains access to the primary motor cortex and the central control of movement. We placed multiple injections of one retrograde tracer in the arm area of the primary motor cortex to define the premotor areas in the frontal lobe. Then, in the same animal, we placed multiple injections of another retrograde tracer in and around the principal sulcus (Walker's area 46). This double labeling strategy enabled us to determine which premotor areas are interconnected with the prefrontal cortex. There are three major results of this study. First, we found that five of the six premotor areas in the frontal lobe are interconnected with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Second, the major site for interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the premotor areas is the ventral premotor area. Third, the prefrontal cortex is interconnected with only a portion of the arm representation in three premotor areas (supplementary motor area, the caudal cingulate motor area on the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus, and the dorsal premotor area), whereas it is interconnected with the entire arm representation in the ventral premotor area and the rostral cingulate motor area. These observations indicate that the output of the prefrontal cortex targets specific premotor areas and even subregions within individual premotor areas.
7516501	Nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity was detected in neurons and fibers of the rat pontine medulla. In the medulla, nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons and processes were observed in the gracile nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus ambiguus, medial longitudinal fasciculus, reticular nuclei and lateral to the pyramidal tract. In the pons, intensely labeled neurons were observed in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, paralemniscal nucleus, ventral tegmental nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei. Labeled neurons and fibers were seen in the interpeduncular nuclei, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, central gray and dorsal central gray, and superior and inferior colliculi. Double-labeling techniques showed that a small population (< 5%) of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons in the medulla also contained immunoreactivity to the aminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase. The majority of nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei were 5-hydroxytryptamine-positive, whereas very few 5-hydroxytryptamine-positive cells in the caudal raphe nuclei were nitric oxide synthase-positive. Virtually all nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei were also choline acetyltransferase-positive, whereas nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity was either low or not detected in choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medulla. The results indicate a rostrocaudal gradient in the intensity of nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity, i.e. it is highest in neurons of the tegmentum nuclei and neurons in the medulla are less intensely labeled. The majority of cholinergic and serotonergic neurons in the pons are nitric oxide synthase-positive, whereas the immunoreactivity was either too low to be detected or absent in the large majority of serotonergic, aminergic and cholinergic neurons in the medulla.
7518846	The aim of this study was to examine anatomical evidence in cats of whether the nucleus reticularis parvicellularis (Pc) is part of the circuit responsible for the inhibition of brainstem motoneurons during paradoxical sleep. For this purpose, we made iontophoretic injections of the retrograde and anterograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) in the Pc. After CTb injections in the Pc, a large number of retrogradely labeled neurons were seen in the central nucleus of the amygdala, the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the posterior hypothalamic areas, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the nucleus locus subcoeruleus, the nucleus pontis caudalis, other portions of the Pc, the nucleus reticularis dorsalis, the trigeminal sensory complex, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. We further found that the Pc receives 1) serotoninergic afferents from the raphe dorsalis, magnus, and obscurus nuclei; 2) noradrenergic inputs from the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum; 3) cholinergic afferents from the lateral medullary reticular formation; 4) substance P-like afferents from the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, and nucleus of the solitary tract; and 5) methionine-enkephalin-like projections from the periaqueductal gray, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation, and the spinal trigeminal nucleus. We further found that the Pc do not receive afferents from brainstem structures responsible for muscle atonia, such as the ventromedial medulla and the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum, and therefore may not be part of the circuit inhibiting the brainstem motoneurons during paradoxical sleep.
7524533	As a result of selective lesions of dorsal (DB) and ventral (VB) noradrenergic system (DSP-4 i.c.) it was observed that these two systems are functionally differentiated and only DB participates in the regulation of post-carbachol emotional-defensive behavior in the cat. Following DB lesion an increase in emotional-defensive excitation occurred and HPLC analysis showed a significant reduction of NA concentration in the posterior hypothalamus, midbrain central gray matter and frontal cortex and decreased turnover of 5-HT in all "emotional brain areas" (hypothalamus, midbrain, amygdala, hippocampus) and frontal cortex. Following VB lesion there were no significant changes of post-carbachol defensive behavior and HPLC analysis showed a significant reduction of NA in the anterior and posterior hypothalamus, midbrain central gray matter and amygdala and an increased turnover of 5-HT in the posterior hypothalamus and midbrain central gray matter. The results obtained can be interpreted in relation to functional interactions between the NA and 5-HT systems.
7526408	The distribution of the immunoreactivity to nitric oxide synthase has been examined from rostral to caudal areas of the rat central nervous system using light microscopy. Endogenous nitric oxide synthase was located using a specific polyclonal antiserum, produced against affinity purified nitric oxide synthase from whole rat brain, following the avidin-biotin peroxidase procedure. Immunoreactive cell bodies and processes showed a widespread distribution in the brain. In the telencephalon, immunoreactive structures were distributed in all areas of the cerebral cortex, the ventral endopiriform nucleus and claustrum, the main and accessory olfactory bulb, the anterior and posterior olfactory nuclei, the precommisural hippocampus, the taenia tecta, the nucleus accumbens, the stria terminalis, the caudate putamen, the olfactory tubercle and islands of Calleja, septum, globus pallidus and substantia innominata, hippocampus and amygdala. In the diencephalon, the immunoreactivity was largely found in both the hypothalamus and thalamus. In the hypothalamus, immunoreactive cell bodies were characteristically located in the perivascular-neurosecretory systems and mamillary bodies. In addition, immunoreactive nerve fibres were detected in the median eminence of the infundibular stem. The mesencephalon showed nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity in the ventral tegmental area, the interpeduncular nucleus, the rostral linear nucleus of the raphe and the dorsal raphe nucleus. Immunoreactive structures were also found in the nuclei of the central grey, the peripeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars lateralis, the geniculate nucleus and in the superior and inferior colliculi. The pons displayed immunoreactive structures principally in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, the ventral tegmental nucleus, the reticulotegmental pontine nucleus, the parabrachial nucleus and locus coeruleus. In the medulla oblongata, immunoreactive neurons and processes were detected in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, the trapezoid body, the raphe magnus, the pontine reticular nuclei, the supragenual nucleus, the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the medullary reticular field, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the gracile and cuneate nuclei, the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the oral, interpolar and caudal parts of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In the cerebellum, the stellate and basket cells showed immunoreactivity, which was also seen in the basket terminal fibres of the Purkinje cell layer. Isolated immunoreactive Purkinje cells were found in the vermis and parafloccular regions of the cerebellum. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, the granular cells and glomeruli were also immunoreactive. Numerous positive varicose nerve fibres and occasional neurons were also found in the lateral and interposed cerebellar nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7526605	The twitcher mouse is an authentic animal model of globoid cell leukodystrophy, which is a genetic disease that affects the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase. This enzyme deficiency causes one of its substrates, galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), to accumulate in myelin-forming cells, which eventually results in their death. In the central nervous system, the death of oligodendrocytes is thought to cause a series of secondary pathological changes. In this study, several techniques were utilized to examine the neuropathology of two different brain regions in the twitcher mouse--the hindbrain and the cerebrum. Neuropathological changes were as follows: (1) demyelination was detected in the hindbrain but not in the cerebrum, (2) a high density of periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells were detected in the hindbrain and to a lesser extent in the cerebrum, (3) astrocyte gliosis was pronounced in both the hindbrain and cerebrum, and (4) macrophages were abundant in both the hindbrain and the cerebrum. We found that Periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells, astrocyte gliosis and macrophage infiltration were present in white and gray matter regions of the cerebrum, while they were generally absent from the granule and molecular layers of the cerebellum. In addition to these studies, we utilized the technique of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy to identify the in situ distribution of psychosine in the brains of twitcher mice. Evidence was obtained that indicates a large accumulation of psychosine in the hindbrain, and to a lesser extent in the white matter of the cerebrum in the twitcher mouse, but not the normal mouse. There was no evidence for the accumulation of psychosine in the molecular layer of the cerebellum from the twitcher or normal mouse. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) pathology is more advanced in the hindbrain compared to the cerebrum, which is likely due to the hindbrain becoming myelinated prior to the cerebrum, (2) demyelination is not necessary for the development of secondary pathological changes, (3) pathology is not limited to white matter in the cerebrum, (4) pathology is not present in all brain regions, i.e. the granule and molecular layers of the cerebellum are devoid of pathological changes, and (5) psychosine accumulates in both the cerebrum and hindbrain, but not in the molecular layer of the cerebellum in the twitcher mouse. This study demonstrates that FT-IR microspectroscopy can be used to correlate chemical changes to histopathological changes in brains from twitcher mice, which suggests that FT-IR microspectroscopy may be a useful tool for studies examining other brain diseases.
7526816	The distribution of galanin-like immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies has been studied in the cat brainstem. Perikarya containing galanin were only found, at a low density, in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus and in the pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus. The highest density of immunoreactive fibers was found in the laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus and in the parvocellular division of the alaminar spinal trigeminal nucleus. A moderate density of immunoreactive fibers was observed in the periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum and below the facial nucleus, whereas a low density of such fibers was found in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus, nucleus incertus, medial division of the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, accessory dorsal tegmental nucleus, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, lateral tegmental field, postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, pericentral division of the dorsal tegmental nucleus, infratrigeminal nucleus, medial nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and in the lateral reticular nucleus. According to the distribution of galanin-like immunoreactive structures in the cat brainstem, our data suggest that the peptide could be involved in respiratory, cardiovascular, nociceptive and auditory mechanisms.
7527806	The connections between the olfactory bulb, primary olfactory cortex, and olfactory related areas of the orbital cortex were defined in macaque monkeys with a combination of anterograde and retrograde axonal tracers and electrophysiological recording. Anterograde tracers placed into the olfactory bulb labeled axons in eight primary olfactory cortical areas: the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, ventral tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, periamygdaloid cortex, and olfactory division of the entorhinal cortex. The bulbar axons terminate in the outer part of layer I throughout these areas and are most dense in areas that are close to the lateral olfactory tract. Labeled axons also were found in the superficial part of nucleus of the horizontal diagonal band. Retrograde tracers injected into the olfactory bulb labeled cells in the nucleus of the diagonal band and in all of the primary olfactory cortical areas except the olfactory tubercle. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb evoked short-latency unit responses and a characteristic field wave in the primary olfactory cortex. Multiunit activity in layer II tended to be of shorter latency than that in layer III and the endopiriform nucleus. Associational connections within the primary olfactory cortex were demonstrated with anterograde tracer injections into the piriform cortex and the entorhinal cortex. Injections into the piriform cortex near the lateral olfactory tract labeled axons in the deep part of layer I of many primary olfactory areas, but especially in areas near the tract. An injection into the rostral entorhinal cortex, distant to the lateral olfactory tract, labeled a complementary distribution of axons in deep layer I of olfactory areas medial and caudoventral to the tract. This organization resembles that reported in the primary olfactory cortex of the rat [Luskin and Price (1983) J. Comp. Neurol. 216:264-291]. The anterograde tracer injections into the piriform cortex and retrograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex and rostral insula label connections from the primary olfactory cortex to nine areas in the caudal orbital cortex, including the agranular insula areas Iam, Iai, Ial, Iapm, and Iapl and areas 14c, 25, 13a, and 13m. The piriform cortex projects most heavily to layer I of these areas. Only Iam, Iapm, and 13a receive a substantial projection to the deeper layers. Areas Iam, Iapm, and 13a were also the only areas that responded with multiunit action potentials to olfactory bulb stimulation in anesthetized animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7530512	Changes of RNA synthesis were demonstrated in neurons and ependymal cells of the green frog Rana esculenta during the annual cycle using the Mallory's trichrome stain as histochemical marker and autoradiography. Since the higher affinity of the nuclei for aniline blue is consistent with the increase of RNA content, the increase of RNA synthesis was expressed as percentage of the blue stained nuclei (% BSN). Neuronal transcription starts slowly in March or April, reaches a maximum in July and declines from September to November or December, depending on the brain region. In the ependymal cells, RNA synthesis starts in March and lasts until October. Neuronal transcriptional activity is found mostly in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in the striatum, nucleus accumbens septi, lateral and medial septal nuclei of the telencephalon, in the habenulae and various nuclei of the diencephalon, in the tectum opticum (particularly in the stratum griseum centrale), in the molecular layer of the cerebellum and in various nuclei of the rhombencephalon. The transcriptional activity of the ependymal cells is quite uniform in the lateral ventricles and the fourth ventricle, while it shows regional symmetric distribution in the third ventricle. Seasonal differences in transcriptional activity appear to be independent of seasonal thermic and photoperiodic fluctuations. In fact, temperature and photoperiod manipulations do not modify significantly the number of active nuclei. It is likely that the increase of RNA synthesis in nerve and ependymal cells corresponds to the resumption of neurotransmitter biosynthesis after hibernation. The simple Mallory's trichrome stain provides a reliable method for revealing increased transcriptional activity in histological sections.
7531723	Galanin is a brain-gut peptide present in the central nervous system of fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. For comparative studies among vertebrates, the distribution of galanin in the brain of reptiles has been investigated. We studied the localization of galanin-like-immunoreactive perikarya and nerve fibers in the brain of the turtle Mauremys caspica by using an antiserum against porcine galanin. In the telencephalon, few immunoreactive perikarya were seen in the amygdaloid complex. The diencephalon contained the majority of the immunoreactive perikarya present in the lamina terminalis, nucleus periventricularis anterior, lateral preoptic area, nuclei hypothalamicus ventromedialis and posterior, nucleus basalis of the anterior commissure, and nucleus ventralis tuberis. Many immunoreactive cells, especially in the infundibulum, contacted the cerebrospinal fluid by an apical process. In the rhombencephalon, immunopositive perikarya were restricted to a few cells in the nucleus tractus solitari. In the mesencephalon, they were absent. Immunoreactive nerve fibers were present in all regions containing labeled perikarya and in 1) telencephalon: septum, nucleus fasciculi diagonalis Brocae; 2) diencephalon: nucleus paraventricularis, nucleus supraopticus, nucleus suprachiasmaticus, subventricular grey, nucleus of the paraventricular organ, nucleus mamillaris, infundibular decussation, outer layer of the median eminence, posterior commissure and subcommissural organ region, habenula, nuclei dorsomedialis anterior, and dorsolateralis anterior of the thalamus; and 3) mesencephalon and rhombencephalon: stratum griseum periventriculare, stratum fibrosum periventriculare, laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis, periventricular grey, nucleus interpeduncularis, nucleus ruber, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, nuclei of the reticular formation, nucleus motorius nervi trigemini, cochlear and vestibular area, and nucleus spinalis nerve trigemini. Our results suggest that galanin may have hypophysiotropic and central roles in the turtle Mauremys caspica.
7532289	Our previous in vivo structure-activity studies suggested that the putative receptors mediating the effects of NPY and NPY2-36 on food intake and body temperature following ICV administration are pharmacologically different. In the present study, we examined and compared dose related effects of NPY and NPY2-36 on levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and its main metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA), as well as serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), in several brain regions of the rat, including: frontal cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala, septum, nucleus accumbens, corpus striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra and hippocampus. NPY and NPY2-36 (10 or 20 micrograms) were administered intraventricularly and the regional levels of the amines and metabolites were assessed 30 min following administration. Results indicate that both doses of NPY decreased NE levels within the hypothalamus. Furthermore, DOPAC concentrations were increased in this region while DA and HVA remained unchanged. The most pronounced neurochemical effects of NPY were found in the hippocampus, where the peptide produced dose related increases in DA, DOPAC and HVA. On the other hand, NPY2-36 significantly increased NE, DA and its metabolite DOPAC in both the amygdala and septum. The metabolism of DA was most obviously affected in the hippocampus and frontal cortex where levels of DA and DOPAC were significantly increased. 5-HT was affected in both the hypothalamus and globus pallidus where DA and its metabolite HVA were also increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7534883	Nitric oxide can act as a neurotransmitter and a retrograde modulator of synaptic transmission, but uncontrolled nitric oxide synthase activity has been associated with neural degeneration. Although earlier studies using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and NADPH-diaphorase staining had suggested that nitric oxide synthase is not expressed in the CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, we have recently demonstrated that NADPH-diaphorase activity can be detected in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. To confirm that this diaphorase activity reflects nitric oxide synthase, we have developed a more sensitive in situ hybridization procedure, and an RNase protection assay to detect message for constitutive nitric oxide synthase, the form constitutively expressed in many neurons. Message for constitutive nitric oxide synthase is expressed in the hippocampus, and it is localized to neural cell layers CA1, CA3, the dentate gyrus and some displaced neurons, but not to CA2. Expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase message in the CA1 region was lost when pyramidal neurons died due to transient forebrain ischemia, supporting the conclusion that CA1 pyramidal cells express constitutive nitric oxide synthase. Although constitutive nitric oxide synthase message is strongly expressed in CA3 and the dentate gyrus, there is little diaphorase activity in these cells, suggesting that there may be post-transcriptional controls that limit constitutive nitric oxide synthase expression in some cells. Message for constitutive nitric oxide synthase is also present in a number of other regions, including the amygdala, several hypothalamic nuclei, the cerebellum, the olfactory bulb, two distinct regions of the perirhinal cortex, the subthalamic nuclei, a neuronal layer in the retrosplenial granular cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the presubiculum, the inferior colliculus, the superior colliculus, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, and scattered individual neurons in the cortex, hippocampus and brainstem. These studies support a role for nitric oxide in multiple regions of the central nervous system. In particular, nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of nitric oxide, is expressed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that nitric oxide may play a major role in long-term potentiation. CA1 hippocampal neurons are an example of a population of neurons that express constitutive nitric oxide synthase but are very sensitive to excitotoxicity and ischemic insults.
7535653	The present study revealed the efferent projections from the external cuneate nucleus (ECN) to various medullary nuclei in the gerbil as demonstrated in fresh living brainstem slices by using in vitro anterogradely tracing with the dextran-tetramethyl-rhodamine-biotin. The tracer-labelled ECN axon terminals were observed (1) in most of the vital autonomic-related nuclei: the nucleus solitary tractus, nucleus ambiguus, rostroventrolateral reticular nucleus and C2 adrenergic area, (2) in the reticular formation: the medullary, parvocellular, intermediate, gigantocellular, dorsal paragigantocellular and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei and medullary linear nucleus, and (3) in sensory nuclei: the cuneate nucleus, spinal trigeminal nuclei caudalis and interpolaris, paratrigeminal nucleus, medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, inferior olive and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus. These new findings are discussed in relation to possible roles of the ECN in cardiovascular, respiratory and sensorimotor controls.
7538219	Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was determined by the rate of conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline in brain regions (midbrain, hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, corpus striatum, cortex, pons-medulla and amygdala) and spinal cord of male Swiss Webster mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats. In mice, high activity of NOS was found in cerebellum, hypothalamus and midbrain; intermediate activity in pons-medulla, hippocampus, amygdala, corpus striatum and cortex; and low activity in the spinal cord. In rat, highest activity of NOS was observed in cerebellum followed in decreasing order by midbrain, hypothalamus, cortex, striatum, pons-medulla, hippocampus and spinal cord. In all tissues, NOS activity was higher in rat than in mouse. Analysis of the Eadie-Hofstee plot indicated that the Vmax and Km values of the enzyme in cortex and cerebellum of rats were higher than in mouse tissues. These studies show differential distribution of NOS activity in mouse and rat brain regions and spinal cord and higher activity of NOS in rat brain regions and spinal cord compared to mouse tissues.
7541903	Activation of the dorsal midbrain has a powerful anticonvulsant effect in the maximal electroshock model of epilepsy. The suppression of tonic seizures can be obtained most reliably from an area centred on the intercollicular nucleus overlapping into the deep layers of the superior colliculus and adjacent mesencephalic reticular formation. As part of a series of investigations to identify neural mechanisms responsible for mediating the anticonvulsant properties of the dorsal midbrain, the present study provides an anatomical description of the efferent projections of this region. Small amounts of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (10-30 nl of a 1% solution) were injected into the intercollicular nucleus and surrounding tissue. The resulting anterograde transport of the tracer was plotted on a set of standard atlas sections. Four major output pathways were identified: (i) an ipsilateral descending projection which had terminations in the microcellular tegmental nucleus, lateral and ventral pontine reticular nucleus pars oralis, ventrolateral tegmental nucleus, ventral and caudal pontine reticular nucleus pars caudalis, raphe magnus nucleus and the gigantocellular nucleus; (ii) a contralateral descending projection which for the most part targeted the same brainstem structures but with weaker terminal labelling; (iii) a projection to the contralateral dorsal midbrain with comparatively weak terminal label in the contralateral superior colliculus, intercollicular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, mesencephalic reticular formation and cuneiform area; (iv) ipsilateral ascending pathway with terminations in the red nucleus, zona incerta, peripeduncular area, parafascicular nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, parts of the pretectum and caudal thalamus. At a general level the dorsal midbrain anticonvulsant zone shares its major output projections and efferent targets with at least one of its near neighbours, including the superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, the cuneiform nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus. The possibility that anticonvulsant properties of the intercollicular area can simply be attributed to a unique set of efferent projections is therefore not supported by the anatomy.
7559128	The possible origins of cerebellar cholinergic afferents from the lower brainstem of the gerbil were examined using immunohistochemistry combined with retrograde neuronal labelling techniques. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) monoclonal antibody was used in conjunction with a retrogradely transported tracer, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The use of this technique allowed an unequivocal localisation of cholinergic neurons in different parts of the lower brainstem projecting to the cerebellum. In addition, single labelling of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), ChAT and HRP was carried out to elucidate the efferent projection from the lower brainstem to the cerebellum as well as the cholinergic distribution in these two areas. Our results showed the presence of HRP/ChAT double-labelled neurons in (1) the midline medulla: the periventricular gray beneath the 4th ventricle, C3 adrenergic area, raphe obscurus nucleus and medial longitudinal fasciculus, (2) the reticular formation: the medullary, lateral, intermediate, gigantocellular, lateral paragigantocellular and dorsal paragigantocellular reticular nuclei and gigantocellular reticular nucleus ventralis, and (3) sensory nuclei: the gracile nucleus, cuneate nucleus, external cuneate nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus interpolaris, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and medial vestibular nucleus. In the cerebellum, AChE-positive mossy fibres were chiefly localised in the vermian lobules VIb,c, VII and X, paramedian lobule, crura I and II, paraflocculus and flocculus, and they were distributed in the white matter and granular layer of the cortex. The 3 above-mentioned cerebellar cholinergic afferent systems associated with the unique AChE distribution pattern in the cerebellum may be of important functional significance.
7560265	Lungfishes, which share similarities with both fishes and amphibians, represent an interesting group in which to investigate the evolutionary transition from fishes to tetrapods. In the present study, we have investigated the localization and biochemical characteristics of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive material in the central nervous system of the African lungfish, Protopterus annectens. NPY-immunoreactive cell bodies were found in various regions of the brain, most notably in the telencephalon (septal area, ventral striatum, and nucleus accumbens), in the diencephalon (preoptic nucleus, periventricular region of the hypothalamus, and ventral thalamus), and in the tegmentum of the mesencephalon. A strong immunoreaction was also detected in cell bodies of the nervus terminalis. Immunoreactive nerve fibers were particularly abundant in the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens, the diagonal band of Broca, the hypothalamus, and the mesencephalic tegmentum. Positive fibers were also seen in the median eminence and in the neural lobe of the pituitary. The NPY-immunoreactive material localized in the brain and pituitary was characterized by combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and radioimmunological quantitation. The displacement curves obtained with synthetic porcine and frog NPY and serial dilutions of brain and pituitary extracts were parallel. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of telencephalon, diencephalon, and pituitary extracts resolved a major NPY-immunoreactive peak that coeluted with frog NPY. The similarity between the distribution of NPY-containing neurons and the biochemical characteristics of the immunoreactive peptide in the brain of lungfish and frog strongly favors a close phylogenetic relationship between dipnoans and amphibians.
7566702	The expression of Fos protein in the rat diencephalon, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord was investigated using immunohistochemistry during chronic cold exposure, in order to clarify the neural regions involved in the thermoregulatory responses and the central mechanism of neural activation with cold acclimation. Numerous Fos-positive cells were observed in many brain regions after cold exposure and changes in the number of Fos-positive cells were analyzed quantitatively. Fos-positive regions were classified into three groups on the basis of the expression period of Fos protein. The first group was where a significant number of Fos-positive cells were seen 3 h and 24 h after cold exposure, but not observed 14 days after exposure; the regions included the lateral septal nucleus (LS), parvocellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pPVN), posterior hypothalamic area (PH), supramammillary nucleus (SuM), locus coeruleus (LC), dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTg), vestibular nucleus (Ves), and nucleus of solitary tract (Sol). The second group was where a significant number of Fos-positive cells were found 3 h, 24 h and 14 days after cold exposure; the regions included the preoptic hypothalamic area (POA), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PV), lateral preoptic area (LPO), zona incerta (ZI), subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (SPF), lateral dorsal central grey (CGLD), lateral ventral central grey (CGLV), microcellular tegmental nucleus (MiTg), lateral lemniscus nucleus (LL), dorsal parabrachial nucleus (DPB), and the cerebellum. The third group was where Fos-positive cells were more numerous 14 days after cold exposure than they were after 3 h and 24 h of exposure; these regions included the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and the spinal cord. These results demonstrate that the numbers and regions of Fos-positive cells in the rat brains changed during chronic cold exposure, and such changes may reveal the cellular adaptation of the thermogenic responsive neurons in the rat brain to cold acclimation.
7583347	Fos expression in the rat diencephalon, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord was examined after warm (33 degrees C) and cold (10 degrees C) ambient exposures. Fos expression was examined with use of immunohistochemical method and the number of Fos-positive neurons in each nucleus was quantitatively analyzed. When rats were exposed to cold ambient, significant number of Fos-positive neurons was found in the lateral septal nucleus (LS), preoptic hypothalamic area (POA), parvocellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pPVN), lateral preoptic area (LPO), zona incerta (ZI), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PV), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (SPF), posterior hypothalamic area (PH), supramammillary nucleus (SuM), microcellular tegmental nucleus (MiTg), lateral lemniscus nucleus (LL), lateral dorsal central grey (CGLD), lateral ventral central grey (CGLV), dorsal parabrachial nucleus (DPB), locus coeruleus (LC), dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTg), vestibular nucleus (Ves), nucleus of solitary tract (Sol), spinal cord, and cerebellum. When animals were exposed to warm ambient, the numbers of Fos-positive neurons in the LS, POA, PV, LPO, and SuM were significantly increased to be equal to those of cold ambient. However, after warm ambient exposure the numbers of Fos-positive neurons in the DPB and spinal cord were increased but less than those of cold ambient, and those in the pPVN, VMH, ZI, SPF, PH, CGLD, CGLV, MiTg, LL, LC, DTg, Ves, Sol, and cerebellum were not significantly increased as compared with those of control or cold ambient. Abdominal temperature was not changed during cold ambient exposure, but the temperature was significantly increased during warm ambient exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7593745	The distribution of vasopressin innervation in the brain of the jerboa (Jaculus orientalis) was investigated, with special attention to sex differences and seasonal variations. Vasopressin perikarya were observed in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the periventricular nucleus, the medial preoptic area, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the medial amygdaloid nucleus. In addition, vasopressin cell bodies were observed in the ventral retrochiasmatic area. After treatment with colchicine, vasopressin perikarya were also observed around the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, in the medial diagonal band of Broca, and in the dorsal medial preoptic nucleus. Vasopressin fibers were also found to be more widespread in the jerboa brain than in other rodents. Fibers were observed in the medial diagonal band of Broca, the stria medullaris, the tuber cinerum, the area postrema, the medial vestibular nucleus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Sexual dimorphism and seasonal variation in vasopressin immunoreactivity were observed in areas that not only showed a testosterone-dependent vasopressin innervation in other rodents but also in the paratenial and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, the tuber cinerum, the supramammillary complex, the zona incerta, the interpeduncular complex, and the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei. A denser vasopressin innervation was observed in spring/summer (sexual active period) than in autumn. Numerous brain structures contained vasopressin receptors (cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dentate gyrus, thalamic nuclei, superior colliculus, dorsal cochlear nucleus, and cerebellum); no sex- or season-related differences were observed. These data indicate a high level of vasopressin in the jerboa brain, which may reflect an adaptation to its harsh bioclimatic environment.
7615876	The prohormone convertase (PC2) is expressed in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and has been shown to play an important role in the processing of certain neuropeptide precursors and prohormones at paired basic residues. Amphibian PC2 cDNA was recently cloned for the frog Xenopus laevis, and both its sequence and its pituitary expression pattern were shown to be very similar to those of mammalian PC2. To investigate further the function of PC2 in the vertebrate CNS, we used in situ hybridization histochemistry to localize the distribution of cells expressing PC2 mRNA in the frog brain and the spinal cord. The distribution of PC2-expressing cells was also compared with that of cells expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) mRNA or peptide. PC2-expressing cells were detected in specific nuclei that were widely distributed in the frog CNS. In forebrain, telencephalic PC2 mRNA was found in the olfactory bulb, pallium, striatum, amygdala, and septum, and diencephalic PC2 mRNA was seen in the preoptic area, thalamus, and hypothalamus. More posteriorly, PC2 cells were localized to midbrain tegmentum, the torus semicircularis, and the optic tectum, as well as the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Despite this wide distribution steady-state levels of PC2 mRNA were clearly different in various brain nuclei. Regions with higher levels showed good correspondence to areas shown by others in frog to contain large numbers of neuropeptide-expressing cells, including TRH cells. On the other hand, not all brain areas with high levels of TRH mRNA had high levels of PC2 mRNA. Localization studies combining in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry showed that, at least in optic tectum and brainstem, PC2 mRNA and pro-TRH peptide coexist. These findings suggest that pro-TRH is processed by PC2 in some, but possibly not all, brain regions. Thus, different converting enzymes may be involved in pro-TRH processing in different brain regions.
7620288	The purpose of this study was to identify the functional cortical fields involved in reaching for targets in extrapersonal space, and to identify the specific fields representing visual target information in long-term memory. Ten healthy subjects were asked to learn the positions of seven circular targets that were repeatedly projected on a screen. The regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron emission tomography during a rest state, at an early learning stage, at a later learning stage, and finally at 30 min after the course of learning had been completed. Mean rCBF change images for each task minus rest were calculated and fields of significant rCBF changes were identified. In all three task states, cortical fields were consistently activated in the left motor and premotor areas, the posterior part of the superior parietal lobule, and the right angular gyrus. When learning of the target positions had been achieved, additional fields appeared bilaterally in the posterior part of the superior parietal lobule, the right superior occipital gyrus, the left motor and premotor areas, the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, the superior part of the cuneus, the inferior part of the angular gyrus, and the anterior part of the insula. The results indicate that there are at least two different types of functional fields in the posterior part of the superior parietal lobule; one is active during reaching for the targets when guided by internal representations of target positions; the other likely represents the storage sites of visual target information that is addressed in long-term memory.
7623116	The ventral striatum is considered an interface between limbic and motor systems. We followed the orbital and medial prefrontal circuit through the monkey basal ganglia by analyzing the projection from this cortical area to the ventral striatum and the representation of orbitofrontal cortex via the striatum, in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Following injections of Lucifer yellow and horse radish peroxidase into the medial ventral striatum, there is a very densely labeled distribution of cells in areas 13a and 13b, primarily in layers V and VI, and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 25. Injections into the shell of the nucleus accumbens labeled primarily areas 25 and 32. The reaction product in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra supports previous studies demonstrating that efferent projections from the ventral striatum are represented topographically in the ventral pallidum and nontopographically in the substantia nigra, pars compacta. Tritiated amino acid or PHA-L tracer injections into orbitofrontal cortex produce dense patches of terminal labeling along the medial edge of the caudate nucleus and the dorsal part of the nucleus accumbens. These results demonstrate that the orbital prefrontal cortex projects primarily to the medial edge of the ventral striatum and to the core of the nucleus accumbens. The arrangement of terminals in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra show two different patterns. Thus, the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex is represented in a confined region of the globus pallidus but throughout an extensive area of the dorsal substantia nigra. Terminals are extensive throughout the region of the dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that this input may influence a wide area of both the striatum and frontal cortex.
7624833	4-Phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl)piperidine (4-PPBP) is a very potent ligand for sigma (Sigma) receptors. The present study was undertaken to evaluate [3H]4-PPBP as a radioligand for in vivo labeling of cerebral sigma receptors. After intravenous administration of [3H]4-PPBP to mice, there is high uptake of radioactivity in the brain. The regional distribution of radioactivity in the brain 2 h after intravenous injection of [3H]4-PPBP parallels the in vitro binding of the radioligand in rat brain (pons/medulla > cerebellum > or = prefrontal cortex > or = parietal cortex > hypothalamus > olfactory tubercle > or = thalamus > hippocampus > striatum). Pretreatment with haloperidol (2 mg/kg) significantly decreases the radioactivity measured in the brain 30-120 min after injection of [3H]4-PPBP. Pretreatment with unlabeled 4-PPBP or ifenprodil also significantly decreases radioactivity in the brain 2 h after injection of [3H]4-PPBP, in a dose-dependent manner. The in vivo binding of [3H]4-PPBP in the brain also is significantly inhibited by SL 82.0715, BMY 14802, 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), and (+)-enantiomers of pentazocine, SKF 10,047, and 3-PPP, but not by the corresponding (-)-enantiomers, consistent with stereoselectivity of inhibition obtained in in vitro binding studies. In contrast, pretreatment with dizocilpine and spiperone does not inhibit in vivo binding of [3H]4-PPBP. The results indicate that [3H]4-PPBP would be a suitable radioligand for in vivo labeling of sigma receptors in brain.
7637574	We examined the localization of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) mRNA in the rat brain by in situ hybridization. FGF-9 mRNA was moderately or weakly expressed in widespread regions including the olfactory bulb, caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem and cerebellum. However, FGF-9 mRNA was also strongly expressed in several specific nuclei including the red nucleus and oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nucleus and facial nucleus in the brainstem and the medial cerebellar nucleus, interposed cerebellar nucleus and lateral cerebellar nucleus in the cerebellum. The cellular localization of FGF-9 mRNA indicated that the mRNA in the rat brain was expressed preferentially in neurons, although FGF-9 was originally isolated from human glioma cells. The localization profile of FGF-9 mRNA is different from those of aFGF, bFGF and FGF-5 mRNAs reported previously. The present findings indicate that FGF-9 has a unique role in the brain.
7637868	Transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactivity is examined in the developing and adult brain of cats and rats, and in the adult human brain in cryostat sections immediately processed free-floating with a well-characterized monoclonal antibody which does not cross-react with epidermal growth factor. Transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactivity is observed in neurons of the cerebral neocortex, subiculum, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, basal forebrain, mesencephalon, cerebellar cortex, dentate nucleus and brainstem during development and in adulthood. The intensity of the immunoreaction directly correlates with the size of the cytoplasm. Diffuse transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactivity also occurs in the white matter of the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem in the kitten, but not in the adult cat. In addition to neurons, numbers of glial cells in the cerebellar white matter, brainstem and cerebral hemispheres during development, and a few glial cells in the cerebellar cortex, diencephalon, cerebral cortex and white matter in adults are strongly transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactive. These results support the concept that transforming growth factor-alpha is widely distributed in the brain of mammals, localizes in both neurons and glial cells, and is development dependent. These findings also suggest that transforming growth factor-alpha may play a role in the developing and adult central nervous system.
7655888	We investigated the functional anatomy of self-initiated and externally triggered movements. Six patients with Parkinson's disease off medication and six age-matched normals were assessed. All subjects had regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurement with PET and recording of movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs) from frontal (F), fronto-central (FC), central (C) and parietal (P) sites to obtain measures of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). The tasks were (i) self-initiated extension of the right index finger on average once every 3 s, (ii) externally triggered finger extension with the rate yoked to the self-initiated task, and (iii) rest condition with tones presented at a rate yoked with the self-initiated task. For the self-initiated movements, the amplitude of the early and peak BP were lower in Parkinson's disease relative to normals. For the externally triggered movements, the patients and the normals did not differ on any of the measures of cortical negativity prior to movement. For both groups, the late and peak BP components, but not the early component, had a lower amplitude in the externally triggered than the self-initiated movements. In normals, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary motor area bilaterally, anterior cingulate, the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally, the insular cortex bilaterally, the left thalamus and the left putamen, parietal area 40 bilaterally and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were significantly activated during the self-initiated movements relative to rest. For the normals, greater activation of the right DLPFC during the self-initiated movements was the only area that significantly differentiated them from the externally triggered movements. When Parkinson's disease patients and normals were compared for the self-initiated movements relative to rest, normals showed greater activation of the supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate, left putamen, left insular cortex, right DLPFC and right parietal area 40. When the groups were compared for the externally triggered movements relative to rest, the global pattern of blood flow and rCBF change in the two groups did not differ, confirming the absence of group differences in BPs for the externally triggered movements. During the self-initiated movements, the lower amplitude of the early BP in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the underactivation of the supplementary motor area relative to normals support the premises that (i) the supplementary motor area contributes to the early BP, and (ii) the deficit is self-initiated movements in Parkinson's disease is due to supplementary motor area underactivation. The DLPFC is activated in situations requiring non-routine decision making as in the self-initiated movements.
7669273	Three opioid receptor types have recently been cloned that correspond to the pharmacologically defined mu, delta and kappa 1 receptors. In situ hybridization studies suggest that the opioid receptor mRNAs that encode these receptors have distinct distributions in the central nervous system that correlate well with their known functions. In the present study polyclonal antibodies were generated to the C terminal 63 amino acids of the cloned mu receptor (335-398) to examine the distribution of the mu receptor-like protein with immunohistochemical techniques. mu receptor-like immunoreactivity is widely distributed in the rat central nervous system with immunoreactive fibers and/or perikarya in such regions as the neocortex, the striatal patches and subcallosal streak, nucleus accumbens, lateral and medial septum, endopiriform nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral pallidum, amygdala, hippocampus, presubiculum, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, superior and inferior colliculi, central grey, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, interpeduncular nucleus, medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, raphe nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. In addition, two major neuronal pathways, the fasciculus retroflexus and the stria terminalis, exhibit densely stained axonal fibers. While this distribution is in excellent agreement with the known mu receptor binding localization, a few regions, such as neocortex and cingulate cortex, basolateral amygdala, medial geniculate nucleus and the medial preoptic area fail to show a good correspondence. Several explanations are provided to interpret these results, and the anatomical and functional implications of these findings are discussed.
7675182	The aim of this study was to define the temporal appearance and regional distribution of angiotensinogen in the fetal and neonatal rat brain. This was done by immunocytochemical localization of angiotensinogen in brains from embryonic day 16 to postnatal day 12. Immunostaining was first observed on embryonic day 18, and persisted to postnatal day 2, in the choroid plexus and ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. This initial expression of angiotensinogen at embryonic day 18 was followed at postnatal day 20 by a rapid progression of angiotensinogen staining appearing in astrocytes in the paraventricular nucleus, medial preoptic area, ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei; these areas showed the highest astrocyte staining intensity in the brain. This was followed sequentially by staining in areas of the thalamus, midbrain, forebrain and brainstem. In general, neuroglial staining was higher in regions proximal to the cerebral ventricles and cerebral aqueduct. Neuronal angiotensinogen was observed at day postnatal day 0 and later. The most consistent immunopositive areas were in the forebrain and thalamus; in particular, the hippocampus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, basal and lateral amygdala, the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, lateral septum, medial habenular nuclei and lateral thalamic nuclei. Most of the immunopositive cells in the hypothalamus and brainstem were astrocytes, while those in the cortex were almost exclusively neurons. Staining in thalamic regions was both neuronal and neuroglial. From the intensity of staining and cell density, it was determined that a rapid increase in angiotensinogen occurs between embryonic day 20 and postnatal day 0, followed by further, smaller increases postnatally. In conclusion, this study has shown that angiotensinogen, the protein from which angiotensin II is generated, is present in the rat fetal brain. The timing of its appearance supports the establishment of a renin-angiotensin system by late gestation. Its predominance in fetal hypothalamic nuclei and in thalamic, cerebellar and cortical neurons suggests major roles in prenatal fluid and electrolyte balance, in sensorimotor development and in brain maturation.
7676126	A 72 year-old right handed woman had a right sided anterior choroidal artery infarction. She presented the triad of hemiplegia, hemianaesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia, as well as complete non-determinant hemisphere syndrome that combined: disorientation for place and time, anosognosia, hemiasomatognosia, left spatial neglect, constructional apraxia and spatial fabulation concerning both the present time and the weeks that preceded the vascular event. Language and verbal memory were normal. Spatial memory could not be studied because of the severity of the neglect. The clinical course was poor: when tested one and a half year post-onset, the hemiplegia, the hemianaesthesia, and the hemianopsia as well as left spatial neglect remained severe. Vestibular caloric stimulation, carried out with left ear cold water irrigation, resulted in brief but clear-cut alleviation of the spatial neglect. An MRI with both axial and coronal slices showed a right-sided infarct affecting the whole posterior limb of the internal capsule including the genu, the posterior part of the globus pallidus, the anterior third of the cerebral peduncle and the amygdala but sparing the thalamus and the corona radiata. This crescent-shaped lesion transected entirely the thalamo-cortical connection fibers which resulted in a "thalamic exclusion". The measurement of brain glucose utilisation with (18F)-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose and positron emission tomography performed in the chronic phase (3 months post-onset) showed an exceptionally severe and widespread hypometabolism of the right hemisphere, relative to the left hemisphere, which correlated with both the unusual, severe and protracted non-dominant hemisphere syndrome. All the brain regions on the right side were hypometabolic relative to the left including the temporal region (mostly medial temporal), the left cerebellar lobe, the frontal lobe (mostly prefrontal region), the occipital region and the thalamus. The hypometabolism of the basal ganglia, the sensorimotor area and the parietal cortex was less severe. This most uncommon clinical-metabolic presentation presumably reflects a global thalamo-cortical disconnection inducing a diffuse dysfunction of the whole hemisphere.
7680939	The presence of neuropeptides in brainstem neurons that project to the medial and lateral thalamus and zona incerta has been studied in the rat. Brainstem neurons were retrogradely labeled from the medial and lateral thalamus and the zona incerta by colloidal gold-WGA-HRP and, after silver intensification of the retrograde label, their content of immunoreactivity for nine different neuropeptides was determined after colchicine administration. The medial thalamus and zona incerta both received a large peptidergic input and the lateral thalamus a smaller input from neurons in several brainstem nuclei. These were principally from the locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, the dorsal raphe and the dorsal tegmentum. The principal input to the medial thalamus arose from neurotensin, neuropeptide Y and galanin neurons in the locus coeruleus, neurotensin neurons in the dorsal tegmentum, dynorphin neurons in the parabrachial nucleus and dorsal tegmentum, galanin neurons in the dorsal raphe, substance P neurons in the lateral and dorsal periaqueductal grey and calcitonin gene-related peptide neurons in the nucleus paragigantocellularis. The principal peptidergic input to the zona incerta was from dynorphin neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract, bombesin neurons in the lateral reticular nucleus, calcitonin gene-related peptide and cholecystokinin neurons in the dorsal tegmentum, substance P, bombesin and galanin neurons in the locus coeruleus, dynorphin and substance P neurons in the lateral periaqueductal grey and cholecystokinin neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental nucleus and raphe linearis. The principal peptidergic input to the lateral thalamus came from calcitonin gene-related peptide and cholecystokinin neurons in the dorsal tegmentum, calcitonin gene-related peptide and galanin neurons in the locus coeruleus; substance P, neuropeptide Y, galanin and calcitonin gene-related peptide neurons in the dorsal raphe, substance P neurons in the lateral periaqueductal gray, galanin neurons in the nucleus interpedunculus and cholecystokinin neurons in the raphe linearis. In all these cases, from 25% to virtually all of the projection neurons in the brainstem nucleus could contain immunoreactivity to the neuropeptide. A lesser, but significant peptidergic input to the thalamus and zona incerta also arose from the trigeminal nucleus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral reticular nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, the raphe linearis, the paragigantocellularis, the inferior olive and ventral tegmental area. Overall, the neuropeptides most frequently present in the projection neurons were substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin and cholecystokinin. Bombesin, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin and dynorphin were less common; and enkephalin was present in only a small percentage of projection neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7682660	The effect of castration on the levels of brain monoamines and their metabolites has been investigated in rats which became or did not become muricidal following long-term isolation. Fourteen brain areas were explored: olfactory bulbs (OB), olfactory tubercles (OT), septum (Se), striatum (Sr), amygdala (A), thalamus (Th), hypothalamus (Hy), hippocampus (Hi), superior colliculus (SC), inferior colliculus (IC), raphe (Ra), pons-medulla (PM), frontal cortex (FC), temporal cortex (TC) and parietal cortex (PC). Except in the raphe of non muricidal rats and in the striatum of muricidal animals, all other areas examined demonstrate some changes of monoamines neurotransmitter or their metabolites after castration. The strongest changes, always increases, were found in the thalamus. In several brain areas, the changes occurring after castration, differ quantitatively and qualitatively in muricidal and non-muricidal rats.
7684249	On the basis of cortical connections and architectonics, inferior temporal (IT) cortex of squirrel monkeys consists of a caudal, prestriate-recipient region, ITC; a rostral region, ITR; and possibly an intermediate region along the border of ITC and ITR, "ITI" (Weller & Steele, 1992). ITC contains dorsal (ITCd) and ventral (ITCV) areas. The subcortical connections of these subdivisions of IT cortex were determined in the present study from the results of cortical injections of wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, [3H]-amino acids and fast blue. ITC and ITR receive afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral hypothalamus, paracentral nucleus, and central medial nucleus; send efferents to the superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, and striatum; and have both afferent and efferent connections with the pretectum, pulvinar, claustrum, amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert. ITC and ITR have different patterns of connections with a number of subcortical structures, including the pulvinar and amygdala. Injections in ITC strongly label multiple nuclei of the inferior pulvinar and the medial division of the lateral pulvinar (PLM), and moderately label the medial pulvinar (PM), whereas injections in ITR strongly label PM and moderately label PLM. Injections in ITC label sparse projections to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, in contrast to injections in ITR that label strong projections to the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala. Injections in "ITI" produce a pattern of subcortical label that has some features of that observed from injections in ITC and that observed from injections in ITR. Although most of the connections of ITCd and ITCv appear similar, only injections involving ITCd label the middle nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIM). Comparison of the subcortical connections of subdivisions of IT cortex in squirrel monkeys and what is presently known of the subcortical connections of subdivisions of IT cortex in macaque monkeys supports the previous suggestion that ITC of squirrel monkeys may be comparable to area TEO of macaques, ITI may be comparable to posterior area TE, and ITR may be comparable to anterior area TE (Weller & Steele, 1992).
7685395	We have previously isolated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) from media conditioned by a neuronal cell line and have detected IGFBP-4 mRNA in selected regions of the developing and adult rat brain by Northern blot analysis. In this study, the ontogeny and regional distribution of IGFBP-4 expression were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. While IGFBP-4 mRNA expression at embryonic day 15 was restricted to choroid plexus primordium and meninges, by embryonic day 20 IGFBP-4 mRNA was also localized in the basal ganglia. In the postnatal rat, at days 1 and 5, IGFBP-4 was also present in the meningeal cell layer surrounding the developing cerebellum and in the hippocampal formation. The distribution of IGFBP-4 mRNA in the adult brain was considerably more widespread. The principal areas where IGFBP-4 mRNA was detected were the cerebral cortex (layers II and IV), olfactory peduncle (anterior olfactory nuclei), limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), thalamus and basal ganglia, as well as choroid plexus and meninges. The widespread and persistent expression of IGFBP-4 is in marked contrast with IGFBP-2, the other IGFBP in the brain, whose localization by in situ hybridization is reported to be restricted to choroid plexus and meninges. The spatial pattern of IGFBP-4 expression in areas known to either overlap, be adjacent to, or project to regions that express the IGFs or their receptors may reflect a role for IGFBP-4 as a modulator of IGF action in the brain.
7694534	The regional distribution of 125I-galanin specific binding sites was determined by radioautography on brain sections in young (3- to 4-month-old) and aged (26- to 27-month-old) male Sprague-Dawley rats, previously tested for their performances in the Morris water maze task. In aged rats, a significant increase in specific binding was observed in piriform, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, the CA1 field of the ventral hippocampus, ventral subiculum, and dorsal dentate gyrus, whereas no significant change was observed in the ventral dentate gyrus, the dorsal subiculum, the CA3 field of the hippocampus, the amygdala or the septal area. The area-specific regional increase in specific binding density in aged rats was significantly correlated with the impairment of their behavioral performances in the Morris water maze task. The change in 125I-galanin specific binding in the aged rats was a result of an increase in the number of galanin-binding sites, without change in affinity.
7699112	The distribution of the reticular neuronal type in the human brain and its involvement in both degeneration and dendritic reorganisation under the conditions of ageing, Korsakoff's disease (KD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) was comparatively investigated after Golgi impregnation. Reticular neurones are distributed throughout different areas along the brain axis. The cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei, i.e., the basal nucleus of Meynert, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and the medial septal nucleus form the most rostral part of this network of "open nuclei," which is collectively referred to as the "reticular core." Reticular neurones of the following areas were quantitatively investigated by a computer-based three-dimensional analysis: caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, basal nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, and raphe magnus nucleus. There are three major findings. First, neurones that were found to be susceptible to degeneration in AD were largely part of the same neuronal populations prone to degeneration during ageing, in KD and PD. Thus, areas could be classified according to their overall degree of vulnerability under the present degenerative conditions as being highly vulnerable (basal forebrain nuclei, caudate nucleus, locus coeruleus), moderately vulnerable (medial amygdaloid nucleus, raphe magnus nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus), or marginally vulnerable (globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus). Second, neuronal populations that are particularly vulnerable to degenerative changes show a high degree of structural plasticity. Third, the degree of this dendritic plasticity is inversely related to the complexity of dendritic arborisation of the neurone. It is concluded that the sparsely ramified reticular type of neurone forms a pool of pluripotent neurones that have retained their plastic capacity throughout life, which makes them vulnerable to a variety of perturbations.
7700529	We have recently cloned the neurotensin receptor from human substantia nigra. Using in situ hybridization techniques, with an 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe complementary to this receptor complementary DNA, we studied the expression of the human neurotensin receptor in the brain from control and Parkinson's disease subjects. We also performed an analogous study with rat brain. Neurotensin receptor messenger RNA was present in high levels in melanized neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the nucleus paranigralis (the ventral tegmental area for rat brain). Background levels of signals for neurotensin receptor messenger RNA were detected in the nucleus ruber, the colliculus inferior and the striatal subdivisions (the nucleus caudatus, the putamen and the nucleus accumbens) of both human and rat brain. All these areas, except the nucleus ruber and the collicus inferior, contain very high to high levels of neurotensin receptor binding sites. Additionally, Parkinson's disease brains had markedly fewer melanized (possibly dopaminergic) neurons, as expected, and correspondingly very low or background levels of messenger RNA for neurotensin receptor. We have also demonstrated heterogeneity among the melanized cells expressing messenger RNA encoding the neurotensin receptor in the substantia nigra and the nucleus paranigralis of human brain. The neurons in the nucleus paranigralis had lower melanin pigmentation and higher expression of neurotensin receptor messenger RNA. In general, the expression of the messenger RNA within the highly and evenly melanized neurons was lower than that found in low or unevenly pigmented neurons. The neurons in the nucleus paranigralis had lower melanin pigmentation and higher expression of neurotensin receptor messenger RNA. The low pigmented neurons in the ventral tier of the substantia nigra had relatively high expression. On the other hand, highly and evenly melanized neurons in these regions of the brain had low expression of neurotensin receptor messenger RNA. Together with the previous binding data, it is suggested that not only in rat brain, but also in human brain, melanized (possibly dopaminergic) neurons in the substantia nigra and the nucleus paranigralis (ventral tegmental area of rat brain) synthesize neurotensin receptors and express them in their perikarya and the terminal regions. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the melanized neurons in human brain may play a role in the normal function of dopaminergic systems and probably in the etiology of some neurological and psychiatric disorders.
7704298	In this study sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotide probes have been used to investigate the distribution of the mRNAs coding for the somatostatin receptor subtypes termed somatostatin receptor 1, somatostatin receptor 2 and somatostatin receptor 3 in the rat brain and pituitary using in situ hybridization techniques. The three receptor subtype mRNAs were found to be widely distributed in the brain with different patterns of expression, but with some overlap. Somatostatin receptor 1 mRNA was particularly concentrated in the cerebral and piriform cortex, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and several nuclei of the brainstem. Somatostatin receptor 3 mRNA was very abundant in the cerebellum and pituitary (in contrast to somatostatin receptor 1), but it was also found in hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus and in motor nuclei of the brainstem. Somatostatin receptor 2 mRNA levels were very low relative to the other two mRNAs evaluated. Receptor 2 mRNA was observed in the anterior pituitary, and in the brain it was found in the medial habenular nucleus, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, hippocampus some amygdala nuclei, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. None of the three somatostatin receptor mRNAs studied here was found in the caudate nucleus. Northern analysis revealed distinct sizes of mRNAs for each subtype, and displacement experiments showed that each probe sequence was subtype-specific.
7704424	GIRK1/KGA (referred to as GIRK1) is a member of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel family and is activated by G protein-linked receptors. The activation of this channel leads to hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and is fundamental to the control of atrial and neuronal excitability. RNA blotting studies have shown that GIRK1 is expressed in the atrium of the heart and in the brain. We have used in situ hybridization histochemistry to characterize the pattern of expression of GIRK1 mRNA in adult rat heart and brain. In heart, expression of GIRK1 mRNA is homogeneous throughout the atria. There is no significant ventricular expression, although the conduction bundles were not specifically identified. GIRK1 mRNA expression in the brain is widespread with highest levels in the cortex, septum, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, cerebellum, and many nuclei of the midbrain and hindbrain, including red nucleus, inferior colliculus, pontine nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and multiple cranial nerve nuclei (motor and sensory components). This detailed map of GIRK1 mRNA expression provides a basis for further study of this important new family of K+ channels.
7704444	Aromatase activity was measured in explant cultures from the newborn mouse and rat brain and in homogenates of regions of the rat brain sampled between birth and 51 days of age. Conversion of 19-[3H]hydroxy-androstenedione to estradiol and estrone was detected in explant cultures from the mouse preoptic/septal region, anterior cingulate cortex, and midbrain, as well as from the rat preoptic area, septum, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and midbrain central grey. No detectable estrogen biosynthesis was observed in explants from the cerebellum and spinal cord of either species. Measurements of aromatase in tissue homogenates using 1 beta[3H]androstenedione as substrate revealed detectable enzyme activity in the hypothalamus + preoptic area, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and midbrain, from birth onward. Aromatase activity per milligram of tissue protein was highest in the hypothalamus-preoptic area and amygdala, followed by the hippocampus, midbrain, and cingulate cortex. In all brain regions, aromatase activity was markedly higher at Postnatal Days 1 and 7 than later in life. In both the cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, aromatase was barely detectable above the assay blank in adult (51 day) animals. These results demonstrate that regions of the developing rodent neo- and archicortex have the capacity to convert androgen to estrogen, consistent with a role for local estrogen biosynthesis in the sexual differentiation of higher brain functions.
7706547	Serotonin (5-HT) mediates its effects on neurons in the central nervous system through a number of different receptor types. To gain better insight as to the localization of 5-HT responsive cells, the distribution of cells expressing mRNAs encoding the three 5-HT receptor subtypes 1A, 1C, and 2 was examined in rat brain with in situ hybridization using cRNA probes. 5-HT1A receptor mRNA labeling was most pronounced in the olfactory bulb, anterior hippocampal rudiment, septum, hippocampus (dentate gyrus and layers CA1-3), entorhinal cortex, interpeduncular nucleus, and medullary raphe nuclei. 5-HT1C receptor mRNA labeling was the most abundant and widespread of the three 5-HT receptor subtypes examined. Hybridization signal was densest in the choroid plexus, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, septum, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, claustrum, accumbens nucleus, striatum, lateral amygdala, paratenial and paracentral thalamic nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and reticular cell groups. 5-HT2 receptor mRNA was localized to the olfactory bulb, anterior hippocampal rudiment, frontal cortex, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, claustrum, pontine nuclei, and cranial nerve motor nuclei including the oculomotor, trigeminal motor, facial, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and hypoglossal nuclei. The distributions of mRNAs for the three different 5-HT receptor subtypes overlap with regions that bind various 5-HT receptor-selective ligands and are present in nearly all areas known to receive serotonergic innervation. The results of this study demonstrate that neurons which express these 5-HT receptor subtypes are very widespread in the central nervous system, yet possess unique distributions within the rat brain. Moreover, previously unreported regions of 5-HT receptor subtype expression were observed, particularly with the 5-HT2 receptor riboprobe in the brainstem. Finally, several brain areas contain multiple 5-HT receptor subtype mRNAs, which leads to the possibility that individual cells may express more than one 5-HT receptor subtype.
7709340	The regional distribution of the mRNA encoding the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor was studied in the central nervous system of the rat by in situ hybridization histochemistry and Northern blot analysis. A 180 base pair probe, corresponding to a highly selective portion of the third intracellular loop of the rat 5-HT1B receptor, was used. In most regions, a single 5 kb message was found by Northern blot analysis. However, two additional bands (2.5 and 4 kb) were detected in the striatum. The rank order of 5-HT1B mRNA abundance was striatum >> septum = ventral tegmentum > or = colliculi = hypothalamus = hippocampus > brain stem > or = cerebellum > or = dorsal horn of the spinal cord > cerebral cortex > or = ventral horn of the spinal cord > olfactory tubercle. This distribution was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which further revealed that the 5-HT1B mRNA was present in dorsal root ganglia, the layer IV of the cerebral cortex, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. In situ hybridization was also performed in nomifensine (10 mg/kg/i.p.)-pretreated rats whose serotoninergic neurons were extensively and selectively lesioned by microinjection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (8 micrograms/1 microliter) directly into the anteroventral vicinity of anterior raphe nuclei 3 weeks before sacrifice. In lesioned rats, 5-HT1B mRNA was present in the same areas and at the same levels as in control rats, except in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, where a marked decrease (-75%) in its local concentration was observed. These data provide the first demonstration of the synthesis of 5-HT1B receptor within serotoninergic neurons, as expected of their presynaptic autoreceptor function at the level of serotoninergic terminals.
7712209	The purpose of this study was to compare the localization in the brain of calcitonin-induced anorexia to the distribution of calcitonin binding sites (as described by others). We, thus, performed an extensive mapping of brain structures to determine those involved in calcitonin-induced anorexia. A significant anorexia is found after injection of calcitonin (15 ng in 0.3 microliters) into several brain areas. Forebrain: lateral septum, lateral part of the anterior commissure, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; hypothalamus: floor of the anterior part of the hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus and adjacent perifornical area; thalamus: nucleus reuniens, an area internal to the mamillo-thalamic tract, and medial geniculate body; other areas: amygdala, lateral hippocampus, and central gray. No significant effect is found in the following areas: forebrain: nucleus accumbens, striatum, and medial septum; hypothalamus: lateral, ventro-medial, dorso-medial, and posterior nuclei; thalamus: centro-medial nucleus, lateral part of the zona incerta, and lateral geniculate body; hippocampus: dorsal and ventral parts; midbrain: central tegmentum, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra. When these results are compared to the distribution of calcitonin binding sites in the brain, two types of discrepancies are found. The first is the absence of effect in areas containing receptors: these areas may be involved in calcitonin-induced behaviors other than food intake. The second is the occurrence of anorexia in areas where no receptors are found: this finding is not easy to explain and raises some speculative hypotheses. In conclusion, calcitonin is active to decrease food intake in several brain areas, the strongest effect occurring in the paraventricular/perifornical area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7714250	The distribution of neurotensin-containing cell bodies and fibers was examined in the central nervous system of the dog using light microscopic immunohistochemistry. A very large population of neurotensin-containing cell bodies was observed in the septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens septi, preoptic areas, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, olfactory tubercle, entorhinal cortex, ventral subiculum, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, anteroventral thalamic nucleus, nucleus reuniens, lateral habenular nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Extremely dense networks of neurotensin-containing fibers were found in the globus pallidus, hypothalamus, infundibular stalk, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, interpeduncular nucleus, and spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and substantia gelatinosa. However, the cerebral neocortex and cerebellum were negative for neurotensin in the present study. When the present findings are compared with those in other animals, it is clear that the major species-specific differences in distribution involve three immunonegative regions and four immunopositive regions in the dog: The former are the cerebral neocortex, mammillary body, and hippocampus; the latter are the cell bodies in the pyramidal layer of the olfactory tubercle, the superficial and middle layers of the entorhinal cortex and ventral subiculum, and the nerve fibers in the interpeduncular nucleus. The present study indicates a rather extensive network of neurotensin neurons in the central nervous system of the dog.
7722622	The present study investigated the effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and immobilization stress on the genetic expression of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRF-R) in the brains of conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats. One group of rats was killed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hr after a single intraperitoneal injection of either the LPS (250 micrograms/100 gm of body weight) or the vehicle solution; the other group was killed before, immediately after, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 hr after a 90 min acute session of immobilization stress. Rats were deeply anesthetized and rapidly perfused with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde-borax. Frozen brains were mounted on a microtome and cut from the olfactory bulb to the medulla in 30 microns coronal sections. mRNA encoding the rat CRF-R was assayed by in situ hybridization histochemistry using a 35S-labeled riboprobe, and CRF-R localization within CRF-immunoreactive neurons in the PVN was determined using a combination of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques. Strong basal levels of CRF-R transcripts were observed in several regions of the brain (piriform cortex, medial and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, red nucleus, pontine gray, cerebellum, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, caudal division of the zona incerta, nucleus incertus, spinal and principal sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, and various layers of the cortex). A low to moderate signal was also detected in multiple sites (medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, supraoptic nucleus, arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, and nucleus prepositus). Whereas vehicle-treated and control rats displayed hardly detectable signals of CRF-R mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), CRF-R gene transcription was highly stimulated by LPS administration and immobilization stress in this hypothalamic structure. Indeed, the CRF-R mRNA signal was positive in the dorsomedial parvocellular PVN 3 hr after LPS injection, strong and maximum in both parvo- and magno-PVN at 6 hr postinjection, and declined 9 and 12 hr after treatment. Similarly, 90 min and 3 hr after the immobilization session, mRNA encoding the CRF-R was highly expressed in the parvo-PVN and totally vanished 12 hr after the stress. A lower but significant increase in the CRF-R transcript signal was also observed in the supraoptic nucleus 6 hr after the LPS treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7723628	Parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide (PTHrP) has been identified in human tumors associated with the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. PTHrP mRNA is also expressed in a variety of non-malignant tissues, suggesting that PTHrP is an endogenous peptide with as-yet unidentified autocrine or paracrine functions in normal tissues, including brain (Weir et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87 (1990) 108-112). In the present study, we used in situ hybridization to examine the expression of PTHrP and the common receptor for PTH and PTHrP in adult rat brain. Widespread yet anatomically discrete patterns of hybridization were observed using 35S-labeled antisense cRNA probes. PTHrP gene expression was highest in the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, medial superior olivary nucleus, and in subpopulations of cells in the neostriatum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. Other major sites of PTHrP gene expression included the amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, pontine nuclei, choroid plexus, and the anterior pituitary gland. Highest levels of PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA were in the mesencephalic portion of the trigeminal nucleus and the trigeminal ganglion, the lateral reticular, pontine and reticulotegmental nuclei, the hypoglossal nucleus and area postrema. Other major sites of PTH/PTHrP receptor expression included the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, basolateral amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parasubiculum, cells in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, vestibular nuclei, ventral cochlear nucleus, the motor nucleus of the trigeminal, and the facial and external cuneate nuclei. The expression of genes encoding PTHrP and its receptor in discrete areas of the brain suggests that PTHrP may function as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.
7749727	The distribution of the growth associated protein GAP-43 has been described in the brain and spinal cord of rats and other placental mammals but not marsupials. In order to provide such information, we employed a monoclonal antibody to immunostain for GAP-43 in the central nervous system of adult and developing opossums, Didelphis virginiana. The GAP-43 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the brain of adult opossums, but it was particularly dense within specific layers of the olfactory bulb and hippocampal formation, layer I of the cerebral cortex, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus accumbens, the striatum, the amygdala, the septum, the olfactory tubercle, medial parts of the preoptic area and diencephalon, the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmental area, the periaqueductal grey matter, the interpeduncular nucleus, the periventricular grey, the molecular layer of the cerebellum, the superior central nucleus, the basilar pons, the dorsal vagal and solitary nuclei, and laminae I and II of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Immunoreactivity for GAP-43 was also present within the spinal cord, where it was densest within laminae I, II, IX, and X and within the intermediolateral cell column. In most areas of the brain and some areas of the spinal cord, an inverse correlation existed between the location of GAP-43 and myelin. Immunostaining for GAP-43 was found throughout most of the central nervous system during early development, but it decreased with age in a regionally specific manner until the adult pattern was reached. Our results suggest that the distribution of GAP-43 in opossums is similar in many respects to that reported in rats and that it is developmentally regulated.
7751613	Immunocytochemistry with an antiserum raised against serotonin was used to provide detailed description of the serotonin (5-HT)-containing cell bodies and fibers in the CNS of the hedgehog (Erinaceus europeaus). The distribution of the 5-HT-positive cells and the pattern of 5-HT innervation resembled those described in other mammalian species but several differences were also noticed. The nine B groups of Dahlstrom and Fuxe (1964) were observed, except for the B 4 group which was not detected in the hedgehog. Neuron-like immunoreactive cells were also observed in brain regions located outside the brainstem reticular formation. Among the latter the olfactory tubercle and the thalamus have not been described to contain 5-HT cell bodies in other mammals. The number and the "lateralization" of 5-HT-positive neurons in areas outside the midline raphe were more limited than those described in the rodents and much more limited than in the carnivores and the primates. 5-HT-positive axons were unevenly distributed throughout the hedgehog's CNS. From all neocortical areas, which displayed the highest innervation density in the layer I, somatosensory and visual areas were the most heavily and lightly innervated ones respectively. Other regions of the forebrain exhibiting dense serotoninergic innervation were: olfactory cortex; olfactory tubercle; subiculum; lateral septal nucleus; stratum; medial and basal amygdaloid nuclei. Dense serotoninergic innervation were also found to receive the following brainstem structures: lateral hypothalamic area; dorsal part of the suprachiasmatic nucleus; arcuate nucleus; median eminence; habenular nuclei; centromedian thalamic nucleus; ventral tegmental area; medial part of the substantia nigra; interpeduncular nucleus; locus coeruleus; cuneiform nucleus; motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve; facial nucleus; parabrachial nucleus; prepositus hypoglossi nucleus; medial subnucleus of the nucleus of the solitary tract; hypoglossal nucleus; dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. In the spinal cord, laminae IX and X received the heaviest innervation.
7753352	Sagittal sections of anatomic specimens and magnetic resonance images well display the individual gyri and sulci along the low-middle convexity. Those familiar with the typical pattern and with the common normal variations will be able to use sagittal magnetic resonance imaging to correctly localize lesions by identifying: (a) the five major rami of the sylvian fissure; (b) the subdivision of the triangular inferior frontal gyrus into the M-shaped partes orbitalis, triangularis, and opercularis by the anterior horizontal and anterior ascending rami of the sylvian fissure; (c) the zig-zag shape of the middle frontal gyrus, which characteristically angles sharply and inferiorly to fuse with the anterior surface of the precentral gyrus; (d) T-shaped bifurcation of the posterior end of the inferior frontal sulcus to form the inferior precentral sulcus; (e) separation of the central sulcus from the sylvian fissure by union of the opercular ends of the precentral and postcentral gyri to form the subcentral gyrus inferior to the central sulcus; (f) narrower sagittal dimension of the postcentral gyrus than the precentral gyrus; (g) horseshoe shape of the supramarginal gyrus perched atop the posterior ascending ramus of the sylvian fissure; (h) similar horseshoe shape of the angular gyrus perched atop the posterior end of the superior temporal sulcus; (i) commonly intercalated accessory presupramarginal and preangular gyri; and (j) the arcuate course of the intraparietal sulcus, which separates the superior from the inferior parietal lobules. The anatomic relationships described are more nearly constant anteriorly than posteriorly. When used as described, they prove helpful in correctly localizing pathology and in planning a surgical approach to lesions that may be difficult to localize on the basis of axial or coronal plane magnetic resonance images.
7753373	Alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission have profound effects on neuronal expression of the putative activity marker, Fos, in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Stimulants such as D-amphetamine and cocaine increase Fos-like immunoreactivity by enhancing the activation of D1 dopamine receptors. In contrast, neuroleptics such as haloperidol and raclopride increase Fos-like immunoreactivity by blocking striatal D2 dopamine receptors. In the dorsal striatum, D1 receptor stimulation elevates Fos-like immunoreactivity predominantly in neurons projecting to the midbrain (substantia nigra), whereas D2 receptor antagonism enhances Fos-like immunoreactivity principally in neurons projecting to the pallidum (globus pallidus). These findings are consistent with the proposal that D1 receptors are located chiefly on striatonigral neurons, whereas D2 receptors reside mainly on striatopallidal neurons. Since the nucleus accumbens (largest component of the ventral striatum) also sends projections to the midbrain (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra) and pallidum (ventral pallidum), the present study utilized retrograde tract-tracing techniques to determine if there was a similar segregation of D1 agonist- and D2 antagonist-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in these accumbal projections. In addition, we examined whether these relationships were the same in the core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens. Like the dorsal striatum, D1 agonists (D-amphetamine and CY 208-243), but not D2 antagonists (haloperidol and clozapine), increased Fos-like immunoreactivity in accumbal neurons projecting to the midbrain (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra). Also like the dorsal striatum, D2 antagonist-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity was located preferentially in accumbal neurons projecting to the pallidum (ventral pallidum). However, unlike the dorsal striatum, where the vast majority of neurons which display D1 agonist-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity project to the midbrain, nearly 50% of those neurons in the nucleus accumbens which were Fos-immunoreactive after D-amphetamine or CY 208-243 projected to the ventral pallidum. Thus, a similar number of accumbal neurons which expressed D1 agonist-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity were retrogradely labelled from the midbrain and ventral pallidum. Accumbal projections to the midbrain and ventral pallidum were retrogradely labelled with different retrograde tracers in order to determine the degree of collateralization between these pathways. Approximately 20% of retrogradely labelled neurons displayed both tracers, indicating that collateralization and damage to fibres of passage could not account for all of those cases in which D1 agonist-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity was detected in accumbal neurons projecting to the ventral pallidum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7753394	The aim of this study was to examine the afferents to the rat locus coeruleus by means of retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments using cholera-toxin B subunit and phaseolus leucoagglutinin. To obtain reliable injections of cholera-toxin B in the locus coeruleus, electrophysiological recordings were made through glass micropipettes containing the tracer and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus were identified by their characteristic discharge properties. After iontophoretic injections of cholera-toxin B into the nuclear core of the locus coeruleus, we observed a substantial number of retrogradely labeled cells in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus and the dorsomedial rostral medulla (ventromedial prepositus hypoglossi and dorsal paragigantocellular nuclei) as previously described. We also saw a substantial number of retrogradely labeled neurons in (1) the preoptic area dorsal to the supraoptic nucleus, (2) areas of the posterior hypothalamus, (3) the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, (4) mesencephalic reticular formation. Fewer labeled cells were also observed in other regions including the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, median raphe nucleus, dorsal part of the periaqueductal gray, the area of the noradrenergic A5 group, the lateral parabrachial nucleus and the caudoventrolateral reticular nucleus. No or only occasional cells were found in the cortex, the central nucleus of the amygdala, the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the vestibular nuclei, the nucleus of the solitary tract or the spinal cord, structures which were previously reported as inputs to the locus coeruleus. Control injections of cholera-toxin B were made in areas surrounding the locus coeruleus, including (1) Barrington's nucleus, (2) the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, (3) a previously undefined area immediately rostral to the locus coeruleus and medial to the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus that we named the peri-mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, and (4) the medial vestibular nucleus lateral to the caudal tip of the locus coeruleus. These injections yielded patterns of retrograde labeling that differed from one another and also from that obtained with cholera-toxin B injection sites in the locus coeruleus. These results indicate that the area surrounding the locus coeruleus is divided into individual nuclei with distinct afferents. These results were confirmed and extended with anterograde transport of cholera-toxin B or phaseolus leucoagglutinin. Injections of these tracers in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus, preoptic area dorsal to the supraoptic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal gray, the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus yielded a substantial to large number of labeled fibers in the nuclear core of the locus coeruleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7754303	The striatum receives inputs from different areas of the cerebral cortex, including association cortical areas far on in the hierarchy of cortical information processing as well as the sensori-motor cortex, and has connections via the globus pallidus and substantia nigra to the thalamus and thence to premotor and prefrontal cortical areas. Recordings of the activity of neurons in different parts of the striatum of primates show that they have the following properties: 1) neurons in much of the putamen, which receives inputs from the sensori-motor cortex, have activity related to movements; 2) neurons in the caudate nucleus, which receives from the association cortex, have activity related for example to environmental stimuli which signal preparation for or initiation of behavioral responses; 3) neurons in the tail of the caudate nucleus, which receives strongly from the inferior temporal visual cortex, respond when a patterned visual stimulus changes; 4) some neurons in the posterior ventral putamen, which receives from the inferior temporal visual cortex and the prefrontal cortex, respond in a visual short term memory task, delayed match to sample. The neurons responded in the delay period, or differentially to match and non-match stimuli. These neurons did not respond in an auditory delayed match to sample task, so that their activity was not related to movement per se, but was instead more closely related to visual inputs relevant to a memory task; 5) some neurons in the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens), which receives from limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus, respond to stimuli associated with reinforcement or to novel stimuli. It is concluded that there is considerable segregation of function within the striatum. It is suggested that there is an opportunity for inputs which originate from different parts of the cerebral cortex to interact, via a first stage of convergence in the striatum, and by a further stage of convergence on the dendrites of single neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra; and that both these parts of the basal ganglia may learn associations between the different signals they receive. The result of this convergence and learning is that the basal ganglia provide a way for cortical areas far on in the hierarchy of information processing to become linked during motor learning to particular sequences of movements, and thus to be involved in the execution of motor programs.
7759618	Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, we studied the distribution of neurons that express preproopiomelanocortin (pre-POMC), preprodynorphin (pre-PDYN), and preproenkephalin (pre-PENK) gene transcripts within the human hypothalamus and surrounding structures. Of the three opioid systems, pre-POMC neurons have the most restricted distribution. Pre-POMC cells are most numerous in the infundibular nucleus and retrochiasmatic area of the mediobasal hypothalamus; a few labeled cells are present within the boundaries of the ventromedial nucleus and infundibular stalk. Pre-POMC message was not found in the limited samples of structures adjacent to the hypothalamus. In contrast to neurons that express pre-POMC, neurons expressing pre-PDYN and pre-PENK are more widely represented throughout the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic structures. However, pre-PDYN and pre-PENK cells differ from one another in distribution. Pre-PDYN message is especially abundant in neurons of the tuberal and mammillary regions, with a distinct population of labeled cells in the premammillary nucleus and dorsal posterior hypothalamus. Pre-PDYN gene expression also is found in neurons of the dorsomedial nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, caudal magnocellular portion of the paraventricular nucleus, dorsolateral supraoptic nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, caudal lateral hypothalamus, and retrochiasmatic area. In structures immediately adjacent to the hypothalamus, pre-PDYN neurons were observed in the caudate nucleus, putamen, cortical nucleus of the amygdala, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Pre-PENK neurons occur in varying numbers in all hypothalamic nuclei except the mammillary bodies. The chiasmatic region is particularly rich in pre-PENK neurons, with the highest packing density in the intermediate nucleus [the intermediate nucleus (Braak and Braak [1987] Anat. Embryol. 176:315-330) has also been termed the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDA-POA; Swaab and Fliers [1985] Science 228:1112-1115) or the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus 1 (Allen et al. [1989] J. Neurosci. 9:497-506)], dorsal suprachiasmatic nucleus, medial preoptic area, and rostral lateral hypothalamic area. Pre-PENK neurons are numerous in the infundibular nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, caudal parvicellular portion of the paraventricular nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, and retrochiasmatic area. Only a few lightly labeled cells were found in the periphery of the supraoptic nucleus and lateral tuberal nucleus. In areas adjacent to the hypothalamus, cells that contain pre-PENK message occur in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, central nucleus of amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, caudate nucleus, and putamen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7777196	Thirty days after induction of experimental diabetes the brain catecholamines namely, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) were studied in discrete brain regions (striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and medulla, cerebellum and cerebral cortex) in control, alloxan-diabetic untreated and insulin-treated diabetic rats. E showed significant increase in striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus, whereas NE was increased in hypothalamus, and decreased in pons and medulla significantly in untreated diabetic rats. These effects were not seen in the insulin-treated diabetic rats.
7779525	By means of a high resolution PET scanner, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral blood volume (rCBV), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) for major cerebral gyri and deep brain structures were studied in eleven normal volunteers during an eye-covered and ear-unplugged resting condition. Regional CBF was measured by the autoradiographic method after intravenous administration of H2(15)O. Regional OEF and rCMRO2 were measured by the single inhalation of 15O2. With MR T1-weighted images as an anatomical reference, thirteen major cerebral gyri, caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum and vermis were defined on the CMRO2 images. Values were read by using circular regions of interest 16 mm in diameter. The posterior part of the cingulate gyri had the highest rCBF and rCMRO2 values among brain structures, followed by the lentiform nucleus, the cerebellum, the caudate nucleus, and the thalamus. Parahippocampal gyri had the lowest rCBF and rCMRO2 values among the cortical gyri. Regional OEF for the pontine nuclei (0.34 +/- 0.04), the midbrain (0.35 +/- 0.05), the parahippocampal gyri (0.35 +/- 0.04 for the right and 0.37 +/- 0.05 for the left), and the thalami (0.37 +/- 0.05 for the right and 0.36 +/- 0.04 for the left) were significantly lower than the mean OEF for the cerebral cortices (0.42 +/- 0.04) (p < 0.05 or less). The global CBF and CMRO2 were consistent with those obtained by the Kety-Schmidt method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7780656	1. The distribution, pharmacology and effects of neurodegenerative diseases on 5-HT4 receptors in human brain have been characterized in vitro. 2. The 5-HT4 receptor in post mortem human brain tissue was specifically labelled with [3H]-GR 113808. In human putamen, this ligand labelled a homogeneous population of sites, with an apparent affinity (-log Kd) of 10.1 and a density (Bmax) of 5.73 fmol mg-1 tissue. The pharmacology of this site was characterized by use of a series of displacing ligands, and the following rank order of apparent affinities (with mean +/- s.d. -log Ki values in parentheses) was generated: GR113808 (10.05 +/- 0.04) > SDZ 205,557 (8.65 +/- 0.08) > DAU 6285 (7.95 +/- 0.04) > BIMU-1 (7.81 +/- 0.06) > DAU 6215 (7.42 +/- 0.23) > tropisetron (7.39 +/- 0.23) > 5-HT (7.32 +/- 1.00) > BIMU-8 (7.25 +/- 0.04) > (R)-zacopride (5.82 +/- 0.04). The Hill coefficients were not significantly different from unity, consistent with an interaction at a single site. A comparison of the affinities of these compounds with those obtained from guinea-pig striatum indicated no evidence of species differences. 3. The regional distribution of 5-HT4 receptors was assessed by determining the density of binding sites for [3H]-GR 113808. The distribution were as follows (with mean +/- s.d. Bmax values, fmol mg-1 tissue, in parentheses): caudate nucleus (8.7 +/- 1.5), lateral pallidum (8.6 +/- 5.5), putamen (5.7 +/- 3.0), medial pallidum (3.8 +/- 0.9), temporal cortex (2.6 +/- 0.6), hippocampus (2.4 +/- 0.8), amygdala (2.3 +/-1.1), frontal cortex (1.7 +/- 0.5), cerebellar cortex (<1.0). In these studies, the affinities of GR 113808 were not significantly different.4. The density of 5-HT4 receptors selected from regions of post mortem brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease were compared to age-matched controls. In Parkinson's disease, there was no significant difference between control or patient values(mean +/- s.d. Bmax values, fmol mg-1 tissue; putamen, control 4.74 +/- 0.07, patient 5.86 +/- 1.48; substantia nigra, control 4.21 +/- 2.56, patient 5.57 +/- 0.10). In Huntington's disease, there was a significant decrease in putamen (control 5.33 +/- 1.08, patient 2.68 +/- 1.08), while in Alzheimer's disease, there was a marked loss of receptors in hippocampus (control 2.34 +/- 0.62, patient 0.78 +/- 0.61), in frontal cortex (control,1.76 +/- 0.19, patient 1.30 +/- 0.22). Receptor density in temporal cortex showed a decrease, but did not achieve statistical significance (control 2.06 +/- 0.21, patient 1.44 +/- 0.64).5. These data suggest a heterogeneous distribution of 5-HT4 receptors in human brain, with high to moderate densities in basal ganglia and limbic structures. These receptors may not be principally co-localized on dopaminergic cell bodies or terminals, given the lack of change observed in Parkinson's disease. The loss of 5-HT4 receptors in the putamen in Huntington's disease raises the possibility of their presence on intrinsic striatal GABAergic or cholinergic neurones. The marked loss of receptors in hippocampal and cortical regions in the brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease is consistent with a role for the 5-HT4 receptor in cognitive processing.
7787830	Maternal behavior (ultrasound-induced pup-searching and retrieving) was studied in eight groups of female house mice with various hormonal backgrounds, experience with pups and function of the olfactory system. In their brains, estrogen receptor immunoreactive (ER-IR) cells were localized and quantified. All animals of all groups had ER-IR cells in a 'reliable subset' of brain areas, the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and ventromedial (VMH) and arcuate nucleus (ARH) of the hypothalamus. In another subset of brain areas, the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) and cortical (CA) and medial (MA) amygdaloid nucleus, ER-IR cells can be expected in at least some animals of all experimental groups ('expected subset'). In a variable subset of additional brain areas (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, BNST; suprachiasmatic nucleus, SC; lateral septal nuclei, LS; paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, PVH; entorhinal and piriform cortex, ENT, PIR; subiculum, SUB; hippocampus, HPC; periventricular gray of the midbrain, PVG), ER-IR cells occurred only in some animals of some groups. Numbers of ER-IR cells in a given brain area, volumes occupied by these cells, and cell densities varied considerably among the groups. A covariation of cell counts and volumes was significant for most brain areas indicating that increases of numbers of ER-IR cells relate mainly to volume increases within a given brain area. Experience with pups correlated with an increase of ER presence in the AHA, VMH, ENT, PIR, SUB, HPC and PVG, however, only in the presence of estrogen. Estrogen and pup-experience together led to an increased ER presence in mainly the VMH, ENT and PIR, however, only in females with intact olfaction. Full maternal behavior (retrieving, ultrasound recognition) occurred after the high pregnancy- or experience-induced ER content was reduced to lower levels. The ER occurrence in lactating and experienced virgin females differed, however, in the AHA, BNST, SC, PVH, ENT, PIR, SUB, HPC and PVG showing that the maintenance of maternal behavior can run under different profiles of ER content in the brain. Ovariectomy and/or prolonged high blood-estrogen levels correlated significantly with decreased levels of ER-IR cells in most brain areas which could not be increased by pup-experience.
7790912	Potassium channels play major roles in the regulation of many aspects of neuronal excitability. These channels are particularly well suited for such multiplicity of roles since there is a large diversity of channel types. This diversity contributes to the ability of specific neurons (and possibly different regions of the same neuron) to respond uniquely to a given input. Neuronal integration depends on the local response of spatially segregated inputs to the cell and the communication of these integration centers with the axon. Therefore, the functional implications of a given set of K+ channels varies depending on their precise location on the neuronal surface. Site-specific antibodies were utilized to characterize the distribution of KV3.1b, a subunit of voltage-gated K+ channels in CNS neurons. KV3.1b subunits are expressed in specific neuronal populations of the rat brain, such as cerebellar granule cells, projecting neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei, the substantia nigra pars-reticulata, the globus pallidus, and the ventral thalamus (reticular thalamic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate and zona incerta). The KV3.1b protein is also present in various neuronal populations involved in the processing of auditory signals, including the inferior colliculus, the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the superior olive, and some parts of the cochlear nuclei; as well as in several other neuronal groups in the brainstem (e.g., in the oculomotor nucleus, the pontine nuclei, the reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons, trigeminal and vestibular nuclei, and the reticular formation) and subsets of neurons in the neocortex, the hippocampus and the caudate-putamen shown by double staining to correspond to neurons containing parvalbumin. KV3.1b subunits are localized predominantly in somatic and axonal membranes (particularly in axonal terminal fields) but are much less prominent in dendritic arborizations. This distribution is different than that of other subunits of voltage gated K+ channels and is consistent with a role in the modulation of action potentials. KV3.1b proteins have a cellular and subcellular distribution different than the related KV3.2 subunits which express in Xenopus oocytes currents similar to those expressed by KV3.1b.
7791521	We have used a sensitive solution hybridization assay that employs a riboprobe obtained from the mouse delta opioid receptor (DOR) coding sequence to quantitate the relative abundance of DOR mRNA in the central nervous system (CNS) of the adult mouse and rat. In brain Poly A+ RNA extracts this riboprobe hybridized to a single 10 kb transcript from mouse and two transcripts, one of 12 and the other of 4.5 kb in size from rat. In mouse CNS the highest levels of DOR mRNA were found in the caudate-putamen at 3.3 +/- 0.1 (SEM) pg/micrograms RNA. DOR mRNA levels in the range from 2.6 to 2.1 pg/micrograms RNA were measured in frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, whole brain and olfactory tubercle. Spinal cord, periaqueductal gray and hippocampus had DOR mRNA levels in the range from 1.8 to 1.5 pg/micrograms RNA, while medial thalamus and cerebellum had the lowest levels (0.5 pg/micrograms RNA). These results correlate with the reported relative distribution of DOR mRNA in mouse using an in situ hybridization technique. In rat CNS, the highest levels of DOR mRNA were measured in caudate-putamen at 2.3 +/- 0.1 pg equivalents/micrograms RNA. Whole brain, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and brain stem had levels in the range from 1.5 to 0.9 pg equivalents/micrograms RNA while the lowest DOR mRNA levels were measured at 0.5 pg equivalents/micrograms RNA or less in thalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra and cerebellum. This study demonstrates the ability of solution hybridization assays to quantitate homologous (mouse) as well as similar but heterologous (rat) DOR mRNA levels.
7793307	Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a "ladder" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.
7802967	The distribution of binding sites of [125I]RTI-55 (3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropan-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester), a phenyl tropane analog of cocaine, and the selective labeling of the dopamine transporter (DAT) were studied by in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography in the rat whole brain. Recent evidence has shown that RTI-55 binds to not only DAT but also serotonin transporter (5HTT). In the present study, in vitro autoradiography revealed that [125I]RTI-55 bound to the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the accumbens nucleus, the midline and lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the hypothalamic nuclei, the substantia nigra compact part, the subthalamic nucleus, the ventral tegmental area, the superior colliculus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the facial nucleus. Further, in the presence of clomipramine, a selective ligand for 5HTT, [125I]RTI-55 binding was remarkably inhibited in the midline and lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the hypothalamic nuclei, the superior colliculus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the facial nucleus, while [125I]RTI-55 binding remained in the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the accumbens nucleus, the substantia nigra compact part, the subthalamic nucleus, and the ventral tegmental area. These findings suggest that [125I]RTI-55 binds to 5HTT in the former areas and to DAT in the latter areas. It is therefore concluded that RTI-55 is a suitable ligand for studying the action of cocaine in whole brain regions, including the thalamus, the hypothalamus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, regions in which cocaine is thought to act evoking several neurological effects, e.g., analgesia and elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone. DAT was also labelled selectively both in vitro and in vivo using [125I]RTI-55 combined with clomipramine. Therefore, radiolabelled RTI-55, combined with unlabelled clomipramine, which displaces its binding to 5HTT, also appears to be suitable for the selective imaging of DAT in vivo.
7804602	The distribution of the kappa opioid receptor mRNA in adult mouse brain has been determined using the technique of in situ hybridization histochemistry. The mRNA for the kappa opioid receptor was expressed in distinct areas throughout the brain. The telencephalon showed high levels of expression in the deeper layers of the parietal and temporal cortex, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, nucleus of the vertical and horizontal limb of the diagonal band, and medial and central nuclei of the amygdala. In the diencephalon, kappa opioid receptor mRNA was present in multiple medial thalamic nuclei including the centromedial, paraventricular, parafasicular, central, and peritenial nuclei, as well as in most hypothalamic nuclei including the ventromedial, periventricular, supraoptic, arcuate, and dorsomedial nuclei. The mesencephalon showed highest levels of kappa receptor mRNA in the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, zona incerta, interpeduncular nucleus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, central grey, and the raphe nucleus. In the metencephalon, kappa opioid receptor mRNA was expressed in the parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, and the raphe pontine nuclei. The distribution of the kappa receptor mRNA closely coincides with the localization of binding sites in rat brain for [3H]U-69,593, a specific kappa 1 opioid receptor ligand. The mRNA distribution also correlates with neuroanatomical sites of actions of kappa agonists and distribution of the endogenous kappa receptor ligand dynorphin.
7814667	In an attempt to reveal the function sites of substance P (SP) in the central nervous system (CNS), the distribution of SP receptor (SPR) was immunocytochemically investigated in adult rat and compared with that of SP-positive fibers. SPR-like immunoreactivity (LI) was mostly localized to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Neurons with intense SPR-LI were distributed densely in the cortical amygdaloid nucleus, hilus of the dentate gyrus, locus ceruleus, rostral half of the ambiguus nucleus, and intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic cord; moderately in the caudatoputamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, median, pontine, and magnus raphe nuclei, laminae I and III of the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and lamina I of the spinal cord; and sparsely in the cerebral cortex, basal nucleus of Meynert, claustrum, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and lobules IX and X of the cerebellar vermis. Neurons with weak to moderate SPR-LI were distributed more widely throughout the CNS. The regional patterns of distribution of SPR-LI were not necessarily the same as those of SP-positive fibers. The entopedunucular nucleus, substantia nigra, and lateral part of the interpeduncular nucleus showed intense SP-LI but displayed almost no SPR-LI. Conversely, the hilus of the dentate gyrus, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, and dorsal tegmental nucleus showed intense to moderate SPR-LI but contained few axons with SP-LI. These findings confirmed the presence of the "mismatch" problem between SP and SPR localizations. However, the distribution of SPR-LI was quite consistent with that of the SP-binding activity, which has been studied via autoradiography. This indicates that the sites of SPR-LI revealed in the present study represent most, if not all, sites of SP-binding activity.
7816195	Supraspinal afferents to the pontine micturition center, Barrington's nucleus, were investigated in the rat by visualization of the retrograde tracer, cholera-toxin subunit B, in neurons following iontophoretic injection into Barrington's nucleus. Tissue sections from five rats with injections primarily localized in Barrington's nucleus revealed numerous retrogradely labeled neurons throughout all rostrocaudal levels of the periaqueductal gray (particularly its ventrolateral division), in the lateral hypothalamic area (particularly medial to the fornix), and in the medial preoptic nucleus. Retrogradely labeled neurons were also consistently found in the nucleus of the solitary tract, in the vicinity of the lateral reticular nucleus, nucleus paragigantocellularis, parabrachial nucleus, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, raphe nucleus and zona incerta. In the hypothalamus, in addition to the perifornical region, retrogradely labeled neurons were found in all cases in the tuberomammillary nucleus, premammillary nucleus, dorsal hypothalamic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus. At more rostral levels, in addition to the medial preoptic area, retrogradely labeled neurons were seen in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in a region just lateral to the supraoptic nucleus near the medial amygdaloid nucleus. Retrogradely labeled neurons were also observed in the motor, insular, and infralimbic cortices. Injections of anterograde tracers (cholera-toxin subunit B or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin) into the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, lateral hypothalamic area, or medial preoptic area, resulted in fiber labeling within Barrington's nucleus, confirming the retrograde tracing studies. As previously reported, numerous neurons in Barrington's nucleus were immunoreactive for corticotropin-releasing hormone. Double-labeling studies revealed afferent fibers from the periaqueductal gray and lateral hypothalamic area overlapping the corticotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive neurons of Barrington's nucleus, and in some cases anterogradely labeled fibers with varcosities appeared to target these neurons. The present results suggest that Barrington's nucleus in the rat receives neuronal inputs from brainstem nuclei as well as from forebrain limbic structures including hypothalamic nuclei, the medial preoptic nucleus, and cortical areas involved in fluid balance or blood pressure regulation. In light of the role of Barrington's nucleus in micturition, the integration of these various inputs may be important for co-ordinating urinary function with fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. Additionally, as neurons in Barrington's nucleus are immunoreactive for the stress-related neurohormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, these diverse inputs may regulate stress-related functions of this nucleus.
7830900	The postnatal development of GABAB binding sites in rat brain was studied by quantitative receptor autoradiography using [3H]GABA under selective conditions. Binding levels peak at regionally specific times during the first three weeks of life and then decline to adult levels. GABAB binding peaked in the globus pallidus, vestibular and spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the CA3 region of the hippocampus at postnatal day 3; in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, inferior olive, septum, dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the hippocampus at postnatal day 7; in the neocortex and thalamus at postnatal day 14; and in the medial geniculate at postnatal day 21. Following these regionally specific peaks, binding decreased to postnatal day 28 levels. Further significant decreases in binding were observed in all regions examined between postnatal day 28 and adulthood. Comparisons of binding site pharmacology reveal equipotent displacement of GABAB binding by several competitive agonists and antagonists in postnatal day 7 and adult rat brain, indicating that immature and adult binding sites have similar pharmacological properties with regard to these compounds. The GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 54626A, however, inhibited binding more potently in the postnatal day 7 thalamus and neocortex than in these areas in the adult brain. The guanyl nucleotide analogue guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphasphate) inhibited GABAB binding extensively in both postnatal day 7 and adult brain. The non-competitive antagonist zinc also inhibited GABAB binding at both ages and was more potent in postnatal day 7 brain than in adult brain. Saturation analyses reveal two binding sites with similar affinities in both immature and adult rat brain, indicating that postnatal modulation of GABAB binding reflects changes in binding site density rather than modulation of binding site affinity. While immature GABAB binding sites share most pharmacological characteristics with adult binding sites and appear to be coupled to G-proteins at an early age, their interactions with zinc and CGP 54626A suggest that GABAB binding sites in immature brain may have a distinct pharmacological profile. Our data suggest significant regional and pharmacological changes in GABAB binding during development. The implications of these findings are discussed with regards to a possible role of GABAB receptors in the development of the central nervous system.
7844312	The purpose of this study was to identify the CNS neurons that express Fos protein after repeated activation of the baroreceptor reflex. This was done in Wistar rats anesthetized with urethane and alpha-chloralose with careful physiological controls. The intact control rat showed few Fos-immunoreactive (ir) neurons, whereas the anesthetized control rat showed many Fos-ir neurons in the CNS from the medulla oblongata to the forebrain. After repeated stimulation of baroreceptors by pressor responses to phenylephrine (dose), we counted the amounts of Fos-ir neurons (response). The correlation coefficient of the dose-response relationship was high, and significant only in the medial part of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the medulla and periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the midbrain, whereas it was comparatively high but insignificant in the commissure and lateral parts of the NTS, caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla, periambiguus nucleus, dorsal and ventral medullary reticular nuclei, lateral parabrachial nucleus, paraventricular nucleus thalamus, and dorsomedial nucleus hypothalamus. No significant correlation was found in the humoral control nuclei in the preoptico-hypothalamic structure. Fos expression was never detected in the sensory neurons in the ganglia petrosum and nodosum, and in the sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic spinal cord. This study shows that Fos expression in the CNS neurons is induced not only by baroreceptor stimulation but also by anesthesia and/or sham-operation, and that Fos expression in the NTSm and PAG neurons faithfully responds to baroreceptor stimulation.
7850460	The discovery of glucagon biosynthesis and receptors within mammalian brain has led one to suspect a neurotransmitter role for glucagon. In order to address this hypothesis in birds, we investigated the existence of glucagon receptors in duck brain by radioligand binding on fresh tissue sections and radioautography. Specific high-affinity [125I]glucagon binding sites similar to those in the liver were demonstrated in the avian brain. Mapping of these putative glucagon receptors revealed a discrete distributional pattern. Most of the [125I]glucagon binding capacity in duck brain is concentrated within the telencephalon, mainly in components of motor and limbic systems. Specific labeling densities were associated with avian equivalents of the mammalian pyramidal system (hyperstriatum accessorium; archistriatum intermedium and tractus occipitomesencephalicus) and extrapyramidal system (paleostriatum augmentatum, paleostriatum primitivum and lobus parolfactorius), as well as several limbic structures (hippocampal formation, nucleus taeniae and the caudal part of the archistriatum). Few glucagon-reactive foci were detected in the diencephalon (the nucleus dorsomedialis of hypothalamus, the two circumventricular organs, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and median eminence and the nucleus habenularis medialis). These findings suggest that glucagon might be involved in the central control of somatic motricity and basic behaviors and point therefore to glucagon as a new neuroactive messenger in avian brain. The extensive difference between the distribution of glucagon binding sites observed in duck brain and that previously reported in rat brain suggests that glucagon does not subserve the same physiological role(s) in avian and mammalian brains.
7854065	Polyclonal subtype-specific antibodies were developed against three subtypes of GABA transporters (GAT1, GAT2 and GAT3). By immunoblot analysis, each antibody detected a single band that could be blocked by absorption of the antibody with the respective antigen. GAT2 was found in various tissues, while GAT1 and GAT3 were detected only in the brain. GAT1 was distributed throughout the brain with the highest amount in the olfactory bulb, CA3 region of the hippocampus, layer I of the cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, superior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus and nucleus spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, while the GAT3 was densely found in the olfactory bulb, thalamus, hypothalamus, pons and medulla, globus pallidus, central gray, substantia nigra, deep cerebellar nuclei and nucleus spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve but not in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen and cerebellar cortex. GAT2 immunoreactivity was faint throughout the brain but was concentrated in the arachnoid and ependymal cells. Both GAT1 and GAT3 were found in the neuropil but not in the cell bodies nor in the white matter. These results suggest that GAT1, GAT2 and GAT3 are expressed in different cells and that GAT1 and GAT3 are involved in distinct GABAergic transmission while GAT2 may be related to non-neuronal function.
7857598	We have produced transgenic (Tg) mice carrying 5.0-kb fragment from the 5'-flanking region of the human tyrosine hydroxylase (hTH) gene fused to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) [Sasaoka et al. (1992) Mol Brain Res 16: 274-286]. In the brain of the Tg mice, CAT expression has been observed in catecholaminergic (CAnergic) neurons and also in non-CAnergic neurons. The aim of the present study is to examine in detail the cell-type specific expression of the hTH-CAT fusion gene in the brain of the Tg mice, by use of immunohistochemistry for CAT, TH, and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). CAT-immunoreactive cells were found in CAnergic brain regions which contained TH-positive cells, and also in non-CAnergic brain regions which contained no TH-labeled cells. The non-CAnergic brain regions that represented CAT-stained cells were further divided into two groups: (i) regions containing AADC-labeled cells, for example, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus suprachiasmaticus, mammillary body, nucleus raphe dorsalis, inferior colliculus, and nucleus parabrachialis, and (ii) regions containing no AADC-positive cells, for example, main olfactory bulb (except A16), accessory olfactory bulb, nucleus olfactorius anterior, caudoputamen, septum, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, medial nucleus of the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, nucleus supraopticus, and parasubiculum. The results indicate that the 5.0-kb DNA fragment flanking the 5' end of the hTH gene may contain the element(s) specific for neuron-specific TH expression but which may be insufficient to attenuate ectopic expression.
7860780	[D-Ala2]deltorphin-I, a highly selective ligand for delta opioid receptors, is a heptapeptide originally purified from frog skin. Previous immunohistochemical studies indicate that [D-Ala2]deltorphin-I-like molecule(s) may be present in adult rat brain, including specific neuronal cells and fibers partially overlapping with the mesocortical and nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems. Here, we examined the developmental aspect of such immunoreactive brain structures in early postnatal rats. In newborn to 21-day-old rats, positive staining in the brain occurred mainly in subpopulations of neurons and occasionally in tanycytes. On postnatal day 0, neuronal cell bodies containing [D-Ala2]deltorphin-I-like immunoreactivity were found in various brain regions, including the olfactory tubercle, ventral pallidum, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, pars compacta of the substantia nigra, supramammillary nucleus, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, olfactory tubercle, prelimbic area, anterior cingulate cortex, neostriatum, accumbens, lateral septal nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, and superior colliculus. As pups grew, positive staining of cell bodies decreased gradually in both density and intensity, and those in the olfactory tubercle and ventral pallidum were no longer visible on postnatal day 14. On postnatal day 21, positive cells were found only in the ventral midbrain, including the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, A8 region, and supramammillary nucleus. Positive fibers also decreased in density with age except in the accessory olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, prelimbic area, and anterior cingulate cortex.
7861132	Transketolase (TK; EC 2.2.1.1) is a key pentose phosphate shunt enzyme that plays an important role in the production of reducing equivalents and pentose sugars. TK activity declines in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, as well as in thiamine-deficient rats. Understanding the role of TK in the pathophysiology of these neurodegenerative conditions requires knowledge of its regional, cellular, and subcellular distribution within the brain. The current study employed in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to examine the distribution of TK mRNA and its encoded protein in adult rat brain. TK mRNA and protein were widely distributed throughout the brain. However, they were enriched in selective perikarya in the piriform cortex, nucleus of the diagonal band, red nucleus, dorsal raphe, pontine nucleus, locus coeruleus, trapezoid, inferior olive, and several cranial nerve nuclei. Lower expression of TK mRNA and protein occurred in layer V of cortex, olfactory tubercle, ventral pallidum, medial septal nucleus, hippocampus, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, mammillary body, central gray, and the substantia nigra. TK immunoreactivity also occurred in the nuclei of ubiquitously distributed glial cells, as well as ependymal cells. The heterogeneous distribution of TK may reflect a variety of metabolic activities among different brain regions but does not provide a simple molecular explanation for selective cell death in either thiamine deficiency or other conditions where TK is reduced.
7868187	The role of the catecholamines noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine on metallothionein (MT) levels of specific areas of the rat brain has been studied. MT-I or MT-I + II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay using specific antibodies that cross-react only slightly with human MT-III (growth inhibitory factor, GIF). The inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (MPT), which depletes brain dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, increased MT levels in all brain areas studied (frontal cortex, cortex, medulla oblongata plus pons, midbrain, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum) when considering the results of two separate experiments. The alpha- and beta-receptor blockers, phentolamine, and propranolol, alone or together, did not increase brain MT levels in any area of the brain, suggesting that the effect of MPT in vivo is related to inhibition of the synthesis of dopamine rather than of noradrenaline and adrenaline. Dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin increased MT-I levels in primary cultures of neurons, whereas decreased them in astrocyte-enriched primary cultures. Since MT-I levels are about ten times higher in astrocytes than in neurons, the increased brain MT levels induced by MPT may reflect the suppression of the normal inhibitory effect of dopamine on astrocyte MT levels. The increase in MT concentrations induced in most parts of the brain by immobilization stress was not prevented by MPT, phentolamine, or propranolol, suggesting that it was not mediated by the central monoamines.
7870313	Distribution of the messenger RNA for the prostaglandin E receptor subtype EP3 was investigated by in situ hybridization in the nervous system of the mouse. The hybridization signals for EP3 were widely distributed in the brain and sensory ganglia and specifically localized to neurons. In the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, about half of the neurons were labeled intensely. In the brain, intensely labeled neurons were found in Ammon's horn, the preoptic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, lateral mammillary nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei. Moderately labeled neurons were seen in the mitral cell layer of the main olfactory bulb, layer V of the entorhinal and parasubicular cortices, layers V and VI of the cerebral neocortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, globus pallidus and lateral parabrachial nucleus. In the thalamus, moderately labeled neurons were distributed in the anterior, ventromedial, laterodorsal, paraventricular and central medial nuclei. Based on these distributions, we suggest that EP3 not only mediates prostaglandin E2 signals evoked by blood-borne cytokines in the areas poor in the blood-brain barrier, but also responds to those formed intrinsically within the brain to modulate various neuronal activities. Possible EP3 actions are discussed in relation to the reported neuronal activities of prostaglandin E2 in the brain.
7884049	The mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors are the three main types of opioid receptors found in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. These receptors and the peptides with which they interact are important in a number of physiological functions, including analgesia, respiration, and hormonal regulation. This study examines the expression of mu, delta, and kappa receptor mRNAs in the rat brain and spinal cord using in situ hybridization techniques. Tissue sections were hybridized with 35S-labeled cRNA probes to the rat mu (744-1,064 b), delta (304-1,287 b), and kappa (1,351-2,124 b) receptors. Each mRNA demonstrates a distinct anatomical distribution that corresponds well to known receptor binding distributions. Cells expressing mu receptor mRNA are localized in such regions as the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, lateral and medial septum, diagonal band of Broca, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, most thalamic nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, medial preoptic area, superior and inferior colliculi, central gray, dorsal and median raphe, raphe magnus, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, pontine and medullary reticular nuclei, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus gracilis and cuneatus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Cellular localization of delta receptor mRNA varied from mu or kappa, with expression in such regions as the olfactory bulb, allo- and neocortex, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, ventromedial hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, red nucleus, pontine nuclei, reticulotegmental nucleus, motor and spinal trigeminal, linear nucleus of the medulla, lateral reticular nucleus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Cells expressing kappa receptor mRNA demonstrate a third pattern of expression, with cells localized in regions such as the claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, most hypothalamic nuclei, median eminence, infundibulum, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, raphe nuclei, paratrigeminal and spinal trigeminal, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. These findings are discussed in relation to the physiological functions associated with the opioid receptors.
7890832	The present investigation used an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the signal transducing nerve growth factor receptor, trkA, to reveal immunoreactive perikarya or fibers within the olfactory bulb and tubercle, cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum, endopiriform nucleus, septal/diagonal band complex, nucleus basalis, hippocampal complex, thalamic paraventricular and reuniens nuclei, periventricular hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve, dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, ventral cochlear nucleus, ventral lateral tegmentum, medial vestibular nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis, nucleus of the solitary tract, raphe nuclei, and spinal cord. Colocalization experiments revealed that virtually all striatal trkA-immunoreactive neurons (> 99%) coexpressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) but not p75 nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). Within the septal/diagonal band complex virtually all trkA neurons (> 95%) coexpressed both ChAT and p75 NGFR. More caudally, dual stained sections revealed numerous trkA/ChAT (> 80%) and trkA/p75 NGFR (> 95%) immunoreactive neurons within the nucleus basalis. In the brainstem, raphe serotonergic neurons (45%) coexpressed trkA. Sections stained with a pan-trk antibody that recognizes primarily trkA, as well as trkB and trkC, labeled neurons within all of these regions as well as within the hypothalamic arcuate, supramammilary, and supraoptic nuclei, hippocampus, inferior and superior colliculus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area of T'sai, and cerebellular Purkinje cells. Virtually all of these other regions with the exception of the cerebellum also expressed pan-trk immunoreactivity in the monkey. The widespread expression of trkA throughout the central neural axis suggests that this receptor may play a role in signal transduction mechanisms linked to NGF-related substances in cholinergic basal forebrain and noncholinergic systems. These findings suggest that pharmacological use of ligands for trkA could have beneficial effects on the multiple neuronal systems that are affected in such disorders as Alzheimer's disease.
7890891	Hyperintensity in the basal ganglia of patients with serious liver disease is a common finding on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. In this study, we used optical densitometry to quantitatively evaluate the hyperintense magnetic resonance image signal changes in the various regions of the brain of patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy. The incidence and morphological distribution of the magnetic resonance signal changes were evaluated from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain from seven non-alcoholic patients and six healthy controls. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the patient group and controls were found in the limbic system (hippocampus, temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus, and fornix), extrapyramidal system and associated myelinated pathways (lentiform nucleus, tectum, tegmentum, cerebral peduncles, internal capsule and the corpus callosum). No measurable differences were observed in the frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex, or the dorsomedial thalamus. The presence of the high signal intensity changes on T1-weighted magnetic resonance image suggests that characteristics alterations occur in functional regions of the brain in chronic hepatic encephalopathy.
7893197	We studied the distribution of calbindin-immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies in the cat brainstem. The densest clusters of immunoreactive perikarya were found in the inferior and superior colliculi, the inferior olive, the periaqueductal gray, the central tegmental field and the substantia nigra, whereas the central linear nucleus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus incertus, the dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the cuneiform nucleus, the pontine gray, the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the medial nucleus of the solitary tract had the lowest density. In the lateral tegmental field, the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, the superior central nucleus, the nucleus sagulum, the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, the interpeduncular nucleus and the retrorubral nucleus the density of immunoreactive cell bodies was moderate. A high density of immunoreactive fibers was observed in the substantia nigra, the nucleus ruber, the superior and inferior colliculi, the periaqueductal gray, the interpeduncular nucleus, the central, magnocellular and lateral tegmental fields, the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, the postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, the inferior olive, the internal division of the lateral reticular nucleus and the medial and lateral nuclei of the superior olive. A moderate density of calbindin-immunoreactive fibers was found in the retrorubral nucleus, the central linear nucleus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus sagulum, the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, the cuneiform nucleus, the ventral and dorsal nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the medial nucleus of the solitary tract, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the cuneate nucleus. Other brainstem regions such as the area postrema, the external division of the lateral reticular nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus, the nucleus intercalatus, the nucleus incertus, the pyramidal tract and the trapezoid body had the lowest density of immunoreactive fibers.
7898667	The distribution and density of cannabinoid receptor binding and messenger RNA expression in aged human brain were examined in several forebrain and basal ganglia structures. In vitro binding of [3H]CP-55,940, a synthetic cannabinoid, was examined by autoradiography in fresh frozen brain sections from normal aged humans (n = 3), patients who died with Alzheimer's disease (n = 5) and patients who died with other forms of cortical pathology (n = 5). In the structures examined--hippocampal formation, neocortex, basal ganglia and parts of the brainstem--receptor binding showed a characteristic pattern of high densities in the dentate gyrus molecular layer, globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, moderate densities in the hippocampus, neocortex, amygdala and striatum, and low densities in the white matter and brainstem. In situ hybridization histochemistry of human cannabinoid receptor, a ribonucleotide probe for the human cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA, showed a pattern of extremely dense transcript levels in subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and cortex, moderate levels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and neurons of the striatum, amygdala and hypothalamus, and no signal over dentate gyrus granule cells and most of the cells of the thalamus and upper brainstem, including the substantia nigra. In Alzheimer's brains, compared to normal brains, [3H]CP-55,940 binding was reduced by 37-45% in all of the subfields of the hippocampal formation and by 49% in the caudate. Lesser reductions (20-24%) occurred in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, internal segment. Other neocortical and basal ganglia structures were not different from control levels. Levels of messenger RNA expression did not differ between Alzheimer's and control brains, but there were regionally discrete statistically significant losses of the intensely expressing cells in the hippocampus. The reductions in binding did not correlate with or localize to areas showing histopathology, estimated either on the basis of overall tissue quality or silver staining of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Reduced [3H]55,940 binding was associated with increasing age and with other forms of cortical pathology, suggesting that receptor losses are related to the generalized aging and/or disease process and are not selectively associated with the pathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, nor with overall decrements in levels of cannabinoid receptor gene expression.
7901271	We report the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons in the brain of adult and developing trout. In the adult brain TH-ir neurons were observed in the telencephalon (in the olfactory bulbs and the ventral telencephalic region), the diencephalon (in both the parvicellular and magnocellular portions of the preoptic nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the ventromedial thalamic nucleus, the posterior tuberal nucleus, the organon vasculosum hypothalami, the lateral recess nucleus and the dorsal periventricular region of the medial lobe recess), the pretectal region (nucleus pretectalis periventricularis), the isthmal region (locus coeruleus) and the medulla oblongata (in the area postrema, nucleus solitarius, the reticular area of the vagal region, and the reticular nucleus of the octaval region). The earliest TH-ir nuclei were observed in 10- to 11-min embryos in the posterior tuberal nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus solitarius and vagal reticular neurons. In the olfactory bulb, nucleus ventromedialis thalami and octaval reticular area, TH-ir cells a latter appeared at a later stage in development. In fry, juveniles and adults cerebrospinal fluid-contacting TH-ir cells were observed in circumventricular organs. The evolution of these TH-ir neuronal populations during development is described, and we discuss their significance for both comparative and developmental analysis.
7902053	Neurons in the central nervous system communicate almost exclusively by the production and release at synapses of a series of molecules that are designated transmitters. Three such molecules make up the major transmitters, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA neurons are the principal inhibitory neurons and, as such, are the major local circuit neurons of the brain. They also are projection neurons in a number of systems. Glutamate neurons are excitatory projection neurons, particularly of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and retina. Acetylcholine neurons are excitatory neurons in ascending brainstem and basal forebrain systems and in cranial and spinal motor neurons and neurons of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The catecholamines, dopamine and norepinephrine, are transmitters in several systems in brain. Dopamine is present in midbrain neurons projecting to the neostriatum, basal forebrain and cerebral cortex. It is also produced by hypothalamic neurons projecting to the median eminence and pituitary. These systems are highly topographically organized in contrast to the norepinephrine systems. The locus coeruleus norepinephrine system projects principally to thalamus, cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex whereas the lateral tegmental system projects primarily to basal forebrain, hypothalamus, brainstem and spinal cord. The serotonin neurons of the brainstem raphe also project widely over the neuraxis, midbrain raphe neurons primarily to diencephalon and telencephalon and pontine medullary neurons to brainstem and spinal cord. There are smaller neuronal groups that produce glycine or histamine. At the present time, it appears that most, if not all, CNS neurons produce one of these small molecule transmitters. In many instances, these molecules are colocalized with one or more peptides that appear to modify the postsynaptic action of the small molecule transmitter.
7907172	Distribution of kappa-opioid receptor mRNA in rat brain was examined by in situ hybridization technique. kappa-Opioid receptor mRNA was expressed in various brain regions, especially intensely in the neocortex (layer V and VI), caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, preoptic area, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, amygdala, several nuclei of hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta.
7914895	We determined the regional distribution of the dopamine D2 receptor group in the rat central nervous system by quantitative receptor autoradiography with a high-affinity and selective antagonist, [3H]YM-09151-2. Saturation and competition experiments demonstrated that the binding of [3H]YM-09151-2 to striatal sections was saturable (Bmax = 37.3 fmol/section), of high affinity (Kd = 0.315 nM), and was inhibited selectively by prototypic D2 ligands. The anatomical localization of binding sites was determined by comparison of autoradiograms and the original 3H-ligand-exposed sections stained with cresyl violet. Very high levels of [3H]YM-09151-2 binding were found in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, tuberculum olfactorium and the insula of Calleja, to each of which midbrain dopaminergic neurons project densely. High levels of binding were also observed in other regions rich in dopaminergic neurons and fibers including the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the intermediate lobe of the pituitary, lateral septum, substantia nigra pars compacta, interfascicular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Some regions poor in dopaminergic innervation, however, had high levels of [3H]YM-09151-2 binding including the molecular layer of gyrus dentatus, all layers of CA1 and the nonpyramidal layer of CA4 of hippocampus, and the deeper layer of medial entorhinal cortex. Motor neurons present in brainstem motor nuclei and spinal ventral horn were also strongly labeled. Neocortical, cerebellar, and thalamic regions had low levels of binding, except lobules 9-10 of the cerebellum, the olivary pretectal nucleus, zona incerta and lateral mammillary nucleus, in which moderate to high levels of binding were detected. Our findings concerning the widespread but region-specific localization of [3H]YM-09151-2 binding sites in the brain and spinal cord may prove useful for analyzing various dopaminergic functions in the central nervous system.
7925112	Vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) transcripts were localized in brain, pineal, and superficial brain vascular tissues of adult male rats using hybridization histochemistry and an [35S]riboprobe complementary to the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the fifth to the midseventh transmembrane regions of the receptor. V1aR mRNA was extensively distributed throughout brain and was expressed in 1) superficial cells of the granule cell layers of the main olfactory bulb, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and cerebellum; 2) numerous anatomically distinct brain nuclei; 3) isolated cells dispersed throughout the central nervous system; 4) cells of the choroid plexus, occasional blood vessels in the olfactory bulb and interpeduncular nucleus, and extraparenchymal intracranial vasculature; and 5) some white matter structures. Numerous cells expressing V1aR transcripts were found in forebrain structures, including primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, the anterior and posterior olfactory nuclei; dorsal, intermediate, and ventral lateral septal nuclei; the septo-fimbrial nucleus and accumbens nucleus; and numerous hypothalamic regions with the most intense hypothalamic labeling in the arcuate, stigmoid, suprachiasmatic, and periventricular nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area. Cells expressing V1aR transcripts were ubiquitous throughout the midbrain, pontine, and medullary regions. A lower intensity signal was found in cells of the parvocellular paraventricular and anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus, circumventricular organs including the pineal, and the subfornical organ. V1aR transcripts were not generally detected in parenchymal vasculature, but could be found over large blood vessels in the interpeduncular nucleus and medial olfactory bulb; transcripts were commonly detected in perivascular brain cells. V1aR mRNA was abundantly expressed by choroid plexus, endothelial cells of midline blood vessels between the main olfactory bulbs, and superficial vascular tissue on all brain surfaces. These data confirm the presence of the vascular/hepatic-type V1aR gene in brain tissue and document an extensive expression. The distribution of V1aR mRNA suggests that there are at least two types of vasopressin-responsive cells in brain: one type exemplified by lateral septal ara neurons innervated by classical axodendritic/somatic synaptic vasopressinergic terminals and a second, perivascular/vascular type that would facilitate humoral vasopressinergic signaling in the brain.
7953743	Based on enzymatic activity, the localization and the identification of D-amino-acid oxidase-containing cells in rat whole brain was systematically studied in serial fixed sections. The oxidase activity was absent or scarce in the forebrain, was confined to the brain stem (midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata) and cerebellum, and its localization was extended to the spinal cord. In the brain stem the oxidase was mainly localized in the tegmentum, particularly in the reticular formation. The intense oxidase reactions were present in the red nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, trochlear nucleus, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, vestibular nuclei, nuclei of posterior funiculus, nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, lateral reticular nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus. In the cerebellum the activity in the cortex was much more intense than that in the medulla. In all the fields described above, the oxidase-containing cells were exclusively astrocytes including Bergmann glial cells, and neither neuronal components, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes nor ependymal cells showed oxidase activity. These results indicated that the astrocytes regionally differentiated into two distinct types, one of which expressed oxidase in the midbrain, rhombencephalon and spinal cord, and the other which did not in the forebrain. The localization of the oxidase was inversely correlated with the distribution of free D-serine in mammalian brains (Nagata, Y., Horiike, K. and Maeda, T., Brain Res., 634 (1994) 291-295). Based on the characteristic localization of the oxidase-containing astrocytes, we discussed the physiological role of the oxidase.
7954075	Major regions of the rat brain have been examined for the presence of glucose transporters (GLUTs 1-4) and their mRNAs. Both the mRNA and immunoreactive protein for GLUT1 and GLUT3 were found in each brain region (medulla, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, parietal cortex). The mRNA and protein for GLUT4 were identified in the cerebellum, but not elsewhere in the brain. GLUT2 protein and mRNA were not detected in any region of the brain. Although GLUT1 and GLUT3 are the major brain glucose transporters, the presence of GLUT4 in the cerebellum suggests that insulin-sensitive glucose uptake may occur in a specific part of the brain.
7955710	We studied cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in 6 patients with pure akinesia (PA), 8 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 10 normal control subjects using positron emission tomography (PET). Regions of interest were studied in the cerebral cortex (the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe), thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, and brainstem. In patients with PA, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and brainstem compared with normal control subjects. PSP patients showed significantly decreased CBF in the entire cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, and brainstem and regional cerebral oxygen metabolic rate (CMRO2) in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, whereas patients with PD were revealed to be normal in both CBF and CMRO2 values. In conclusion, a part of patients with PA may be in the early stage of PSP or may be atypical presentations of PSP whose symptom is only akinesia judging from the followings. 1) PET findings demonstrated a close similarity between PA and PSP; a pattern of CBF and CMRO2 decrement especially in the frontal cortex, thalamus and brainstem. 2) Patients with PA were shown to have similar pathological changes to PSP in recent studies. 3) Several authors reported that some PSP cases could show only akinesia initially, later developing dementia, supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseundobulbar palsy, and nuchal rigidity during their illnesses.
7964808	The first comprehensive in vivo documentation of the long term profile of pathological and spared tissue is described in a group of 10 patients with a diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis, who were left with memory difficulties as a major residual sequel of their condition. With a dedicated MRI protocol, which included high resolution images of temporal lobe and limbic system areas, data are provided on structures that have recently gained importance as anatomical substrates for amnesia. The major features of the lesion profile were: (1) unilateral or bilateral hippocampal damage never occurred in isolation, and was often accompanied by damage to the parahippocampus, the amygdala, specific temporal lobe gyri, and the temporal poles; (2) the insula was always abnormal; (3) neocortical temporal lobe damage was usually unilateral or asymmetric. It never occurred in isolation, and was invariably associated with more medial pathological changes; (4) anterior and inferior temporal lobe gyri were damaged more often and more severely than posterior and superior temporal lobe gyri; (5) pronounced abnormality was often present in the substantia innominata (region of the basal forebrain/anterior perforated substance); (6) there was evidence of significant abnormality in the fornix; (7) there was evidence of damage to the mammillary bodies; (8) thalamic nuclei were affected in around 50% of cases, with damage usually unilateral; (9) frontal lobe damage was present in a few patients, and affected medial areas more than dorsolateral areas; (10) there was some involvement of the striatum, although this was usually unilateral and mild; (11) there was usually limited involvement of the cingulate gyrus and of the parietal and occipital lobes; (12) the cerebellum and brain stem were never damaged. Lesion covariance analysis indicated a close relation between the presence of abnormalities in temporal lobe and limbic-diencephalic regions. Unlike severe head injury, lesions in the temporal pole were not associated with the presence of lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex. Long term neuropsychological impairments were characterised by a dense amnesia in 60% of cases, and a less serve but noticeable anterograde memory impairment in the others. Naming and problem solving deficits were found in a small number of cases. Only two patients were able to return to open employment. Severity of amnesia showed a significant relation with severity of damage to medical limbic system structures such as the hippocampus, with bilateral damage being particularly important. By contrast, there was a minimal relation between memory loss and severity of damage to the thalamus, to lateral temporal lobe areas, or to the frontal lobes.
7968346	The distribution of cells expressing mRNA encoding a vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) was examined in Long-Evans male and female rats by in situ hybridization using a [35S]cRNA probe. Specific hybridization to the vasopressin V1aR mRNA was evident in cells of the frontal cortex, piriform cortex, internal granular layer and the medial, dorsal, ventral and lateral portion of the anterior olfactory nucleus, zona limitans of the islands of Calleja, suprachiasmatic nucleus, CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, lateral habenular nucleus, and the molecular and granular cell layers of the cerebellum. The cerebellum, olfactory nucleus and the dentate gyrus appeared to be the most intensely labeled areas, while all other areas exhibited a lower level of expression. The anatomical distribution and the amount (as measured by optical density) of V1aR mRNA labeling was identical between male and female rats. This indicates that unlike the vasopressin gene itself, the expression of the vasopressin V1aR mRNA does not exhibit sexual dimorphism. These data demonstrate a wide spread distribution in the expression of the vasopressin V1aR mRNA in the CNS of male and female rats. This information on the anatomical distribution of the V1aR mRNA when combined with data concerning the anatomical distribution of the V1a binding sites, provides new information on the possible pre- and post-synaptic location of these neuropeptide receptors.
7969912	The distribution of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that transforms superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide, was studied in the human brain post mortem using a sheep polyclonal antiserum raised against the enzyme from liver mitochondria. One band, corresponding to a protein of 22,000 mol. wt was detected in the human brain by western blot analysis. At the light-microscopy level, a punctate immunostaining was observed in the neuropil and in some but not all, glial and neuronal cell bodies. Electron-microscopy revealed that the staining was exclusively confined to the inner mitochondrial membrane. A heterogeneous distribution of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase was observed in the human brain. In the forebrain, numerous immunostained neurons were detected in the striatum, thalamus, pallidal complex and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In the cerebellum, only granular and Purkinje cells were immunostained. Various nuclei from the brainstem displayed superoxide dismutase immunoreactivity, including the cranial nerve nuclei, the nucleus supratrochlearis, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus cuneiformis and subcuneiformis, the nucleus parabigeminal, the nucleus centralis superior, the nucleus supraspinalis, the nucleus of the medullae oblongata and the gigantocellularis nucleus. Large pyramidal neurons containing superoxide dismutase were detected in the CA subsectors, the hilus of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Smaller immunostained neurons were also observed in layers I, IV and VI of all cortical regions studied. The distribution of immunostained glial cells was more limited, and restricted to the internal and external capsules, the hypothalamus, the red nucleus, the pyramidal white matter and surrounding areas, the cerebral cortex and the sub-ependymal layer, the alveus and the stratum oriens of the hippocampus. This heterogeneous but not ubiquitous distribution of cells expressing manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase suggests that not all cells in the human brain are protected to the same extent against the deleterious effects of superoxide.
7974203	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptors were studied in adult human postmortem brain and pituitary gland using quantitative autoradiography with human recombinant [125I]IGF-I. The highest densities were found in the choroid plexus, pituitary gland--where IGF-I receptors were mainly concentrated in the anterior lobe, pineal gland, glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, and the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Moderate densities were present in cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, accumbens, the CA1, CA2, CA3 fields and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, amygdala, thalamus, pontine nuclei, and substantia nigra. All other brain areas, including white matter, contained low densities of IGF-I receptors. The finding that several well-defined brain structures are enriched with IGF-I receptors suggests a neurotrophic/survival or neuromodulatory role of insulin-like growth factors on specific neuronal systems. IGF-I receptors observed in the white matter may be associated with oligodendrocytes.
7984033	Localization of mRNA encoding for the enzyme hexokinase and its regulation in aged animals was carried out in rat brain using the in situ hybridization technique. The highest levels of the hybridization signal were observed in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, tenia tecta, hippocampus and granular cells of the cerebellum. Other brain areas and nuclei including cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, subiculum, choroid plexus and superior colliculus displayed moderate to low density of transcripts. Correlation between relative hexokinase content and levels of its mRNA was found only for some brain regions such as caudate-putamen, geniculate nucleus, ventral and lateral thalamic nuclei, superior colliculus and granular cells of the cerebellum. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of old animals the expression of hexokinase was significantly increased at 18 and 24 months of age. From the present data we conclude that although hexokinase is an ubiquitous enzyme, sites of synthesis display a discrete and uneven localization in rat CNS and expression, in the aging brain, might be regulated to compensate for reduced oxidative phosphorylation in the brain tissue.
7991218	It has been proposed that the neurobiological basis of many of the behavioral manifestations arising in response to Pb exposure may be due to selective vulnerability of particular brain regions, such as hippocampus, a region in which preferential accumulation has been reported in some studies. However, these findings have not been invariant and, in fact, have been found to vary with dosing parameters. This study examined potential regional accumulation of Pb in brain following postnatal exposure of rats to Pb via nursing dams consuming Pb acetate solutions of 0, 100, 350, 1000, or 2000 ppm. Offspring were sacrificed at 7, 14, 21, 40 or 60 days of age and brains dissected into 12 regions, including striatum, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, thalamus, ventral (tegmentum) and dorsal (tectum) midbrain, hippocampus, frontal, parietal/temporal, and occipital cortices, cerebellum and brain stem for regional Pb analyses. All brain regions generally accumulated Pb in a similar pattern. Regional elimination half-lives, determined for the 350, 1000 and 2000 ppm exposure groups, averaged about 20 days and did not vary between regions. Regional brain Pb levels were not different whether brains were perfused or not prior to brain Pb determinations. However, regional differences in brain Pb levels could be introduced by using dry, rather than wet weights in the calculation of Pb concentrations, and by procedures including soaking in formaldehyde prior to drying, probably as a result of the differential fluid volume of different brain regions. Taken together, these data do not support previous findings of selective regional accumulation of Pb in any brain region, including the hippocampus, at least under conditions of postnatal Pb exposure and wet weight measures. While there may indeed be differences among brain regions in sensitivity to Pb, any differences in response among brain regions should probably be ascribed to differences in the interactions of Pb with biochemical or cellular targets unique or enriched in that region rather than to differences in accumulation of Pb.
7998767	Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is known to establish latency in human trigeminal ganglia. It has been speculated that the virus might also be present in latent fashion in normal human brain, where it might be responsible for conditions such as herpes simplex encephalitis, and less plausibly as a cause for multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease. To test the possibility that HSV exists in normal human brain, we utilized the polymerase chain reaction to assess the frequency and distribution of HSV genomes in the nervous system tissues of patients dying of nonneurological causes. Nine samples were obtained in a systematic fashion from olfactory bulb, gyrus rectus, hippocampus amygdala, calcarine cortex, pons, medulla, cerebellum, and trigeminal ganglia from each of 40 individuals dying of nonneurological disease. HSV genomes were sought in each sample using primers from four regions of the HSV genome. The primers were capable of detecting HSV genomic sequences from as little as 10 fg of DNA. HSV genomic sequences were identified in 26 (65%) of 40 samples of trigeminal ganglia. From 30 patients seropositive to HSV, sequences were amplified from 23 (77%). HSV genomic sequences could be amplified and detected in 14 (35%) of 40 brains. The positive areas included medulla, olfactory bulbs, pons, gyrus rectus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The study has confirmed the previous demonstration of latent HSV in trigeminal ganglia in normal humans. The frequency of latent HSV in trigeminal ganglia is in general agreement with results obtained by explanation of ganglia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8004456	Five h after injection of tritiated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 into Trachemys scripta, neurons with nuclear concentrations of radioactivity were identified in distinct regions within the central nervous system. Coinjection of a 100-fold excess of non-labeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 abolished or reduced the specific nuclear binding of tracer. Target neurons were present in ventral periventricular brain regions including tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus accumbens, cortex piriformis, primordium hippocampi, nucleus striae terminalis, dorsal ventricular ridge, amygdala, nucleus infundibularis and tectum opticum. With the exception of the nucleus infundibularis and the tectum opticum, target neurons can be continuously followed from the ventrolateral nucleus accumbens throughout the nucleus striae terminalis into the amygdala. The general distribution of target neurons is similar to that described for rodents but more restricted to the above regions. The results show that target neurons for vitamin D are located in brain regions including several components of the limbic and thalamic systems in which gonadal steroids as well as aminergic and peptidergic messengers exert their actions. Vitamin D, the heliogenic steroid hormone, may therefore be involved in the orchestration of season-specific processes such as reproduction and related behaviors.
8010155	The effect of postnatal age on phosphoinositide metabolism per se and on quisqualate-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism was characterized in synaptoneurosomes prepared from nine different regions of the rat nervous system, namely the brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, colliculi, hippocampus, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, spinal cord and striatum. In the hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, brainstem, colliculus and spinal cord, the basal levels of inositol phosphate (inositol-1-phosphate+inositol-4,5-bisphosphate) formation were maximal two days after birth and declined steeply to steady-state levels from the age of 10 postnatal days. Similarly, in the olfactory bulb, basal inositol phosphate synthesis did not significantly change when measured during the period from postnatal day 10 to 42. The extent of [3H]-inositol labelling of phosphoinositides as a function of age presented similar profiles when measured in hippocampal, striatal, cerebellar and cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes, i.e. maximal at perinatal ages and minimal at adult ages. In the hypothalamus, [3H]-inositol labelling of phosphoinositides showed an increase from postnatal day 12 to higher levels from postnatal days 14 to 18 subsequently followed by a dramatic increase from postnatal day 21 to 42. A similar developmental trend was also obtained for basal inositol phosphate synthesis. On the whole, four types of developmental profiles for quisqualate-stimulated inositol phosphate formation (expressed as the percentage of the basal level and as the difference between stimulated and basal levels of radioactive inositol phosphates) were obtained depending on the nervous system region studied. In the early, prenatally developed nervous system regions, namely the brainstem and the spinal cord, no postnatal stimulation peaks of quisqualate-induced inositol phosphate formation were recorded. This was also the case for the colliculi when the stimulation of IP formation was expressed as the difference in basal and stimulated levels of inositol phosphates. Secondly, in the olfactory bulb a region known to possess a continuous capacity for developmental plasticity both structurally and functionally during the first three weeks of postnatal development, a simultaneous sustained high level of quisqualate stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism (fluctuating around 200% of the basal level) during the early postnatal period was evident. Thirdly, in regions of the central nervous system like the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and the striatum known to undergo intense developmental activity during the first two postnatal weeks, peaks of quisqualate-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism were initially detected around the first week after birth in each of these brain areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8021452	After the intraventricular injection of 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine (5,6-DHT), the course of degeneration and regeneration of the serotonergic fibers in the rat brain was studied immunohistochemically by using serotonin antiserum. Three days after 5,6-DHT treatment, an extensive disappearance of serotonin immunoreactive fibers was observed throughout the brain. Degenerative serotonergic fibers characterized by droplet-like swelling and intense staining by serotonin antiserum were detected in the following discrete areas, e.g., medial forebrain bundle (MFB), cingulate cortex, septal nucleus, diagonal band of Broca (DBB), lateral preoptic area, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, perifornical area, stria-terminals, raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray lateral reticular nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. The swelling were regarded as the proximal stumps of the chemically injured serotonin fibers. Sprouting serotonin fibers emanating from these swellings were observed 5 days after injection. The swollen thick fibers were seen up to 3 months thereafter throughout the brain, although they gradually decreased in number until 1 month after injection. On the contrary, the sprouting fibers extended their terminal fields throughout the brain. Three types of reorganization pattern of regenerating serotonergic fibers were distinguished: hyperinnervation, normoinnervation (similar to the normal innervation) and hypoinnervation patterns. In the areas with hyperinnervation, the density of the serotonergic fibers gradually increased for 3 months. These hyperinnervation patterns of regenerative serotonergic fibers were observed in the MFB, cingulate cortex, diagonal band of Broca, perifornical area, raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area, motor trigeminal nucleus, facial nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus, inferior olivary complex and hypoglossal nucleus. On the other hand, the hypoinnervation displayed by a few regenerating serotonergic fibers was observed in the periventricular part of the prosencephalon, the ventromedial part of the hypothalamus, the dorsal hippocampus, the neocortex, the superior and inferior colliculi, the cerebellum, the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, the vestibular nuclei, the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus. These reorganization patterns were formed 3 months after injection, and continued for a long time (2 years). The mechanisms of serotonergic fiber reorganization are discussed.
8021456	The brain weights and volumes of the main brain subdivisions: telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalic tegmentum, optic tectum, cerebellum and myelencephalon were measured in 8 species of Phasianoidea (Galliformes) and in 20 species of birds belonging to 13 orders. The sizes of these structures were compared using allometry formulae calculated for each structure from the 8 Phasianoidea. Encephalization and the relative size of the main brain subdivisions are expressed by size indices. Higher encephalization indices are obtained in species which are either highly telencephalized as in Psittaciformes or with a large cerebellum as in Sphenisciformes. The brainstem components: diencephalon, mesencephalic tegmentum and myelencephalon appear to be more conservative in their size variation than the telencephalon, cerebellum and optic tectum. The size of the cerebellum appears to be related to flight abilities. The size of the optic tectum is related to the importance of vision in foraging within the Charadriiformes. In tactile-feeding Charadriiformes and filter-feeding Anseriformes, the optic tectum is relatively small.
8026736	1. The effect of morphine tolerance and abstinence on the binding of [3H]naltrexone to discrete brain regions and spinal cord of the rat was determined. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted s.c. under light ether anesthesia with six morphine pellets for a 7-day period. Each pellet contained 75 mg of morphine base. Rats implanted with six placebo pellets each served as controls. 3. This procedure resulted in the development of tolerance to morphine as evidenced by decreased analgesic response to various doses of morphine. 4. The binding characteristics (Bmax or Kd values) of [3H]naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, were determined in various tissues of morphine tolerant and abstinent rats. In the tolerant rats, the pellets were left in place at the time of sacrificing, whereas in the abstinent rats, the pellets were removed 18 hr prior to sacrificing. 5. The binding of [3H]naltrexone to opiate receptors on membranes prepared from brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex, pons and medulla, midbrain, corpus striatum and amygdala) and spinal cord of rats from various treatment groups was determined. 6. [3H]Naltrexone bound to tissue membranes at a single high affinity binding sites. The Bmax values of [3H]naltrexone to bind to opiate receptors on the membranes of amygdala and striatum were increased significantly in morphine tolerant rats when compared to the placebo controls, but the Kd values did not differ. 7. The Bmax and Kd values of [3H]naltrexone did not differ in any other brain region or spinal cord of morphine tolerant rats and their placebo controls. The binding constants of [3H]naltrexone were unaffected in morphine abstinent rats. 8. Previously we had shown that the binding of [3H]D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5 enkephalin (DAMGO), a highly specific agonist for mu-opiate receptors was decreased in cortex, pons and medulla and spinal cord of morphine tolerant but not in the abstinent rats. In addition, delta and kappa receptors are unaffected in morphine tolerant and abstinent rats. 9. The results suggest that direction of change, as well as, the brain areas for mu-agonist and -antagonist opiate binding sites are affected differentially in morphine tolerant rats.
8027428	Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter in the circuitry of the basal ganglia. Of the four pharmacological classes of receptors that may mediate the actions of glutamate, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type is of particular interest insofar as it has been implicated in the neural processes underlying long-term synaptic plasticity as well as excitotoxic injury. NMDA ligand binding sites are abundant in the structures of the basal ganglia, and NMDA receptors have been linked to neuronal excitability, neuropeptide gene expression, and regulation of dopamine release in these regions. NMDA receptors are believed to be heterooligomers of subunits from two families: NMDAR1, encoded by a single gene but alternatively spliced to produce eight distinct isoforms (NMDAR1A-H), and NMDAR2, encoded by four separate genes (NMDAR2A-D). We have used in situ hybridization with a total of 13 oligonucleotide probes to examine the expression of these genes in the rat basal ganglia. NMDAR1 subunits are expressed throughout the basal ganglia as well as in the rest of the brain; however, the alternatively spliced amino-terminal region Insertion I is abundantly expressed only in the subthalamic nucleus and is not detectable in the neostriatum, globus pallidus, or substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, expression of the carboxy terminus segment Deletion I is prominent in the striatum but is not observed in other elements of the basal ganglia. NMDAR2 subunits also exhibit differential expression: NMDAR2B is abundant in the striatum, but NMDAR2A is present within the striatum only at low levels. NMDAR2C is present in the substantia nigra pars compacta only, while NMDAR2D exhibits an unusual distribution, with high levels of expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus, and the ventral pallidum. Since each isoform of the NMDAR1 and NMDAR2 subunits can confer distinct properties on the resultant NMDA receptor, these data imply that there is a high degree of regional specialization in the properties of NMDA receptors within the basal ganglia.
8028479	Because of their similarities, serotonin 5-HT2, 5-HT1C, and the recently described 5-HT2F receptors have been classified as members of the 5-HT2 receptor family, and they have been renamed 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT2B, respectively. The regional distribution and cellular localization of mRNA coding for the members of 5-HT2 receptor family were investigated in consecutive tissue sections from the rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. No evidence for the expression of 5-HT2B receptor was found. High levels of 5-HT2A (formerly 5-HT2) receptor mRNA were observed only in few areas, as the frontal cortex, piriform cortex, ventro-caudal part of CA3, medial mammillary nucleus, the pontine nuclei and the motor cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem, and the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The distribution of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA is generally in good agreement with that of the corresponding binding sites, although discrepancies were sometimes observed. 5-HT2C (formerly 5-HT1C) mRNA was present at very high levels in the choroid plexuses. However, very high levels were also seen in many other brain regions, as the retrosplenial, piriform and entorhinal cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septal nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, amygdala, subiculum and ventral part of CA3, lateral habenula, substantia nigra pars compacta, several brainstem nuclei and the whole grey matter of the spinal cord. These results confirm and extend previous observations that 5-HT2C receptor mRNA is present in many brain areas in addition to those autoradiographically shown to have the corresponding binding sites and that 5-HT2C receptor subtype is a principal 5-HT receptor in the brain. From the comparison between their distributions, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor mRNAs appeared to be expressed in distinct but overlapping sets of brain regions. Both mRNAs coexisted at high levels in the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, pyramidal cell layer of the ventral part of CA3, taenia tecta, substantia nigra pars compacta, and several brainstem nuclei. In other regions both mRNAs were present but with different distributions, as the caudate-putamen. These results are also discussed in relation to the physiological meaning of the existence of two so similar receptor subtypes in the brain.
8031138	Polyclonal antibody against Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase V (CaM kinase V) was prepared from guinea pigs immunized with synthetic polypeptide, based on the partial amino acid sequence of the rat brain enzyme. Immunoblot analysis of purified CaM kinase V revealed two immunoreactive bands with a molecular mass of 41 kDa and minor 40 kDa, respectively. Tissue distribution of CaM kinase V and immunohistochemical localization in rat brain were also investigated. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of immunoreactive proteins with the same molecular mass of 40 and 41 kDa, in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, pituitary gland, lung, adrenal gland, spleen, liver, colon, heart, stomach, ovary, spinal cord, and thymus. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong staining in the neuronal somata and weak staining in the nuclei. Densely stained regions included the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation, the caudatoputamen, the globus pallidus, the hypothalamus, the substantia nigra, the medial geniculate body, the olfactory bulb, the cerebellar cortex and the choroid plexus. CaM kinase V revealed different substrate specificity compared with CaM kinase II. These results lead to the notion that CaM kinase V may exist in 40- and 41-kDa isoforms, is widely distributed in various tissues, and may play an important role in the control of a wide variety of calcium regulated processes in the respective tissues.
8032682	Three opioid receptor types have been identified in the CNS and periphery that are referred to as mu, delta, and kappa. The present study examines the mRNA distribution of the kappa 1 receptor in the rat brain and compares it to the distribution of kappa receptor-binding sites and prodynorphin mRNA using a combination of in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiographic techniques. kappa 1 receptor mRNA was localized with a cRNA probe generated with a BamHI-HindIII cDNA fragment of the rat kappa 1 receptor and corresponds to the last 45 bp of the protein coding region and 728 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region. Prodynorphin mRNA was localized with a cRNA probe corresponding to a 733-bp BamHI-HincII fragment of prodynorphin. kappa receptor-binding sites were labeled in one of two ways: [3H]U69,593 or [3H]bremazocine in the presence of a 300-fold excess of DAMGO and DPDPE. A high degree of correspondence between the kappa 1 receptor mRNA and kappa receptor binding was observed in several brain regions, including the endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, paraventricular, supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, basolateral, medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, midline thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal grey, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Differences in the localization of kappa 1 receptor mRNA and binding and the relationship between the distribution of kappa 1 receptor and prodynorphin mRNAs are discussed.
8032905	Rats subjected to chronic total sleep deprivation (TSD) by the disk-over-water method have shown very large, sustained rebounds in paradoxical sleep (PS) (also known as REM sleep). Other studies have indicated that cholinergic mechanisms are involved in the instigation and maintenance of PS. Hypothetically, the large PS rebounds could be mediated by an upregulation of cholinergic receptors during TSD. To evaluate this hypothesis, regional brain cholinergic receptors were compared in rats subjected to 10-day TSD by the disk-over-water method (TSD rats), yoked control (TSC) rats which received the same physical stimulation but with much smaller reductions in sleep, and home cage control (HCC) rats. L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate were used as specific cholinergic radioligands for nicotinic and muscarinic receptor binding assays, respectively. Nicotinic receptor binding was not significantly different among groups for any of the brain regions assayed, including frontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior hypothalamus, posterior hypothalamus, caudate, limbic system (including septal area, olfactory tubercle, and nucleus accumbens), midbrain, pons, and medulla. Thus, there was no evidence that changes in nicotinic receptors mediate the PS rebounds. For muscarinic receptor binding, TSD rats differed significantly from control rats only in showing a higher binding affinity than TSC rats in the limbic system and a lower binding density than HCC rats in the hippocampus. On the other hand, significant differences in muscarinic receptor binding sites between rats selectively deprived of PS and their yoked controls were found only for the septal area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8032920	The distribution of cells expressing mu-receptor mRNA and mu-receptor binding sites were compared in brain and spinal cord tissue sections using a combination of in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiographic techniques. mu-Receptor mRNA was visualized with a 35S-labeled cRNA probe directed to transmembrane III-VI of the rat mu-receptor, while mu-receptor binding sites were labeled with the mu-selective ligand [3H]DAMGO. A high correspondence between the mu-receptor mRNA and receptor binding distributions was observed in the nucleus of the accessory olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nuclei, striatal patches of the nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen, endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, diagonal band of Broca, globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, most thalamic nuclei, medial and posteriocortical medial amygdala, lateral, dorsomedial, posterior and mammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus, presubiculum, subiculum, rostral interpeduncular nucleus, median raphe, inferior colliculus, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, central grey, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus gracilis, nucleus cuneatus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus. Differences in mu-receptor mRNA and receptor binding distributions were observed in several regions, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, superior colliculus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, cochlear nucleus and spinal cord, and may be due to mu-receptor transport to presynaptic terminals.
8034019	A novel G protein-coupled receptor was cloned by PCR and homology screening. Its deduced amino acid sequence is 47% identical overall to the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors and 64% identical in the putative transmembrane domains. When transiently expressed in COS-7 cells this receptor did not bind any of the typical mu, delta or kappa opioid receptor ligands with high affinity. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that LC132 mRNA is highly expressed in several rat brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, thalamus, subfornical organ, habenula, hypothalamus, central gray, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Based on this distribution and its high homology with the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors, it is proposed that LC132 is a new member of the opioid receptor family that is involved in analgesia and the perception of pain.
8045344	Migration of cranial neural crest cells is a crucial event in the formation of facial organs such as the frontonasal mass and branchial arches. However, the source of the populating crest cells that occupy the frontonasal mass remains unclear in mammalian embryos. To elucidate this, we performed focal DiI injections at various sites in the prosencephalon (forebrain, including the future telencephalon and diencephalon), mesencephalon (midbrain), and the anterior part of the rhombencephalon (hindbrain) separated posteriorly by the preotic sulus (i.e., rhombomere A; future rhombomere 1 and 2) of cultured mouse embryos from the 3- to 10-somite stage. Results directly revealed that during these stages the lateral edge of the prosencephalon produced crest cells which migrated to the frontonasal mass. On the other hand, labeled cells at the anterior neural ridge in the prosencephalon contributed mainly to the head epithelium, including the nasal placode, Rathke's pouch, and oral epithelium. As for the crest cells of the mesencephalon and rhombomere A, their destinations were significantly dependent on the injection site and somite stage. At the 3- to 4-somite stage, the crest cells emigrating from both the mesencephalon and rhombomere A migrated to the first branchial arch. Moreover, the mesencephalic region, but never rhombomere A, produced another group of crest cells that migrated to the frontonasal mass. In the 5- to 10-somite stage, the destinations of late-emigrating crest cells were restricted depending on their premigratory positions, i.e., the region producing crest cells migrating toward the frontonasal mass was restricted to the anterior portion of the mesencephalon, and the crest cells from the posterior portion of the mesencephalon primarily migrated to the first branchial arch, while those from the rhombomere A predominantly migrated to the trigeminal ganglion. Migration toward the frontonasal mass from the mesencephalon ceased at the earliest in the 7-somite stage, followed by termination of mesencephalic and rhombencephalic crest cell migration toward the first branchial arch at the 8-somite stage, whereas the contribution from rhombomere A to the trigeminal ganglion continued even at the 10-somite stage. This behavior suggests that both the prosencephalic and mesencephalic crest contribute to the mesenchymal cells in the frontonasal mass and also that the migration patterns of crest cells released from the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon depend on their axial level and developmental stage at initial emigration.
8050854	Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that oxygen free radicals are involved in the destruction of neurons in various degenerative disorders of the central nervous system. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, three enzymes that contribute to the cellular defenses against free radical damage, were measured in different areas of autopsy brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease and from age matched controls. All brains were removed within 24 hours of the time of death and were cut in half sagitally. One half was stored frozen at -86 degrees C and the other half was examined histologically to confirm the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease. Samples were taken from the frozen half for the enzyme assays. In control brains, the activity of superoxide dismutase is significantly higher in the cerebellum, frontal cortex and hippocampus than it is in the temporal cortex, parietal cortex and entorhinal cortex. The activity of catalase is significantly higher in cerebellum and frontal cortex than in hippocampus, parietal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Glutathione peroxidase activity is uniform across all brain areas studied. In Alzheimer's brains, superoxide dismutase activity is not statistically different among the various brain regions studied, but it is significantly lower than control in the cerebellum (-27%), frontal cortex (-27%) and hippocampus (-35%). Catalase is significantly higher in Alzheimer's cerebellum, frontal cortex and temporal cortex than in Alzheimer's hippocampus, parietal cortex and entorhinal cortex. However, there are no significant differences in catalase activity between Alzheimer's and control samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8052420	To elucidate the role and the mechanism of action of nerve growth factor in the adult central nervous system, we investigated the localization of nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity in adult rat brain, both quantitatively and immunohistochemically, using polyclonal anti-nerve growth factor immunoglobulin G. We raised rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse nerve growth factor antibody with an extremely high titer as 10(-9) determined by an enzyme immunoassay. The affinity-purified anti-nerve growth factor immunoglobulin G specifically recognized nerve growth factor with no cross-reaction to recombinant brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 evaluated by an enzyme immunoassay. We quantified nerve growth factor content in each layer of the adult rat cerebral cortex and in each small piece (0.225 mg wet weight tissue) of the diencephalon, brainstem and cerebellum with a highly sensitive two-site enzyme immunoassay. Nerve growth factor content was unevenly distributed in the cerebral cortex (dense in layers II/III and V/VI and sparse in layers I and IV). Moderate to high levels of nerve growth factor were registered in the habenular nuclei, zona incerta, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, ventral cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, lateral vestibular nucleus, cerebellar nuclei and paraflocculus. Immunohistochemically, the nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity was found in the cell bodies, dendrites and axons of adult rat central neurons, not only in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal forebrain, but also in the diencephalon, brainstem and cerebellum. The population of neurons with nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity was limited, but unexpectedly widespread, and the density of these cells correlated well with the content determined by an enzyme immunoassay in the present and a previous study [Nishio T. et al. (1992) Expl Neurol. 116, 76-84]. The monoamine neurons, including dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons, showed intense nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity, indicating that the central monoaminergic neuronal system may also be involved in the nerve growth factor trophic system. To visualize nerve growth factor transported in the axons and to enhance the immunostaining in the nerve growth factor-producing cells, we injected colchicine, a potent inhibitor of microtubule polymerization and a blocker of axoplasmic transport, into the lateral ventricle of adult Wistar rat brain. Colchicine treatment enhanced the intensities of nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity in the axons and cell bodies, especially in the axon hillocks and the proximal axons of the nerve growth factor-producing neurons. This observation may suggest the existence of an orthograde axonal transport system for nerve growth factor in the central neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8055329	Neurons of the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca project topographically to the hippocampus through the fornix and fimbria, the supracallosal stria and via a ventral route through the amygdala. Injection of the fluorescent dyes Fluoro-Gold or Diamidino yellow into the fimbria-fornix retrogradely labeled neurons in the medial septum and in the ventromedial portion of the vertical limb of the diagonal band. Injection of True blue into the vicinity of the supracallosal stria labeled only neurons in the dorsolateral portion of the diagonal band. No double labeled neurons were observed. These results indicate that (1) neurons of the medial septum and the ventromedial diagonal band project to (or towards) the hippocampus via the fornix and fimbria, (2) neurons in the dorsolateral portion of diagonal band project via the supracallosal stria, and (3) neurons of the medial septum and diagonal band do not send collaterals via both routes. The differential projection of the two groups of neurons may explain the differences in degenerative changes in the two nuclei after damage to their axons.
8058119	Brain activity patterns during echolocation and flight were assessed in mustached bats (Pteronotus parnellii parnellii). Bats were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]2-deoxyglucose and restrained in a foam holder or allowed to fly for 20 min. Under resting conditions, low levels of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake were observed throughout the forebrain but relatively high uptake was found in brainstem auditory and vestibular centers. In flying, echolocating bats, marked increases in regional [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake were apparent. All structures of the classical ascending auditory pathway were intensely labeled in autoradiograms. Other brain regions that exhibited high [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake in flying bats included the cingulate cortex, stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus, thalamus, caudate-putamen, superior colliculus, pontine reticular formation, nucleus ambiguus, parts of the midbrain central gray, and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, the most prominent increase in [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake was found in discrete patches of the granule cell layer. The results provide the first overview of brain activity patterns during echolocation and flight in bats. In addition, uptake of [14C]fluorodeoxyglucose was used to compare brain activity patterns in flying bats to bats that were imaging their environment via biosonar while hanging in a wire cage. The echolocating-not-flying bats emitted 6931 +/- 1226 pulses in 20 min compared to 8972 +/- 1273 pulses in 20 min for flying bats. The uptake of the metabolic marker was significantly more in the flying bats compared to the emitting-not-flying bats in the medial geniculate, superior colliculus, auditory cortex, cingulate cortex and thalamus. In the nucleus ambiguus, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus, uptake was similar for the flying and emitting-not-flying bats. These results suggest that the high metabolic activity observed in forebrain auditory regions of flying bats is related in part to neural processes that involve sensory motor integration during flight and not simply the perception of acoustic information.
8059927	Copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) activities were determined by the chemiluminescence method using the cypridina luciferin analog (MCLA) in 22 human brains from fetuses to adults. Cu,Zn-SOD activity of the cerebral cortex and white matter increased from 15% in fetuses to 50% of adult levels in neonates. The activity of the white matter was higher than that in the cortex in the fetal period, but was essentially the same as those of the cortex in the postnatal period. Cu,Zn-SOD activity in the central nervous system was highest in the spinal cord and higher in the order pons, medulla oblongata > cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus > putamen, pallidum and cerebrum. These low activities may be related to the vulnerability of cerebral cortex and white matter in premature infants.
8095427	We investigated endogenous levels of a novel peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), in the rat central nervous system. The amount of PACAP was measured by means of highly specific and sensitive sandwich-enzyme immunoassay. This assay system following HPLC analysis revealed that PACAP38 was a major portion of the total PACAP immunoreactivity and PACAP27 levels were negligibly low in the brain. Therefore, we measured the amount of PACAP38 in 62 regions punched out from frozen tissue sections. High amounts of PACAP38 were found in the lateral septal nucleus (intermediate part), diagonal band, central amygdaloid nucleus, several parts of the hypothalamus (suprachiasmatic, supraoptic, periventricular and arcuate nuclei), central gray, interpeduncular nucleus and dorsal raphe. The suprachiasmatic, paraventricular and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei showed the highest levels. A moderate amount of the peptide was observed in the lateral septal nucleus (dorsal part), medial septal nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, thalamus (paraventricular, paratenial, central medial, ventromedial, reuniens and rhomboid nuclei), hypothalamus (lateral hypothalamic area and mammillary body), ventral tegmental area, interfascicular nucleus and in the locus coeruleus. Such a distribution of endogenous PACAP38 did not parallel the localization of PACAP binding sites which we had demonstrated recently. Moreover, the topographical distribution of PACAP38 observed in the present study differed from that of VIP which had been previously reported. The present results suggest that PACAP38 may have a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator role which is different from that of VIP in the central nervous system.
8100526	The specific binding sites of a homophthalazine, girisopam, in rat brain have been localized by qualitative and quantitative autoradiography. This substance exerts strong anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects both in rodents and in humans. High labeling was present in all major components of the extrapyramidal system, such as the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and the extrapyramidal portion of the accumbens nucleus and the olfactory tubercle, while specific labeling was not seen in any other brain areas including the cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellum or brainstem areas. This novel distribution of girisopam is consistent with its antipsychotic effect and anxiolytic properties and may provide a morphological basis for further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of action of homophthalazines in the central nervous system.
8101849	The lateral habenular nucleus of the rat contains a dense plexus of dopaminergic fibers, which are more marked in the medial part of the lateral habenular nucleus than in its lateral counterpart. Employing a combination of fluorescent retrograde axonal tracing with fluorogold and tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence histochemistry, we investigated the distribution of cells of origin of the dopaminergic afferent fibers to the lateral habenular nucleus in the rat. The cells double-labeled with both fluorogold injected into the lateral habenular nucleus and tyrosine hydroxylase antisera were seen in a variety of fore- and midbrain regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, periventricular, ventromedial, and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, ventral tegmental area, interfascicular nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, ventrolateral division of the midbrain periaqueductal gray, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The double-labeled cells were located bilaterally with an ipsilateral predominance, and constituted approximately 10% of the total fluorogold-positive cell population. We have further observed by anterograde axonal tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin that projection fibers arising from the sites of origin of the dopaminergic afferent fibers to the lateral habenular nucleus terminate mainly in the medial part of the lateral habenular nucleus, and to a lesser extent in its lateral counterpart. Thus, we have found in the present study that the dopaminergic neurons sending their axons to the lateral habenular nucleus are widely distributed in the A9, A10, A14, and A15 dopaminergic cell groups. Such dopaminergic neurons may exert regulatory influences upon many limbic-associated brain regions via the lateral habenular nucleus.
8104090	The subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (Spf) contains a substantial number of dopaminergic neurons. The present study was designed to investigate in the rat whether or not Spf neurons projecting to a variety of central nervous system structures are dopaminergic. The following eight structures were tested for projection sites of Spf dopamine neurons: the neocortex, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, inferior olive, and spinal cord. By using a combination of fluorescent retrograde axonal tracing and immunofluorescence histochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, it has been revealed that the Spf provides a dopaminergic innervation, in varying degree, to each of these structures: the neocortex and spinal cord were the largest targets for dopaminergic projections from the Spf. The Spf was also found to contain significant numbers of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the olfactory tubercle and amygdala. In contrast, dopaminergic projections of Spf neurons to the nucleus accumbens, striatum, globus pallidus, and inferior olive were only minor. Furthermore, a series of fluorescent retrograde double-labeling experiments have indicated that individual Spf neurons are poorly collateralized to more than one of the eight terminal fields examined; the Spf neurons descending to the spinal cord relatively more frequently send axon collaterals ascending to the telencephalic structures, including the neocortex, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, striatum, and amygdala. The present results suggest that the Spf constitutes a major origin of widespread dopaminergic projections arising from the thalamus.
8106661	In order to determine the regions within the parabrachial nucleus that receive synaptic input from nociceptive regions of the spinal cord and medulla in the rat, we analyzed the "Golgi-like" labeling produced by anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) from discrete iontophoretic injections confined to either the superficial dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord or to the superficial dorsal horn of the trigeminal nucleus at the level of the obex. Labeled fibers from both the spinal cord and the medulla ascended through the ventral lateral pons and coursed with the ventral spinocerebellar tract toward the parabrachial nuclei. Spinal cord injections led to labeling of fine caliber fibers and en passant and terminal enlargements in the rostral part of the contralateral lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBL), mostly in the central lateral and dorsal lateral subnuclei. Medullary injections revealed fiber and enlargement labeling primarily in the ipsilateral caudal PBL, mostly in the central lateral, external lateral, and medial subnuclei. Injections in both regions resulted in labeled terminations in the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus. These results indicate that the nociceptive regions of the spinal cord and medulla terminate in regions of the parabrachial nucleus that have been associated with autonomic functions because of their interconnections with the hypothalamus, brainstem cardiovascular and respiratory control centers, and the amygdala.
8120637	Based on their relative abundance and regulation by Ca2+ and by phosphorylation in vitro, it is thought that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterases (CaM-PDEs) are important modulators of cyclic nucleotide function in the brain. Two of the most abundant CaM-PDEs in the brain are the 61 kDa and 63 kDa isozymes. In this study, the regional and cellular expression of mRNA encoding these two different isoforms in mouse brain has been determined by in situ hybridization. The 63 kDa CaM-PDE mRNA has a wide-spread but uneven distribution. Very strong hybridization signals are present in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Somewhat lesser amounts of 63 kDa CaM-PDE mRNA are present in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex. Weaker but still easily discernible hybridization signals are seen in several layers of the cerebral cortex, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. A weak hybridization signal was detected in the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia. In general, the distribution of the 63 kDa CaM-PDE is very similar to that of dopamine receptors, suggesting that it may modulate dopamine function. In contrast, the 61 kDa CaM-PDE mRNA has a more limited and much different distribution, with the highest level of expression in the cerebral cortex and in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. A moderate hybridization signal was detected in the medial habenula and amygdaloid nuclear complex. In addition, small subsets of neurons in several other regions showed specific hybridization. Both PDE mRNAs appear to be localized exclusively in neuronal cell bodies. Their distinct distribution suggests important but different physiological roles for these two isozymes in the regional regulation of cyclic nucleotides in the CNS. Since these two isozymes are differentially phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, the differential expression also provides a potential mechanism by which these PDEs can differentially regulate cAMP and cGMP in different brain areas. The high expression levels in specific subsets of neurons also suggest that agents increasing Ca2+ in these neurons will increase the rate of cyclic nucleotide degradation.
8124872	We studied Wallerian degeneration of the cortico-descending tract in the cerebral peduncle following a supratentorial cerebrovascular lesion by MRI. A total of 57 patients with palsy following a supratentorial cerebrovascular lesion were prospectively studied. Wallerian degeneration was detected as a high signal intensity (HSI) in 37 patients between 70 days and 100 days after the onset, but not detected in the remaining 27 patients. Patient with an HSI in all area of the cerebral peduncle had a large lesion involving the hemisphere. Patient with an HSI at the center of the cerebral peduncle had a lesion confined to the paracentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, corona radiata or posterior limb of the internal capsule. Patient with an HSI at the lateral side of the cerebral peduncle had a lesion of parietal lobe or temporal lobe which spares the corticospinal tract originating from the paracentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, corona radiata or posterior limb of the internal capsule. These findings suggest that an HSI at the center of the cerebral peduncle may reveal Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract, and an HSI at the lateral side of the cerebral peduncle may show Wallerian degeneration of the corticopontine tract. The functional recovery of paresis was poor in all patients with an HSI at the center of the cerebral peduncle, while it was good in all patients without an HSI in that region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8134309	This paper examines the distribution of fibers and cell bodies containing alpha-neo-endorphin in the cat brain stem by using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. A high or moderate density of immunoreactive cell bodies was found in the superior central nucleus, nucleus incertus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, and in the laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus, whereas a low density of such perikarya was observed in the inferior colliculus, nucleus praepositus hypoglossi, dorsal nucleus of the raphe, nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, and in the nucleus of the solitary tract. The highest density of immunoreactive fibers was found in the substantia nigra, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus coeruleus, lateral tegmental field, marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, and in the inferior and medial vestibular nuclei. These results indicate that alpha-neo-endorphin is widely distributed in the cat brain stem and suggest that the peptide could play an important role in several physiological functions, e.g., those involved in respiratory, cardiovascular, auditory, and motor mechanisms.
8149221	To investigate the distribution of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the central nervous system of urethane anesthesized rats after activation of a somatosympathetic reflex pathway, the cut central end of the right femoral nerve of 17 male Wistar rats was stimulated electrically for 1 h at parameters such that increases in heart rate and arterial pressure were elicited. Sections of brain and spinal cord were incubated in anti-Fos antibody and the presence of FLI was detected using the ABC immunoperoxidase method. In the spinal cord FLI was present in the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord (laminae 1 and 2, 4-6 and 10) and contralateral intermediolateral nucleus in the thoracic spinal cord. In the hindbrain, FLI was present in the contralateral rostral ventrolateral medulla and bilaterally in the cochlear nucleus, external cuneate nucleus, locus coeruleus and lateral parabrachial nucleus. In the midbrain, label appeared in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and peripeduncular nucleus on both sides. In the forebrain, FLI appeared bilaterally in the central nucleus of the amygdala, para- and periventricular hypothalamus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular thalamus, reuniens nucleus, subfornical organ and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These results define the central nervous system pathways of somatosympathetic reflexes and demonstrate that areas in the forebrain not previously known to be activated by somatosympathetic reflexes, but previously implicated in mediating the defense reaction, are activated by these reflexes.
8170498	In situ hybridization histochemistry was performed to analyse the distribution of the messenger RNA (mRNA) of three putative somatostatin (SRIF) receptors in rat brain, using oligonucleotide probes derived from the cDNA coding for SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-3 receptors. SSTR-1 signals were found in layers V-VI of the cerebral cortex, in primary olfactory cortex, taenia tecta, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, granular layer of the dentate gyrus, amygdala and cerebellar nuclei. Signals for SSTR-2 were found in the frontal cerebral cortex (layers IV, V and VI), taenia tecta, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, locus coeruleus, medial habenula, subiculum, granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and amygdala. High levels of SSTR-3 hybridization were found in the olfactory bulb, primary olfactory cortex, islands of Calleja, medial habenula, amygdala, granular layer of the dentate gyrus, various thalamic and pontine nuclei and in the granular and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum. The distribution of the hybridization signals of the oligoprobes is consistent with the labelling of specific SRIF binding sites in rat brain. Especially, SSTR-2 and SSTR-1 oligos seem to label regions in which SS-1 and SS-2 receptors, respectively, have been previously characterized in autoradiographical studies. The situation is less clear with SSTR-3 mRNA, since SRIF binding in adult rats is usually low or absent in cerebellum, although some cerebellar nuclei appear to be labelled in the adult. The localization of SSTR-1, SSTR-2 and SSTR-3 mRNAs suggests that SRIF receptor subtypes in rat brain show profound differences in their distribution and are involved in a variety of central, in addition to neuroendocrine, functions.
8170524	Using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, the location of gastrin-releasing/bombesin-like immunoreactive fibres and cell bodies in the cat brainstem was studied. A moderate or low density of immunoreactive cell bodies was observed in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and in the external division of the lateral reticular nucleus. The densest network of immunoreactive fibres was visualized in the interpeduncular nucleus, marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, alaminar and laminar spinal trigeminal nuclei and in the substantia nigra. The periaqueductal gray, brachium of the inferior colliculus, nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, locus coeruleus, nucleus incertus, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, facial nucleus, medial nucleus of the solitary tract and the area postrema contained a moderate density of immunoreactive fibres, whereas the pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus, nucleus sagulum, cuneiform nucleus, dorsal nucleus of the raphe, superior central nucleus, central, lateral and paralemniscal tegmental fields, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, nucleus ambiguus, accessory dorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the inferior olive had the lowest density of immunoreactive fibres.
8173963	The immunohistochemical localization of hyaluronic acid (HA) was studied in rat and human brain using the monoclonal antibody NDOG1, which specifically recognizes HA. In both rat and human brain, HA-like immunoreactivity formed characteristic coats around neurons in highly selective areas. The staining was abolished by pretreatment of sections with testicular and Streptomyces hyaluronidases, indicating that the staining was specific for HA. In rat brain, positive neurons were located in the cerebral cortex, subiculum, amygdala, thalamic reticular nucleus, nuclei of the inferior colliculus, nuclei of the trapezoid body, and vestibular nuclei. They were also scattered in the hypothalamus, substantia nigra pars reticularis, red nucleus, parabrachial nuclei, brainstem reticular nuclear group, ventral cochlear nucleus, nuclei of lateral lemniscus, and deep cerebellar nuclei. Double immunohistochemical studies showed that many neurons staining for HA were positive for parvalbumin, with minor exceptions in the amygdala and piriform cortex, where some HA-positive neurons were also positive for calbindin-D28k. In the areas studied in human brain, the distribution of HA-positive neurons was virtually identical to that in rat brain. HA-positive neurons were not significantly altered in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain, suggesting that these neurons are resistant to the pathological process of AD.
8176000	Early studies that used older tracing techniques reported exceedingly few projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) to the brainstem. The present report examined DR projections to the brainstem by use of the anterograde anatomical tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). DR fibers were found to terminate relatively substantially in several structures of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. The following pontine and midbrain nuclei receive moderate to dense projections from the DR: pontomesencephalic central gray, mesencephalic reticular formation, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, nucleus pontis oralis, nucleus pontis caudalis, locus coeruleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and raphe nuclei, including the central linear nucleus, median raphe nucleus, and raphe pontis. The following nuclei of the medulla receive moderately dense projections from the DR: nucleus gigantocellularis, nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe obscurus, facial nucleus, nucleus gigantocellularis-pars alpha, and the rostral ventrolateral medullary area. DR fibers project lightly to nucleus cuneiformis, nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, nucleus paragigantocellularis, nucleus reticularis ventralis, and hypoglossal nucleus. Some differences were observed in projections from rostral and caudal parts of the DR. The major difference was that fibers from the rostral DR distribute more widely and heavily than do those from the caudal DR to structures of the medulla, including raphe magnus and obscurus, nucleus gigantocellularis-pars alpha, nucleus paragigantocellularis, facial nucleus, and the rostral ventrolateral medullary area. A role for the dorsal raphe nucleus in several brainstem controlled functions is discussed, including REM sleep and its events, nociception, and sensory motor control.
8182554	The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) C-terminal fragment human CGRP8-37 acts as a potent antagonist of various in vitro and in vivo effects of CGRP. Its iodinated counterpart, [125I-Tyr] hCGRP8-37, binds with high affinity (KD values between 7.5 x 10(-11)-2.1 x 10(-10) M) to what is apparently a single class of CGRP receptors in brain, atrium and vas deferens membrane preparations. The relative potencies of various CGRP-related fragments and analogs in competing for [125I-Tyr]hCGRP8-37 binding sites were similar in these three preparations, with hCGRP alpha being the most potent competitor, followed by unlabeled hCGRP8-37, the linear agonist [acetamidomethyl-cysteine2,7] hCGRP alpha, and finally by rat amylin-amide and salmon calcitonin. Competition profiles suggested the existence of a single affinity site (except in the case of hCGRP alpha, for which competition binding data were best fitted to two apparent affinity constants in all three tissues), whereas rat amylin-amide revealed two affinity constants in the rat brain. Guanylylimidodiphosphate (100 microM) failed to alter specific [125I-Tyr]hCGRP8-37 binding in the various tissues studied here. Quantitative receptor autoradiography in the rat brain revealed [125I-Tyr]hCGRP8-37 binding sites mostly concentrated in the nucleus accumbens (shell), caudate putamen (tail), amygdaloid body, pontine nuclei, cerebellum and inferior olive, whereas lower quantities of sites were present in the olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens (core), medial geniculate, superior colliculus, temporal cortex, inferior colliculus, lateral lemniscus, vestibular nuclei and principal sensory trigeminal nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8190373	We cloned a cDNA for the rat mu-opioid receptor from a rat thalamus cDNA library. The deduced amino-acid sequence of rat mu-opioid receptor consists of 398 residues with the features shared by the members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, and is 59% and 60% identical with those of rat kappa-opioid and mouse delta-opioid receptors, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of mu-opioid receptor mRNA was intensive in the thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus and pons-medulla, moderate in the hippocampus and midbrain, and slight in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. More detailed distribution of the mRNA in the rat brain was examined using the in situ hybridization technique. Intense expression of mu-opioid receptor mRNA was observed in the internal granular and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, medial septum, diagonal band, medial preoptic area, several nuclei of thalamus, amygdala, interpeduncular nucleus, medial raphe nucleus, inferior colliculus, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus solitary tract and ambiguus nucleus. Furthermore, mu-opioid receptor mRNA was moderately expressed in the hippocampus, globus pallidus, ventral pallidus, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, superior colliculus, periacqueductal gray, and several nuclei of lower brain stem, including raphe magnus nucleus, reticular gigantocellular nucleus and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus.
8195465	In situ hybridization techniques were used to examine the distribution and the nerve growth factor (NGF) regulation of trkA mRNA in the adult rat brain in order to identify neurons in discrete regions of the brain that may be NGF responsive. In agreement with previous studies, trkA mRNA was detected within cells located in the medial septum (MS), diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and caudate. trkA mRNA was also detected in many other regions of the brain, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, substantia innominata, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, vestibular nuclei, raphe obscuris, cochlear nucleus, sensory trigeminal nuclei, and gigantocellular as well as perigigantocellular neurons in the medullary reticular formation. By combining in situ hybridization detection of trkA mRNA with immunocytochemical detection of p75NGFR, it was determined that the vast majority (> 90%) of the trkA mRNA-containing cells detected in the MS and DBB also express p75NGFR. Likewise, the vast majority of p75NGFR-IR cells detected in the MS and DBB expressed trkA mRNA. Intracerebroventricular infusions of NGF into the third ventricle adjacent to the preoptic area resulted in a 58% increase in relative cellular levels of trkA mRNA in the horizontal limb of the DBB. These data provide evidence that both p75NGFR and trkA are expressed by NGF-responsive neurons in the MS and DBB. In addition, we note that areas that contained trkA mRNA and that also have been reported to contain p75NGFR are areas where high-affinity NGF binding sites have been observed autoradiographically, whereas areas that contain either trkA or p75NGFR alone are areas where no high-affinity NGF binding has been reported. Together, these findings suggest that both trkA and p75NGFR play an important role in the formation of high-affinity NGF receptors in brain and, furthermore, suggest that NGF may have physiological effects within many regions of the brain outside of the basal forebrain.
8195811	This study is a chronological analysis of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced alterations in development of the hamster cerebellar cortex. This treatment destroys the overlying meningeal cells, the sequelae of which include (i) a thinning of the external granular layer over the folial apices and a thickening in the region of the prospective fissures, reflecting a retardation of the growth of the cerebellar cortex, accompanied by displacement of the normally superficialmost GFAP-positive external granular layer cells into deeper parts of the external granular layer; (ii) a retardation of multiplication of Golgi epithelial cells which colonize the rostral third of the Purkinje cell layer so that their numbers decrease in the rostralmost folia; (iii) disturbed morphological and biochemical differentiation of the Golgi epithelial cells and their processes, the growing radial Bergmann glial fibres which detach from the pial surface and branch within the external granular layer, causing a failure in endfeet formation at the superficial glia limitans, loss of characteristic radial morphology, with the adoption of a multipolar form, and normal or increased GFAP expression and decreased S-100 expression; (iv) fragmentation of the external granular layer beyond P5 to P7 with loss of the regular lamination and foliation of the cerebellar cortex, characterized by a completely random distribution of fragments of Purkinje cell layer, molecular zone and internal granular layer. We conclude that the destruction of meningeal cells interferes with the establishment and stabilization of both the external granular layer and the secondary radial glial scaffold composed of Golgi epithelial cells, whose proliferation, growth and differentiation is subsequently disturbed. The failure to stabilize the external granular layer and to form a normal secondary radial glial scaffold is, in turn, responsible for the disruption of the regular laminar deposition of the neurons of the cerebellar cortex.
8214629	We examined the regions projecting to the supramammillary nucleus of the rat with retrograde transport of WGA-HRP and WGA, and anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. The supramammillary nucleus receives major descending afferents from the infralimbic cortex, the dorsal peduncular cortex, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the medial and lateral preoptic nuclei, bilaterally. The major ascending afferents come from the pars compacta of the nucleus centralis superior, the ventral tegmental nucleus, and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. The supramammillary nucleus also receives a few (but distinct) fibers from the anterior and lateral hypothalamic nuclei, the ventral premammillary nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, the cuneiform nucleus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the incertus nucleus, and the C3 region including the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus. All descending fibers run through the medial forebrain bundle. Almost all ascending fibers from the pars compacta of the nucleus centralis superior and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus run through the mammillary peduncle, and terminate throughout the supramammillary nucleus. A few fibers from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and the C3 region run through the fasciculus longitudinalis dorsalis and terminate in the dorsal part of the supramammillary nucleus including the supramammillary decussation.
8214631	Brain sections of the turtle, Mauremys caspica were studied by means of an antiserum against rat corticotropin-releasing factor. Immunoreactive neurons were identified in telencephalic, diencephalic and mesencephalic areas such as the cortex, nucleus caudatus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic dorsolateral aggregation, nucleus of the paraventricular organ, infundibular nucleus, pretectal nucleus, periventricular grey, reticular formation and nucleus of the raphe. Many immunoreactive cells located near the ependyma were bipolar, having an apical dendrite that contacted the cerebrospinal fluid. Immunoreactive fibers were seen in these locations and in the lamina terminalis, lateral forebrain bundle, supraoptic nucleus, median eminence, neurohypophysis, tectum opticum, torus semicircularis and deep mesencephalic nucleus. Parvocellular bipolar immunoreactive neurons from the paraventricular and infundibular nuclei projected axons that joined the hypothalamo-hypophysial tract and reached the outer zone of median eminence, and the neural lobe of the hypophysis where immunoreactive fibers terminated close to intermediate lobe cells. From these results it can be concluded that, as in other vertebrates, corticotropin-releasing factor in the turtle may act as a releasing factor and, centrally, as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.
8221163	We studied the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the cat brain stem. A high or moderate density of perikarya containing parvalbumin was observed in the periaqueductal gray, interpeduncular nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, superior and inferior colliculi, and in the substantia nigra. The nucleus ruber, cuneiform nucleus, preolivary nucleus, retrorubral nucleus, paracentral division of the tegmental reticular nucleus, central and lateral tegmental fields, and the pericentral division of the dorsal tegmental nucleus had the lowest density of immunoreactive cell bodies. Moreover, a high or moderate density of parvalbumin immunoreactive processes was visualized in the nucleus ruber, substantia nigra, superior and inferior colliculi, periaqueductal gray, nucleus sagulum, cuneiform nucleus, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, vestibular nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and in the lateral reticular nucleus. Finally, a few immunoreactive fibers were observed in the pontine gray, nucleus coeruleus, marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, nucleus of the solitary tract, inferior olive, and in the tegmental fields.
8227517	Distribution of the mRNA for a metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR3, which is coupled to the inhibitory cAMP cascade, was examined in the central nervous system of the adult albino rat by in situ hybridization. The hybridization signals of mGluR3 were detected not only on neuronal cells but also on many glial cells throughout the brain and spinal cord. In the neuronal cells, prominent expression of mGluR3 mRNA was seen in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Moderately labeled neurons were seen in the anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral neo- and mesocortical regions, lateral amygdaloid nucleus, ventral part of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus, superior olivary nuclei, and Golgi cells in the cerebellar cortex. Weakly labeled neurons were observed in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, medial habenular nucleus, anterior pretectal nucleus, Barrington's nucleus, Nucleus O, paragenual nucleus, trigeminal sensory complex, cochlear nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, dorsal cap of the inferior olive, spinal dorsal horn, and lamina X of the spinal cord. The stellate cells in the cerebellar cortex, and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei were also labeled weakly. The granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, as a whole, appeared to be labeled intensely, but each of the granule cells was labeled only weakly. No significant labeling was detected in the mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, hippocampal pyramidal cells, Purkinje and granule cells in the cerebellar cortex, or somatic motoneurons. The distribution of mGluR3 mRNA in particular neurons and glial cells indicates specific roles of mGluR3 in the glutamatergic system of the central nervous system.
8230689	To elucidate the mechanism of general anesthesia, effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on serotonin metabolism in rat brain were studied. Three percent sevoflurane was administered for twenty minutes to Wistar male rats weighing 230-270g under spontaneous respiration. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains were rapidly removed. They were dissected into nine discrete regions, locus coeruleus, pons plus medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex. The contents of serotonin (5-HT) and one of its major metabolites, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with the dual-cell coulometric detector before anesthesia, 20 minutes after the start of anesthesia and at the recovery from anesthesia. Significant increases in 5-HT levels were observed in the pons, hypothalamus, midbrain, amygdala and cerebral cortex by sevoflurane anesthesia as compared with the control group. 5-HIAA levels decreased significantly in the thalamus by sevoflurane anesthesia, while an appreciable increase in 5-HIAA levels was observed in the basal ganglia at the recovery from anesthesia. It is concluded that 5-HT metabolism is significantly suppressed in the pons, hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, amygdala and cerebral cortex during sevoflurane anesthesia and this change in 5-HT metabolism may be associated with a mechanism of sevoflurane anesthesia.
8232728	Using a new ultrasensitive method the trace biogenic amines, phenylethylamine, meta-tyramine and para-tyramine have been quantitated in brain regions obtained from a single rat. Phenylethylamine concentrations in ng/g wet tissue (mean +/- std. error) were as follows: caudate 2.71 +/- 0.73, hypothalamus 0.45 +/- 0.15, cerebellum 0.09 +/- 0.02, olfactory bulb 0.35 +/- 0.11, stem 0.13 +/- 0.03, hippocampus 0.20 +/- 0.11, cortex 0.69 +/- 0.13 and the rest (remainder of the brain) 2.81 +/- 0.41. Mean whole brain was 1.23 +/- 0.19 ng/g, in agreement with previous measurements. meta-Tyramine concentrations (ng/g) were: caudate 2.69 +/- 0.19, hypothalamus 0.32 +/- 0.16, cerebellum 0.07 +/- 0.04, olfactory bulb 0.09 +/- 0.04, stem 0.04 +/- 0.01, hippocampus 0.07 +/- 0.02, cortex 0.18 +/- 0.15 and the rest 0.15 +/- 0.06, with a mean whole brain value of 0.26 +/- 0.05 ng/g and para-tyramine concentrations were: caudate 8.99 +/- 1.60, hypothalamus 0.93 +/- 0.13, cerebellum 0.78 +/- 0.27, olfactory bulb 0.70 +/- 0.13, stem 0.90 +/- 0.36, hippocampus 0.40 +/- 0.06, cortex 1.78 +/- 0.28 and the rest 2.38 +/- 0.12 and mean whole brain was 1.90 +/- 0.25 ng/g. In human plasma the concentrations of the three amines were found to be 31.3 +/- 3.4 pg/ml, 5.3 +/- 1.6 pg/ml and 66.0 +/- 9.9 pg/ml respectively and in dog blood 95.3 +/- 4.6 pg/ml, 24.0 +/- 7.6 pg/ml and 486 +/- 43 pg/ml respectively. When monoamine oxidase inhibitors were added to the blood immediately after collection there were no significant increases in the amine levels indicating that MAO-B is not present in plasma in significant quantities.
8247266	The accessory olfactory system constitutes a sensory system specifically involved in regulating neuroendocrine function and reproductive behavior. The chemosensitive structure of this system, the vomeronasal organ, exclusively innervates the accessory olfactory bulb, which in turn projects via mono- or disynaptic pathways to a limited number of regions implicated in endocrine and sexual function, including the amygdala and hypothalamus. The present study investigated synaptic processing between the different levels of this sensory system, with particular focus on the input from the accessory olfactory bulb to the medial amygdala and the reciprocal connections between the medial amygdala and the ventromedial hypothalamus. Extracellular single-unit recordings were obtained from medial amygdala neurons in anesthetized female rats to study the synaptic responses elicited by stimulation of the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus. Locally applied agonists and antagonists of amino acid neurotransmitters were tested for their ability to mimic and block these synaptic responses in an attempt to identify the neurotransmitters involved in the stimulated pathways. Electrical stimulation of the accessory olfactory bulb induced orthodromic responses in 88% of 288 medial amygdala neurons, with 67% showing orthodromic inhibition and 21% showing excitation as the shortest-latency response. Many cells displayed multiphasic responses with both orthodromic excitation and inhibition. In separate experiments, main olfactory bulb stimulation also produced excitatory (39%) or inhibitory (50%) orthodromic responses in medial amygdala neurons (n = 105), but the latency and distribution of responses were significantly different than with accessory olfactory bulb stimulation. Stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus also had prominent excitatory (29%) or inhibitory (59%) orthodromic actions on the majority of amygdala neurons. Out of 288 cells tested with both accessory olfactory bulb and ventromedial hypothalamus stimulation, 79% were orthodromically responsive to both areas, whereas only 3% responded to neither area. Fourteen (6%) medial amygdala neurons were antidromically activated from the ventromedial hypothalamus, and 11 of these 14 cells were simultaneously orthodromically responsive to accessory olfactory bulb stimulation, indicating that the accessory olfactory bulb can influence medial amygdala neurons that project directly to the hypothalamus. Iontophoretic application of drugs to the medial amygdala revealed that glutamate and GABA consistently mimicked the orthodromic excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively, from both the accessory olfactory bulb and ventromedial hypothalamus. In some cases, ejection of bicuculline could block or reverse excitation of the orthodromic inhibitory responses, whereas kynurenic acid could eliminate the orthodromic excitation, indicating that excitatory and inhibitory amino acid transmitters are at least partially involved in these pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8249621	This study applied immunohistochemistry method to examine the pattern of c-fos expression in the neuraxis following peripheral noxious thermal stimulation accomplished by immersion of tail of awake rat into hot water (50 degrees C). In unstimulated control rats, no obvious baseline expression of c-fos protein was found except in nucleus paraventricularis hypothalami and colliculus inferior, probably associated with restraint-induced stress and auditory stimulus, respectively. Noxious thermal stimulation resulted in the activation of c-fos expression, and bilateral increased nuclear immunostaining was counted in dorsal horn of lumbar and sacral segments of spinal cord (laminae I, II), nucleus raphe dorsalis, substantia grisea centralis (ventralis), nucleus paraventricularis thalami, nucleus anterior thalami, nucleus ventralis thalami, nucleus medialis thalami, nucleus reuniens, nucleus rhomboideus, nucleus habenulae lateralis, nucleus paraventricularis hypothalami, nucleus arcuatus, nucleus lateralis hypothalami, nucleus preopticus lateralis, nucleus septi lateralis, nucleus amygdala, nucleus striae terminalis, nucleus tractus diagonalis, and cortex cerebri. The results demonstrated that peripheral noxious stimulation induced central c-fos protein expression in a pattern of labeling nociresponsive cells.
8252398	Regions of the brain that concentrate estrogen and progesterone are thought to regulate female sexual behavior by altering gene expression and neural sensitivity to afferent stimulation. We used immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to examine c-fos gene expression within estrogen-concentrating regions of the forebrain following various types of sexual stimulation with or without hormone treatment. Ovariectomized rats received injections of estradiol benzoate 48 h and progesterone 4 h before testing. Control rats that had been ovariectomized at least 5 months before testing did not receive hormone treatment. Rats were then either placed into bilevel testing chambers with sexually vigorous males, received manual stimulation of the flanks, received vaginocervical stimulation with a glass rod, or were left in their home cages. Copulation with intromission and ejaculation in hormone-treated rats, or stimulation of the vaginal cervix in both hormone-treated and control rats, produced a dramatic induction of c-fos mRNA and Fos-like immunoreactivity in estrogen-concentrating regions, such as the lateral septum, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral habenula, and medial amygdala, in addition to regions that do not readily concentrate estrogen, such as the neocortex, thalamus, and striatum. Mechanical stimulation of the flanks produced a smaller induction of Fos in these rats, whereas hormone treatment alone had no effect. These data demonstrate that afferent sensory stimulation, but not estrogen or progesterone, regulates c-fos gene expression within different estrogen-concentrating and non-concentrating regions of the female rat forebrain.
8252608	1. The topical distribution of tritiated dexamethasone (DEX), a potent synthetic glucocorticoid of widespread use in the diagnosis and assessment of mental illness, was studied in rat CNS by autoradiography to obtain information on potential target sites for feedback and other centrally mediated effects of glucocorticoids. 2. The cells of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the lateral thalamic nuclei displayed the most concentrated nuclear accumulation of silver grains. 3. Significant accumulation, exceeding that found in the hippocampal formation, also occurred in the cells of the ventromedial, periventricular, and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, the locus ceruleus, the nucleus tractus solitarii, and the area postrema, none of which are targeted by corticosterone, the native glucocorticoid of the rat. 4. Nuclear accumulation of silver grains was prominent in neural and glial cells of the cerebral cortex, the olfactory nucleus, the dorsolateral septum, the amygdala, the subfornical organ, the lateral parabrachial, medial trapezoid, and dorsal reticular nuclei, the nucleus centralis of the raphe, the cerebellum, and vascular tissues. 5. The localization of DEX in hypothalamic and brain-stem nuclei coincided with that of the glucocorticoid receptor, possibly implicating these sites in direct or modulating effects of glucocorticoids in various forms of mental disturbance, including depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and alcohol withdrawal. 6. The extent to which various CNS regions targeted by DEX feature in negative feedback control of adrenocortical secretion remains to be defined, as does the site of impaired feedback disclosed by the dexamethasone suppression test in psychiatric patients.
8255177	The distribution patterns of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA in various brain regions of saline- and kainic acid-treated rats were examined using in situ hybridization technique. In normal rat brain, the signals of IL-1 beta mRNA were observed in the cerebellar Purkinje cells and in dispersed cells in the hypothalamus. In the case of the kainic acid treatment, IL-1 beta mRNA was intensely induced in the olfactory bulb, lateral septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, polymorphic layers of hippocampus, piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and cerebral cortex at 2 h after the injection of kainic acid. In the hypothalamic region, we observed the induction of IL-1 beta mRNA around the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, mammillary regions and arcuate nucleus. The signal of IL-1 beta mRNA was still expressed 4 h after treatment with kainic acid, less intensely than at 2 h, but above the control level. In these regions, IL-1 beta mRNA was expressed mainly in the glial cells, which were densely stained by Cresyl violet and did not contain glial fibrillary acidic protein. These results suggest that IL-1 beta is produced by a certain type of glial cells, maybe microglia, and might have regulatory functions in the central nervous system.
8255180	The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a bidirectional electrogenic ion transporter that exchanges three Na+ ions for each Ca2+ ion and plays a critical role in returning sarcolemma Ca2+ concentrations to their resting levels. Because of the importance that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger may play in maintaining neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis in the central nervous system, we subcloned a 456 bp portion of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger cDNA from RNA isolated from primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This cDNA fragment was sequenced and shown to share 91.4% sequence identity with the human and 88% sequence identity with the canine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. The PCR amplification product was used to analyze the distribution of this portion of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mRNA in various regions of the CNS by both Northern blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry. The Northern analysis showed that the rank order of abundance of this mRNA was: hippocampus > cortex > cerebellum > hypothalamus > midbrain > striatum. The in situ hybridization data indicated that the corresponding mRNA containing this portion of the exchanger was present in numerous brain regions including multiple cortical layers, the hippocampus, septal nuclei, various thalamic nuclei, cerebellum, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, brainstem, in various regions of the thoracic spinal cord and to a lesser extent in the striatum. The differential distribution of the mRNA as revealed by the in situ hybridization pattern suggests that either additional molecular variants exist or that different Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanisms may be operative in those cell types that contain low amounts of this fragment of the exchanger mRNA.
8255431	It has previously been shown that an intracellular serine/threonine kinase known as extracellularly signal-regulated kinase, also known as microtubule-associated protein kinase, is phosphorylated and activated in response to a range of hormones, growth factors (e.g. nerve growth factor) and neurotransmitters (e.g. N-methyl-D-aspartate) in a variety of cells including neurons. Extracellularly regulated kinases phosphorylate transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins and enzyme targets. As such they are believed to function in neuronal signal transduction. In situ hybridization histochemistry using synthetic oligonucleotide probes has been used to identify cells in the adult rat central nervous system containing messenger RNAs coding for two isoforms of extracellularly regulated kinase. Extracellularly regulated kinase-2 messenger RNA was observed in many regions including the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia (except the globus pallidus and endopeduncular nucleus), basal nucleus, thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem nuclei, cerebellum and neurons in the spinal cord. Extracellularly regulated kinase-1 messenger RNA was confined to fewer regions than extracellularly regulated kinase-2 messenger RNA. Hybridization signals for extracellularly regulated kinase-1 were seen in the olfactory bulb, cortex, regions of the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus basalis of Maynert, substantia nigra, some hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei and cerebellum, as well as neurons of the spinal cord. Of particular interest, extracellularly regulated kinase-1 messenger RNA was absent from all regions of the basal ganglia and thalamus. Furthermore, extracellularly regulated kinase-1 was almost absent from the CA1 region, whereas extracellularly regulated kinase-2 was present in all neurons of the hippocampus. There were no CNS regions that expressed extracellularly regulated kinase-1 but not extracellularly regulated kinase-2; however, neurons of the dorsal root ganglia showed extracellularly regulated kinase-1 but not extracellularly regulated kinase-2 messenger RNA. Although extracellularly regulated kinase-1 and extracellularly regulated kinase-2 expression was selectively neuronal in the brain, extracellularly regulated kinase-1 messenger RNA was localized to glia in the spinal cord. The distinct cellular distribution of individual extracellularly regulated kinases in the adult rat CNS suggests that they play unique signalling roles.
8263228	Protein kinase C (PKC) is one of the major cellular signal transduction systems. Since at least nine different PKC isoenzymes have been described, the purpose of the present studies was to identify the regional, cellular, and subcellular distributions of PKC delta in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. We have found that PKC delta immunoreactivity is present in all major subdivisions of the rat CNS. Within each of the subdivisions, PKC delta immunoreactivity is localized to perikarya that monitor sensory and motor functions. More specifically, PKC delta is found in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, lateral septum, thalamus, vestibular and cochlear nuclei, inferior olive, nucleus of the solitary tract, cerebellum, and superficial layers of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. In most cases, the distribution of this isoenzyme is distinct from that of the conventional isoforms. Within the CNS, PKC delta is localized primarily in neurons; however, neurons of the same type are not uniformly labeled. This is most evident in the cerebellum, where alternating columns of Purkinje cells are immunostained. While PKC delta is prominent in perikarya, occasional immunostaining is seen in dendrites, fibers or axons, and nerve terminal. Electron microscopic analysis of the posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus reveals that the cell nucleus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane are all immunopositive. Since each of the PKC subspecies may have different substrate, lipid, and other co-factor requirements, the regional, cellular, and subcellular distribution of each of these isoforms should help to define their functional environments.
8278047	The efferent projections of the ventral pallidum in the rat were studied using anterograde tracing of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde tracing of choleratoxin subunit B. The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8282854	The distribution of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor protein, P400, was investigated in adult rat brain by immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal antibody 4C11 raised against mouse cerebellar inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor protein. Immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies were detected in the cerebral cortex, the claustrum, the endopiriform nucleus, the corpus callosum, the anterior olfactory nuclei, the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus accumbens, the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hippocampal formation, the dentate gyrus, the caudate-putamen, the fundus striatum, the amygdaloid complex, the thalamus, the caudolateral part of the hypothalamus, the supramammillary nuclei, the substantia nigra, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, the ventrotegmental area, the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the subnucleus oralis and caudalis of trigeminal nerve, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Immunoreactive fibres were found in the medial forebrain bundle, the globus pallidus, the stria terminalis, the pyramidal tract, the spinal tract of trigeminal nerve, and the ventral horn of spinal cord. Nerve fibres forming a dense plexus ending in terminal-like boutons were detected in relation to nonimmunoreactive neurons of the dentate, interpositus, and fastigial nuclei of the cerebellum and around neurons of the vestibular nuclei. This receptor protein binds a specific second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which produces a mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and a modulation of transmitter release.
8284033	Selective, 35S-labeled, oligonucleotide probes were designed from sequences of the rat beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor messenger RNAs for use in situ hybridization experiments on sections of unfixed rat brain and spinal cord. After hybridized sections were exposed to film or dipped in autoradiographic emulsion, specific and selective labeling patterns characteristic for each receptor messenger RNA and region of the central nervous system were observed. For example, labeling for beta-1 messenger RNA was found in the anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral cortex, lateral intermediate septal nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus, oculomotor complex, vestibular nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei, trapezoid nucleus, abducens nucleus, ventrolateral pontine and medullary reticular formations, the intermediate gray matter of the spinal cord and in the pineal gland, while beta-2 messenger RNA labeling was strongest in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, hippocampal formation, thalamic intralaminar nuclei and cerebellar cortex. In some of these regions the beta-1 labeling seemed mainly confined to the cell nucleus. Whether or not this apparently nuclear labeling is specific, i.e. indicates synthesis of beta-1 receptor, remains to be established. However, all labeling patterns described disappeared when excess unlabeled probes were added to their respective radiolabeled probes or when sense probes were employed. Since the in situ method labels only cell bodies that produce the messenger RNA for these two beta receptor subtypes, a comparison between these maps and those of past autoradiographic studies mapping the location of central beta receptors using drugs as radioligands may produce further insights regarding the pre- and postsynaptic localization of these receptors in the various parts of the central nervous system circuitry.
8293278	Neuropsychological assessment of 16 clinically non-demented patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 16 age-matched controls revealed significantly (P < 0.05) impaired verbal fluency and picture recall in the ALS patients. On the basis of their verbal fluency scores, two subgroups of the ALS patients (five high, five low scores) and a different group of five age-matched controls then underwent positron emission tomographic (PET) measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Scans were performed in the resting state and while subjects performed stereotyped or freely selected movements of a joystick with their right hand. The pattern of cerebral activation associated with self-generated activity was determined by comparing the profile of rCBF during freely selected and stereotyped joystick movements. Statistical parametric mapping was used to determine significant differences in rCBF between the groups at rest and during activation. Regional cerebral blood flow at rest was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced in the anterior cingulate cortex of both ALS subgroups in comparison with controls. The profile of cortical and subcortical activation during performance of freely selected joystick movements relative to stereotyped movements was abnormal in ALS patients: (i) ALS patients with a normal fluency score showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with controls in the left medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and the right and left parahippocampal gyri; (ii) ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with controls in the right and left medial prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10), the rostral aspects of the right anterior cingulate cortex (areas 24 and 32), the right parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex; (iii) ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with patients with normal verbal fluency in the right parahippocampal gyrus, the anterior thalamic nuclear complex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (area 24). Regional cerebral blood flow at rest in the right parahippocampal gyrus of ALS patients was significantly correlated with verbal fluency score (P = 0.01) and picture recall score (P = 0.01). Activation of the anterior thalamic nuclear complex in ALS patients was also significantly correlated with verbal fluency score (P = 0.001) and picture recall score (P = 0.01). The results show that abnormalities of function are present in regions along a limbo-thalamo-cortical pathway in some ALS patients during performance of a self-generated motor task.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8299274	A 67-year-old patient was admitted to our hospital owing to coma and tetraplegia. MRI showed T2 weighed high intensity areas in the pontine tegmentum, lower aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, left half of medulla oblongata, and bilateral paramedian thalamus. He showed marked recovery by urokinase injection becoming able to walk in a few months, but severe amnesia and hypersomnia persisted even 5 months after onset. EEG showed diffuse alpha activity with occasional delta waves in frontal leads. Intelligence was considered normal (WAIS score; verbal IQ 97, performance IQ 102, total IQ 99), through performance on Wechsler memory Scale-R (Revised Japanese edition, WMS-R) and Benton Visual Retention Test indicated impairment of both verbal and visual memory. Verbal memory was impaired to a greater degree than visual memory (Scores of WMS-R: verbal memory index 60, visual memory index 98, index of general memory 72, attention index 95, index of delayed memory 71). He was able to finish only 0 and 1 categories on two trials of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. FDG (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose)-PET showed diffuse areas of decreased metabolism in bilateral thalami, frontal lobes, cingulate gyri and medial temporal lobes. The bilateral thalamic lesion seemed to affect the following structures, as judged from MRI: 1) The anterior thalamic peduncle including most of the reciprocal connections between dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus (MD nucleus) and the frontal lobe, 2) The inferior thalamic peduncle which serves as the reciprocal pathway between MD nucleus and medial temporal lobe, especially the amygdala (component of Yakovlev circuit), and 3) The inferior part of mammillothalamic tract (component of Papez circuit).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8299281	We report a 64-year-old male with angiotropic lymphoma. He developed subacute dementia with right hemiparesis. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (715 U/l) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (38 mm/hr) and CSF protein (90 mg/dl). Precontrast MR imaging of the brain demonstrated lesions involving the left internal capsule, subcortical white matter in the right frontal lobe and splenium within the atrophic corpus callosum. A brain biopsy revealed intravascular lymphoid cells, strongly suggestive of angiotropic lymphoma. By combination chemotherapy (CHOP), serum LDH and CSF protein normalized through the patient remained demented. He died of bronchopneumonia about 2 years and 5 months after the onset. Coronal sections of the brain showed infarct in the left internal capsule as well as markedly thin corpus callosum with necrotic lesions involving both the genu and splenium. Microscopic examination showed many small vessels occluded by lymphoma cells (B-lymphocyte) predominantly in the corpus callosum, cerebral white matter, thalamus, midbrain, medulla oblongata, thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord. By combination chemotherapy, our patient survived longer than most of previous patients with angiotropic lymphoma. An early diagnosis and subsequent combination chemotherapy may improve neurological manifestations, and make possible longer survival in angiotropic lymphoma.
8299574	We have studied the distribution of activin receptor gene expression in the brain, pituitary, ovary, and testis of the adult rat by in situ hybridization, using probes complementary to the mRNAs encoding the mouse activin receptor subtypes II and IIB (ActRII and ActRIIB). Throughout the brain, ActRII mRNA expression was stronger than that of ActRIIB, and the patterns of expression were similar, although not identical. The most intense sites of activin receptor gene expression were the hippocampal formation, especially the dentate gyrus (ActRII), taenia tecta, and induseum griseum; the amygdala, particularly the amygdaloid-hippocampal transition zone; and throughout the cortical mantle, including the primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle); other regions of the cortex showing lesser degrees of hybridization included the cingulate cortex, claustrum, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum. In addition, moderate levels of expression were observed in several hypothalamic areas involved in neuroendocrine regulation, such as the suprachiasmatic, supraoptic, paraventricular, and arcuate nuclei. Moreover, activin receptors were also expressed in regions with inputs to the hypothalamus, both in the forebrain (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial preoptic area) and within the brainstem (nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, locus coeruleus, and mesencephalic raphé system). ActRII mRNA was observed in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary and, less prominently, in the anterior lobe, whereas ActRIIB appeared to be weakly expressed throughout all three pituitary divisions. In both male and female gonads, activin receptor message was clearly present in germ cells, and ActRII was the predominant form. In the ovary, in addition to an intense signal in the oocyte, activin receptor was expressed in corpus luteum and granulosa cells during diestrous day 1. In the testis, there was a strong ActRII signal in rounded spermatids, and a moderate signal in pachytene spermatocytes. In contrast, ActRIIB was absent within tubules, but weakly expressed in interstitial and Leydig cells. This is the first report of the distribution of activin receptor message in adult mammalian tissues. Although consistent with some previously suggested functional associations of activin-containing pathways in the brain, this pattern of expression suggests a greater role for activin than was previously appreciated in cortical, limbic, and somatosensory pathways and in the maturation of germ cells in the gonads of both male and female rats.
8301357	NMDA receptors play key roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development, and may be involved in learning, memory, and compensation following injury. A polyclonal antibody that recognizes four of seven splice variants of NMDAR1 was made using a C-terminus peptide (30 amino acid residues). NMDAR1 is the major NMDA receptor subunit, found in most or all NMDA receptor complexes. On immunoblots, this antibody labeled a single major band migrating at M(r) = 120,000. The antibody did not cross-react with extracts from transfected cells expressing other glutamate receptor subunits, nor did it label non-neuronal tissues. Immunostained vibratome sections of rat tissue showed labeling in many neurons in most structures in the brain, as well as in the cervical spinal cord, dorsal root and vestibular ganglia, and in pineal and pituitary glands. Staining was moderate to dense in the olfactory bulb, neocortex, striatum, some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, the colliculi, and many reticular, sensory, and motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. The densest stained cells included the pyramidal and hilar neurons of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, supraoptic and magnocellular paraventricular neurons of the hypothalamus, inferior olive, red nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus, peripheral dorsal cochlear nucleus, and motor nuclei of the lower brainstem and spinal cord. Ultrastructural localization of immunostaining was examined in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar cortex. The major staining was in postsynaptic densities apposed by unstained presynaptic terminals with round or mainly round vesicles, and in associated dendrites. The pattern of staining matched that of previous in situ hybridization but differed somewhat from that of binding studies, implying that multiple types of NMDA receptors exist. Comparison with previous studies of localization of other glutamate receptor types revealed that NMDAR1 may colocalize with these other types in many neurons throughout the nervous system.
8320343	The organization of projections from the anterior thalamic nuclei to the cingulate cortex was analyzed in the rat by the anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. The rostral part of the anteromedial nucleus projects to layers I, V and VI of the anterior cingulate areas 1 and 2, layers I and III of the ventral orbital area, layers I, V and VI of area 29D of the retrosplenial area, and layers I and V of the caudal part of the retrosplenial granular and agranular areas. In contrast, the caudal part of the anteromedial nucleus projects to layer V of the frontal area 2, and layers I and V of the rostral part of the retrosplenial granular and agranular areas. The interanteromedial nucleus projects to layers I, III and V of the frontal area 2, layer V of the agranular insular area, and layers I, V and VI of area 29D. The anteroventral nucleus projects to layers I and IV of the retrosplenial granular area, whereas the anterodorsal nucleus projects to layers I, III and IV of the same area. Projections from the anteroventral and anterodorsal nuclei were, furthermore, organized such that their ventral parts project to the rostral part of the retrosplenial granular area, whereas their dorsal parts project to the more caudal part. The results suggest that the anterior thalamic nuclei project to more widespread areas and laminae of the cingulate cortex than was previously assumed. The projections are organized such that the anteromedial and interanteromedial nuclei project to layer I and the deep layers of the anterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, whereas the anteroventral and anterodorsal nuclei project to the superficial layers of the retrosplenial cortex. These thalamocortical projections may play important roles in behavioral learning such as discriminative avoidance behavior.
8327186	The cDNA encoding calcyphosine, a new calcium-binding protein of the calmodulin superfamily which is regulated by cAMP, has been cloned in the dog thyroid (EMBO J., 8 (1989) 111-116). By in situ hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides, we here demonstrate for the first time its neuronal localization in the rat brain. Hybridization signal was detected in all the olfactory areas; in pyramidal and non pyramidal-shaped neurons in the different layers of the cerebral cortex, especially the superficial ones; in the pyramidal cells of the different sectors of the Ammon's horn and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; in the subiculum; in the medium-sized and large neurons of the different quadrants of the caudate-putamen and accumbens and in the cerebellar Purkinje cells. Hybridization was also observed to a lesser extent in the majority of the neurons in the basal areas of the forebrain, including septum, nucleus of the diagonal band and amygdala; in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta, ventral tegmental area; in the subthalamic nucleus; in the thalamus; in the hypothalamus; in the brainstem and in the upper cervical spinal cord. In addition to its neuronal localization, calcyphosine mRNA was also found in ependymal cells. The non-detection of positive cells in the white matter was not in favor of prominent glial localization, although it does not exclude it.
8331211	The corticostriatal connections of the parietal association cortices were examined by the autoradiographic technique in rhesus monkeys. The results show that the rostral portion of the superior parietal lobule projects predominantly to the dorsal portion of the putamen, whereas the caudal portion of the superior parietal lobule and the cortex of the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus have connections with the caudate nucleus as well as with the dorsal portion of the putamen. The medial parietal convexity cortex projects strongly to the caudate nucleus, and has less extensive projections to the putamen. In contrast, the medial parietal cortex within the caudal portion of the cingulate sulcus projects predominantly to the dorsal portion of the putamen, and has only minor connections with the caudate nucleus. The rostral portion of the inferior parietal lobule projects mainly to the ventral sector of the putamen, and has only minor connections with the caudate nucleus. The middle portion of the inferior parietal lobule has sizable projections to both the putamen and the caudate nucleus. The caudal portion of the inferior parietal lobule as well as the lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus project predominantly to the caudate nucleus, and have relatively minor connections with the putamen. The cortex of the parietal opercular region also shows a specific pattern of corticostriatal projections. Whereas the rostral portion projects exclusively to the ventral sector of the putamen, the caudal portion has connections to the caudate nucleus as well. Thus, it seems that parietostriatal projections show a differential topographic distribution; within both the superior and the inferior parietal region, as one progresses from rostral to caudal, there is a corresponding shift in the predominance of projections from the putamen to the caudate nucleus. In addition, with regard to the projections to the putamen, the superior parietal lobule is related mainly to the dorsal portion, and the inferior parietal lobule to the ventral portion. The striatal projections of the cortex of the caudal portion of the cingulate gyrus (corresponding in part to the supplementary sensory area) and of the rostral parietal opercular region (corresponding in part to the second somatosensory area) are directed almost exclusively to the dorsal and ventral sectors of the putamen, respectively. This pattern resembles that of the primary somatosensory cortex. The results are discussed with regard to the overall architectonic organization of the posterior parietal region. Possible functional aspects of parietostriatal connectivity are considered in the light of physiological and behavioral studies.
8336831	The present study determined the topographical distribution of [125I] nerve growth factor in rat brain at various time points following an intraventricular injection. In addition, we quantified the tissue content of nerve growth factor in various brain tissues following the injection. Autoradiographic analysis of the distribution of [125] nerve growth factor indicated that the neurotrophin is rapidly distributed within the entire ventricular system. However, penetration of nerve growth factor into the brain parenchyma was very limited. At early time points following an injection of nerve growth factor, there was an accumulation of label in the immediate vicinity of the lateral ventricle and third ventricle with predominant labeling around the septum, hypothalamus and cerebellum. By 24 h following nerve growth factor administration, there was discreet labeling of the lateral septum, medial septum, diagonal band, hypothalamus, olfactory tubercle and nucleus of the olfactory tract, and some label was present in the hippocampus and subiculum. Quantitative ELISA of nerve growth factor in brain tissues 1 h following the injection indicated a 446% and 133% increase over basal levels of nerve growth factor in the basal forebrain and hippocampus, respectively. At 24 h nerve growth factor levels measured in brain were not significantly different from endogenous basal levels as determined by ELISA, whereas there were high quantities of 125I present in the thyroid gland, suggesting that the administered [125I] nerve growth factor was rapidly degraded following the intraventricular injection. We observed a similar labeling pattern of the medial septum/diagonal band cholinergic cell body group 24 h following either an intraventricular or intrahippocampal injection of [125I] nerve growth factor. There was a good correlation between the [125I] nerve growth factor labeling pattern and the presence of trkA messenger RNA. This suggested that, at least in the septohippocampal pathway, nerve growth factor accumulated in a region which contained trkA nerve growth factor receptors. Thus, this study shows that after a single unilateral intraventricular injection of nerve growth factor into rat brain there is effective uptake by diagonal band/septal cells on both sides of the brain, and by cells whose positions correlate with the locations of cholinergic and trk A messenger RNA-expressing cells. Significant uptake was also observed in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. The very limited penetration and rapid degradation of intraventricularly administered nerve growth factor suggests that tissue penetration may be a limiting factor when attempting to influence brain neurons by exogenous neurotropic factors.
8337230	Previously it was demonstrated that intravenously administered morphine produced greater analgesic but lower hyperthermic responses to morphine in 24-week-old rats in comparison to 8-week-old rats. The differential pharmacological responses to morphine could not solely be attributed to the pharmacokinetic parameters, namely area under the serum morphine concentration-time curve, serum levels of morphine extrapolated to zero time, half-life, mean residence time, apparent volume of distribution at the steady state, terminal rate constant and total body clearance of morphine in serum. In order to determine whether the differences in pharmacological responses to morphine in rats from two age groups are related to differential distribution of morphine in the central nervous system, in the present study, the time course of the distribution of morphine in brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex, pons and medulla, amygdala, midbrain and corpus striatum), spinal cord and serum following intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg dose to 8- and 24-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats was determined. Morphine injected intravenously produced a greater analgesic but less intense hyperthermic effect in 24-week-old rats in comparison to 8-week-old rats. In most of the brain regions and spinal cord, with few exceptions, the concentration of morphine was found to be greater in 24-week-old rats than in 8-week-old rats. Similarly, the ratio of the concentration of morphine in brain region or spinal cord to serum was significantly higher in rats from the older age group. The studies demonstrate that the altered pharmacological responses to intravenously administered morphine to rats of differing ages may be related to the higher concentration of morphine in the central nervous system of older rats, which in turn may be related to the differences in the blood-brain barrier to morphine in the two age groups.
8340497	The distribution of cells and fibers immunoreactive (ir) for either chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone I (cGnRH I; [Gln8]GnRH) or II ([His5,Trp7,Tyr8]GnRH) was determined in brains of turkey hens to reveal whether these peptides occur in separate neuronal systems. ir-cGnRH I cells were located: along the medial aspect of the ventriculus lateralis, nucleus accumbens, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; ventral to the tractus septomesencephalicus and extending medially to the third ventricle, and caudally into the lateral hypothalamic area; and in a diffuse band extending from the nucleus preopticus medialis to the nucleus dorsomedialis anterior thalami. cGnRH I fibers were evident in these areas in addition to the hippocampus, nucleus subhabenularis medialis, nucleus ventromedialis hypothalami, and median eminence. Two groups of ir-cGnRH II cells were observed: a magnocellular group lying between the substantia grisea centralis and the nucleus ruber; and a parvicellular group lying medial to the nucleus of the basal optic root and extending into the lateral hypothalamic area. ir-cGnRH II fibers were prominent in limbic structures (cortex piriformis, lateral to nucleus taeniae, hippocampus); olfactory areas (tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus subhabenularis lateralis, nucleus septalis lateralis); areas that in other avian species have steroid-concentrating cells or receptors (medial edge of lobus parolfactorius, nucleus septalis medialis, nucleus periventricularis magnocellularis, nucleus dorsomedialis posterior thalami); and areas containing ir-GnRH I cells or fibers but not in median eminence. These results suggest that cGnRH I and II occur in separate neuronal systems and that cGnRH II does not directly promote pituitary gonadotropin secretion.
8341425	The distribution of secretoneurin, a peptide derived from its precursor secretogranin II by proteolytic processing, was studied in the central nervous system of the rat by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay and compared to the distribution of secretogranin II messenger RNA by using in situ hybridization. With a specific antiserum a distinct staining of fibers and to a lesser extent also of perikarya was observed throughout the central nervous system. A high density of immunoreactive fibers and terminals was found in several brain areas, i.e. the lateral septum, the medial parts of the amygdala, some medial thalamic nuclei, the hypothalamus, habenula, nucleus interpeduncularis, locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarii, the substantiae gelatinosae of the caudal trigeminal nucleus and of the spinal cord. The quantitative distribution as measured by a radioimmunoassay agreed well with the varying densities of immunoreactivity found by immunocytochemistry. The highest concentrations of this peptide were present in the hypothalamus, in particular, in the median eminence and are comparable to those of the most highly concentrated neuropeptides. The distribution of immunopositive perikarya corresponded well with that of secretogranin II messenger RNA obtained by in situ hybridization. The pattern of secretoneurin expression in rat brain was widespread and unique, partially overlapping with established chemical transmitters and neuropeptides. The functional significance of this new brain peptide remains to be established.
8357622	This article discusses the gross, functional, and imaging anatomy of the suprasellar cistern and its contents as well as the structures that form its borders, among the most important being the floor of the third ventricle and associated structures. Specific structures discussed include the optic chiasm and optic tracts, the anterior third ventricle, the tuber cinereum, the pituitary stalk (infundibulum), the choroidal fissure, the lamina terminalis, the gyrus rectus, the uncus, and the cerebral peduncles.
8360700	Paramyxoviruses such as measles virus or canine distemper virus are etiological agents for acute and chronic encephalitis (measles inclusion body encephalitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and chronic distemper encephalitis or old dog encephalitis). The mechanisms by which viral injury leads to neurological diseases have not yet been fully elucidated. We have developed an experimental model in mice in order to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of canine distemper virus in the central nervous system. Cerebral target structures for viral replication were examined for the presence of viral material (proteins and mRNA) during the two stages of the biphasic disease. During the acute stage of infection all target areas could be identified by day 6 with a similar anatomical distribution in all the animals examined, which were either intracranially or intracerebroventricularly infected. Viral mRNA and proteins were selectively localized in certain brain structures such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra (pars compacta), locus ceruleus and raphe nuclei (dorsalis and centralis), and limbic system (hippocampus, septum, entorhinal and cingulate cortex, amygdala). The virus was apparently unable to replicate in cerebellum, striatum, a large part of cortex, or endothelial cells. During the subacute disease, viral material was no longer detectable except in a few structures such as hypothalamus up to 4-6 weeks after inoculation. After this time, all target structures were devoid of any labeling in spite of the occurrence of pathology (obesity, paralysis) during this viral quiescent phase. These results suggest that after the initial viral exposure, expression of viral genes in defined structures might disrupt central homeostasis and finally may lead to neurological or neuroendocrine diseases, even in the absence of the hallmarks of the virus.
8381444	Selective 35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes were designed to sequences of the rat alpha-2A (RG20), alpha-2B (RNG), and alpha-2C (RG10) adrenoreceptor mRNAs for use in in situ hybridization experiments on sections of unfixed rat brain, spinal cord and kidney. After hybridized sections were exposed to film or dipped in autoradiographic emulsion, specific and selective labeling patterns characteristic for each probe and region of the central nervous system were observed. Alpha-2A mRNA labeling was most pronounced in neurons in layer six of the cerebral cortex, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus, pontine nuclei, locus coeruleus, vestibular nuclei, trapezoid nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei, nucleus tractus solitarii, ventrolateral medullary reticular formation, and the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord. In some of these locations, the receptor mRNA, in all probability, is present in noradrenaline and perhaps adrenaline neurons. The alpha-2B probe, which primarily labels the kidney, gave only a very light signal in the thalamus in the central nervous system after extended exposure times. Alpha-2C mRNA labeling was primarily observed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, islands of Calleja, striatum, hippocampal formation, cerebellar cortex, and dorsal root ganglia. Labeling patterns disappeared when excess unlabeled probes were added to their respective radiolabeled probes, or when sense probes were employed. When a hybrid antisense probe homologous to all three alpha-2 probes was used, labeling patterns also disappeared. The present study therefore justifies the pharmacological subclassification of alpha-2 receptors by providing anatomical evidence for specific and selective cell groups in the rat central nervous system containing mRNA for three alpha-2 receptor subtypes.
8381910	The cellular distribution of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA within the adult rat central nervous system was evaluated using in situ hybridization. In forebrain, hybridization of a 35S-labeled rat ChAT cRNA densely labeled neurons in the well-characterized basal forebrain cholinergic system including the medial septal nucleus, diagonal bands of Broca, nucleus basalis of Meynert and substantia innominata, as well as in the striatum, ventral pallidum, and olfactory tubercle. A small number of lightly labeled neurons were distributed throughout neocortex, primarily in superficial layers. No cellular labeling was detected in hippocampus. In the diencephalon, dense hybridization labeled neurons in the ventral aspect of the medial habenular nucleus whereas cells in the lateral hypothalamic area and supramammillary region were more lightly labeled. Hybridization was most dense in neurons of the motor and autonomic cranial nerve nuclei including the oculomotor, Edinger-Westphal, and trochlear nuclei of the midbrain, the abducens, superior salivatory, trigeminal, facial and accessory facial nuclei of the pons, and the hypoglossal, vagus, and solitary nuclei and nucleus ambiguous of the medulla. In addition, numerous cells in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, the medial and lateral divisions of the parabrachial nucleus, and the medial and lateral superior olive were labeled. Occasional labeled neurons were distributed in the giantocellular, intermediate, and parvocellular reticular nuclei, and the raphe magnus nucleus. In the medulla, light to moderately densely labeled cells were scattered in the nucleus of Probst's bundle, the medial vestibular nucleus, the lateral reticular nucleus, and the raphe obscurus nucleus. In spinal cord, the cRNA densely labeled motor neurons of the ventral horn, and cells in the intermediolateral column, surrounding the central canal, and in the spinal accessory nucleus. These results are in good agreement with reports of the immunohistochemical localization of ChAT and provide further evidence that cholinergic neurons are present within neocortex but not hippocampus.
8382709	As a result of its interaction with a specific receptor, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) mobilizes intracellular calcium. The metabolism of InsP3 is rather complex: InsP3 3-kinase produces Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4), a putative second messenger also involved in the intraneuronal calcium homeostasis. The distribution of the messenger RNA coding for the recently cloned InsP3 3-kinase was studied in the developing rat brain by using oligonucleotides derived from the rat cDNA sequence and in situ hybridization combined with Northern blot analysis. In addition, the locations of the enzyme were determined by immunohistochemistry in combination with Western blot analysis. By Northern blot and Western blot analyses on rat brain, the kinase was not detected in the embryo, was first found slightly at birth, and reached adult levels around 2-3 postnatal weeks. These findings were confirmed in the different positive regions by in situ hybridization conducted at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, the mRNA was found exclusively in the neuronal populations previously demonstrated in the adult. The levels of transcripts per neuron were however higher in the adult than in the neonate brain. The enzyme mRNA could be detected first at postnatal day 0, (birth, P0) in the perikarya of the cerebellar Purkinje cells, followed at P4 by the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and granule cells of the dentate gyrus and finally, at P9, by a majority of the neurons in the cortical layers II-III and V, especially in the frontal cortex and cingulate cortex; claustrum; caudate, putamen, accumbens, olfactory tubercle and calleja islets; anterior olfactory nucleus; taenia tecta; piriform piriform cortex; dorsolateral septum; bed nucleus stria terminalis; amygdala; hippocampal CA2-4 sectors and subiculum. By immunohistochemistry, the enzyme was initially found in the periphery of the cell bodies of the neonatal neurons; was progressively enriched in the developing dendritic arborization during the first postnatal weeks where it remained exclusively localized in the adult. In conclusion, in the developing brain, InsP3 3-kinase was first detected at birth, and thereafter its concentrations increased to reach adult levels around 2-3 postnatal weeks. At the cellular level, the kinase was exclusively found in the neurons. The small amounts of transcripts found per neuron in the neonate increase during synaptogenesis and the protein became progressively enriched in the developing dendritic arborization, where it is localized in the adult.
8382821	The binding of 3H-D-Pen2-D-Pen5-enkephalin (DPDPE), a highly selective delta-opiate receptor agonist, to membranes of discrete brain regions and spinal cord of 10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was determined. The brain regions examined were amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons and medulla, corpus striatum, midbrain and cortex. 3H-DPDPE bound to membranes of brain regions and spinal cord at a single high affinity site with apparent dissociation constant value of 4 nmol/l, except in cortex where the values were higher. The highest density of 3H-DPDPE binding sites were in hypothalamus and lowest in pons and medulla. The receptor density (Bmax value) and apparent dissociation constant (Kd value) of 3H-DPDPE to bind to delta-opiate receptors on the membranes of hippocampus, hypothalamus, corpus striatum, midbrain, cortex, pons and medulla and spinal cord of WKY and SHR rats did not differ. The Bmax value of 3H-DPDPE in amygdala of SHR rats was higher than in WKY rats, but the Kd values in the two strains did not differ. It is concluded that SHR rats have a higher density of delta-opiate receptors, labeled with 3H-DPDPE, in amygdala in comparison with WKY rats. Whether such a difference in the density of delta-opiate receptors is related to the elevated blood pressure of SHR rats is not clear.
8393486	The significance for CNS function of glutamate-gated cation channels that exhibit high-affinity kainate sites is not understood. Such receptors, which on dorsal root ganglia and in recombinant systems exhibit currents that rapidly desensitize to kainate application, have not been detected electrophysiologically in the brain. However, a comparison of the distribution of mRNAs encoding five glutamate receptor subunits exhibiting high-affinity kainate sites (GluR-5-GluR-7, KA-1, and KA-2) indicates that high-affinity kainate receptors are most likely involved in all central neuronal circuits of the rat brain. The KA-1 mRNA occurs mainly in the CA3 field of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, with much lower amounts being found in inner cortical layers, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and white matter (e.g., corpus callosum and anterior commissure). The KA-2 gene is widely expressed in many neuronal nuclei including layers II-VI of neocortex, hippocampal pyramidal (CA1-CA3) and dentate granule cells, septal nuclei such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic, suprachiasmatic, and ventral medial hypothalamic nuclei, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, and cerebellar granule cells. KA-2 mRNA is also found in the pineal gland. GluR-5 transcripts are in the cingulate and piriform cortex, the subiculum, lateral septal nuclei, anteroventral thalamus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, the tegmental nuclei, pontine nuclei, and Purkinje cells. GluR-6 mRNA is most abundant in cerebellar granule cells, with lower levels in caudate-putamen and the pyramidal cell layers and dentate granule cells of hippocampus. The GluR-7 gene is prominently expressed in the inner neocortical layers and some cells in layer II, subiculum, caudate-putamen, reticular thalamus, ventral medial hypothalamic nucleus, pontine nuclei, and in putative stellate/basket cells in the cerebellum. These findings suggest that a complex mosaic of receptor variants underlies the high-affinity kainate receptor in the vertebrate brain.
8395952	Specific binding sites for GABAA and benzodiazepines were detected in the brain of the frog Rana esculenta after the in vitro incubation of tissue sections with their respective specific agonists [3H] muscimol and [3H] flunitrazepam. Conditions for the binding assay were optimized and as a result binding was saturable and specific. Quantitative autoradiographic receptor measurements in the different brain sections showed that elevated levels of [3H] muscimol binding sites were found in the two layers of the cerebellum (periventricular and external) with the highest binding densities being detected in the periventricular layer. Relatively high densities of [3H] muscimol binding sites were also observed in the torus semicircularis of the mesencephalon and in the thalamic nucleus rotundus and posterolateral nucleus, plus the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the amygdala pars lateralis and the striatum of the telencephalon. Intermediate to low binding levels were obtained in the remaining brain areas such as the external layer of the optic tectum, the dorsomedial and dorsolateral anterior thalamic nuclei, the medial and lateral pallium, the medial septal nucleus, the preoptic nucleus, the dorsal and ventral infundibular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the interpeduncular nucleus. Autoradiographic evaluation of benzodiazepine receptors revealed that binding levels of [3H] flunitrazepam were overall lower than those of the GABAA sites. In fact the highest [3H] flunitrazepam binding levels were observed in the striatum, external layer of the optic tectum and the torus semicircularis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8396014	The expression of oxytocin receptor (OT-R) mRNA in the rat central nervous system was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry using cRNA probe. Wide distribution of cells expressing OT-R mRNA was observed not only in the hypothalamus, but also in other regions. There were high levels of OT-R mRNA in the anterior olfactory nuclei, tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, rostral most region of the frontal cortex, piriform cortex, layers 2 and 3 of the neocortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior medial preoptic nucleus (AV3V region), magnocellular preoptic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, retrochiasmatic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, central amygdaloid nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, posterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, amygdalohippocampal area, subiculum, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus. In most regions of the brain, our findings concurred with those obtained by receptor binding autoradiography using a ligand specific to OT. However, in the inferior olive nucleus, OT-R mRNA was not detected despite an abundance of binding sites showed by receptor binding autography. Despite this discrepancy OT appears to have central nervous system functions in addition to its hormonal functions.
8398387	The distributions of androgen receptor (AR) like protein were studied immunohistochemically in the central nervous system of rat and human medulla and spinal cord. Six male rats, weighing 160-180 g and medulla and spinal cord from three non-neurological human cases were used. The rats were perfused through the heart and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Small blocks of the medulla and spinal cord from the human samples were also fixed with the same manner. Tissue sections of 20 microns were incubated with primary antibody (NH27; anti-human androgen receptor) and processed by the peroxidase-avidin-biotin complex methods. The specificity of this antibody was analyzed by Western blotting. A band of approximately 95 kDa which corresponds to AR and other several bands which may be degradating products were seen. Immunohistochemical examination of the rat brain and spinal cord revealed that positive neurons were localized in the amygdala, hypothalamus, motor nuclei of cranial nerves in brainstem, reticular formation of pons and medulla, Purkinje cells and anterior horn cells. The localizations of the immunoreactivity were chiefly in the cytoplasm as well as the processes. In the non-neurological human tissues, hypoglossal nucleus and anterior horn cells had positive immunoreactivity for AR like protein. They were localized in the cytoplasm and their processes. The abnormality of CAG repeat site of gene which code the androgen receptor has been recognized in X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy-Alter-Sung syndrome; KAS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8408767	Prosaposin is the precursor for saposins A, B, C, and D, which are small lysosomal proteins required for the hydrolysis of sphingolipids by specific lysosomal hydrolases. With a monospecific anti-saposin C antibody, which cross-reacts with prosaposin but not with saposin A, B, or D, the present immunoblot experiments showed that the rat brain expresses an unprocessed approximately 72 kDa protein (possibly prosaposin) and little saposin C. Regional analysis demonstrated that prosaposin is abundant in the brainstem, hypothalamus, cerebellum, striatum, and hippocampus, and less abundant in the cerebral cortex. Consistent with this finding, prosaposin-like immunoreactive neurons and fibers as revealed by immunohistochemistry were observed frequently in subcortical regions. The medial septum, diagonal bands, basal nucleus of Meynert, ventral striatum, medial habenular nucleus, and motor nuclei of cranial nerve had significant numbers of immunoreactive neurons. There were also nerve fibers with prosaposin-like immunoreactivity in several projection fields of the above nuclei. Other brain areas that contained prosaposin-like immunoreactive neurons and/or processes were: several brain nuclei (nucleus caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, red nucleus) constituting the so-called extrapyramidal system, reticular thalamic nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus, mammillary nuclei, auditory relay nuclei, cerebellum, sensory cranial nerve nuclei, and the reticular formation. The distribution pattern of prosaposin is apparently different from that of other neuroactive substances so far examined, and thus prosaposin may be involved in novel central events.
8413855	We have studied the distribution of neurokinin A-like immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the cat brainstem. The densest clusters of perikarya containing the peptide were observed in the periaqueductal gray, inferior colliculus, postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, medial nucleus of the solitary tract and in the lateral reticular nucleus. By contrast, the interpeduncular nucleus, magnocellular part of the red nucleus, central tegmental field, cuneiform nucleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus sagulum and the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei had the lowest density, whereas a moderate density of immunoreactive cell bodies was found in the superior colliculus, medial division of the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, nucleus incertus, locus coeruleus and in the Kölliker-Fuse area. The highest density of immunoreactive fibers was observed in the substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, medial vestibular nucleus, medial nucleus of the solitary tract, laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial division of the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, locus coeruleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus and in the spinal trigeminal tract. A moderate density of immunoreactive fibers was found in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and in the postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe and a low density in the cuneiform nucleus, Kölliker-Fuse area, nucleus sagulum, inferior and superior central nuclei, lateral reticular nucleus and in the lateral and magnocellular tegmental fields.
8426929	To establish a baseline of the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance of the fetal brain in early stages of development, the authors undertook a study of fixed and fresh specimens of embryos and fetuses of 6-28 weeks gestational age. Images of formalin-preserved and fresh specimens were comparable in their depiction of anatomic structures. On MR images of embryos of 6 weeks gestational age, the rhombic and cervical flexures, aqueduct of Sylvius, diencephalon, cerebellum, cerebral hemisphere, and fourth ventricle could be differentiated. The optic recess and chiasm, pituitary gland, pineal recess, third ventricle, pons, olfactory lobe, corpus striatum, insula, and parietal and temporal lobes could be distinguished as early as 11 weeks gestation. Although MR imaging is impractical as a screening tool for intrauterine abnormalities, it can demonstrate the fetus in great detail and allows a more specific evaluation of fetal anatomy. With the information provided by MR imaging, it may be possible to establish guidelines for assessment of the stage of development during intrauterine life.
8427014	Intracranial self-stimulation (ICS) is thought to activate neuronal systems involved in processing natural reinforcing agents. Metabolic mapping studies have previously demonstrated a subset of CNS structures specifically engaged by ICS in animals receiving stimulation actively vs. passively. Since opiates are known to enhance ICS behavior and presumably its reinforcing properties, the current study addressed the question of the role of opioid peptides as mediators of ICS. Rats were trained on a fixed ration (FR) 20 schedule of responding maintained by ICS. Following response stabilization, rats were assigned either to an active or a corresponding yoked stimulation group at 1 of 2 schedules of reinforcement (i.e., FR1-YFR1, FR20-YFR20, or sedentary control), and opioid peptide release was inferred from in vivo receptor occupancy. Autoradiographic analyses identified 3 groups of structures. Treatment-induced alterations in occupancy were seen in the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, basolateral amygdala, ventral pallidum, medial habenula, dorsal raphe, posterior hypothalamus, substantia nigra pars compacta, agranular preinsular cortex, and zona incerta. Depending upon the structure, peptide release was dependent upon stimulus contingency (active vs. yoked) and/or schedule (FR1 vs. FR20). Evidence for ICS-induced inhibition of peptide release was found in the habenula and preinsular cortex. Nine additional structures, all components of, or receiving projections from, the limbic system, revealed complex interactions between ICS treatment and the electrode side. Finally, a widespread ipsilateral increase in receptor binding was seen rostrally from the cingulate, olfactory tubercle, and nucleus accumbens, along the lateral hypothalamus and hippocampus, and extending caudally to the substantia nigra and ventral tegmentum. These later effects appear to be related to stimulation-induced changes in blood flow and subsequent ligant presentation increases. Collectively, these data point towards the ability of rewarding brain stimulation to activate discrete neuronal opioid systems contingent upon specific behavioral as well as stimulus conditions.
8429124	The regional and laminar organization of the projections from the presubiculum and the parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed in the rat with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The projections from the presubiculum were bilateral and confined to layers III and I of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Both the ispi- and the contralateral projections showed similar distributions and were almost of equal density. Projections to layer III of the entorhinal cortex arose predominantly from superficial layers of the presubiculum, whereas the fibers that reach layer I of the entorhinal cortex appear to originate preferentially from the deep layers of the presubiculum. These fibers also appeared to innervate weakly layer II of MEA. The parasubiculum distributed projections not only to MEA but also to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA), innervating layer II selectively. The innervation of LEA was quite dense and extensive. Very weak projections from the parasubiculum to the contralateral entorhinal cortex were observed in this study. The position of the terminal plexus in the entorhinal cortex was determined by the point of origin along both the dorsoventral and transverse or proximodistal axes of the presubiculum and parasubiculum. Projections from the presubiculum and parasubiculum entered the entorhinal cortex at the level of the injection, or slightly ventral to it, and the main terminal field was always present ventrally to the injection site. The dorsoventral axis of origin thus corresponded to a similarly oriented axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The distribution in relation to the origin along the transverse axis was more complex, and differences between the presubiculum and parasubiculum were present. The proximal presubiculum, i.e., the part closest to the subiculum, projected to the most lateral part of MEA and the central part of the presubiculum sent fibers to the most medial part of MEA. The distal part of the presubiculum, i.e., the part that borders the parasubiculum, projected to the central part of MEA. Projections from the portion of the parasubiculum directly adjacent to the presubiculum, the so-called proximal parasubiculum, reached medial parts of MEA, and those originating in the central part distributed preferentially to lateral parts of MEA and adjacent medial parts of LEA. The distal part of the parasubiculum that borders the entorhinal cortex projected mainly to almost the full mediolateral extent of LEA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8435750	The time course and the relation to dose of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) were measured in awake male adult Fischer-344 rats after administration of quipazine, a serotonin 5-HT2-3 receptor agonist. rCMRglc was determined, using the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]deoxyglucose technique, in 92 brain regions at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after quipazine 20 mg/kg i.p. and at 60 min after quipazine 5 mg/kg i.p. Peak metabolic effects were observed 60 min after quipazine 20 mg/kg i.p. when rCMRglc was significantly elevated in 27 (29%) brain regions (mean rise 17%). Quipazine increased rCMRglc in brain regions with high densities of 5-HT3 receptors (area postrema, olfactory tubercle, amygdala), in dopaminergic nuclei (substantia nigra pars compacta and pars reticulata) and terminal fields of their projections (zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus, preoptic magnocellular area, nucleus of facial nerve). The topographic distribution and direction of rCMRglc changes induced by quipazine are different from those produced by the 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane and, consistent with the pharmacological and binding properties of quipazine, suggest a preferential activation of 5-HT3 receptors.
8440303	Autoradiographic and homogenate binding studies using the radioligand, [125I]angiotensin II, identified a heterogeneous distribution of specific binding sites (defined by angiotensin II, 1.0 microM) throughout the human forebrain. Highest AT receptor densities were detected in the paraventricular nucleus, median eminence, substantia nigra, putamen and caudate nucleus (2.4, 1.2, 1.0, 0.30 and 0.24 fmol/mg tissue equivalent, respectively). The AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (1.0 microM) competed for the majority of the specific binding. [125I]Angiotensin II-specific binding (although not consistently above non-specific binding levels) was also detected in various other brain regions (e.g. amygdala, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, inferior colliculus, nucleus accumbens, parietal cortex, periaquaductal grey, superior colliculus, striate cortex, temporal cortex, thalamus). In the presence of losartan (1.0 microM), angiotensin II, saralasin, losartan and PD123177 competed for [125I]angiotensin II binding to membranes prepared from the cerebellum or substantia nigra with a rank order of affinity; angiotensin II = saralasin > PD123177 > losartan. In the presence of PD123177 (1.0 microM), the rank order of affinity of losartan and PD123177 was reversed. These studies indicate the presence of both AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes within various regions of the human forebrain.
8440780	The distribution of proneuropeptide Y-containing perikarya and nerve fibers in the brain of Rana esculenta and Xenopus laevis was determined with antisera directed toward neuropeptide Y and the carboxyl terminal flanking peptide. The distribution of proneuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity was similar in both anurans. In the telencephalon, immunoreactive perikarya were found in the olfactory bulb, all subdivisions of the pallium, the septum, pars lateralis of the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, and the anterior preoptic area. In the diencephalon, labelled perikarya were detected in the ventromedial, ventrolateral and central thalamic nuclei, the magnocellular preoptic nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the posterior tuberculum, and the infundibulum. Amacrine-like cells were stained in the retina. In the pretectal area, posterior thalamic neurons showed intense, Golgi-like immunostaining. In the mesencephalon, immunoreactive cells were found in the reticular nucleus, the anteroventral tegmental nucleus, the optic tectum, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the torus semicircularis. In the rhombencephalon, labelled perikarya were detected in the secondary visceral nucleus, the central gray, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the dorsal column nuclei, and the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed in all areas of the brain that contained labelled perikarya. The densest accumulations were found in the accessory olfactory bulb, pars lateralis of the amygdala, the ventral habenula, the posterior pituitary, the optic tectum, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the saccular nucleus. The distribution of proneuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity in the anuran brain showed many similarities to the distribution described for the amniote brain.
8441710	This study was performed to identify the efferents of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), particularly in regard to nociception. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) was microiontophoresed into the DRN and visualized immunocytochemically; PHA-L-immunoreactive (-IR) fibers and terminals were identified in the forebrain, hypothalamus, midline and intralaminar thalamus, habenula, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, medullary raphe and reticular nuclei, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Dual immunocytochemistry was used to identify corticotropin-releasing factor, neurotensin, and enkephalin neurons in DRN terminal fields, in some cases in close proximity to PHA-L-IR terminals. Terminal fields were identified in regions that influence nociception, and the neuroactive substances identified in these terminal fields may play modulatory roles in nociception.
8468412	Since saxitoxin (STX) binds to voltage-sensitive sodium channels and blocks their function, it has been widely used in the study of these channels. There is, however, limited information on STX binding properties and the neuroanatomical distribution of the Na+ channel as a function of brain region in the rat and in lower vertebrates such as the turtle. In the present study, we used a broad range of 3H-STX concentration (up to 64 nM) to examine saturation profiles and density distribution in both adult rat and turtle brains. We found that (1) STX sites do not vary greatly in affinity (most Kds = 2 to 5 nM) in various regions of the adult rat brain; (2) STX binding distribution was very heterogeneous in the rat with much higher density in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum than in the brainstem and spinal cord; (3) STX sites are mostly localized in layers made mostly of neurons with low density in white matter; and (4) turtle brain STX sites had similar binding properties, but its brain had much fewer STX sites than the rat, especially in the cerebellum and rostral areas such as the cortex. We conclude that (a) adult brain sodium channels have similar STX binding affinity in spite of the existence of multiple sodium channel subtypes; (b) the brainstem is very different from rostral brain areas in channel density; and (c) the turtle brain has a much lower sodium channel density than the rat brain.
8473896	The cellular localization of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) mRNA in juvenile and adult rat forebrain was examined using in situ hybridization with a 35S-labeled cRNA probe. TGF alpha cRNA-labeled neuronal perikarya were distributed across many forebrain regions including the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, ventral pallidum, amygdala, hippocampal stratum granulosum and CA3 stratum pyramidale, and piriform, entorhinal, and retrosplenial cortices. TGF alpha cRNA-hybridizing cells were also localized to several thalamic nuclei and to the suprachiasmatic, dorsomedial, and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. In addition, labeled cells were present in regions of white matter including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, internal and external capsules, optic tract, and lateral olfactory tract. Thus, both neurons and glia appear to synthesize TGF alpha in normal brain. Hybridization densities were greater in neuronal fields at 2 weeks of age compared with the adult, suggesting a role for TGF alpha in the development of several forebrain systems. Our results demonstrating the prominent and wide-spread expression of TGF alpha mRNA in forebrain, combined with the extremely low abundance of epidermal growth factor mRNA in brain, support the argument that TGF alpha is the principal endogenous ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor in normal brain.
8481789	The effects of naltrexone injected intravenously (i.v.) on the pharmacological actions and distribution of i.v. injected morphine in brain regions and spinal cord of male Sprague-Dawley rats were determined. Naltrexone (0.625- and 2.5-mg/kg doses) antagonized the analgesic and hyperthermic effects of morphine (10-mg/kg dose). For distribution studies, naltrexone (0.625- and 2.5-mg/kg doses) was co-administered with morphine via indwelling catheters. Rats were sacrificed at various times after drug injection and the concentration of morphine in brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex, pons and medulla, amygdala, midbrain and corpus striatum), spinal cord and serum was determined by radioimmunoassay. The concentration of morphine in various brain regions was found to be time dependent. Initially, at 5 min, the highest concentration of morphine was found in the hypothalamus and the lowest in the striatum. In cortex and spinal cord, the concentration of morphine was significantly higher in comparison to the other brain regions at 30- and 60-min time points. Co-administration of lower dose of naltrexone (0.625 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the distribution of morphine in brain regions and spinal cord with some exceptions. The higher dose of naltrexone (2.5 mg/kg) increased the concentration of morphine in several brain regions and spinal cord. The ratio of the concentration of morphine in brain region or spinal cord to serum was decreased by naltrexone. It is concluded that naltrexone also alters the distribution of morphine in the central nervous system.
8518201	A medico-legal autopsy case of hydranencephaly in a male infant which was first suspected of maternal infanticide is reported. The infant was 48 cm in height, weighed 2.86 kg and the circumference of the head, the chest and the abdomen was 32.2 cm, 31.0 cm and 30.4 cm, respectively, with no deformities of the head or body. Autopsy examination, however, revealed a severe defect in the central nervous system. The cranial cavity was filled with a cloudy dark red fluid (ca. 310 ml) instead of the cerebral hemispheres. The residual central nervous tissues were mostly subtentorial structures from the midbrain to the spinal cord namely, corpus mamillare, corpora quadrigemina, corpus pineale, crus cerebri, pons, cerebellum, medulla oblongata and spinal cord. The basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus and chiasma opticum could not be found, although atrophic hypophysis, eyeballs and optic nerves were present. The usual distribution of cerebral blood vessels, especially the branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and Willis' ring, was absent despite the presence of the internal and external carotid arteries. Other organs were, in general, congestive. The marked cortical atrophy of the adrenal glands (left 0.5 g, right 0.6 g), especially the zona fasciculata, was characteristic. The hydrostatic lung test gave partially positive results, but this was considered to be due to artificial respiration by an ambulance man because amniotic fluid components were microscopically noted and fully expanded alveoli were not found. In conclusion, the cause of the infant's death was diagnosed as stillbirth due to aspiration of amniotic fluid caused by the severe defect of vegetative hypothalamic function through hydranencephaly.
8527036	For a better understanding of the development of neurotransmitter systems and of their putative functional significance during ontogenesis, the development of the vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MST) systems in the brain of Xenopus laevis was studied by means of immunohistochemical techniques. Weakly immunoreactive fibers were already present at late embryonic stage 38 in the caudoventral part of the telencephalon and in the ventral part of the diencephalon. The earliest immunodetectable AVT and MST immunoreactive cell bodies were found in the developing preoptic area at late embryonic stage 43. At the end of the embryonic period (stage 45), AVT immunoreactive fibers have reached the future medial amygdala, the midbrain tegmentum, the median eminence and the neural lobe of the pituitary. When compared with AVT immunoreactive fibers, the development of MST fibers shows some temporal delay. During the premetamorphosis (stages 45-52), AVT immunoreactive cell bodies appear in the medial part of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the dorsal infundibular region, and the midbrain tegmentum, whereas fibers can now be traced to the nucleus accumbens, the septum and the medial amygdala in the forebrain, to the midbrain tegmentum, the reticular formation, the raphe nuclei, and the solitary tract nucleus in the brainstem, and to the spinal cord. Further maturation of the AVT system during prometamorphosis (stages 53-58) includes the appearance of immunoreactive cell bodies in the lateral part of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the ventral preoptic area, and the dorsal infundibular region. By the end of the metamorphosis (stage 65), the maturation of the AVT/MST systems reaches an almost adult-like pattern. It should be noted that in amphibians, in contrast to mammals, the early appearance of the AVT/MST systems, including their extensive extrahypothalamic component, suggests that the two neuropeptidergic systems may play a significant role during development.
8545052	Recent studies have explored certain changes in neurons containing neuropeptides with aging. However, until now, the degree of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-containing neuronal cell loss in the aged CNS has not yet been established with certainty, and available data are often contradictory. Changes in the VIP-containing neurons with aging were demonstrated by immunocytochemisty. Major loss of VIP-immunoreactive neurons in the aged rat brain were observed in frontal cortex area 3, parietal cortex area 1, hindlimb area, temporal cortex area 1 and 2, monocular part of occipital cortex area 1, occipital cortex area 2, and retrosplenial cortex. Frontal cortex area 1 and 2, parietal cortex area 2, forelimb area, binocular part of the occipital cortex area 1, and the dentate gyrus were moderately decreased. The axis of the VIP neurons in the aged group showed an irregular orientation tendency, especially in layers II and III. These results indicate the involvement of a neuronal system containing VIP in the aging brain, and provide the first morphological evidence for the loss of VIP neurons in the cerebral cortex of the aged rat.
8557849	With the exception of a report by R.B. Veazey, D.G. Amaral, and W.M. Cowan (1982, J. Comp. Neurol. 207:135-156) that examined the projections of the posterior hypothalamic area in the monkey by using the autoradiographic technique, the ascending projections of the posterior nucleus (PH) of the hypothalamus have not been systematically examined in any species. The present report describes the ascending projections of PH in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The major ascending route for PH fibers is the medial forebrain bundle. PH fibers project densely to several subcortical and cortical sites. The subcortical sites are the subthalamus/hypothalamus (zona incerta, the supramammillary nucleus, lateral, perifornical, dorsal, and anterior nuclei/areas), the thalamus (lateroposterior, laterodorsal, parafascicular, reuniens, paraventricular, central medial, paracentral, central lateral and intermediodorsal nuclei), the amygdala (central, lateral, and medial nuclei), the septal area (bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial and lateral septum), and the basal forebrain (horizontal/vertical limbs of diagonal band nuclei and lateral preoptic area). The cortical sites are the perirhinal, insular, frontal (lateral agranular), prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices. The diversity of PH projections to subcortical and cortical "limbic-related" sites and to several structures with direct input to the hippocampus (supramammillary nucleus, reuniens, paraventricular and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, medial and lateral septum, and perirhinal cortex) suggest that the PH may serve a critical role in various components of emotional behavior, including mnemonic processes associated with significant emotional events.
8560783	Two recent studies provided new evidence on the latency of HSV-1 DNA in 15.5% of olfactory bulbs and in 72.5% of trigeminal nerves from human corpses at forensic postmortems (1) and in 35% of 40 autopsied human brains (2). In the latter brains, latent HSV-1 DNA was found in the olfactory bulbs, amygdala, hippocampus, brain stem, and trigeminal ganglia. Although in these studies it is not known by which route HSV-1 entered the olfactory bulbs and brain, experimental studies in mice (3) revealed that injection of HSV-1 into the olfactory bulbs leads to virus migration into the brain amygdala and hippocampus via the olfactory nerve and locus coeruleus. If the olfactory ciliary nerve epithelium is the port of entry of HSV-1 into the olfactory bulbs and brain in humans as well, protection of the nose against HSV-1 infection may be needed to prevent virus latency in neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus (3). Infection of humans by HSV-1 was estimated to increase from 18.2% in the 0-20 year population group to 100% in persons older than 60 years (1), indicating that worldwide human populations at all ages are at risk of brain infection by the olfactory nerve route. In addition, both primary infection and reactivation of latent DNA in the brain may lead to damage of neurons in the brain involved in memory, learning, and behavior, as observed in infected, acyclovir-treated mice (3). The current introduction of a live apathogenic varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine to immunize children against chickenpox (4) may suggest that the time is ripe for immunization of children and adults against HSV-1 infections, especially infections by the olfactory nerve route, to prevent potential brain damage.
8561952	The distribution of neurons expressing preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA in the brain of the salmon was investigated by means of non-radioactive in situ hybridization, and directly compared with the distribution of enkephalin-immunoreactive (ENKir) neurons. This approach, utilized here for the first time in a non-mammalian vertebrate for the identification of neurons containing opioid peptides, permitted a detailed analysis of the distribution of putative enkephalinergic neurons in the salmon brain. Several cell groups containing neurons that express PPE mRNA also contain ENKir neurons. Such cell groups are located in the ventral telencephalic area, the nucleus of the rostral mesencephalic tegmentum and another nucleus immediately dorsal to it, the torus semicircularis, the valvula cerebelli and the corpus cerebelli. These cell groups consistently contain larger numbers of PPE mRNA expressing cells than ENKir ones. Some cell groups express PPE mRNA, but do not contain ENKir neurons. These cell groups are located in the dorsal telencephalic area, the inferior lobes of the hypothalamus, the pretectal area, the magnocellular superficial pretectal nucleus, the optic tectum, the oculomotor nucleus, the trochlear nucleus, the magnocellular vestibular nucleus, the secondary gustatory nucleus, the superior and medial reticular nuclei, the motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Moreover, some cell groups contain ENKir neurons, but no PPE mRNA expressing neurons. These cell groups are located in the ventromedial thalamic nucleus, the lateral tuberal nucleus, the nucleus of the lateral recess and the nucleus of the posterior recess. The majority of these periventricular ENKir neurons were of the cerebrospinal fluid-contacting type. ENKir neurons were also located in the dorsal lateral tegmental nucleus and in area B9. The results also permitted a tentative identification of enkephalinergic neurons afferent to the optic tectum, that have previously not been identified with immunocytochemistry, located in the dorsal telencephalic area, as well as enkephalinergic neurons intrinsic to the tectum that may contribute to the laminar arrangement of ENKir fibers in the optic tectum.
8561967	Cocaine HCl (0, 10, or 50 mg/kg) was injected into adult male ICR mice ip. Thirty minutes later, the brains were removed, and nine regions were isolated: olfactory bulbs, olfactory tubercles, prefrontal cortex, septum, striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and thalamus. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and their major metabolites and the metabolite/neurotransmitter ratios were determined as an indicator of utilization. Serotonergic systems responded most dramatically. 5HIAA/5-HT decreases were seen in all the brain regions, except the septum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulbs. In most instances, the alterations were dose-dependent. The most profound changes were seen in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and thalamus. For noradrenergic systems, significant responses were seen only in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, but then only at the lower dose. The dopaminergic responses were more complex and not always dose-dependent. The DOPAC/DA ratio was decreased only in the amygdala and striatum at the lower dose, and the olfactory tubercles at the higher dose. It was increased in the septum. The HVA/DA ratios were decreased in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, but only at the lower dose (like MHPG/NE). The 3MT/DA ratio was decreased in the thalamus at the lower dose and in the olfactory tubercles at the higher dose, whereas it was increased in the prefrontal cortex at the lower dose. The HVA and DOPAC routes of degradation were both utilized only by the amygdala. Thus, cocaine produced its most comprehensive effects in this nucleus, as well as the greatest absolute percentage changes for all three of the monoamine systems studied.
8568667	1. The role of supra-brainstem structures in the ventilatory response to inhaled CO2 is unknown. The present study uses positron emission tomography (PET), with infusion of H2(15)O, to measure changes in relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in order to identify sites of increased neuronal activation during CO2-stimulated breathing (CO2-SB) in awake man. 2. Five male volunteers were scanned during CO2-SB (mean +/- S.E.M.; end-tidal PCO2, 50.3 +/- 1.7 mmHg; respiratory frequency, 16.4 +/- 2.7 min-1; tidal volume, 1.8 +/- 0.2 l). As control, scans were performed during 'passive' isocapnic (elevated fraction of inspired CO2) positive pressure ventilation (end-tidal PCO2, 38.4 +/- 1.0 mmHg; respiratory frequency, 15.5 +/- 2.2 min-1; tidal volume, 1.6 +/- 0.2 l). With CO2-SB, all subjects reported dyspnoea. 3. The anatomical locations of the increases in relative rCBF (CO2-SB versus control) were obtained using magnetic resonance imaging. 4. Group analysis identified neuronal activation within the upper brainstem, midbrain and hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus and parahippocampus, fusiform gyrus, cingulate area, insula, frontal cortex, temporo-occipital cortex and parietal cortex. No neuronal activation was seen within the primary motor cortex (at sites previously shown to be associated with volitional breathing). 5. These results suggest neuronal activation within the limbic system; this activation may be important in the sensory and/or motor respiratory responses to hypercapnia in awake man.
8576435	In Mongolian gerbils, the content of vasopressin in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, and the hypothalamus is increased after induction of acute cerebral ischemia. We used an iodinated vasopressin analogue and light microscopic autoradiography to study the distribution of vasopressin V1 receptors in the brain of adult male gerbils and to evaluate the effects of a transient bilateral cerebral ischemia (6 minutes) on the density of this receptor population. The animals were killed immediately or 10, 30, or 100 hours after transient bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries. In control animals, specific [125I]-VPA binding sites were present in various structures of the brain (olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, median preoptic area, ventral pallidum, substantia innominata, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamic mammillary nuclei, superior colliculus, subiculum, central gray, nucleus of the solitary tract, hypoglossal nucleus). The strongest labeling was detected in the cerebral cortex, layers 5-6. After 30-100 hours of survival time following ischemia there was a marked decrease in [125I]-VPA binding site density in these cerebral cortex layers. To a lesser degree, a decrease was also detected in the lateral septal nucleus. In contrast, labeling in other noncortical structures remained unchanged. All animals with 100 hours recovery showed a loss of cells in hippocampus (CA1 layer) and striatum. In addition, ischemia induced concomitant and proliferative changes in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes assessed by glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity. These observations indicate a role for vasopressin in the cerebral cortex either on neurons or on glial cells and the modulation of vasopressin receptor expression by transient cerebral ischemia.
8582407	The purpose of our study was to evaluate the regional distribution of the resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) pattern in preterm neonates. Sixty-eight preterm babies with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks and a birth weight of less than 1500 g were enrolled into the study. The CBF was measured by the noninvasive intravenous 133Xenon method at three different times. Depending on the age we classified our measurements into three groups. Group 1: measurement between 2-36 h (n = 46). Group 2: measurement between 36-108 h (n = 39). Group 3: measurement between 108-240 h (n = 41). In all three groups CBF was significantly lower in the occipital region than in the frontal and parietal regions (group 1: frontal region 12.8 +/- 3.5 ml/100 g/min, parietal region 12.8 +/- 3.9 ml/100 mg/min, and occipital region 11.6 +/- 3.18 ml/100 g/min; group 2: frontal region 15.4 +/- 4.2 ml/100 g/min, parietal region 15.3 +/- 4.1 ml/100 g/min, and occipital region 13.4 +/- 3.5 ml/100 g/min; group 3: frontal region 14.6 +/- 3.6 ml/100 g/min, parietal region 14.6 +/- 3.2 ml/100 g/min, and occipital region 12.8 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g/min.). CBF did not differ between the left and the right hemispheres in either of the three measured regions. No gradient was found in infants between 108 h and 240 h of age with periventricular leukomalacia and periventricular haemorrhage. CONCLUSION. In preterm neonates the antero-posterior gradient of CBF is already present. Periventricular leukomalacia as well as periventricular haemorrhage may affect the regional regulation of CBF.
8590825	Postnatal changes in the topography of the multiple corticospinal projections in the macaque monkey were followed using retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers, and related to the monkey's acquisition of manual dexterity; both behavioral and anatomical maturation were completed by about 8 postnatal months. Cortical origins of the corticospinal projections were examined by constructing planar projection maps of the distributions of labeled corticospinal neuron somas; these somas were found only in lamina V. At birth elaborate somatotopically organized corticospinal projections from primary motor cortex (area 4), the mesial supplementary motor area and cingulate areas 23 and 24, area 12, dorsolateral area 6a beta, the dorsolateral and ventral area 6a alpha (area F4), parietal areas 2/5, 7b and the peri-insular cortex (including area SII), were clearly defined, with axons extending to all spinal cord segments. While this pattern of regional projections broadly resembled that of the mature macaque, there were, however, substantial maturational changes during the 8 months after birth. These included (1) a halving of the area of cerebral cortex from which the contralateral corticospinal projection originated and (2) a threefold reduction in the number of labeled corticospinal neurons projecting to all segments of the cord. Collateral elimination rather than neuronal cell death was the likely mechanism for this reduction in the population and areal extent of corticospinal neurons in the maturing macaque. The surviving corticospinal axon terminals also developed substantially during the postnatal period. At birth some terminals had invaded the intermediate zone in each spinal segment, but few had penetrated the dorsal and ventral horns. By 6 postnatal months, however, many corticospinal neurons were retrogradely labeled following the injection of fluorescent labels into each of these spinal zones in cervical and lumbar spinal segments. These data demonstrate a considerable postnatal reduction in corticospinal neurons projecting to the contralateral spinal cord, and imply that many of the axons that are eliminated never synapse on spinal neurons. It is suggested that during the middle fetal period the axons of many of the cortical neurons in lamina V that in the mature monkey will terminate on particular neuron populations in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord, traverse a common pathway down through the internal capsule into the spinal cord, passing close to these successive targets, and possibly forming collaterals at these levels. In the postnatal period each such neuron establishes a stable, effective synaptic input to only one or a few of these subcortical target populations, and the remaining collateral branches regress. The postnatal maturation of corticospinal neurons, examined in this study, is compatible with such a model.
8593578	Brain regions that may be functionally involved in the neuropharmacological actions of mu-opioid agonists have been examined in conscious rats using the quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique. At 0.5 microgram and 1 microgram intracerebroventricularly the highly selective mu-opioid receptor agonist D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5-enkephalin effected statistically significant increases as well as statistically significant decreases in regional glucose utilization: in limbic structures, such as hippocampal formation, medial amygdala and lateral septum, glucose utilization was most prominently increased after D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5-enkephalin; glucose utilization was further increased in the lateral habenular nucleus, the hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus and dorsal raphe; whereas decreases were found in the mamillary body and anterior thalamus. Glucose utilization in structures associated with somatosensory and nociceptive processing was increased in the central gray of the midbrain and decreased in the nucleus gelatinosus. Only increases in glucose utilization were produced by D-Ala2; MePhe4, Gly-ol5-enkephalin in brain regions involved in motor control, including the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, the nucleus ruber and the cerebellum, and brain regions involved in visual processing--the visual cortex and superior colliculus deep layer. It is concluded that this pattern of regional changes underlies the mu-opioid receptor-mediated antinociceptive-, epileptogenic-, memory- and mood-modulating actions of mu-opioid agonists.
8593657	Subsets of neurons ensheathed by perineuronal nets containing chondroitin unsulfated proteoglycan have been immunohistochemically mapped throughout the rat central nervous system from the olfactory bulb to the spinal cord. A variable proportion of neurons were outlined by immunoreactivity for the monoclonal antibody (Mab 1B5), but only after chondroitinase ABC digestion. In forebrain cortical structures the only immunoreactive nets were around interneurons; in contrast, throughout the brainstem and spinal cord a large proportion of projection neurons were surrounded by intense immunoreactivity. Immunoreactivity was ordinarily found in the neuropil between neurons surrounded by an immunopositive net. By contrast, within the pyriform cortex the neuropil of the plexiform layer was intensely immunoreactive even though no perineuronal net could be found. The presence of perineuronal nets could not be correlated with any single class of neurons; however a few functionally related groups (e.g., motor and motor-related structures: motor neurons both in the spinal cord and in the efferent somatic nuclei of the brainstem, deep cerebellar nuclei, vestibular nuclei; red nucleus, reticular formation; central auditory pathway: ventral cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, superior olive, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body) were the main components of the neuronal subpopulation displaying chondroitin unsulfated proteoglycans in the surrounding extracellular matrix. The immunodecorated neurons found in the present study and those shown by different monoclonal antibodies or by lectin cytochemistry, revealed consistent overlapping of their distribution patterns.
8605953	The endogenous neuroinhibitory and neuroprotective excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid has been hypothetically linked to the pathogenesis of epilepsy and several other brain disorders. In the present study, alterations in kynurenic acid levels were examined in the kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Kainate was systemically injected in rats at a dose (10 mg/kg s.c.) which induces a characteristic behavioural syndrome with stereotypies and focal (limbic) and generalized seizures, eventually progressing into severe status epilepticus. Kynurenic acid was determined 3 h after kainate injection in various brain regions (olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, piriform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudate/putamen, thalamus, superior and inferior colliculus, pons and medulla, and cerebellar cortex) and in plasma, using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method. When data were analysed irrespective of individual seizure severity, significant increases in kynurenic acid were determined in all brain regions examined except the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and pons/medulla. The most marked (200-500%) increases above controls were seen in the piriform cortex, amygdala, and cerebellar cortex. Furthermore, a significant kynurenic acid increase of about 200% above control was determined in plasma. When kynurenic acid levels were determined in subgroups of rats with different behavioural alterations in response to kainate, the most marked kynurenic acid increases were seen in subgroups with status epilepticus. Rats which only developed mild (focal) seizures or stereotyped behaviours (wet dog shakes) also exhibited significantly increased kynurenic acid levels, thus indicating that the increase in kynurenic acid in response to kainate was not solely due to sustained convulsive seizure activity. Whereas it was previously proposed that kynurenic acid is involved only in later stages of seizure disorders, the present data demonstrate that marked increases in central and peripheral kynurenic acid levels occur early after the onset of neuroexcitation, at least in the kainate model.
8612327	Transplasma membrane redox plays a significant role in cellular activation and growth. Six isoenzymes could be prepared from purified rat brain synaptic plasma membrane. Polyclonal antibodies have been prepared against six transplasma membrane oxydoreductases (PMO-I to PMO-VI) and the tissue distribution of the various iso-enzymes have been investigated in adult rat brains by means of immunohistochemistry. PMO-I is densely observed in layers I, IV and V of the parietal cortex, in CA1 of the hippocampus (except for the molecular layer), in the caudate putamen, in the dorsal, granular and ventral parts of the auditory nuclei, in some loci of the vestibular nuclei as well as in the deep cerebellar nucleus and in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. PMO-II is mainly located in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and in the deep cerebellar nucleus and in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. PMO-III is abundant in the piriform cortex, in the pyramidal layers of both CA1 and CA2, in the diagonal band of the basal ganglia, in the supraoptic nucleus and in various loci of the magnetocellular paraventricular nucleus of the hippothalamus as well as in the vestibular nuclei from the brain stem. In addition PMO-III is also densely present in motor nuclei (oculomotor, facial, hypoglossal and ambiguus nuclei), in the reticular formation and in the deep cerebellar nucleus as well as in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellar cortex. PMO-IV has a similar location but is less abundant in the vestibular nuclei of the sensory brain stem and in the motor nucleus. PMO-V in contrast is poorly present in most brain areas compared to the other iso-enzymes, apart of the Purkinje layer of the cerebellar cortex. Finally PMO-VI is mainly present in the oriens layer and in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus formation, in the supraoptic and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the hypothalamus, in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, in the ventral auditory nucleus and in the facial nucleus of the brain stem as well as in red nucleus of the reticular formation and in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellar cortex. These data show that the iso-enzymes are located in specific brain nuclei. The significance of the results in respect to the yet very poorly defined function of PMO's is discussed.
8612331	The ontogenesis of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal systems was studied in the brain of the frog, Rana esculenta. Attention was also focussed on the differential distribution of molecular forms of GnRH during development. The first GnRH-immunoreactive neurons appear in the mesencephalon of posterior limb-stage tadpoles. These neurons are shown to contain only chicken [His5,Trp7,Tyr8]GnRH (cGnRH-II). Later in development, mammalian [Tyr5,Leu7,Arg8] GnRH (mGnRH)-like peptide-containing neurons appear simultaneously in the terminal nerve as well as in the anterior preoptic area of the telencephalon. Subsequently, only after metamorphosis, mGnRH-containing neurons appear in the medial septal area of the posterior telencephalon. It is here shown that neurons containing the two forms of GnRH are distributed in distinct brain areas during development and in the adult: mGnRH-immunoreactive neurons in the terminal nerve, olfactory bulb, mediobasal telencephalon, medial septal area, anterior preoptic area, ventrolateral thalamus and infundibulum, whereas cGnRH-II neurons are located in the mesencephalon. We hypothesize that the terminal nerve/forebrain-located GnRH neurons express immunohistochemically late in development and originate extracranially migrating centrally, along the terminal nerve, during development, whereas those located in the mesencephalon express earlier and may have an intracranial site of origin.
8636801	Correlation of myelin-stained or cryotomic sections of human brain with inversion-recovery MR images can display the cerebral commissures as white-matter tracts (in hypersignal on MRI), crossing the mid-line. MRI shows routinely in three orthogonal planes a) the corpus callosum stretched above the supra-tentorial ventricles, it's four portions (rostrum, genu, body and splenium) and connections with the Deep Grey Nuclei b) the fornix, intralimbic commissure joining anteriorly the mammillary bodies (through it's columns) to the alveus posteriorly and inferiorly (via it's two crura), arcing around the thalamus and lying over the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus as shown on the frontal sections c) the anterior commissure, white-matter tract connecting the two temporal lobes. In axial view, the anterior commissure has the shape of bicycle handlebars, coursing posteriorly, inferiorly and laterally behind the head of the caudate nucleus and passes into the lateral nucleus of the globus pallidus into the inferior and middle temporal gyri. Because the anterior commissure is easily recognisable in all planes, it's appears to be a important landmark for identification of the lateral and medial nuclei of the globus pallidus on axial and sagittal planes d) at least, the posterior commissure, anterior margin of the pineal region, closely related to the superior colliculi, acquire a major importance in the AC-PC line delineation becoming a reference landmark for stereotatical procedures.
8637624	The binding of [3H]nisoxetine, a selective inhibitor of the high-affinity noradrenaline uptake sites, was studied on frontal frozen sections of the cat brain. The highest densities in autoradiographic signal were observed in the nucleus locus coeruleus and its ascending pathways, in the area postrema and in the dorsal part of the inferior olive, the pontine nuclei, the raphe nuclei, the colliculi, the periventricular and lateral areas of the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory bulb. A moderately high concentration of binding sites was observed in the hippocampal formation, especially in the molecular layer of Ammon's horn, in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and in the indusium griseum. Binding sites were visualized in all the subdivisions of the neocortex. The highest density of binding was generally detected in the outer edge of the superficial layer I. In some cortical areas, especially in the visual cortex, labeling with a prevalent laminar distribution in the superficial layers I-III and in the deep layers V-VI was clearly observed. Moderate to low densities of binding sites were seen in most other areas of the brain except in the white matter, the caudate nucleus and putamen, which were devoid of labeling. Overall these findings indicate a good correlation between the distribution of [3H]nisoxetine binding sites and the noradrenergic systems. Furthermore, data suggest that in several areas, high-affinity noradrenaline reuptake mechanisms could play an important role in local interactions between the noradrenergic system and the other monoaminergic systems.
8653410	We studied seizures which were induced by a microinjection of kainic acid (KA) into the unilateral olfactory bulb (OB) in the rats. The first epileptiform discharge appeared in the OB, was then propagated to the amygdala and the hippocampus unilaterally, and finally propagated to the unilateral sensori-motor cortex. Consistent graded behavioral changes, almost identical to those of the amygdaloid and hippocampal seizures, occurred during the development of the seizures, and three stages were classified: stage 1 was staring, stage 2 consisted of masticatory movement and stage 3 demonstrated rearing and rearing and falling. Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) measured with the [14C]2-deoxyglucose method revealed a graded propagation of seizure activities at each stage in the unilateral structures. At stage 1, the increased activities propagated from the OB localized in the anterior olfactory nucleus; at stage 2, the endopiriform nucleus, the nucleus accumbens, the entorhinal cortex, the ventral globus pallidus and the globus pallidus were all activated; at stage 3, the thalamic nuclei (mediodorsal, ventrolateral, ventromedial and centromedian nuclei), the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the entopeduncular nucleus and the sensorimotor cortex were also activated. The globus pallidus, which receives afferent fibers from the nucleus accumbens, was the first structure that was activated metabolically among the extralimbic structures. No metabolic activation occurred in the amygdala and the hippocampus in spite of the early propagation of epileptiform discharges to these structures on EEG. These results suggest that OB seizures involve the limbic structures, while the amygdala and the hippocampus have a little contribution to OB seizures. In addition, the nucleus accumbens plays an important role as a functional interface between the limbic and the motor system in OB seizures.
8656296	Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography during eyeblink conditioning in young adults. Subjects were scanned in three experimental conditions: delay conditioning, in which binaural tones preceded air puffs to the right eye by 400 msec; pseudoconditioning, in which presentations of tone and air puff stimuli were not correlated in time; and fixation rest, which served as a baseline control. Compared with fixation, pseudoconditioning produced rCBF increases in frontal and temporal cortex, basal ganglia, left hippocampal formation, and pons. Learning-specific activations were observed in conditioning as compared with pseudoconditioning in bilateral frontal cortex, left thalamus, right medial hippocampal formation, left lingual gyrus, pons, and bilateral cerebellum; decreases in rCBF were observed for bilateral temporal cortex, and in the right hemisphere in putamen, cerebellum, and the lateral aspect of hippocampal formation. Blood flow increased as the level of learning increased in the left hemisphere in caudate, hippocampal formation, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum, and in right temporal cortex and pons. In contrast, activation in left frontal cortex decreased as learning increased. These functional imaging results implicate many of the same structures identified by previous lesion and recording studies of eyeblink conditioning in animals and humans and suggest that the same brain regions in animals and humans mediate multiple forms of associative learning that give meaning to a previously neutral stimulus.
8690857	Hypotension- and hypertension-evoked expression of the protein product, Fos, of the immediate early gene c-fos was assessed throughout the rat brain as an approach for describing the neuronal populations that respond to alterations in arterial blood pressure. Conscious, chronically catheterized rats were treated with the vasoconstricting drug phenylephrine or the vasodilatating drug hydralazine to increase or decrease, respectively, arterial pressure by approx. 40 mm Hg for 90 min. Rats were then anesthetized, fixed by vascular perfusion, and sections representing the entire brain were processed for the immunocytochemical localization of Fos. In control rats treated with isotonic saline, few Fos-positive neurons were observed. In contrast, phenylephrine and hydralazine treatments resulted in different, yet reproducible, patterns of Fos expression in the brain, with hydralazine evoking Fos expression in more brain regions than phenylephrine. Brain regions containing Fos-positive neurons in rats treated with hydralazine included nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, caudal ventrolateral medulla, rostral ventrolateral medulla, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, subfornical organ and the Islands of Calleja. The nucleus tractus solitarius, paraventricular nucleus and the amygdala also contained Fos-positive neurons in phenylephrine-treated rats, although the number of Fos-positive neurons was always less than that noted in the hydralazine-treated rats and the location of Fos-positive neurons within these regions tended to differ between treatments. These results generally fit within an emerging understanding of brain circuitry underlying cardiovascular regulation.
8698885	Cytochrome P450s are enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of numerous endogenous and exogenous molecules. The enzyme cytochrome debrisoquine/sparteine-type monoxygenase is a specific form of cytochrome P450 and is found in the liver and the brain (in the rat the enzyme is known as CYP2D1). CYP2D1 has no established role in the brain; however, it has been shown to share substrate and inhibitor specificities with the dopamine transporter and the enzyme monoamine oxygenase B. Using CYP2D-specific deoxyoligonucleotide probes and a polyclonal antibody to CYP2D1, we have mapped the distribution of CYP2D mRNA and CYP2D1-like immunoreactivity in the rat central nervous system. CYP2D1 immunoreactivity and the CYP2D1 mRNA signal were heterogenously distributed between brain areas. There were moderate to high levels of immunoreactivity and mRNA signal in the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, caudate putamen, supraoptic nucleus, medial habenula, hypothalamus, thalamus, medial mammilliary nucleus and superior colliculus. In the brainstem, strong CYP2D1 immunoreactivity and CYP2D mRNA signal were observed in the substantia nigra compacta, red nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, pontine grey, locus coeruleus, cerebellum, and the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This study indicates that CYP2D1 is widely and constitutively expressed in neuronal and some glial populations in the rat brain. The localization of CYP2D1 in several regions known to harbor catecholamines and serotonin may suggest a role for CYP2D1 in the metabolism of monoamines.
8698899	Of the three major types of opioid receptors ( mu, delta, kappa) in the nervous system, mu-opioid receptor shows the highest affinity for morphine that exerts powerful effects on nociceptive, autonomic, and psychological functions. So far, at least two isoforms of mu-opioid receptors have been cloned from rat brain. The present study attempted to examine immunohistochemically the distribution of mu-opioid receptors in the rat central nervous system with two kinds of antibodies to recently cloned mu-opioid receptors (MOR1 and MOR1B). One antibody recognized a specific site for MOR1, and the other bound to a common site for MOR1 and MOR1B. Intense MOR1-like immunoreactivity (LI) was seen in the 'patch' areas and subcallosal streak in the striatum, medial habenular nucleus, medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, interpeduncular nucleus, median raphe nucleus, parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, ambiguous nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and laminae I and II of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns. Many other regions, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus, also contained many neuronal elements with MOR1-LI. The distribution pattern of the immunoreactivity revealed with the antibody to the common site for MOR1 and MOR1B (MOR1/1B-LI) was almost the same as that of MOR1-LI. Both MOR1-LI and MOR1/1B-LI were primarily located in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns. The presynaptic location of MOR1-LI and MOR1/1B-LI was confirmed by lesion experiments: Enucleation, placing a lesion in the medial habenular nucleus, removal of the nodose ganglion, or dorsal rhizotomy resulted in a clear reduction of the immunoreactivities, respectively, in the nuclei of the accessory optic tract, some subnuclei of the interpeduncular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, or laminae I and II of the spinal dorsal horn. The results indicate that the mu-opioid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord, mainly postsynaptically and occasionally presynaptically. Opioids, including morphine, may inhibit the excitation of neurons via the postsynaptic mu-opioid receptors, and also suppress the release of neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators from axon terminals through the presynaptic mu-opioid receptors.
8698905	Our previous study has indicated that accommodative responses can be evoked with weak currents applied to a circumscribed area of the superior colliculus in the cat. We investigated efferent projections from this area with biocytin in the present study. The accommodation area in the superior colliculus was identified by systematic microstimulation in each of five anesthetized cats. Accommodative responses were detected by an infrared optometer. After mapping the superior colliculus, biocytin was injected through a glass micropipette into the accommodation area, where accommodative responses were elicited with low-intensity microstimulation. In addition, accommodative responses to stimulation of the superior colliculus were compared before and after an injection of muscimol, an agonist of inhibitory neurotransmitter, into the pretectum. Following the injection of biocytin, in the ascending projections, labeled terminals were seen mainly in the caudal portion of the nucleus of the optic tract, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, the posterior pretectal nucleus, the olivary pretectal nucleus, the mesencephalic reticular formation at the level of the oculomotor nucleus, and the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus on the ipsilateral side. Less dense terminals were seen in the anterior pretectal nucleus, the zona incerta, and the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. In the descending projections, labeled terminals were observed mainly in the paramedian pontine reticular formation, the nucleus raphe interpositus, and the dorsomedial portion of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis on the contralateral side. Less dense terminals were also seen in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, the cuneiform nucleus, the medial part of the paralemniscal tegmental field, and the dorsolateral division of the pontine nuclei on the ipsilateral side. Following the injection of muscimol into the pretectum, including the nucleus of the optic tract, the posterior pretectal nucleus, and the nucleus of the posterior commissure, accommodative responses evoked by microstimulation of the superior colliculus were reduced to 33-55% of the value before the injections. These findings suggest that the accommodation area in the superior colliculus projects to the oculomotor nucleus through the ipsilateral pretectal area, especially the nucleus of the optic tract, the nucleus of posterior commissure, and the posterior pretectal nucleus, and also projects to the pupilloconstriction area (the olivary pretectal nucleus), the vergence-related area (the mesencephalic reticular formation), and the active visual fixation-related area (the nucleus raphe interpositus).
8703556	The organization of the striatal afferent fibers from the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation was studied in the monkey with particular emphasis on specific projections of the ventral striatum. Retrograde tracers were injected into the different regions of the ventral (limbic) striatum and dorsolateral (sensorimotor) striatum. Labeled neurons were observed in the various regions of the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation. The medial ventral striatum received dense projections from the amygdala (the basal nucleus and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus), and the hippocampus (subiculum, CA1 and CA3). The shell of the nucleus accumbens (calbindin-D28k negative region) also received dense projections from the amygdala (the basal nucleus and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus), and the hippocampus (subiculum). The injections into the core of the nucleus accumbens showed scattered labeled neurons in the amygdala, and only a few labeled neurons in the hippocampus. The lateral ventral striatum received few inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast to the ventral striatum, the dorsolateral striatum received no projection from the amygdala or the hippocampus. The connectional similarities between the medial ventral striatum and the shell of the nucleus accumbens suggest that although the medial ventral striatum is not calbindin-D28k negative, it may be regarded as a transitional zone between the shell and the rest of the ventral striatum.
8713445	In order to find brain areas involved in the vocal expression of emotion, we compared c-fos expression in three groups of saddle-back tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis). One group, consisting of three animals, was made to utter more than 800 mobbing calls by electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain (PAG). A second group, consisting of two animals, was stimulated in the PAG with the same intensity and for the same duration as the first group but at sites that did not produce vocalization. These sites lay somewhat medial to the vocalization-eliciting sites. A third group, consisting of two animals, was stimulated at vocalization-eliciting sites in the PAG but with an intensity below vocalization threshold. Fos-like immunoreactivity that was found in the vocalizing but not in the non-vocalizing animals was located in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, ventrolateral premotor cortex, sensorimotor face cortex, insula, inferior parietal cortex, superior temporal cortex, claustrum, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex, basal amygdaloid nucleus, anterior and dorsomedial hypothalamus, nucleus reuniens, lateral habenula, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, ventral and dorsolateral midbrain tegmentum, nucleus cuneiformis, sagulum, pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, ventral raphe, periambigual reticular formation and solitary tract nucleus. For some of these structures (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex and periambigual reticular formation), there is evidence also from electrical stimulation, lesioning and single-unit recording studies that they are involved in vocal control. For other structures (e.g. lateral habenula, Edinger-Westphal nucleus), the available evidence speaks against such a role. Fos activation in these cases is probably related to non-vocal reactions accompanying the electrically elicited vocalizations. A third group of structures consists of areas for which a role in vocal control cannot be excluded but for which the present study presents the first evidence for such a role (e.g. claustrum and sagulum). These structures deserve further studies using more specific methods.
8714873	Brains from 32 neonatal autopsies from the Seychelles were examined histologically and analyzed for mercury levels. Six brain regions were sampled: frontal and occipital cortex, temporal cortex with hippocampus, basal ganglia with thalamus, cerebellum, and pons with medulla. Tissue blocks for histology and mercury analysis were taken from opposing faces to provide for correlation of findings. Similar studies were performed on 12 reference neonatal brains from Rochester, New York. No clear-cut developmental abnormality was found, but some brains exhibited low-grade, non-specific destructive changes. Total mercury levels, most of it in the organic form, were elevated in many of the Seychelles specimens. No correlation was demonstrated between mercury levels and degree or type of histologic change. There was considerable variability in total mercury for each anatomic region among the 32 Seychelles cases, as well as from one region to another in individual brains. All values of total mercury were under 300 ppb. Statistical analysis of mean mercury levels for each region demonstrated higher values in deep subcortical nuclei, brain stem, and cerebellum, phylogenetically older parts of the brain. When total mercury concentration of each region was paired with all other areas in the same brain and the paired values plotted for the entire group of brains, high correlations were obtained for all brain pairs, suggesting a strong concentration-dependent relationship between mercury intake and brain content. Analysis of mercury levels in separately dissected blocks of grey and white matter from 12 specimens revealed no significant differences between grey and white. In comparison with other human developmental studies and with experimental developmental studies in animals, where toxicity has been demonstrated with total mercury brain levels above 1,000 ppb, this study found no evidence of toxicity within a range of mercury levels below 300 ppb. Submicroscopic changes, subcellular alterations, subtle disturbances in the unfolding of brain architectonics -- none of these are excluded with methods used in this report. Further studies of threshold effects of MeHg on fetal brain are essential. That approximately half of the mercury resides in glial elements in white matter reinforces the need to focus attention upon glia as well as neurons during development.
8719610	Androgens are involved in a variety of centrally mediated functions after binding to their intracellular receptors. In the present report, we have employed the androgen receptor antibody, PG-21, and indirect immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution of cells containing androgen receptor-like immunoreactivity (AR-IR) in the intact adult male Brazilian opossum brain and pituitary. Additional adult males were castrated to examine the effects of withdrawal of circulating androgens and testosterone replacement on AR-IR. Immunoblots and immunohistochemical controls demonstrated that the androgen receptor in the opossum brain and peripheral tissues are of a similar molecular mass as to has been reported for the rat. Cells containing AR-IR were widely distributed throughout the brain of intact adult males. The highest number of immunoreactive cells were present in the dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral septum, medial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, median preoptic nucleus, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tubercle, central amygdaloid nucleus, anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, posterior amygdaloid nucleus, subiculum, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate-median eminence region, and ventral premammillary nucleus. The anterior pituitary gland also contained a high number of cells containing AR-IR. The general distribution of AR-IR both in the brain and anterior pituitary gland resembled that reported for other mammalian species. Castration of the adult males four days prior to perfusion eliminated androgen receptor immunostaining throughout the brain except for a few lightly immunostained cells in the ventral nucleus of the lateral septum and stria terminalis. Androgen receptor immunostaining was decreased in the anterior pituitary gland following castration and became cytoplasmic. Testosterone administration 2 h before perfusion restored AR-IR both in the brain and anterior pituitary gland. These data suggested that immunohistochemical detection of bound (nuclear) androgen receptors as seen with PG-21 antibody in the brain and anterior pituitary gland of the opossum is dependent upon circulating androgens. Further, the wide distribution and similarity in localization of androgen receptors in the opossum brain and anterior pituitary gland to that of other species suggests that androgen receptors might be involved in similar functions in the opossum as has been reported for other species.
8724648	To investigate the evolution of the neural organization of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), we have examined GnRH-immunoreactivity in two brachiopterygian fishes (Polypterus palmas and Calamoichthys calabaricus). Distal regions of the terminal nerve (TN) within the medial olfactory nerve contained clusters of GnRH-immunoreactive (ir) perikarya (< 10 microns). More proximal, isolated GnRH-ir neurons were present among TN fascicles as they penetrated the ventral forebrain, and a few ir neurons were observed accompanying GnRH-ir fibers in the rostromedial telencephalon. GnRH-ir neurons were not observed in the preoptic area or ventral hypothalamus. In contrast, a small group of GnRH-ir neurons was localized in the periventricular nucleus of the posterior tuberculum. GnRH-ir fibers were present in widespread areas of the brain, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, optic nerve, hypothalamus, thalamus, habenula, optic tectum, tegmentum, pituitary and spinal cord. To further characterize projections of TN neurons, we utilized antiserum to FMRF-amide, a small peptide produced by TN cells in other vertebrates. Perikarya that were FMRF-amide-ir within the TN were similar in distribution to GnRH-TN neurons, and the distribution of FMRF-amide-ir fibers overlapped those of GnRH-ir fibers, thus providing a useful marker for identifying TN projections. An additional population of FMRF-amide-ir neurons was present in the periventricular hypothalamus. Our results suggest that in the polypteriformes, GnRH and FMRF-amide neurons of the TN are similar to those observed in other vertebrates; however, the paucity of GnRH cells in the basal forebrain may be unique to primitive actinopterygians and elasmobranchs, and may result from the lack of migration of GnRH neurons into the forebrain, a phenomenon that likely occurs in all other vertebrate classes. Finally, the identification of GnRH-ir neurons in the posterior tuberculum is consistent with similar, and perhaps homologous, GnRH neurons present in nearly all other vertebrate classes.
8730653	The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there are sex differences in cytosolic androgen receptors (AR) in individual brain nuclei. Bilateral 500 mu diameter samples from 300 mu thick frozen brain sections were micropunched from males and females 2-3 weeks following gonadectomy. Tissue samples were taken from 12 brain nuclei: lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, arcuate nucleus, corticomedial nucleus of the amygdala, lateral preoptic area, parietal cortex, medial nucleus of the amygdala, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and dorsal hippocampus. Cytosolic ARs were found in brain regions involved in the neuromodulation of androgen dependent responses. These data suggest that behavioral differences in male reproductive responses may be the sexually dimorphic distribution of androgen receptor containing neurons.
8738154	Orphan transporter v7-3 is a member of a new subfamily of Na+, Cl- dependent neurotransmitter transporters with two large extracellular loops. Distribution of v7-3 mRNA was investigated in the rat brain. In situ hybridization study revealed that v7-3 mRNA was widely distributed in the rat central nervous system, including the olfactory bulb, the hypothalamus, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. In addition, intense v7-3 mRNA expression was found in the motor nuclei including the oculomotor nucleus, abducens nucleus, trigeminal motor nucleus, facial nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus and ventral horn of spinal cord. Intense hybridization signals were also observed in the nuclei containing monoaminergic neurons, such as locus coeruleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal raphe nucleus and the median raphe nucleus. This multifocal and broad nature of the v7-3 distribution suggests widespread roles for this gene product in neurons mediating several important brain function.
8738262	The distribution of the immediate-early gene and transcription factor protein, c-Fos, was examined in the brains of guinea-pigs following treatment with morphine, naloxone or naltrexone, or the induction of morphine withdrawal by these opioid antagonists. Guinea-pigs were given subcutaneous injections of morphine sulphate or tartrate three times per day in increasing doses for three days (total dose 690 mg/kg as base). Control animals received saline injections. Naloxone hydrochloride (30 mg/kg), naltrexone hydrochloride (15 mg/kg) or saline was administered subcutaneously 1 h after the last dose of morphine or saline, and the animals killed 1.5 h later by perfusion-fixation under deep sodium pentobarbitone anaesthesia. In the animals that were treated with morphine and withdrawn with either naloxone or naltrexone, c-Fos was expressed in neurons in many brain areas, including the frontal and cingulate cortices, olfactory tubercles, ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens, habenular, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, septal and arcuate nuclei, lateral and posterior hypothalamic areas, ventral tegmental area, central grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, raphe magnus, lateral paragigantocellular nucleus and solitary tract nucleus. In contrast, only low levels of c-Fos were found in brains of animals that had been treated for three days with morphine followed by saline, or with saline followed by naltrexone or naloxone. The widespread distribution of c-Fos induced by morphine withdrawal reflects the complexity of the accompanying behavioural and autonomic responses.
8741383	Efferents from the optic tectum to the brain stem in the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were studied with the anterogradely biocytin method. After injection of biocytin into the ipsilateral optic tectum, labeled terminals were seen in the rotund nucleus (Rt), neuropil part of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (GLnv), principal part of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, lateral part of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus, triangular nucleus (T), superficial parvocellular nucleus (SPC), pretectal nucleus, pretectal area (PA), subpretectal nucleus, central gray matter (GC), isthimo optic nucleus (ION), magnocellular and parvocellular parts of the isthimo nuclei (Imc and Ipc), semilunar nucleus (SLu), lateral and medial pontine nuclei and reticular formation (FRM) of the medulla, ipsilaterally. Labeled fibers were seen in the septomesencephalic tract nucleus, FRM, interstitio-paraetecto-subpraetectal nucleus, and the dorsal and ventral tectoreticular tracts (TRd and TRv). In the contralateral brain stem, labeled terminals were seen in the Rt, T. FRM, PA and paramedian nucleus. The contralateral terminals were remarkably fewer than those of the ipsilateral side. The present findings of the labeled terminals of the SPC and the GC at the level of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (MnT), and the topographic projection from optic tectum to the Rt in the thalamus, were original observations in the avian. The labeled terminals in the GLnv, Ipc, Imc and ION showed topographical projections from the optic tectum. Pathways to the contralateral brain stem were via the commissure posterior, ventral supraoptic decussation, and the predorsal bundle. The present results suggest that tectofugal impulses in the quail relate to various functions with special relation to the function of the GC at the level of the MnT as well as a visual function.
8749141	The clinical, oculomotor and ophthalmological features of 27 patients with pendular nystagmus were studied in whom 22 also had MR imaging of the brainstem. The nystagmus was predominately horizontal in 4 patients, torsional in 5, vertical in 3 and mixed in trajectory in 8. Fifteen patients had conjugate nystagmus. Twelve patients had disconjugate nystagmus. Eight patients had INO. In 16 patients visual acuity was 6/12 or worse. Acuity and the presence of INO were unrelated to the conjugacy of the nystagmus. The MRI cuts at the medullary, pontine and midbrain levels were analysed statistically to determine the areas where there was significant (< 0.05%) overlap between areas of abnormal signal in different patients. Significant target areas for lesions causing the nystagmus were: in the pons the medial vestibular nucleus, central tegmental and paramedian tracts; in the medulla the inferior olivary nucleus, reticular formation, dorsal accessory olivary nucleus, central tegmental tracts and olivo-cerebellar fibres; in the midbrain the red nucleus and central tegmental tracts. Horizontal pendular nystagmus was preferentially associated with pontine lesions and torsional nystagmus with medullary lesions. Patients with conjugate nystagmus had a tendency to have bilateral mirror image MRI lesions (p = 0.028). The prevalence of lesions in our patients raises a possibility that more than one neuronal mechanism must be affected to produce pendular nystagmus. The inferior olive may be responsible for the rhythm of ocular oscillation. The disruption of pathways proximal to the oculomotor nuclei may determine the instability in terms of individual eye movement.
8750937	Immunohistochemical detection of Fos, the protein product of the immediate-early gene c-fos, was evaluated as a functional marker of central neurons sensitive to a change of blood pressure/blood volume. Controlled hemorrhage and infusion of the hypotensive agent nitroprusside or hydralazine induced the appearance of Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) in several prominent groups of central neurons: the piriform cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, islands of Calleja, subfornical organ, central nucleus of the amygdala, parabrachial nucleus, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, pontine A5, locus ceruleus, ventrolateral medulla, the nucleus of the solitary tract, area postrema, and intermediolateral cell column in the spinal cord. Elevation of blood pressure by infusion of phenylephrine caused the appearance of Fos-IR in fewer groups of neurons: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema. The differential distribution of Fos neurons in hypotensive versus hypertensive animals underscores the potential application of Fos as a metabolic marker in identifying a network of neurons responding to a specific cardiovascular challenge. Further, simultaneous characterization of the transmitter phenotype of Fos-containing neurons offers an additional advantage of this method over other conventional tract-tracing techniques.
8751838	The neurotoxic action of a synthetic pyrethroid, a deltamethrin formulation (Decis), was studied in adult rats. Adult male albino rats received deltamethrin in formulation at a dose of 7.0 mg/kg body weight/d in corn oil orally for 15 d. Deltamethrin-exposed rats exhibited a decrease in body weight from d 9 onward, which was significantly lowered at d 15 of exposure. Administration of deltamethrin markedly increased the wet weight of the hippocampus and pons medulla region without much affecting the weight of frontal cortex, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. A significant increase in the activity of monoamine oxidase was observed in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and acetylcholinesterase activity was markedly increased in frontal cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and pons medulla. The activity of Na+,K(+)-ATPase showed marked decrease in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum following deltamethrin exposure. The polyamine concentration in brain regions was significantly affected, and all three polyamines showed marked alterations in the cerebellum. Deltamethrin significantly increased the spontaneous locomotor activity and aggressive behavior. Maze learning was markedly decreased. Morphological changes in Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum were observed in deltamethrin-exposed rats. Results suggest significant neurochemical and neuromorphological changes, which may culminate in perturbed synaptic function following deltamethrin exposure in rats.
8761930	The prenatal development of the neurons immunoreactive for high-affinity tropomycin-related kinase (trk) receptor (pan trk which recognizes trkA, trkB, and trkC) and low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) was examined in the human brain from embryonic weeks 10 to 34 of gestation. In the embryonic week 10 specimen in which only brainstem regions were available for evaluation, trk immunoreactivity (trk-ir) was observed in the ventral cochlear, solitary, raphe, spinal trigeminal, and hypoglossal nuclei, as well as the vestibular complex and medullary reticular formation. At this time point of gestation, p75ntr-immunoreactive (p75NTR-ir) staining was observed within these same regions plus the inferior olivary and ambiguus nuclei. At embryonic week 14, trk-ir neurons were seen within the subplate zone of the entorhinal cortex, basal forebrain, caudate nucleus, putamen, external segment of the globus pallidus, specific thalamic nuclei, lateral mammillary nucleus, habenula nucleus, select brainstem nuclei, and the dentate nucleus of cerebellum. At this gestational time point, p75NTR-ir neurons were observed in each of these structures, with the exception of the caudate nucleus, specific thalamic nuclei, lateral mammillary nucleus, and habenula nucleus. Additionally, p75NTR-ir neurons were observed within the corpus callosum. The staining pattern for both trk and p75NTR remained unchanged at embryonic weeks 15 to 16 except for the addition of trk-ir and p75NTR-ir within the cortical subplate zone, hippocampus, and subthalamic nucleus. By embryonic week 18, trk-ir neurons were widely expressed within mostly all thalamic nuclei. In contrast, trk-ir was no longer seen within the hypoglossal, cuneate, and gracile nuclei at this time point. This staining pattern for trk and p75NTR remained virtually unchanged from embryonic weeks 19 to 20 and embryonic weeks 16 to 20, respectively. From embryonic weeks 22 to 34, the distribution of both trk-ir and p75NTR-ir neurons changed gradually. During this period, neurons in most thalamic and some brainstem nuclei became progressively immunonegative for trk, whereas neurons in the neocortical subplate zone, corpus callosum, and hilar region of dentate gyrus gradually lost immunoreactivity for p75NTR. These data demonstrate an important and complex role for both the high-(trk) and low- (p75) affinity neurotrophin receptors during the development of multiple neuronal systems in the human brain.
8764590	In this study, we have investigated the effect of mivazerol, [3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl-1]-2-hydroxy-benzamide hydrochloride, a new alpha2-agonist lacking hypotensive properties and a potential anti-ischemic drug, on the evoked release of norepinephrine, aspartate, and glutamate in tissue preparations from hippocampus, spinal cord T1-T5 section, rostrolateral ventricular medulla, and nucleus tractus solitarii of the brainstem of rat. A simple and efficient in vitro procedure to study pharmacologically the release of norepinephrine and glutamate is described. Tissues were chopped into (0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 mm3) sections and the resulting minces were used for this study. Exposure to KCl (10-75 mM) for 5 min served as a stimulus for the release response. One, S (for aspartate and for glutamate release), or two such stimuli, S1 and S2 (for norepinephrine release) were conducted. The release of norepinephrine (+ 150% above baseline) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by mivazerol in hippocampus (IC50 = 1.5 x 10(-8) M), spinal cord (IC50 = 5 x 10(-8) M), rostrolateral ventricular medulla (IC50 = 10(-7) M), and nucleus tractus solitarii (IC50 = 7.5 X 10(-8) M), and by clonidine in hippocampus IC50 = 5 X 10(-8) M), spinal cord (IC50 = 4.5 x 10(-8) M), rostrolateral ventricular medulla (IC50 = 2.5 x 10( -7) M), and nucleus tractus solitarii (IC50 = 10(-7) M). This effect was counteracted by the selective alpha2-antagonists yohimbine and rauwolscine. A significant glutamate and aspartate release response was also induced by KCl (35 mmol/L) in hippocampus (+250 and + 135%, respectively) and spinal cord (+120 and +55%, respectively), in vitro. However, neither mivazerol nor clonidine, at doses up to 10 microM, had any significant effect on KCI-induced glutamate release in spinal cord, whereas mivazerol blocked completely the release of both amino acids in hippocampus and only the release of aspartate in spinal cord. On the other hand, clonidine (1 microM) was only effective in reducing by 40% the release of aspartate in hippocampus. These data indicate that (1) inhibition of KCl-induced norepinephrine release by mivazerol is mediated by its action on alpha2-adrenergic receptors; (2) at concentrations selective for alpha2-adrenergic receptors, only mivazerol was effective in blocking the KCl-induced glutamate release in hippocampal tissue; and (3) at the same concentrations, both mivazerol and clonidine were unable to inhibit glutamate release in the spinal cord. These data suggest that prevention of hyperadrenergic activity by mivazerol in perioperative patients may be mediated through its effect on the release of norepinephrine and/or the release of glutamate and aspartate in regions of the CNS that are involved in the control of cardiovascular homeostasis.
8766161	The immunohistochemical localization of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like peptide has been investigated in the peripheral terminal nerve, brain and pituitary of the frog, Rana esculenta, during development. Soon after hatching, a rather simple NPY-immunoreactive (-ir) neuronal system is present, with elements located mainly in the diencephalon. When hind limbs appear and develop, the NPY-neuronal system undergoes considerable elaboration and NPY-ir perikarya appear in several regions of the telencephalon (dorsal, medial, and lateral pallium; medial septum; medioventral telencephalon; anterior preoptic area), diencephalon (ventromedial, central and posterior thalamic nuclei; suprachiasmatic nucleus; infundibulum), mesencephalon (anteroventral mesencephalic tegmentum), and rhombencephalon (central grey; area of the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei). The frequency of NPY-ir neurons increases during larval development, and then decreases in the anterior preoptic area during the metamorphic climax. Dense plexuses of NPY-ir fibers are formed in several brain areas. NPY-ir fibers are found in the peripheral terminal nerve, and ir-neurons through its course along the ventromedial surface of the olfactory bulbs. NPY-ir fiber projections to the median eminence and pars intermedia derive mainly from the ventral infundibular group of NPY-ir neurons, with a contribution from the suprachiasmatic group of NPY neurons. NPY and carboxyl terminal flanking peptide of proneuropeptide Y coexist in the same neurons throughout the brain. The ontogenetic pattern of NPY-ir neuronal system in the brain of Rana esculenta is remarkably different than that reported for Xenopus laevis.
8787130	The peptide YY derivatives [Leu31,Pro34]PYY and PYY3-36 are highly selective Y1 and Y2 agonists, devoid of activity on the Y3 receptor subtype [Dumont et al. (1994) Molec. Brain Res., 26:3220-3324]. These selective ligands were iodinated and used to evaluate the respective quantitative autoradiographic distribution of the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes in the rat brain, excluding a potential contamination from Y3 receptor. Specific [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY (Y1), and [125I]PYY3-36 (Y2) binding sites are detected in various brain regions, but each showed a differential distribution profile. Y1/[125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY sites are especially concentrated in superficial layers of the cortex, the olfactory tubercle, islands of Calleja, tenia tecta, molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, several thalamic nuclei, and the posterior part of the medial mammaliary nucleus. These areas generally contained only low densities of Y2/[125I]PYY3-36 binding sites. In contrast, [125I]PYY3-36 binding is most abundant in multiple other regions including the lateral septum, piriform cortex, triangular septal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, oriens layer and stratum radiatum of the dorsal hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the granular cell layer of the cerebellum. Few areas of the rat brain contained significant amounts of both [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY and [125I]PYY3-36 binding sites such as the anterior olfactory nuclei, oriens layer and stratum radiatum of the ventral hippocampus, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, and inferior olive. Taken together, these results and the use of two selective radioligands demonstrate further the discrete, differential distribution of the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes in the rat brain.
8788251	The distribution of the neuromedin K receptor (NK3; NKR) in the central nervous system was investigated in the adult rat by using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. The rabbit anti-NKR antibody was raised against a bacterial fusion protein containing a C-terminal portion of NKR and affinity purified with a Sepharose 4B column conjugated to the fusion protein. Immunoblot analysis was performed to test the reactivity and specificity of the antibody. Crude membrane was prepared from cDNA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing each of the rat NKR, substance P receptor (NK1; SPR), and substance K receptor (NK2; SKR) and from the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Immunoreactive bands were observed specifically in the NKR-CHO cells, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex but not in the SPR- or SKR-CHO cells, nor in the cerebellum. Molecular weights of the immunoreactive bands ranged from 73 to 89 kDa and from 59 to 83 kDa in the NKR-CHO cells and tissues, respectively. The distribution of NKR-like immunoreactivity coincided with that of NKR mRNA. The expression of NKR was indicated on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. NKR was found to be expressed intensely or moderately in neurons in the glomerular and granule cell layers of the main olfactory bulb; glomerular and mitral cell layers of the accessory olfactory bulb; layers IV and V of the cerebral neocortex; medial septal nucleus; nucleus of the diagonal band; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; globus pallidus; ventral pallidum; paraventricular nucleus; supraoptic nucleus; zona incerta; dorsal, lateral, and posterior hypothalamic areas; amygdaloid nuclei; medial habenular nucleus; ventral tegmental area; midbrain periaqueductal gray; interpeduncular nuclei; substantia nigra pars compacta; linear, median, dorsal, and pontine raphe nuclei; posteromedial tegmental nucleus; sphenoid nucleus; nucleus of the solitary tract; intermediate and rostroventrolateral reticular nuclei; and lamina II of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus and spinal dorsal horn. These findings are discussed in relation to the physiological functions associated with neuromedin K.
8788254	Retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing studies were carried out to determine whether the capacity of the nucleus accumbens to influence the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus via ventral striatopallidothalamic connections disproportionately favors the shell over the core subterritory. After injections of Fluoro-Gold into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in sections also processed for calbindin-D 28-kD and neurotensin immunoreactivities to facilitate identification of subterritories in the ventral pallidum. Fluoro-Gold-labeled cells were counted in series of sections cut through the ventral pallidum, rostral globus pallidus, nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, and the sublenticular gray region, including parts of the extended amygdala. Data were expressed as cells/unit area and as percentages of all labeled forebrain cells. Mediodorsal nucleus-projecting rostroventral forebrain neurons were most numerous in the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum and pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle. Few were observed in the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum. In addition, following injections into the ventral pallidum, anterogradely transported biotinylated dextran amine was evaluated in sections processed for calbindin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. Injection into the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum resulted in robust anterograde labeling of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area and weak labeling of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Conversely, after injection into the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum, anterograde labeling was weak in the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area, but robust in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. The results are consistent with a predominant accumbens shell influence on the mediodorsal nucleus and with cortico-ventral striatopallidal-thalamocortical pathways that begin and end in different parts of the frontal lobe.
8799875	Cisplatin is widely used for cancer treatment but has strong side-effects, including nephrotoxicity. Neurotoxicity has been thought to be limited to peripheral damage because the blood-brain barrier is thought to be impervious to hydrophilic substances such as cisplatin. Because anoxic ischaemia has been associated with lesions of the barrier, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry has been used to monitor the accumulation of platinum in the brains of mice treated with cisplatin and exposed to oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Platinum was detected in the cerebral cortex of mice 24 h after the administration of cisplatin (3 mg kg-1) followed by exposure for 60 s to an atmosphere containing 7% oxygen, but not in the cerebral cortex of mice exposed to normal atmospheres. Platinum was also observed in the cerebral cortex after exposure for 120 s to an atmosphere containing 14% oxygen, and platinum levels increased as the concentration of oxygen was reduced. The highest platinum levels were obtained 10 h after administration of cisplatin and exposure for 120 s to an atmosphere containing 7% oxygen. Platinum was still retained in the cerebral cortex one week after administration. In contrast, platinum levels in the blood and kidney decreased with time. Platinum levels were measured in seven regions of the brain: the right and left cerebral cortices, the basal ganglia, the thalamus and hypothalamus, the bulbus olfactorius, the cerebellum, and the mesencephalon. When cisplatin was administered to mice not subjected to hypoxia, platinum was not detected in the right and left cerebral cortices, basal ganglia or the thalamus and hypothalamus, but was detected in the bulbus olfactorius, cerebellum and mesencephalon. When such mice were exposed to low levels of oxygen, however, platinum was detected in the right and left cerebral cortices, the basal ganglia and the thalamus and hypothalamus. Platinum levels in the cerebellum and mesencephalon of mice exposed to low levels of oxygen were higher than those of mice exposed to normal air. In addition, platinum levels in the bulbus olfactorius were significantly higher than those in the other regions, although the platinum content of the bulbus olfactorius was not affected by hypoxia. From these observations, it is concluded that platinum is easily accumulated in the bulbus olfactorius after the administration of cisplatin, and that after exposure to atmospheres containing low levels of oxygen, platinum easily passes through the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in all parts of the brain.
8801249	The distribution of mRNAs for metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR4 and mGluR7, which are highly sensitive for L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4), was examined in the central nervous system of the rat by in situ hybridization. In general, the hybridization signals of mGluR7 mRNA were more widely distributed than those of mGluR4 mRNA, and differential expression of mGluR4 mRNA and mGluR7 mRNA was clearly indicated in some brain regions. Intense or moderate expression of mGluR4 mRNA was detected in the granule cells of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, whereas no significant expression of mGluR7 mRNA was found in these cells. In other neurons or regions where mGluR7 mRNA was intensely or moderately expressed, no significant expression of mGluR4 mRNA was observed. Such were the mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb; anterior olfactory nucleus; neocortical regions; cingulate cortex; retrosplenial cortex; piriform cortex; perirhinal cortex; CA1; CA3; granule cells of the dentate gyrus; superficial layers of the subicular cortex; deep layers of the entorhinal, parasubicular, and presubicular cortices; ventral part of the lateral septal nucleus; septohippocampal nucleus; triangular septal nucleus; nuclei of the diagonal band; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; ventral pallidum; claustrum; amygdaloid nuclei other than the intercalated nuclei; preoptic region; hypothalamic nuclei other than the medial mammillary nucleus; ventral lateral geniculate nucleus; locus coeruleus; Purkinje cells; many nuclei of the lower brainstem other than the superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, interpeduncular nucleus, pontine nuclei, and dorsal cochlear nucleus; and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Both mGluR4 mRNA and mGluR7 mRNA were moderately or intensely expressed in the olfactory tubercle, superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex, CA4, septofimbrial nucleus, intercalated nuclei of the amygdala, medial mammillary nucleus, many thalamic nuclei, and pontine nuclei. Intense expression of both mGluR4 mRNA and mGluR7 mRNA was further detected in the trigeminal ganglion and dorsal root ganglia, whereas no significant expression of them was found in the pterygopalatine ganglion and superior cervical ganglion. The results indicate differential roles of the L-AP4-sensitive metabotropic glutamate receptors in the glutamatergic nervous system.
8804688	The temporal order of the myelination of the nervous pathways in 0-42-day-old Wistar rats was quantitatively analyzed using immunohistochemistry with anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibody. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue according to the standard ABC technique. For the objective evaluation of myelination, we converted the level stained with the immunohistochemical method into continuous numbers of 0-256 giving the intensity of myelination, using an image analyzing system. We analyzed nine nervous pathways: corpus callosum, optic tract, internal capsule, spinal tract of trigeminal nerve, inferior cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, pyramidal tract, medial longitudinal fasciculus, and cuneate fasciculus. The onset of the myelination of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, inferior cerebellar peduncle, medial longitudinal fasciculus and cuneate fasciculus was day 7 (postnatal). That of the corpus callosum, optic tract, internal capsule and cerebellar white matter was day 14, and that of the pyramidal tract was day 21. The time required to reach the level of myelination of day 42 was day 21 for the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, day 28 for the internal capsule, day 35 for the corpus callosum, optic tract, cerebellar white matter and pyramidal tract, and day 42 for the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Our method using immunohistochemistry with anti-MBP antibody provided a highly sensitive and objective criterion for judging precisely the time and the progress of myelination in each nervous pathway and compare one nervous pathway with another.
8807415	Data on the internal organization, and neuronal connections of the human hippocampal formation and related structures of the limbic system are briefly reviewed. In the healthy brain, somatosensory, visual, and auditory input proceeds through neocortical core and belt fields to a variety of association areas, and from here the data is transported via long corticocortical pathways to the extended prefrontal association cortex. Tracts generated from this highest organization level of the brain guide the data via the frontal belt (premotor cortex) to the frontal core (primary motor area). The striatal and cerebellar loops provide the major routes for this data transfer. The main components of the limbic system (the hippocampal formation, the entorhinal region, and the amygdala) maintain a strategic position between the sensory and the motor association areas. Part of the stream of data from the sensory association areas to the prefrontal cortex branches off and eventually converges on the entorhinal region and the amygdala, These connections establish the afferent leg of the limbic loop. In addition, the limbic centers receive substantial input from nuclei processing viscerosensory information. The entorhinal region, the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala are densely interconnected. Important among these connections is the perforant path, which originates in the entorhinal cortex and projects to the hippocampal formation (fascia dentata, Ammon's horn, and subiculum). The subiculum projects to the amygdala, entorhinal region, mamillary nuclei, and anterior and midline thalamic nuclei. The hippocampal formation, the entorhinal region, and the amygdala generate the efferent leg of the limbic loop, which is directed toward the prefrontal cortex. Additional projections reach the key nuclei that control endocrine and autonomic functions. Furthermore, the amygdala exerts influence on all nonthalamic nuclei projecting in a nonspecific manner to the cerebral cortex (ie, the cholinergic magnocellular forebrain nuclei, the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus, the dopaminergic nuclei of the ventral tegmentum, the serotonergic anterior raphe nuclei, and the noradrenergic locus ceruleus). The limbic loop centers thus are in the unique strategic position to perform integration of exteroceptive sensory data of various sources with interoceptive stimuli from autonomic centers. Their efferent projections exert influence on both the prefrontal association cortex and the key centers controlling endocrine and autonomic functions.
8807451	The alpha-herpes virus (pseudorabies, PRV) was used to observe central nervous system (CNS) pathways associated with the vestibulocerebellar system. Retrograde transneuronal migration of alpha-herpes virions from specific lobules of the gerbil and rat vestibulo-cerebellar cortex was detected immunohistochemically. Using a time series analysis, progression of infection along polyneuronal cerebellar afferent pathways was examined. Pressure injections of > 20 nanoliters of a 10(8) plaque forming units (pfu) per ml solution of virus were sufficient to initiate an infectious locus which resulted in labeled neurons in the inferior olivary subnuclei, vestibular nuclei, and their afferent cell groups in a progressive temporal fashion and in growing complexity with increasing incubation time. We show that climbing fibers and some other cerebellar afferent fibers transported the virus retrogradely from the cerebellum within 24 hours. One to three days after cerebellar infection discrete cell groups were labeled and appropriate laterality within crossed projections was preserved. Subsequent nuclei labeled with PRV after infection of the flocculus/paraflocculus, or nodulus/uvula, included the following: vestibular (e.g., z) and inferior olivary nuclei (e.g., dorsal cap), accessory oculomotor (e.g., Darkschewitsch n.) and accessory optic related nuclei, (e.g., the nucleus of the optic tract, and the medial terminal nucleus); noradrenergic, raphe, and reticular cell groups (e.g., locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, raphe pontis, and the lateral reticular tract); other vestibulocerebellum sites, the periaqueductal gray, substantia nigra, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, amygdala, septal nuclei, and the frontal, cingulate, entorhinal, perirhinal, and insular cortices. However, there were differences in the resulting labeling between infection in either region. Double-labeling experiments revealed that vestibular efferent neurons are located adjacent to, but are not included among, flocculus-projecting supragenual neurons. PRV transport from the vestibular labyrinth and cervical muscles also resulted in CNS infections. Virus propagation in situ provides specific connectivity information based on the functional transport across synapses. The findings support and extend anatomical data regarding vestibulo-olivo-cerebellar pathways.
8821741	The nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) is the visuo-motor relay between the retina and preoculomotor structures in the pathway mediating optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). NOT lesions in monkeys produce no OKN toward the lesioned side. Then, efferent fibers from the NOT course through the brainstem and may reach the vestibular nucleus, which is proposed to be the final nucleus to the motor nucleus. In the present study, the tracer was injected through a micropipette in the NOT in four monkeys. Labeled terminals were observed ipsilaterally in the parabigeminal nucleus, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, dorsal and lateral terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system and pretectal nuclei and contralaterally in the NOT and superficial layers of the superior colliculus. Descending fibers from the NOT consisted of two major pathways: (1) fibers descended medially from the injection site through the reticularis pontis oralis to reach the lateral part of the ipsilateral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis; (2) fibers projecting into the dorsal cap of inferior olive, by far the greatest number of labeled fibers, descended ventrally along the lateral border of the reticularis pontis oralis and reached the medial lemniscus where they descended further and branched into the dorsolateral pontine nucleus, the lateral part of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the peduncular pontine nucleus, the lateral pontine nucleus, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the medial vestibular nucleus and finally the dorsal cap of the inferior olive. Consistent with the physiological data, the direct terminals to the medial vestibular nucleus could serve to drive the storage mechanisms and to produce OKN in the monkey.
8821795	Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies generated against the carboxy-terminal region of the mu opioid receptor and the GIRK1 (Kir 3.1) ion channel were used to localize these two proteins in the rat brain. Mu opioid receptor immunoreactivity was detected in brain regions that were previously found to contain mu opioid binding sites using autoradiography. The distribution of GIRK1 immunoreactivity in the brain correlated well with a previous in situ hybridization study. Confocal microscopy of rat brain sections double-labelled with anti-mu opioid receptor and anti-GIRK1 antibodies revealed colocalization of GIRK1 and mu opioid receptor immunoreactivities in somata of subpopulations of neurons in the cerebral cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, peripeduncular nucleus, hippocampal formation, diagonal band, thalamus, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, red nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, reticular nucleus, vestibular nucleus, inferior colliculus and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. These anatomical findings suggest that the mu opioid receptor may couple to GIRK1 in some but not all regions of the rat brain.
8822171	Specific anti-rat 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (serotonin1A) receptor antibodies raised in a rabbit injected with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly selective portion of the third intracellular loop of the receptor protein (El Mestikawy et al. [1990] Neurosci. Lett. 118:189-192) were used for immunohistochemical mapping of serotonin1A receptors in the brain and spinal cord of adult rats. The highest density of immunostaining was found in limbic areas (lateral septum, CA1 area of Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, and frontal and entorhinal cortices), in the anterior raphe nuclei, and in the interpeduncular nucleus, in agreement with previous autoradiographic studies with selective radioligands showing the enrichment of these regions in serotonin1A receptor binding sites. Serotonin1A receptor-like immunoreactivity was also present, but at a moderate level, in the neocortex, in some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, in the nucleus of the solitary tract, in the dorsal tegmentum, in the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, and in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. In contrast, extrapyramidal areas, including the caudate putamen, the globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra as well as the cerebellum, exhibited very low to no immunostaining by antiserotonin1A receptor antibodies. At the cellular level, both the plasma membrane of neuronal perikarya and fine neuronal processes probably corresponding to dendritic fields were found to bind antiserotonin1A receptor antibodies. Regional differences were noted regarding these two types of immunostaining, because only dendrites bound antibodies within the hippocampus and the lateral septum, whereas both dendrites and neuronal cell bodies were immunoreactive in the medial septum, in the diagonal band of Broca, and in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Therefore, differential addressing of serotonin1A receptors could occur from one neuron to another. In general, the distribution and density of serotonin1A receptor-like immunoreactivity in the whole brain and in spinal cord were consistent with the mapping of serotonin1A receptor binding sites and serotonin1A receptor mRNA previously established by immunoautoradiographic and in situ hybridization procedures.
8835780	This study describes the expression of the OR-1 orphan receptor in embryonic, postnatal, and adult brain tissue studied by in situ hybridization. This newly characterized member of the nuclear receptor superfamily functions as a modulator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone signalling by influencing gene activation by these hormones from a distinct promoter region. In the fetal brain OR-1 mRNA was observed from E13-E16 in the developing pons, tegmentum, pontine flexure, medulla, inferior and superior colliculi, cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cortical plate. At E18, OR-1 was expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, ventricular layer of the developing cortex and cortical plate, striatum, and olfactory bulb. In the E21 to early postnatal brain the highest expression of OR-1 mRNA was seen in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, and olfactory bulb. The expression of OR-1 in the cerebellum increased during postnatal development and by d P21 OR-1 mRNA had reached the levels present in the adult in the cerebellar cortex. In the adult brain the highest expression of OR-1 mRNA was observed in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex. We conclude that OR-1 is widely expressed in the fetal brain, whereas in the postnatal and adult brains OR-1 mRNA is more discretely localized, and that the amount of OR-1 mRNA increases in the cerebellum during postnatal development. The results of this study suggest that, in the fetal brain, OR-1 has a spatially widespread role in modulating gene activation by retinoids and thyroid hormone, whereas in the adult brain this modulation occurs only in distinct neuronal populations.
8839352	A novel cDNA clone, CR16, was isolated from a rat hippocampal cDNA library and characterized for responses to corticosteroids and regional expression. The 4-kb RNA was increased 3-fold by treatment of adrenalectomized (ADX) rats with corticosterone (CORT). Overlapping cDNA totaling 4,374 nt were used to define an open reading frame of 1,356 nt beginning 191 nt from the 5'-end and encoding a 45-kD protein containing 32% proline. CR16 has no obvious homologies to GenBank or protein databases. CR16 RNA was detected by in situ hybridization in neuron-rich layers of the hippocampal formation, layers II, III and VI of the cerebral cortex, thalamus, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory bulb, inferior colliculus, pons and inferior olive. The CR16 RNA has low prevalence in the hippocampus and cortex (< 10 pg/micrograms total RNA) and is elevated 3-fold in both structures in a dose-dependent manner by CORT in ADX rats. Treatment of ADX rats with aldosterone (ALDO), CORT, or RU28362 increased CR16 RNA to similar levels in the hippocampus while ALDO had minimal effects on the level of CR16 RNA relative to CORT or RU28362 in the cortex. Neither shaking stress (2 h) nor 2 h CORT significantly elevated CR16 RNA in the hippocampus, suggesting that its response to elevated CORT is not rapid. ADX lowered CR16 RNA levels by 50% relative to intact rats while low-level CORT replacement (> or = 4 ng/ml serum CORT) significantly elevated CR16 RNA 2-fold in ADX rats. These results are consistent with both the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulating the CR16 gene. This gene will be useful in dissecting the role of MR and GR in CNS neurons.
8841910	The distribution of the mRNA for a pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor (PACAP-R) was examined in the rat brain, and also in the hypophysis and pineal gland, by in situ hybridization with a specific 35S-labeled riboprobe which was generated from a rat PACAP-R cDNA clone. In the brain, expression of PACAP-R mRNA was most prominent in the periglomerular and granule cells of the olfactory bulb, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, supraoptic nucleus, and area postrema. The expression was also intense in the piriform, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, pyramidal cells in CA2, non-pyramidal cells in CA1-CA3, neuronal cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, lateral septal nucleus, intercalated amygdaloid nucleus, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, most of the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, many regions of the hypothalamus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nucleus, and lateral reticular nucleus. No significant expression was detected in the mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3, posterior nuclear group of the thalamus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and Purkinje, Golgi, and granule cells in the cerebellar cortex. Moderate-to-weak expression was further observed in many other regions of the brain. In the cerebellar cortex, presumed Bergmann glia cells showed moderate expression. In the hypophysis, the expression was moderate in the anterior lobe, and weak to moderate in the posterior lobe; no significant expression was observed in the intermediate lobe. In the pineal gland, the expression was very weak, if any. Thus, the expression of PACAP-R was detected not only on neuronal cells but also on some particular glial cells. The present study has shown, for the first time, the exact site of PACAP-R expression in the brain and hypophysis. Although the functional significance of PACAP and PACAP-R in the brain still remains to be clarified, the present results are considered to provide some direction for future functional studies.
8841925	The distribution of alpha 2C-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in rat brain and spinal cord was examined immunohistochemically by using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody. The antibody was directed against a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a 70-amino-acid polypeptide portion of the third intracellular loop of the alpha 2C-AR fused to glutathione-S-transferase. Selectivity and subtype specificity of the antibody were demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of [125I]-photoaffinity-labeled alpha 2-AR and by immunohistochemical labeling of COS cells expressing the individual rat alpha 2-AR subtypes. In both cases the antibody recognized only the alpha 2C-AR subtype, and immunoreactivity was eliminated by preadsorption of the antibody with excess antigen. In rat brain, alpha 2C-AR-like immunoreactivity (alpha 2C-AR-LI) was found primarily in neuronal perikarya, with some labeling of proximal dendrites; analysis by confocal microscopy revealed the intracellular localization of some of the immunoreactivity. Areas of dense immunoreactivity include anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, septum, diagonal band, pallidum, preoptic areas, supraoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, amygdala, hippocampus (CA1 and dentate gyrus), substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, raphe (pontine and medullary), motor trigeminal nucleus, facial nucleus, vestibular nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and hypoglossal nucleus. Labeling was found in specific laminae throughout the cortex, and a sparse distribution of very darkly labeled cells was observed in the striatum. At all levels of the spinal cord there were small numbers of large, darkly labeled cells in layer IX and much smaller cells in layer X. In general, the pattern of alpha 2C-LI throughout the neuraxis is consistent with previously published reports of the distribution of receptor mRNA detected by hybridization histochemistry.
8848140	The aim of this study was to determine whether forebrain neurons projecting to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus in rats express glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA as a marker for GABAergic neurons. Forebrain glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing neurons that project to the mediodorsal nucleus were identified using a combination of retrograde tracing with Fluoro-Gold and in situ hybridization for the messenger RNA encoding the 67,000 molecular weight synthetic enzyme for GABA. Glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus were observed in the olfactory tubercle, vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, ventral pallidum, sublenticular substantia innominata, globus pallidus, lateral preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The largest proportions of glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus were observed in the vertical limb of the diagonal band, ventral pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Somewhat fewer glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing, retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the subcommissural ventral pallidum and sublenticular substantia innominata. These data suggest that a GABAergic projection from the basal forebrain to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus can influence the function of this nucleus.
8863132	Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the neuroanatomical distribution of androgen and estrogen receptors in brains of adult male roughskin newts, Taricha granulosa, collected during the breeding season. Immunoreactive cells were found to be widely distributed in specific brain areas of this urodele amphibian. Androgen receptor-immunoreactive (AR-ir) cells were observed in the olfactory bulbs, habenula, pineal body, preoptic area, hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, area acusticolateralis, cerebellum, and motor nuclei of the medulla oblongata. Estrogen receptor-immunoreactive (ER-ir) cells were found in the lateral septum, amygdala pars lateralis, pallium, preoptic area, hypothalamus, and dorsal mesencephalic tegmentum. This immunocytochemical study of the newt brain reveals AR-ir and ER-ir cells in several regions that have not been previously reported to contain androgen and estrogen receptors in non-mammalian vertebrates. Additionally, the distribution of AR-ir and ER-ir cells in the newt brain, in general, is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that the distribution of sex steroid receptor-containing neurons in some brain regions is relatively conserved among vertebrates.
8867040	Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the presence of three opioid receptor types in the CNS and periphery. These receptors are referred to as mu, delta and kappa, and have been implicated in a wide variety of functions. The present study examines the localization of the kappa 1 receptor, a region of the receptor that has little homology with mu and delta receptors. Immunohistochemical studies in Zamboni-fixed rat tissue demonstrate immunoreactive perikarya and/or fibers in such regions as the deep layers of the parietal, temporal and occipital cortex, parasubiculum, central and medial amygdala, bed nucleus stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, hypothalamic nuclei, median eminence, midline thalamic nuclei, zona incerta, central gray, caudal linear and dorsal raphe, substantia nigra, pars reticulata, ventral tegmental area, parabrachial nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglia. Specific kappa 1 receptor-like immunohistochemical staining is also observed in the pituitary, where immunoreactive perikarya and fibers are localized in the neural and intermediate lobes. Transfection and preabsorption controls suggest that the antibody is selective for the cloned kappa 1 receptor, and does not recognize mu or delta. This immunohistochemical localization corresponds well to previously described kappa 1 receptor mRNA and binding distributions and provides new insights into the cellular localization and pre- and postsynaptic organization of the kappa 1 receptor-like proteins in the rat brain and pituitary. The functional implications of these results are discussed in light of the kappa 1 receptors play in hormonal regulation, antinociception and reward.
8873126	Recent studies have explored certain changes with aging of neurons containing neuropeptides. The extent of loss in aged central nervous system (CNS) of neuronal cells containing neuropeptide Y (NPY) has not yet been established with certainty, and available data is often contradictory. Changes of NPY-containing neurons with aging in the cerebral cortex of aged rat were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. A major loss of NPY-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the aged rat brain was observed in the retrosplenial cortex, frontal cortex area 1 and 2, parietal cortex area 1 and 2, occipital cortex area 1 and 2, temporal cortex area 3, cingulate cortex and the hippocampus proper. A loss of NPY-ir neurons was observed mostly in layers V and VI; in addition, the number and length of dendritic branches appeared to be decreased and shortened in the age group. These results indicate the involvement of NPY-ir neurons in the aging process of cerebral cortex, and provide the first morphological evidence for the loss of NPY neurons in the cerebral cortex of aged rats.
8873868	The tachykinin family of neuropeptides, which includes substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B, have three distinct receptors: NK-1, NK-2, and NK-3. With the cloning of the rat NK-3 cDNA, it is now possible to evaluate the distribution of NK-3 mRNA in the rat brain. Female rat brains were sectioned and hybridized with a riboprobe complimentary to NK-3 mRNA. The results of these studies revealed an extensive distribution of NK-3 mRNA throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the brain, spinal cord, and retina. In agreement with previous binding studies, we observed NK-3 mRNA in the cortex, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the medial habenula, the zona incerta, the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmental area, the interpeduncular nucleus, the raphe nuclei, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. In contrast with binding data, only a few NK-3 mRNA cells were detected in the striatum. In addition, the present study detected NK-3 mRNA in the olfactory bulb, the dentate gyrus and subiculum, the medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca, the ventral pallidum, the globus pallidus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the arcuate, the premammillary and mammillary nuclei, the dorsal and lateral regions of the posterior hypothalamus, the central gray, the cerebellum, the parabrachial nuclei, the nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and the retina. The results of these in situ hybridization histochemical studies have provided detailed and novel information about the distribution of NK-3 mRNA and have elucidated the putative sites of neurokinin B action in the rat central nervous system.
8873979	Prostaglandin (PG) E2 acts on the brain stem to modulate breathing activity in the ovine fetus. The source of this PGE2 is unknown and we hypothesized that it is produced locally in the developing brain and functions in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner. The purpose of the present study was to establish whether prostaglandin-H synthase-1 (PGHS-1), a crucial enzyme in de novo prostaglandin synthesis, is present and its gene expressed in the ovine fetal brain. Immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques were used to identify sites of PGHS-1 immunoreactivity and PGHS-1 mRNA expression respectively in the brain of the ovine fetus in late gestation (approximately 126 days gestation, term 145 days). PGHS-1 immunoreactivity was localized to specific regions of the fetal brain, including the cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampal formation, superior colliculus of the midbrain, parabrachial nucleus of the pons, and the reticular formation, raphe, nucleus of the solitary tract, and gracile and cuneate nuclei of the medulla. The relative abundance of PGHS-1 mRNA in selected brain regions, as determined by Northern blot analysis, correlated qualitatively with the number of PGHS-1 immunoreactive neurons identified in each region. In situ hybridization demonstrated PGHS-1 mRNA to be localized in the same neurons or nuclei as PGHS-1 immunoreactivity. These results indicate that PGHS-1 synthesized de novo in many brain regions including two that are important in respiratory control: the pneumotaxic center (parabrachial nucleus) and the dorsal respiratory group (nucleus tractus solitarius) suggesting that prostaglandins that modulate fetal respiratory activity are synthesized endogenously.
8874754	This study demonstrates that many neurons in the somatosensory cortex, cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex and hippocampal subiculum of the mouse brain are covered by sulfated proteoglycans which are intensely negative-charged and stained with cationic iron colloid, while being digested with hyaluronidase. Neurons with similar perineuronal proteoglycans are also recognized in the extrapyramidal system (superior colliculus, red nucleus, reticular formation, vestibular nuclei and cerebellar nuclei), in the secondary auditory system (cochlear nuclei, nucleus of trapezoid body, inferior colliculus and nucleus of lateral lemniscus), in the vestibulo-ocular reflex system (vestibular nuclei and extraocular motor nuclei), and in the pupillary reflex system. The neurons with perineuronal sulfated proteoglycans in the cerebral cortices and hippocampal subiculum are usually labeled with the lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin, though those in the cerebellar, vestibular and cochlear nuclei may not be reactive to this lectin. Double staining of the retrosplenial cortex, hippocampal subiculum and cerebellar nuclei with Golgi's silver nitrate and cationic iron colloid indicates that the perineuronal sulfated proteoglycans are identical with the Golgi's reticular coating or glial nets.
8874894	Developmental aspects of the distribution of FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) immunoreactivity (ir) were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence in the brain, pituitary and terminal nerve of the frog, Rana esculenta. Soon after hatching. FMRFamide neurons were found in the proximal terminal nerve, mediobasal olfactory bulb, caudal dorsolateral pallium, diagonal band of Broca, anterior preoptic area, suprachiasmatic area, thalamus, infundibulum, and developing pituitary. FMRFamide fibers were present in the olfactory epithelium, terminal nerve, olfactory bulbs, dorsal and midventral telencephalon, epiphysis, mediolateral thalamus, pretectal gray, optic tectum, infundibulum, posterior interpeduncular nucleus-tegmentum area, and rostral rhombencephalon. During successive developmental stages, ir neurons were no longer observed in the dorsal telencephalon and pituitary. In late larval stages, ir neurons appeared in the medial septal area, and ir fibers in the cerebellum and torus semicircularis. At the same time, the frequency of ir neurons increased progressively in the anterior preoptic area, suprachiasmatic area and infundibulum. FMRFamide-ir neurons were never revealed in mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Numerous ir fibers terminated in the median eminence and intermediate lobe of the pituitary. The adult pattern of distribution of FMRFamide-ir elements in the brain was achieved during the postmetamorphic development. In light of the existing literature, the possible placodal origin of forebrain-located FMRFamide neurons is briefly discussed.
8876464	Receptors for the neuropeptide, neurotensin, were localized by immunohistochemistry in the rat brain by using an antibody raised against a sequence of the third intracellular loop of the cloned high affinity receptor. Selective receptor immunostaining was observed throughout the brain and brainstem. This immunostaining was totally prevented by preadsorbing the antibody with the immunogenic peptide. The regional distribution of the immunoreactivity conformed for the most part to that of [3H]- or [125I]-neurotensin binding sites previously identified by autoradiography. Thus, the highest levels of immunostaining were observed in the islands of Calleja, diagonal band of Broca, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, pre- and parasubiculum, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, pontine nuclei and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, all of which had previously been documented to contain high densities of neurotensin binding sites. There were, however, a number of regions reportedly endowed with neurotensin binding sites, including the central amygdaloid nucleus, periaqueductal gray, outer layer of the superior colliculus and dorsal tegmental nucleus, which showed no or divergent patterns of immunostaining, suggesting that they might be expressing a molecularly distinct form of the receptor. At the cellular level, neurotensin receptor immunoreactivity was predominantly associated with perikarya and dendrites in some regions (e.g., in the basal forebrain, ventral midbrain, pons and rostral medulla) and with axons and axon terminals in others (e.g., in the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, neostriatum, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and nucleus of the solitary tract). These data indicate that neurotensin may act both post- and presynaptically in the central nervous system and confirm that some of its effects are exerted on projection neurons. There were also areas, such as the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and para- and periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which contained both immunoreactive perikarya/dendrites and axon terminals, consistent with either a joint association of the receptor with afferent and efferent elements or its presence on interneurons. Taken together, these results also suggest that the neurotensin high affinity receptor protein is associated with a neuronal population that is more extensive than originally surmised from in situ hybridization studies.
8877816	The ventrolateral hypothalamus (VLH) in female guinea pigs includes a subset of neurons which contain estrogen and progestin receptors, and which are implicated in the regulation of female sexual behavior by steroid hormones. However, little is known about where these neurons project, and consequently which other brain areas are involved in sexual behavior in female guinea pigs. The anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-Leucoagglutinin was used to label efferents from the ovarian steroid receptor-containing part of the VLH. To identify the correct placement of the tracer specifically within the group of neurons containing estrogen receptors, medial hypothalamic sections were also immunostained for estrogen receptors. Forebrain areas receiving dense projections from the ventrolateral hypothalamus included the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamic area, anterior ventromedial hypothalamus, and caudal ventrolateral hypothalamus. The midbrain central gray was also heavily labeled. Moderate innervation was observed in the forebrain in the basolateral amygdala, medial preoptic nucleus, lateroanterior hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal hypothalamic areas, posterior hypothalamus, zona incerta, and in the midbrain interspersed among the central and lateral tegmental tracts. The major efferent pathways from the VLH appeared to travel rostrally through the mediobasal hypothalamus and preoptic area, and caudally via the medial thalamic nuclei and periventricular fiber system. These findings are similar to those of previous studies tracing the efferents from the ventromedial nucleus in rats and from the lateral hypothalamus in guinea pigs. Many of these areas that receive input from the steroid receptor rich area within the VLH are likely to be involved in the regulation of female sexual behavior.
8881471	The distribution of serotonin (5-HT)-containing perikarya, fibers and terminals in the brain of the pigeon (Columba livia) was investigated, using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods combined with retrograde axonal transport. Twenty-one different groups of 5-HT immunoreactive (IR) cells were identified, 2 of which were localized at the hypothalamic level (periventricular organ, infundibular recess) and 19 at the tegmental-mesencephalic and rhombencephalic levels. Ten of the cell groups were situated within the region of the midline from the isthmic to the posterior rhombencephalic level and constituted the raphe system (nucleus annularis, decussatio brachium conjunctivum, area ventralis, external border of the nucleus interpeduncularis, zona peri-nervus oculomotorius, zona perifasciculus longitudinalis medialis, zona inter-flm, nucleus linearis caudalis, nucleus raphe superior pars ventralis, nucleus raphe inferior). The 9 other cell populations belonged to the lateral group and extended from the posterior mesencephalic tegmentum to the caudal rhombencephalon [formatio reticularis mesencephali, nucleus ventrolateralis tegmenti, ectopic area (Ec) of the nucleus isthmo-opticus (NIO), nucleus subceruleus, nucleus ceruleus, nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis, nucleus vestibularis medialis, nucleus reticularis parvocellularis and nucleus reticularis magnocellularis]. Combining the retrograde axonal transport of rhodamine beta-isothiocyanate (RITC) after intraocular injection and immunohistofluorescence (fluoresceine isothiocyanate: FITC/5-HT) showed the centrifugal neurons (NIO, Ec) to be immunonegative. Serotonin-IR fibers and terminals were found to be very broadly distributed within the brain and were particularly prominent in several structures of the telencephalon (archistriatum pars dorsalis, nucleus taeniae, area parahippocampalis, septum), diencephalon (nuclei preopticus medianus, magnocellularis, nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars ventralis, nucleus triangularis, nucleus pretectalis), mesencephalon-rhombencephalon (superficial layers of the optic tectum, nucleus ectomamillaris, nucleus isthmo-opticus and in most of the cranial nerve nuclei). Comparing the present results with those of previous studies in birds suggests some major serotonin-containing pathways in the avian brain and clarifies the possible origin of the serotonin innervation of some parts of the brain. Moreover, comparing our results in birds with those obtained in other vertebrate species shows that the organization of the serotoninergic system in many regions of the avian brain is much like that found in reptiles and mammals.
8882592	1. The present study investigated the effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the indirect 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonist, dexfenfluramine, on the transcriptional activity of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its type 1 receptor in the brains of conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats via in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) using both intronic and exonic probe technology. 2. The immediate early gene (IEG) c-fos mRNA was also used as index of cellular activity, whereas localization between CRF-immunoreactive (ir) perikarya and the IEG was accomplished to determine the site of CRF neuronal activation in the brain of dexfenfluramine-treated rats. 3. Thirty minutes, 1, 3, and 6 h after a single injection of either dexfenfluramine (10 mg kg-1) or the vehicle solution, adult male rats (230-260 g) were deeply anaesthetized and rapidly perfused with a 4% paraformaldehyde-borax solution (PF). The brains were removed from the skull, postfixed, and placed in a solution of 4% PF-10% sucrose overnight at 4 degrees C. Frozen brains were mounted on a microtome and cut from the olfactory bulb to the medulla in 30-microns coronal sections. 4. Dexfenfluramine induced a general neuronal activation as indicated by the strong signal of c-fos mRNA in several structures of the brain, including the parietal cortex, caudate putamen, circumventricular organs, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, choroid plexus, choroidal fissure, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, locus coeruleus, and several subdivisions of the dorsal vagal complex. In most of these structures, the signal was maximal at 30 min, still strong and positive at 60 min, largely decreased at 3 h, and had completely disappeared 6 h after injection. 5. In the parvocellular division of the PVN, the large majority of CRF-ir perikarya displayed a positive signal for the mRNA encoding c-fos, indicating a profound CRFergic activation within this neuroendocrine nucleus after dexfenfluramine administration. 6. Colocalization between CRF-ir neurones and c-fos positive cells was not detected in any other regions. This selective activation of PVN CRF neurones was also confirmed by the presence of CRF primary transcript; 30 min after i.p. injection of the indirect 5-HT agonist, a positive signal for CRF hnRNA was observed, specifically in the parvocellular PVN. 7. Transcription of the gene encoding the type 1 receptor for CRF was highly stimulated in the PVN following 5-HT activation. Although this hypothalamic nucleus exhibited a barely detectable signal under basal conditions, dexfenfluramine induced a strong signal of CRF1 receptor mRNA in the parvocellular PVN. Interestingly, CRF-ir neurones displayed a positive signal for the mRNA encoding the CRF1 receptor, 3 and 6 h after systemic treatment with dexfenfluramine. 8. These results indicate that although dexfenfluramine can generate a wide neuronal activation throughout the brain, this 5-HT agonist triggers the activity of CRF neurones selectively in the parvocellular division of the PVN, a mechanism possibly related to the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Induction of CRF1 receptor mRNA in CRF cells of the PVN indicates that neuroendocrine CRF neurones can be targeted by CNS CRF under 5-HT stimulation.
8883958	Insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) is a member of the insulin receptor family. However, its endogenous ligand and physiological roles are unknown. To elucidate the physiological roles of IRR, an orphan receptor, in the brain, we examined its expression at mRNA and protein levels in the brain by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The expression of IRR mRNA in the brain was highly restricted to the forebrain including the nucleus of the diagonal band, medial septal nucleus, ventral pallidum, accumbens nucleus and caudate putamen, and the brainstem including the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, medial vestibular nucleus, gigantocell reticular nucleus, paragigantocellular nucleus and ventral cochlear nucleus. Most IRR mRNA-positive cells in the forebrain but not in the brainstem were cholinergic neurons. However, most IRR mRNA in the forebrain and brainstem was coexpressed with that of trkA, a high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor. IRR-immunoreactive cell bodies were also detected in the forebrain and brainstem. The pattern of IRR immunoreactivity was similar to that of IRR mRNA. Its restricted pattern indicates that IRR plays unique roles in the brain, in contrast to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors, other members of the insulin receptor family, which are widely expressed in the brain.
8897442	The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of somatostatin receptors sst1-5 was studied in human brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry using specific oligonucleotide probes. sst1 receptor mRNA was mainly found in the outer and intermediate layers of cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation (CA1, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex), hypothalamus, substantia nigra, medullary nuclei and dentate nucleus. sst2 transcripts were present in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampal formation (CA1, dentate gyrus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex), the granular layer of the cerebellum and pituitary. sst3 receptor mRNA was localized in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation (CA1, dentate gyrus), several medullary nuclei and the granule and possibly Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and at very low levels in the pituitary. sst4 receptor mRNA was absent in the cerebral cortex. Intermediate signals were observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and several medullary nuclei while an intense expression was found in the granule and Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum. sst5 transcripts were present in the pituitary and the granule layer of the cerebellum. The present results show that mRNAs of sst1-4 somatostatin receptors have distinct distribution patterns within the human brain, although there is overlap in several regions. sst5 receptor mRNA expression appears to be very low and restricted to the cerebellum and pituitary. The distribution pattern observed in the human brain was broadly similar to that reported previously in the rat brain. The high expression levels of at least two somatostatin receptor subtype mRNAs (sst2 and sst5) in the pituitary gland suggest that somatostatin may affect neuroendocrine functions via more than one receptor.
8898725	The present study investigated the effect of central administration of the prostaglandin of E2 type (PGE2) on the distribution of the immediate early gene (IEG) c-fos mRNA and the transcriptional activity of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its type 1 receptor in the brain of conscious rats. Adult male rats were sacrificed 30 min and 2 h after a single infusion of PGE2 into the right lateral ventricle (2 micrograms/10 microliters) and their brains cut from the olfactory bulb to the end of the medulla in 30 micrometer coronal sections. mRNAs encoding the IEG c-fos and CRF1 receptor were assayed by in situ hybridization histochemistry using 35S-labeled exonic riboprobes whereas the primary transcript (heteronuclear (hn)RNA) for CRF was detected using intronic probe technology as an index of CRF transcriptional activity. Colocalization of c-fos mRNA within CRF, vasopressin (AVP), and oxytocin (OT) neurons was determined by means of a combination of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques on the same brain sections. Thirty min after PGE2 injection, a moderate to strong positive signal for c-fos mRNA was detected in multiple structures of the brain such as the medial preoptic area/organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, supraoptic nucleus (SON), parvocellular and magnocellular divisions of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, area postrema, dorsal division of the ambiguus nucleus, and throughout the choroid plexus and leptomeninges. A smaller but significant c-fos expression was observed in various structures including the subfornical organ, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, arcuate nucleus, and periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Two h after treatment with the PG, the signal for c-fos mRNA in most of these brain nuclei vanished. In the parvocellular nucleus of the PVN, c-fos was expressed in CRF-immunoreactive (ir) and OT-ir neurons, whereas in the magnocellular part of that nucleus and in the SON, this transcript was essentially colocalized in OT-ir neurons. Activation of CRF neuroendocrine cells was also associated with an increase in CRF transcription as revealed by the selective presence of CRF primary transcript (hnRNA), which was stimulated only in the PVN but not in any other nuclei in the brains of PGE2-treated rats. Central administration of PGE2 also induced expression of the CRF type 1 receptor in the parvocellular PVN. Taken together, these results provide clear anatomical evidence that central PGE2 injection causes specific and selective expression of c-fos in several brain structures recognized to be activated in the brains of endotoxin-challenged rats. It is therefore possible that PG of E2 type plays a crucial role within the CNS in the interface between the immune and nervous systems to modulate neuroendocrine responses, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
8910735	Previous observations indicate that the basal forebrain receives dopaminergic input from the ventral midbrain. The present study aimed at determining the topographic organization of these projections in the rat, and whether this input directly terminates on cholinergic neurons. Injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into discrete parts of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) labeled axons and terminals in distinct parts of the basal forebrain, including medial and lateral septum, diagnoal band nuclei, ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, and internal capsule, where PHA-L-labeled terminals abutted cholinergic (choline acetyltransferase = ChAT-containing) profiles. Three-dimensional (3-D) computerized reconstruction of immunostained sections clearly revealed distinct, albeit overlapping, subpopulations of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons apposed by PHA-L-labeled input from medial VTA (mainly in vertical and horizontal diagonal band nuclei), lateral VTA and medial SNC (ventral pallidum and anterior half of substantia innominata), and lateral SNC (caudal half of the substantia innominata and globus pallidus). At the ultrastructural level, about 40% of the selected PHA-L-labeled presynaptic terminals in the ventral pallidum and substantia innominata were found to establish synaptic specializations with ChAT-containing profiles, most of which on the cell body and proximal dendritic shafts. Convergent synaptic input of unlabeled terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with the ChAT-immunoreactive profiles were often found in close proximity to the PHA-L-labeled terminals. These observations show that the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are targets of presumably dopaminergic SNC/VTA neurons, and suggest a direct modulatory role of dopamine in acetylcholine release in the cerebral cortical mantle.
8910738	No previous report in any species has systematically examined the descending projections of the posterior nucleus of the hypothalamus (PH). The present report describes the descending projections of the PH in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. PH fibers mainly descend to the brainstem through two routes: dorsally, within the central tegmental tract, and ventromedially, within the mammillo-tegmental tract and its caudal extension, ventral reticulo-tegmental tracts. PH fibers were found to distribute densely to several nuclei of the brainstem. They are (from rostral to caudal) 1) lateral/ ventrolateral regions of the diencephalo-mesopontine periaqueductal gray (PAG); 2) the peripeduncular nucleus; 3) discrete nuclei of pontomesencephalic central gray (dorsal raphe nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and Barrington's nucleus); 4) the longitudinal extent of the central core of the mesencephalic through meduallary reticular formation (RF); 5) the ventromedial medulla (nucleus gigantocellularis pars alpha, nucleus raphe magnus, and nucleus raphe pallidus); 6) the ventrolateral medulla (nucleus reticularis parvocellularis and the rostral ventrolateral medullary region); and 7) the inferior olivary nucleus. PH fibers originating from the caudal PH distribute much more heavily than those from the rostral PH to the lower brainstem. The PH has been linked to the control of several important functions, including respiration, cardiovascular activity, locomotion, antinociception, and arousal/wakefulness. It is likely that descending PH projections, particularly those to the PAG, the pontomesencephalic RF, Barrington's nucleus, and parts of the ventromedial and ventrolateral medulla, serve a role in a PH modulation of complex behaviors involving integration of respiratory, visceromotor, and somatomotor activity.
8912906	Layer II neurons of the entorhinal cortex project to the dentate gyrus and field CA3 and also send collaterals to the subiculum; layer III neurons project to the subiculum and field CA1, but not to the dentate gyrus; and layer IV neurons project to the perirhinal cortex. We have previously shown that these specific differences between the projections of the layer II and III neurons are maintained and can regenerate in organotypic slice culture. In the present experiments we have confronted Postnatal Day 7 (P7) rat entorhinal cortex with P7 tissue selected from restricted parts of the overall entorhinal projection field. (1) When entorhinal slices were co-cultured with target slices containing only dentate gyrus, extracellular uptake of biotin dextran from crystals placed on the dentate gyrus retrogradely labeled neurons in layer II, and those of layer III were not labeled. (2) When entorhinal slices were co-cultured with target slices that contained only the subiculum and the hippocampal field CA1 (but not dentate gyrus), neurons in both layers II and III of the entorhinal area were labeled. (3) When entorhinal slices were co-cultured with target slices containing the perirhinal area and no hippocampal or dentate tissue, the neurons of entorhinal layer IV were labeled, but (4) when co-cultured with control target slices taken from the rostral parietal neocortex, no entorhinal neurons were labeled. Thus the exclusive relationship of layer II entorhinal neurons to the dentate gyrus has already been established by 1 week of age and is maintained by the regenerating entorhinal axons. Layer III entorhinal neurons cannot be induced to project to the dentate gyrus even when deprived of their own target, and layer IV neurons are specified to project to the perirhinal area and will not project to any part of the hippocampal complex or to the rostral parietal cortex. Thus, deprivation of the normal target tissue and presentation of an incorrect target tissue (even when it is the correct target for one of the other classes of entorhinal neurons) are not sufficient to override the specificity of the entorhinal projection neurons.
8915825	Neurotensin is widely located in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems among mammalian species. To obtain a comparative evaluation, we examined the distribution of neurotensin-containing cell bodies and fibers in the central nervous system of the pigeon and the chicken. The pattern of localization of neurotensin immunoreactivity was similar in the two species. Abundant accumulations of neurotensin-containing cell bodies were found in the dorsolateral corticoid area, the piriform cortex, the parahippocampal area, the medial part of the frontal neostriatum, the lateral part of the caudal neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventral paleostriatum, the preoptic area, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the inferior hypothalamic nucleus, the infundibular hypothalamic nucleus, and the mammillary nuclei. Extremely dense networks of neurotensin-containing fibers were found in the pallial commissure, the lateral septal nucleus, the preoptic area, the periventricular gray around the third ventricle, the dorsalis hypothalamic area, the hypothalamic nuclei, the parabrachial nucleus, the locus ceruleus, and the dorsal vagal complex. Major differences of immunoreactivity between the two species were as follows. 1) The chicken neurohypophysis contained an extremely large accumulation of immunoreactive fibers, but there were few in the median eminence. The reverse was found in the pigeon. 2) The optic tectum in the pigeon contained immunoreactive cells and fibers in layers 2 and 4, but no immunoreactivity was seen in the chicken optic tectum. 3) The cerebellar cortex in the pigeon contained a small number of immunoreactive fibers, whereas that in the chicken did not. 4) The pigeon spinal cord contained immunoreactive neurons in the subependymal layer, but the chicken spinal cord did not. Our observations suggest the presence of a very wide network of neurotensin-containing neurons in the avian brain and spinal cord, which is also the case in mammals.
8915840	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was the second member of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family to be isolated. The ability of BDNF to be retrogradely transported following intraparenchymal infusion represents a unique neurobiological tool to determine the location of putative neuron-specific BDNF-responsive neuronal systems. In the present study, we infused recombinant human (rh) BDNF into the rodent neo- and limbic cortex and used a turkey anti-BDNF antibody to determine specific populations of neurons which retrogradely transport this neurotrophin. Frontal cortex infusion retrogradely labeled neurons within the ipsilateral and contralateral frontal cortex, basal forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, centrolateral, mediodorsal, ventrolateral, ventromedial, ventral posterior, rhomboid, reuniens, and medial geniculate thalamic nuclei, and locus coeruleus. Occipital cortex infusion retrogradely labeled neurons in the frontal, temporal, occipital, and perirhinal cortices as well as the claustrum, basal forebrain, thalamus, epithalamus, hypothalamus, and raphe nuclei. Dorsal hippocampal infusion retrogradely labeled neurons within the septal diagonal band, supramammillary nucleus, and entorhinal cortex and was also transported within various hippocampal subfields. Entorhinal cortex infusion retrogradely labeled neurons within the perirhinal cortex, endopiriform nucleus, piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, presubiculum, parasubiculum, CA1-CA4 fields, amygdaloid nuclei, basal forebrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus. Amygdala infusion labeled neurons in the endopiriform nucleus, temporal cortex, piriform cortex, paralimbic cortex, hippocampus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, basal forebrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, pars compacta, raphe, and pontine parabrachial nuclei. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that virtually all areas which retrogradely transport BDNF also express its message. Neuroanatomical distributional studies of BDNF will unravel specific central nervous system neurotrophic-responsive systems.
8922332	Corticostriatal and corticothalamic projections arising from the second somatosensory area in the rat were studied after labeling small pools of neurons in laminae V and VI with biocytin. Tracing the axon of single neurons revealed the following principles of organization: (i) all corticostriatal and corticothalamic projections arising from layer V cells are collaterals of long-range corticofugal axons that also project below the thalamic level; (ii) all layer V cells that project to the thalamus also project to the striatum; (iii) all layer VI corticothalamic cells project exclusively to the thalamus; (iv) cells of the upper part of lamina VI send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus and arborize in the ventrobasal complex forming rod-like terminal fields; and (v) cells of the lower part of lamina VI also send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus, give off few branches in the ventrobasal complex and terminate principally in the caudal part of the posterior thalamic group. On the basis of these findings, and in the light of previous anatomical studies, it is proposed that the above mentioned organizing principles represent general rules that also apply to corticostriatal and corticothalamic pathways arising from other areas of the neocortex.
8925273	The sensory-motor portion of the inferior collicular cortex is capable of seizure genesis that is characterized initially by coincident wild running behaviors and localized electrographic afterdischarge. With repeated stimulations, this seizure activity spreads into the forebrain, producing generalized tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizure activity. In order to characterize the neural network subserving this caudal-rostral seizure generalization, three mapping techniques were used: 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) utilization, c-fos expression and local anesthetic microinjection. Kindled seizure generalization from the inferior collicular cortex produced a global increase in 2-DG accumulation, while relative 2-DG increases were found in the inferior collicular cortex, dorsal lateral lemniscus, dorsal central gray, peripeduncular nucleus, medial geniculate nucleus, substantia nigra, entopeduncular nucleus, ventroposterior and centromedian thalamus and tenia tectum, as well as the perirhinal, somatosensory and frontal cortices. Kindled seizure generalization also increased c-fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the inferior collicular cortex, cuneiform nucleus, dorsal lateral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, peripeduncular nucleus, caudal central gray, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, rhinal fissure area of the perirhinal cortex and the frontal cortex. Microinjections of procaine into the amygdala, perirhinal cortex, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, peripeduncular nucleus, dorsal central gray, and pontine reticular nucleus all prevented generalized seizure behaviors, but had no effect on the wild running seizures. Conversely, procaine microinjection into the area of the cuneiform nucleus/pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus prevented the wild running seizure but did not block the generalized seizure activity. Neither wild running, nor generalized seizures were altered following procaine microinjections into the anterior thalamus, sub-thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampus or deep superior colliculus. Thus, specific forebrain sites form a widespread neural network that mediates the generalization of seizure activity from the inferior collicular cortex into the forebrain.
8930792	Iron is essential for a variety of intracellular functions. Accordingly, the transfer of iron from blood to brain is vital for normal brain function. In the CNS, the receptor for iron-transferrin is generally accepted to be located in endothelial cells, whereas its occurrence in other cell types is less well established. I have investigated the distribution of the transferrin receptor in the adult mouse central nervous system by immunohistochemistry by using a monoclonal antibody raised against the transferrin receptor protein. Immunoreactive cell types comprised brain capillary endothelial cells, excluding those of circumventricular organs, and choroid plexus epithelial cells. Moreover, transferrin receptor immunoreactivity was detected intraneuronally in several brain regions without access to peripheral blood. The immunoreactive cell bodies were mainly confined to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, habenular nucleus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, pontine nuclei, reticular formation, several cranial nerve nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei, and cerebellar cortex. Transferrin receptor immunoreactivity was not detected in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglial cells. The occurrence of transferrin receptors at brain-barrier sites, i.e., the brain endothelium and choroid plexus epithelium, and the presence of the receptors intraneuronally are in accordance with the generally held belief that iron is released from liver transferrin and transported through capillaries and the choroid plexus into the brain interstitium. Subsequently, iron may be linked to brain transferrin synthesized within oligodendrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells followed by a concomitant uptake of iron-transferrin in neurons expressing transferrin receptors. The clinical importance of the intraneuronal transferrin receptor expression is discussed.
8947922	Immunoreactivity corresponding to the C-terminus of the rat mu opiate receptor can be detected by light microscopy in fiber- and terminal-like patterns in a number of rat brain and spinal cord regions, and in immunoreactive perikarya in several of these regions. Especially abundant fiber- and terminal-like patterns were localized to superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn and nucleus caudalis of the spinal tract of the trigeminal, the nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus ambiguous, locus coeruleus, interpeduncular nucleus, medial aspect of the lateral habenular nucleus, presumed "striasomes" of the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens. Moderate fiber and terminal densities were found in the ventral tegmental area, more medial aspects of the thalamus and hypothalamus, and several amygdaloid nuclei. Immunostained perikarya were prominent in the nucleus accumbens and also observed in the middle layers of the cerebral cortex, septum and diagonal band, preoptic area, medial thalamic and habenular nuclei, locus coeruleus, nucleus ambiguous, nucleus of the solitary tract, trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and spinal cord substantia gelatinosa zones. Many of these localizations correspond well with the previously-determined autoradiographic distributions of mu opiate receptor ligand binding, and with reports of mu opiate receptor immunoreactivity determined using other antisera. Electron microscopic immunohistochemical studies reveal details of the membrane distribution of the mu receptor in nucleus accumbens, caudate/putamen, locus coeruleus, and spinal cord. These results suggest largely neuronal and largely extrasynaptic distributions of mu receptors that show differential patterns of perikaryal, dendritic, and/or axonal immunostaining in different central nervous system zones. Identification of these distributions adds substantially to data identifying the cellular localization of the principal opiate receptor involved in both analgesic and addictive processes.
8951870	To localize glycinergic cell bodies and fibers in the rat brain, we developed a sensitive immunohistochemical method combining the use of specific glycine antibodies (Campistron G. et al. (1986) Brain Res. 376, 400-405; Wenthold R. J. et al. (1987) Neuroscience 22, 897-912) with the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase technique and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine.4HCl-nickel intensification. We confirmed the presence of numerous glycine-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the cochlear nuclei, superior olivary complex, nucleus of the trapezoid body, cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and area postrema. For the first time in rats, we described a large to very large number of cell bodies in the medial vestibular ventral part, prepositus hypoglossal, gracile, raphe magnus and sensory trigeminal nuclei. A large number of cells was also observed in the oral and caudal pontine, parvocellular, parvocellular pars alpha, gigantocellular and gigantocellular pars alpha reticular nuclei. In addition, glycine-immunoreactive cells were seen in the ambiguous and subtrigeminal nuclei, the lateral habenula and the subfornical organ. We also provide the first evidence in rats for a very large number of fibers in the trigeminal, facial, ambiguous and hypoglossal motor nuclei, all nuclei of the medullary and pontine reticular formation, and the raphe and trigeminal sensory nuclei. We further revealed the presence of a substantial number of fibers in regions where glycine was not considered as a main inhibitory neurotransmitter, such as the pontine nuclei, the periaqueductal gray, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the zona incerta, the fields of Forel, the parvocellular parts of the paraventricular nucleus, the posterior hypothalamic areas, the anterior hypothalamic area, and the lateral and medial preoptic areas. These results indicate that, in contrast to previous statements, glycine may be an essential inhibitory neurotransmitter not only in the lower brainstem and spinal cord, but also in the upper brainstem and the forebrain.
8951879	In situ hybridization histochemistry with somatostatin sst1-sst5 receptor messenger RNA-selective oligoprobes and quantitative receptor autoradiographic binding studies using [125I]Tyr3-octreotide, [Leu2,D-Trp22,125I-Tyr25]somatostatin-28 and [125I]CGP 23996 ([125I]c[Asn-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Ser]) were performed to determine the level of expression of somatostatin receptor messenger RNA and receptor binding sites in the hippocampal formation, limbic system and cerebral cortex of adult rats electrically kindled in the dorsal hippocampus. In control rats (implanted with electrodes but not electrically stimulated), the somatostatin-1 receptor-selective [125I]Tyr3-octreotide and the non-subtype-selective [Leu3,D-Trp22,125I-Tyr25]somatostatin-28 preferentially labelled the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the subiculum and presubiculum of the hippocampal formation, the inner layer of the frontal cortex, and the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. The non-subtype-selective radioligand [125I]CGP 23996 (in 5 mM Mg2+ buffer) preferentially labelled the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, the subiculum and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Under conditions where primarily somatostatin-2 receptors were labelled, [125I]CGP 23996 (in 120 mM Na+ buffer) showed strong binding in the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, whereas the dentate gyrus, subiculum and amygdala showed only weak signals. During and after kindling, no significant differences were observed between the ipsi- and contralateral sides of the hippocampus. A significant decrease (about 40%) of somatostatin receptor binding sites was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus with all radioligands (except [125I]CGP 23996 in Na+ buffer, which did not label this area) at stage 2 (pre-convulsive stage) and one week, but not one month, after stage 5 (generalized motor seizures). In contrast to somatostatin receptor binding, no alterations of the messenger RNA levels for sst1-sst5 receptors were found either at stage 2 or at stage 5. Similarly, no changes in receptor binding or messenger RNA levels were observed in the brain of rats which experienced a single afterdischarge. The present study shows a significant and selective decrease of somatostatin-1 receptor binding sites in the dentate gyrus of kindled rats. This is part of the plastic changes induced by kindling and may contribute to the increased sensitivity for the induction of generalized seizures during kindling.
8951896	An autopsy case of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) with degeneration of the fronto-pontine tracts of the midbrain and pons, and without grumose degeneration of the dentate nucleus is reported. A 72-year-old woman was suffering from dysarthria and gait disturbance. Moderate dementia was noted and gradually worsened. Pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs and cerebellar ataxia were not observed. Eye movements were fully preserved. Brain CT showed cerebellar atrophy. Three years later, she was unable to stand or move, and became mutistic. At the age of 75, she died suddenly. The duration of her illness was approximately 4 years. Clinical diagnosis was LCCA (late cortical cerebellar atrophy). Neuropathological examination revealed gliosis of the deep layers of the cerebral cortex around the precentral gyrus, fronto-pontine tracts degeneration (posterior part of the anterior crus, genu and anterior part of the posterior crus of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles of the midbrain, pontine base and pyramis of the medulla oblongata). Also, atrophy of the pons and marked degeneration of the superior colliculi and substantia nigra were observed. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and glial fibrillary tangles (GFTs) were found in the subcortical nuclei. These findings were almost consistent with PSP. However, the following differed from those of previously reported typical PSP cases: firstly, mild gliosis in the reticular formation of the midbrain; secondly, few NFTs in the pontine nuclei and superior colliculi and; thirdly, no grumose degeneration in the dentate nucleus. In addition, clinical symptoms of the present case are not consistent with PSP. Therefore, we concluded this case to be an atypical PSP both clinically and neuropathologically.
8953578	The present study was conducted to demonstrate immunohistochemically, the sites of c-fos protein expression in the brains of mice subjected to acute and chronic social defeat stress. To induce social stress, mice were placed in situations of species-specific intermale aggression either only once or five times at 24 h intervals. Two hours after the single or fifth defeat stress, many c-fos immunoreactive neurons were observed in a variety of brain regions including the limbic system and sensory relay nuclei. The c-fos immunoreactive neurons in the brains of acute defeat mice decreased in number with time and the c-fos staining pattern of acute defeat mice became indistinguishable from that of normal control mice by 24 h after the single defeat stress. In contrast, chronic defeat stress induced persistent c-fos expression in the forebrain and brainstem even 24 h after the fifth defeat stress. In the forebrain of chronic defeat mice, the olfactory bulb, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, entire hypothalamus, septal nuclei and the amygdaloid complex, except for the central nucleus, were labeled intensely with c-fos antiserum. In the lower brainstem, nerve cells with c-fos immunoreactivity were seen mainly in ascending and descending sensory relay nuclei relevant to auditory and vestibular transmission, epicritic sensation (gracile and external cuneate nuclei), pain inhibition (central gray and raphe nuclei), and viscerosensory transmission (solitary tract nucleus). The differences in c-fos expression among the normal control, acute and chronic defeat mice were evaluated by an enumeration of the immunopositive neurons within each brain nucleus examined, and they were confirmed subsequently by statistical analysis. There was little c-fos expression in the nucleus putamen, lateral, ventral and posterior thalamic nuclei, pretectal nuclei, medial geniculate nucleus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, spinal cord, or cranial nerve nuclei. These findings suggest that chronic but not acute defeat stress causes persistent c-fos expression in more widespread brain regions than do any other stresses so far investigated. The present study may shed light on the central mechanisms by which behavioral abnormalities and/or chronic sociopsychological stress leads to the occurrence of abnormal behavior and/or psychosomatic disorders in experimental animals and humans.
8956109	The distribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter mRNAs (mGATs) was studied in mouse brain during embryonic and postnatal development using in situ hybridization with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Mouse GATs 1 and 4 were present in the ventricular and subventricular zones of the lateral ventricle from gestational day 13. During postnatal development, mGAT1 mRNA was distributed diffusely throughout the brain and spinal cord, with the highest expression present in the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex. The mGAT4 message was densely distributed throughout the central nervous system during postnatal week 1; however, the hybridization signal in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus decreased during postnatal weeks 2 and 3, and in adults, mGAT4 labeling was restricted largely to the olfactory bulbs, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, medulla, and spinal cord. Mouse GAT2 mRNA was expressed only in proliferating and migrating cerebellar granule cells, whereas mGAT3 mRNA was absent from the brain and spinal cord throughout development. Each of the four mGATs was present to some degree in the leptomeninges. The expression of mGATs 2 and 3 was almost entirely restricted to the pia-arachnoid, whereas mGATs 1 and 4 were present only in specific regions of the membrane. Although mGATs 1 and 4 may subserve the classical purpose of terminating inhibitory GABAergic transmission through neuronal and glial uptake mechanisms, GABA transporters in the pia-arachnoid may help to regulate the amount of GABA available to proliferating and migrating neurons at the sub-pial surface during perinatal development.
8956113	The efferent connections of the caudal pole of the globus pallidus (GP) were examined in the rat by employing the anterograde axonal transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), and the retrograde transport of fluorescent tracers combined with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or parvalbumin (PV) immunofluorescence histochemistry. Labeled fibers from the caudal GP distribute to the caudate-putamen, nucleus of the ansa lenticularis, reuniens, reticular thalamic nucleus (mainly its posterior extent), and along a thin strip of the zona incerta adjacent to the cerebral peduncle. The entopeduncular and subthalamic nuclei do not appear to receive input from the caudal GP. Descending fibers from the caudal GP course in the cerebral peduncle and project to posterior thalamic nuclei (the subparafascicular and suprageniculate nuclei, medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus, and posterior intralaminar nucleus/peripeduncular area) and to extensive brainstem territories, including the pars lateralis of the substantia nigra, lateral terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system, nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, nucleus sagulum, external cortical nucleus of the inferior colliculus, cuneiform nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. In cases with deposits of PHA-L in the ventral part of the caudal GP, labeled fibers in addition distribute to the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, amygdalostriatal transition area, cerebral cortex (mainly perirhinal, temporal, and somatosensory areas) and rostroventral part of the lateral hypothalamus. Following injections of fluorescent tracer centered in the lateral hypothalamus, posterior intralaminar nucleus, substantia nigra, pars lateralis, or lateral terminal nucleus, a substantial number of retrogradely labeled cells is observed in the caudal GP. None of these cells express ChAT immunoreactivity, but, except for the ones projecting to the lateral hypothalamus, a significant proportion is immunoreactive to PV. Our results indicate that caudal GP efferents differ from those of the rostral GP in that they project to extensive brainstem territories and appear to be less intimately related to intrinsic basal ganglia circuits. Moreover, our data suggest a possible participation of the caudal GP in feedback loops involving posterior cortical areas, posterior striatopallidal districts, and posterior thalamic nuclei. Taken as a whole, the projections of the caudal GP suggest a potential role of this pallidal district in visuomotor and auditory processes.
8964814	In exercise, little is known about local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU), which is an index of functional neurogenic activity. We measured LCGU in resting and running (approximately 85% of maximum O2 uptake) rats (n = 7 in both groups) previously equipped with a tail artery catheter. LCGU was measured quantitatively from 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose autoradiographs. During exercise, total cerebral glucose utilization (TCGU) increased by 38% (p < 0.005). LCGU increased (p < 0.05) in areas involved in motor function (motor cortex 39%, cerebellum approximately 110%, basal ganglia approximately 30%, substantia nigra approximately 37%, and in the following nuclei: subthalamic 47%, posterior hypothalamic 74%, red 61%, ambiguous 43%, pontine 61%), areas involved in sensory function (somatosensory 27%, auditory 32%, and visual cortex 42%, thalamus approximately 75%, and in the following nuclei: Darkschewitsch 22%, cochlear 51%, vestibular 30%, superior olive 23%, cuneate 115%), areas involved in autonomic function (dorsal raphe nucleus 30%, and areas in the hypothalamus approximately 35%, amygdala approximately 35%, and hippocampus 29%), and in white matter of the corpus callosum (36%) and cerebellum (52%). LCGU did not change with exercise in prefrontal and frontal cortex, cingulum, inferior olive, nucleus of solitary tract and median raphe, lateral septal and interpenduncular nuclei, or in areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Glucose utilization did not decrease during exercise in any of the studied cerebral regions. In summary, heavy dynamic exercise increases TCGU and evokes marked differential changes in LCGU. The findings provide clues to the cerebral areas that participate in the large motor, sensory, and autonomic adaptation occurring in exercise.
8980849	Injections of the carbocyanine dye, DiI, into the lateral pallium of the silver lamprey reveal that this pallial region receives bilateral inputs from the olfactory bulbs, dorsomedial telencephalic neuropil, and the habenular nuclei, and ipsilateral inputs from the septum, preoptic area, medial pallium, thalamus, and, possibly, the striatum. The efferent projections of the lateral pallium form dorsal (olfacto-habenular tract of Heier) and ventral (olfacto-thalamic and hypothalamic tracts of Heier) bundles. The dorsal bundle terminates ipsilaterally in the dorsal pallium, medial pallium, habenular nuclei, and pretectum and contralaterally in the habenular nuclei and, possibly, the dorsal pallium. The ventral bundle terminates ipsilaterally in the septum, striatum, and preoptic areas and bilaterally within the hypothalamus. Injections of DiI into the medial pallium reveal bilateral inputs to this pallial formation from the olfactory bulbs, the dorsomedial telencephalic neuropil, septum, habenular nuclei, thalamic nuclei, preoptic area and hypothalamus, as well as ipsilateral inputs from the lateral pallium, dorsal isthmal grey and midbrain tegmentum. The efferent projections of the medial pallium form dorsal, ventral and descending bundles. The dorsal bundle terminates ipsilaterally in the dorsal and lateral pallia and in the olfactory bulb. The ventral bundle terminates ipsilaterally in the dorsal pallium and bilaterally within the lateral pallium and in preoptic and hypothalamic areas. The descending bundle terminates bilaterally in thalamic and hypothalamic areas and in the pretectum and optic tectum. These data support a number of earlier hypotheses concerning pallial homologues in lampreys and other vertebrates but suggest that the earlier hypothesis of an olfactory origin of the telencephalon of craniates should be rejected.
9007189	Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous neurotransmitter that may mediate a decrease in sympathetic output to the periphery. This implication predicts that NO-producing neurons in the brain are activated in animals experiencing increased levels of sympathetic activity. To test this prediction, we subjected three groups of experimental rats to differing levels of environmental stimulation for 1 hour: minimal stimulation, moderate stimulation, and restraint stress. NO-producing neurons were histochemically visualized in sections of the brain, and activation of these neurons was assessed according to the neuronal expression of the immediate early gene c-fos. Constitutive activation of NO-producing neurons was found in the hypothalamus (paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei), dorsal raphe nuclei, and spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve of minimally stimulated rats. When animals were subjected to a novel environment (moderate stimulation), additional NO-producing neurons were activated in the medial septum, medial amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei (lateral, periventricular, and posterior), colliculi, nucleus raphe obscurus, medial vestibular nucleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, and several components of the ventrolateral medulla. Restraint stress caused the activation of NO-producing neurons in all of these areas, often in increasing numbers, and the activation of additional NO-producing neurons in the diagonal band of Broca, lateral and medial preoptic areas, basomedial and basolateral amygdalar nuclei, hypothalamic nuclei (dorsomedial, retrochiasmatic supraoptic, and circularis), nucleus raphe pontus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and pontine nuclei. Expressed as a proportion of NO-producing neurons per section, the largest percentages (>20%) of double-stained neurons were found in the basolateral amygdala (46%), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (35%), corpora quadrigemina (estimated at 40%), dorsal raphe (45%), nuclei raphe pontus (33%) and obscurus (63%), lateral parabrachial nucleus (22%), medial vestibular nucleus (25%), lateral division of the nucleus paragigantocellularis (26%), and lateral reticular nucleus (35%). Evidence from other studies increasingly supports the concept that NO plays a generalized role in autonomic regulation by decreasing sympathetic output. Our results show that more NO-producing neurons were activated during stress than during minimal or moderate levels of stimulation. Together, the evidence suggests that NO is a neurochemical messenger that is utilized by individual autonomic neurons as the organism responds to increased levels of sympathetic activity.
9011402	The development of the central nervous alpha2-adrenergic system in the duck was studied by semiquantitative autoradiography at the ontogenetic stages embryonic days 20 (E20) and 27 (E27) and postnatal days 3 (P3) and 14 (P14) by using the monoradioiodinated alpha2-agonist clonidine ([125I]CLO) as radioligand. All structures endowed with alpha2-adrenoceptors in the adult animal were specifically labeled with [125I]CLO by E20. A detailed analysis of the binding capacity for [125I]CLO was performed for parts of several functional systems: hypothalamic structures (nucleus inferior hypothalami, nucleus magnocellularis preopticus, nucleus paraventricularis), limbic system (habenula, nucleus septalis lateralis, nucleus striae terminalis), circumventricular organs (organum pineale, organum subfornicale, plexus choroidei ventriculi tertii and ventriculi lateralis), visual system (hyperstriatum accessorium, nucleus reticularis superior, tectum opticum), and associative cortex (hyperstriatum ventrale). Except for the nucleus inferior hypothalami and the plexus choroideus ventriculi lateralis, all structures showed a perinatal (E27-P3) maximum of alpha2-adrenoceptor-binding capacity with a subsequent decline to values of prehatching stages. This uniform expression pattern of alpha2-adrenoceptors indicates that the days around hatching are a critical period for the development of the adrenergic system in the brain of the duck.
9034903	Acetylcholine (ACh) is synthesized in nerve terminals from choline and acetyl coenzyme A by the cytoplasmic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The neurotransmitter is thereafter transported into synaptic vesicles, where it is stored until release. cDNA clones encoding a vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) were recently isolated. In this paper, we report on the generation of highly specific goat polyclonal antisera to the rat VAChT protein by using a synthetic carboxy-terminal 20-amino-acid peptide sequence as an immunogen. Characterization of the antisera revealed recognition of VAChT, but not vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) protein, in transfected CV-1 cells. VAChT immunoreactivity was also detected in cells that endogenously express the protein, such as in PC12 cells and in primary cultures of spinal motoneurons. Absorption controls showed that the VAChT antisera could be completely blocked at the 10(-5) M concentration by cognate peptide used for immunization. The antisera cross-reacted with the VAChT protein in rat and mouse but not in guinea pig, rabbit, or cat. Immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy, using the goat VAChT antisera, showed strong immunoreactivity in discrete fibers and neuronal cell bodies of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Within cell bodies and axonal nerve terminals, as well as in dendrites, the staining appeared granular, presumably representing labeling of synaptic vesicles containing ACh. In the rat central nervous system, VAChT-positive cell bodies were demonstrated in the cerebral cortex, striatum, septum, nucleus basalis, medial habenula, mesopontine complex, cranial, and autonomic and spinal motor nuclei and in the intermediomedial region near the central canal. High densities of VAChT-immunoreactive axonal fibers were encountered in areas such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, basal forebrain, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus including median eminence, hippocampal formation, superior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus, and pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei. In cranial and spinal motor nuclei, particularly large varicosities were seen in close proximity to the motoneuron cell somata and their proximal dendrites. In the peripheral nervous system, VAChT immunoreactivity was also detected in motor endplates of skeletal muscle as well as in fibers of sympathetic and parasympathetic abdominal ganglia, heart atrium, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, adrenal medulla, male genitourinary tract, and salivary and lacrimal glands. Direct double labeling revealed colocalization of VAChT and ChAT immunoreactivity in neurons. The results show that VAChT antisera represent novel and unique tools for the study of cholinergic neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
9044389	Ciliary neurotrophic factor is a pleiotropic molecule thought to have multiple functions in the developing and adult nervous system. To investigate the role of ciliary neurotrophic factor in the developing and mature brain by defining putative target cells the expression of the ligand-binding alpha-subunit of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor was studied in neonatal and adult rat brains using a digoxygenin-labelled probe for in situ hybridization. Neuronal populations expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA were found in many functionally diverse brain areas including the olfactory bulb (mitral cells and other neurons) neocortex (layer V) and other cortical areas (pyramidal cell layers in the piriform cortex and hippocampus, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus) and distinct nuclei in the thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem. In the latter, reticular nuclei and both cranial motor and sensory nerve nuclei showed intense hybridization signals in the neonatal brain. The nucleus ruber, substantia nigra pars reticularis, deep cerebellar nuclei and a subpopulation of cells in the internal granular layer of the cerebellum were also labelled. In many areas (e.g. in thalamic, midbrain and pontine nuclei) ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha expression became undetectable with maturation; however, there were other areas (e.g., olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus) where expression was higher in the adult. The neuroepithelium of the neonatal rat displayed a highly selective expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha in areas which are known to exhibit high rates of postnatal cell proliferation in the germinal zones. Generally, neurons which have been reported to respond to exogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor were labelled by the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha probe. This was not the case, however, for striatal and septal neurons. The results of this study suggest that ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha ligands have even broader functions than previously thought, acting on different neuronal populations in the developing and mature brain, respectively.
9050787	The present study provides a detailed comparative description in the adult rat brain of areas that express mRNAs coding for the fibroblast growth factor subtype receptors 1-3 (FGFR1-3). One observation in this analysis was a widespread expression in the brain of all three FGFR mRNAs, according to the following rank order: FGFR1, diencephalon < telencephalon < mesencephalon and metencephalon < myelencephalon; FGFR2 and FGFR3, telencephalon < diencephalon < mesencephalon and metencephalon < myelencephalon. Another observation was an apparent cellular specificity in their basal expression. Thus, the FGFR1 mRNA was expressed mainly in large and weakly stained cells, whereas FGFR2 transcripts were expressed primarily in small and strongly stained cells and in cells of brain regions devoid of neuronal cells, such as the white matter. FGFR3 mRNA was always detected in small and strongly stained cells with scattered distribution and was not expressed in the white matter. However, FGFR2 mRNA was weakly expressed also in large cells localized in some nuclei of the lower brainstem, in the diagonal band, and in the septum. Furthermore, in the medial habenula and in the nuclei of the pons, there exists a high density of cells expressing both FGFR1 and FGFR2 (60-100%). With neurotoxic lesions involving 6-hydroxydopamine microinjections in the substantia nigra, reactive glial cells in the lesioned area and surrounding the cannula tract showed an increase in the expression of both FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNAs, whereas no increased expression was found for FGFR3 mRNA. Taken together, these findings showed that these three FGF receptors exist in all subtypes of cells of each brain region. Their apparent cellular specificity suggests that these receptor subtypes can have a differential trophic role in the brain, reflecting the various biological activities shown by the ligands of the FGF family.
9053793	The functional organization of the cortico-nucleus accumbens-substantia nigra pars reticulata circuit was investigated in the rat using combined anatomical and electrophysiological approaches. The nucleus accumbens neurons which project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata are located in a circumscribed region of the core immediately adjacent and extending dorsally to the anterior commissure. As shown by retrograde and anterograde transports of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the region of the nucleus accumbens related to the substantia nigra was found to receive bilateral inputs from restricted areas of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, i.e., prelimbic/medial orbital and dorsal agranular insular areas. The electrical stimulation of these medial and lateral prefrontal cortical areas induced excitatory responses in nucleus accumbens neurons projecting to the dorsomedial substantia nigra pars reticulata. Interestingly, an important proportion (61%) of the nucleus accumbens-nigral cells responding to the stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex were also excited by the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the existence of a convergent influence of these cortical areas on single nucleus accumbens cells. Furthermore, the present data also show that the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex results in a powerful inhibition of the tonic firing of the substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons. In conclusion, this study reveals the existence of a functional link between the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic/medial orbital and agranular insular areas) and the nucleus accumbens neurons which innervate the dorsomedial region of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Since the dorsomedial region of substantia nigra pars reticulata is known to project to subfields of the mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamic nuclei related to the prefrontal cortex, the present data further demonstrate the existence of a prefrontal-nucleus accumbens-thalamo-cortical circuit involving the substantia nigra pars reticulata.
9053801	In situ hybridization for regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA showed a distinct and limited pattern of expression in the hypothalamus, midline thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus of the rat. High levels of regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA were found in the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular, supraoptic and accessory nuclei, in the neurons of the periventricular, medial tuberal, arcuate, lateral and perifornical nuclei, infundibular stalk, and in the ventrolateral division of the ventromedial nucleus and compact division of the dorsomedial nucleus. Lower levels of regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA were found in the parvocellular divisions of the paraventricular nucleus as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus, medial and lateral preoptic areas, subfornical organ, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, zona incerta, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and tuber cinereum. Regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA was also found in thalamic structures including the paraventricular, central medial, intermediodorsal, anterodorsal, rhomboid and reticular nuclei. Signal was also identified in the medial and lateral habenula, in the central, medial, basomedial and anterior cortical nuclei of the amygdala, and in the CA1-CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Dopamine may regulate regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 expression in the CNS because (i) regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 was originally identified in melanotropes based on its regulation by dopaminergic agents and (ii) many of the nuclei that contain regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 also receive dopaminergic input. The localization of regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 in the diencephalon suggests that regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 is involved in regulation of limbic and autonomic function, neuroendocrine control of salt and water balance, reproductive function and feeding behavior.
9057112	Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) and F1/GAP-43 (B-50/neuromodulin) are both major specific substrates for protein kinase C (PKC) and appear to play an important role in the regulation of neuroplastic events during development and in the adult brain. Since PKC isozymes are differentially expressed in brain and the expression of F1/GAP-43 and MARCKS are differentially regulated by PKC through posttranslational mechanisms, the present study examined the relative distribution of both mRNAs in the adult brain by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. MARCKS hybridization was most pronounced in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex (layer II), medial habenular nucleus, subregions of the amygdala, specific hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampal granule cells, neocortex, and cerebellar cortex, intermediate in the superior colliculus, hippocampal CA1, and certain brainstem nuclei including the locus coeruleus, and low-absent in regions of the caudate-putamen, geniculate, thalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal and hilar neurons. Consistent with previous reports, prominent F1/GAP-43 hybridization was observed in neocortex, medial geniculate, piriform cortex (layer II), substantia nigra pars compacta, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and cerebellar granule cells, intermediate in regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, and low-absent in regions of the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, medial habenular nucleus, hippocampal granule cells, and superior colliculus. Overall, F1/GAP-43 was highly expressed in a greater number of regions compared to MARCKS and, in a number of regions, including the hippocampus, habenular complex, ventral tegmentum, geniculate, and certain brain stem nuclei, a striking inverse pattern of expression was observed. These results indicate that MARCKS gene expression, like that of F1/GAP-43, remains elevated in select regions of the adult rat brain which are associated with a high degree of retained plasticity. The potential role of PKC in the regulation of MARCKS and F1/GAP-43 gene expression in brain is assessed.
9063587	The current view of basal ganglia organization holds that functionally corresponding subregions of the frontal cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus form several parallel segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. In addition, this view states that striatal output reaches the basal ganglia output nuclei (the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi)) via a 'direct' pathway, and via an 'indirect pathway' which traverses the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the topographical relationships of GPe and STN, and their topographical relationships with the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are still unclear. The present work reviewed primate data on the topographical organization of STN afferents from GPe, and STN efferents to the pallidum, striatum and SNR, and examined these data with respect to a tripartite (motor, associative and limbic) functional subdivision of the striatum and pallidum. This examination indicated the following. (1) On the basis of its efferent connections, the STN may be divided into a motor and an associative territories, as well as a smaller limbic territory, each projecting to corresponding areas in the pallidum and striatum. (2) Efferents from GPe are in a position to contact subthalamic cells projecting to GPi/SNR, thus providing anatomical support for the existence of indirect pathways. (3) Moreover, given the tripartite division of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, the available data indicate the existence of indirect pathways connecting functionally corresponding subregions of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, as well as indirect pathways connecting functionally non-corresponding subregions. On the basis of the above we suggested that there may be two types of indirect pathways, one which terminates in the same subregion in GPi/SNR as the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion, and another which terminates in a different GPi/SNR subregion than the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion. We termed the former a 'closed indirect pathway' and the latter an 'open indirect pathway'. The application of these concepts to the surveyed data suggested the existence of three closed indirect pathways, each connecting the corresponding functional (motor, associative, and limbic) regions of the striatum, pallidum, STN, and SNR, as well as of two open indirect pathways, one connecting the associative striatum to the motor subregions of the basal ganglia, and the other connecting the associative striatum to the limbic subregions of the basal ganglia. While the organization of the closed indirect pathways fits the closed segregated arrangement of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, the organization of the open indirect pathways fits the recently suggested open interconnected scheme of basal ganglia thalamocortical circuitry. The clinical implications of this scheme for Huntington's disease are discussed.
9063592	Immunocytochemistry was used to investigate the neuroanatomical distribution of the chicken-I form of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (cGnRH-I) in reproductively active, male, red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis). Cell bodies with cGnRH-I immunoreactivity (ir) were found in the terminal nerve ganglion, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, medial preoptic area, and the hypothalamus. Fibers containing cGnRH-Iir were distributed in the following brain areas. Within the olfactory bulb, fibers were found in the internal plexiform, mitral and glomerular cell layers, as well as in the terminal nerve; within the forebrain, fibers were observed in the diagonal band of Broca, rostral and lateral septum, lateral pallium, retrobulbar region pars dorsomedialis, nucleus accumbens, medial preoptic area, hippocampal commissure, amygdala, posterior dorsal ventricular ridge, hypothalamus, median eminence, and the thalamus; within the midbrain, fibers were found in the interpeduncular nucleus and the stratum album periventricular of the optic tectum. This study shows that the distribution of cell bodies for cGnRH-Iir in this reptile is consistent with the distribution of immunoreactivity for cGnRH-I in birds and mammalian GnRH in amphibians and mammals. Using antiserum specific to cGnRH-I, the endogenous form of GnRH, this is the first study to show that the terminal nerve in a reptile contains GnRH immunoreactivity.
9077491	Utilizing an affinity-purified antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminal region of atrophin-1/drplap (residues 1170-1185), we have examined the expression and distribution of the protein in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses of gelatin-embedded sections of monkey brain demonstrated a wide-spread distribution of the protein throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Labeling was primarily cytoplasmic within neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Prominently staining regions included layers II, III, V, and VI of cerebral cortex, CA1-4 of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, thalamus, red nucleus, pons, Purkinje cells, and deep cerebellar nuclei. Immunoblot analysis of extracts of frontal cortex from a wide variety of mammalian species (human, monkey, rabbit, rat, mouse, and bovine) detected a 190 kDa band in each extract. No cross-reactive material of similar molecular weight was detected in an extract of avian (chicken) central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Furthermore, in the rat, expression of the protein was predominantly neuronal in origin as immunoblot analyses of non-neuronal tissue extracts detected little or no 190 kDa protein. Collectively these investigations suggest a ubiquitous expression of atrophin-1/drplap in mammalian CNS tissue and provide initial immunochemical data for the study of the neuroanatomic and perhaps, phylogenetic relationships between mammalian and non-mammalian forms of the protein.
9077512	Eight normal human brain autopsy samples were analyzed for Na, K, P, Ca, Mg, Si, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Fe, Al, Cd, Pb and As in 12 regions of brain (frontal cerebrum, temporal cerebrum, parietal cerebrum, somatosensory cortex, occipital cerebrum, cerebellum, mid-brain, pons, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus and medulla oblongata) using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICPAES). The distribution of these 15 elements varied significantly from region to region of the brain. Potassium was most abundant in nearly all regions of the brain, followed by sodium and phosphorus (mg/g). The concentration of Al was found to be comparatively high and varied in different areas of the brain (58-196 microg/g). Moderate levels of Pb, Cd and As were observed in different regions. Ratios of Al to Fe were found to be high in temporal cerebrum (8.07) and hippocampus (9.05) and these two regions are significantly involved in Alzheimer's disease. The concentration of Na in mole percentage showed an inverse correlation with that of K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Cr. Direct correlation was observed in the concentration of all analyzed elements, which indicated for the first time the direct dependency of concentration of trace elements in one brain region to other regions. The mole ratios between different elements in different brain regions and total amounts of the elements in an average weight of 1.4 kg human brain were also computed. The present study provides new and in-depth data which may be used as base line data for normal human brains.
9087522	The extent to which variation within and between the sexes can be assigned to genes vs. environment is problematic, because, in most vertebrates, males and females differ genetically. However, factors other than sex chromosomes and the consequent sex-typical gonadal hormone secretions may play important roles in the differentiation of the neural mechanisms underlying individual and sex differences in aggressive and sexual behavior. The leopard gecko, like many oviparous reptiles, lacks sex chromosomes. Instead, gonadal sex is determined by temperature during embryogenesis, with low and high incubation temperatures producing females and intermediate temperatures producing mixed sex ratios. In essence, this allows for the study of individual and sex differences without the confounding variable of genetically determined gender. Experiments have shown that the temperature experienced during incubation plays a critical role in establishing the adult morphological, endocrinological, and behavioral phenotype. In this experiment, the independent effects of incubation temperature and gonadal sex on the morphology and metabolic capacity of specific brain nuclei were determined. Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex. However, incubation temperature and gonadal sex are both important in determining the metabolic capacity in the anterior hypothalamus, external amygdala, dorsal lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, dorsal lateral nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal ventricular ridge, habenula, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus rotundus, nucleus sphericus, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, preoptic area, periventricular nucleus of the preoptic area, septum, striatum, torus semicircularis, and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. This is the first demonstration in a vertebrate that factors other than gonadal sex hormones, which arise from the individual's genetic constitution, can affect the sexual differentiation of the brain.
9087971	We report the clinicopathological features of 203 cases of pathologically proven multiple system atrophy (MSA) from 108 publications up to February 1995. The majority of patients showed symptoms in their early fifties, and men were more commonly affected than women (ratio of 1.3:1). Most patients suffered from some degree of autonomic failure (74%). Parkinsonism was the most common motor disorder (87%), followed by cerebellar ataxia (54%) and pyramidal signs (49%). The response to levodopa was poor in most patients, but there was a subgroup with a good response, who also often developed axial levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Other characteristic features included severe dysarthria, stridor, and, in a few patients, contractures and dystonia (antecollis). Mild or moderate intellectual impairment occurred in some cases, but severe dementing illness was most unusual. The main pathological change comprised cell loss and gliosis in the putamen, caudate nucleus, external pallidum, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, inferior olives, pontine nuclei, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and intermediolateral cell columns of the spinal cord. However, other neuronal populations were also involved to varying degrees, such as the thalamus, vestibular nucleus, dorsal vagal nucleus, corticospinal tracts, and anterior horn cells. Characteristic glial and/or neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were identified in all cases in which they were sought, irrespective of clinical presentation. Akinesia correlated with the degree of nigral and putaminal cell loss, whereas rigidity was related only to the later. Tremor was unrelated to cell loss at any site. Ataxia correlated with the degree of olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Pyramidal signs were associated with pyramidal tract pallor. Our analysis also confirmed an association of postural hypotension with intermediolateral cell column degeneration.
9092601	m-Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) is a mixed serotonin agonist/antagonist used extensively in psychiatric research. Alcoholics show blunted neuroendocrine responses to mCPP, and in some settings mCPP can induce craving for alcohol, particularly among early onset alcoholics. We used 2-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography to examine the effects of intravenously administered mCPP (0.08 mg/kg) on brain glucose utilization in a group of 18 male alcoholics and 12 healthy male control subjects. Differences between two sequential scans (the first followed placebo and the second followed mCPP) were evaluated statistically with a Gaussian random field-based method. Among healthy volunteers mCPP significantly increased brain glucose metabolism in the right medial and posterior orbital gyrus, the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally, the left nucleus accumbens, the head of the caudate nucleus bilaterally, the anterior and medial-dorsal nuclei of the thalamus bilaterally, the middle frontal gyrus, the left insular cortex, the left middle temporal gyrus, and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Among alcoholic subjects mCPP significantly increased brain glucose metabolism in larger areas of the cerebellum and posterior cingulate than it did in healthy volunteers, but compared with the healthy volunteers, alcoholics showed a smaller area of mCPP-induced activation in the thalamus, almost no activation in the orbital cortices, and no activation at all in the head of the caudate nucleus or the middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that a serotoninergic challenge activates basal ganglia circuits involving orbital and prefrontal cortices among healthy volunteers but that the response of these circuits is blunted among alcoholics.
9105665	The distribution of the dopaminergic D4 receptor in rat brain was studied employing site directed polyclonal antibodies. Antisera were raised in rabbits to two oligopeptides corresponding to amino acids 160-172 of the second extracellular loop (P1) and amino acids 260-273 of the third intracellular loop (P2) of the D4 receptor sequence. Affinity-purified antibodies (anti-P1 and anti-P2) specifically recognized two major bands of 42-45 and 95 kDa in Western blots of denatured preparations of various rat brain areas. Immunocyto-chemistry studies showed that D4 receptor is widely distributed in rat central nervous system (CNS) showing higher labelling in the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus) frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, cerebellum, supraoptic nucleus and sustancia nigra pars compacta. In addition, anti-P1 decreased the binding of the antagonist [3H]YM-09151-2 selective for D2, D3 and D4 receptors but did not modify the binding of [3H]raclopride an antagonist selective for D2 and D3, in striatal synaptosomes. Anti-P2 did not modify the binding of these ligands. These results confirm the selectivity of the antibodies towards the D4 receptor and suggest that the binding site for the antagonists might be located at or close to the second extracellular loop of the protein sequence. D4 receptor protein is mainly expressed in plasma membranes and in the peripheral cytoplasm of neurons and is more widely distributed than was originally proposed based on mRNA localization, since it is present both in limbic, diencephalic and motor areas of rat brain.
9115667	Broiler and leghorn chickens show an extreme difference in ingestive and reproductive behavior. As neuropeptide Y (NPY) influences both behaviors the goal of this study was to elucidate the distribution, expression and affinity of NPY binding sites in broiler and leghorn chicken brain. By means of in vitro autoradiography, sections of chicken brains were incubated with 3H-NPY as tracer and NPY as displacer. Scatchard analysis revealed a curvilinear plot suggesting two subtypes of the NPY binding site in the chicken brain, a high affinity one (KD = 2-4 nM) and one with a lower affinity (KD = 18-24 nM). Binding sites for NPY are localized with high density in the different subdivisions of the neostriatum and the hyperstriatum, the cerebellum, the nucleus septalis lateralis and medialis, the nucleus ruber and the nucleus tractus solitarii. A lower density of NPY binding sites was found in the different subdivisions of the striatum, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis, the paleostriatum, the archistriatum intermedium pars ventralis, the nucleus geniculatus lateralis, the nucleus taeniae, the locus ceruleus, the nucleus rotondus, the nucleus habenularis medialis, the nucleus dorsomedialis anterior (rostralis) thalami, the pituitary and the area of the hypothalamus with its nuclei such as the nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis and the nucleus preopticus medialis. Comparison of the localization of NPY binding sites in the brains of broilers and leghorns showed no differences but the density of both receptor types is two to three times higher in broilers than in leghorns.
9120053	As part of a research program to determine if the organization of basal ganglia (BG) of amphibians is homologous to that of amniotes, the afferent connections of the BG in the anurans Xenopus laevis and Rana perezi and the urodele Pleurodeles waltl were investigated with sensitive tract-tracing techniques. Hodological evidence is presented that supports a division of the amphibian BG into a nucleus accumbens and a striatum. Both structures have inputs in common from the olfactory bulb, medial pallium, striatopallial transition area, preoptic area, ventral thalamus, ventral hypothalamic nucleus, posterior tubercle, several mesencephalic and rhombencephalic reticular nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Several nuclei that project to both subdivisions of the BG, however, show a clear preference for either the striatum (lateral amygdala, parabrachial nucleus) or the nucleus accumbens (medial amygdala, ventral midbrain tegmentum). In addition, the anterior entopeduncular nucleus, central thalamic nucleus, anterior and posteroventral divisions of the lateral thalamic nucleus, and torus semicircularis project exclusively to the striatum, whereas the anterior thalamic nucleus, anteroventral, and anterodorsal tegmental nuclei provide inputs solely to the nucleus accumbens. Apart from this subdivision of the basal forebrain, the results of the present study have revealed more elaborate patterns of afferent projections to the BG of amphibians than previously thought. Moreover, regional differences within the striatum and the nucleus accumbens were demonstrated, suggesting the existence of functional subdivisions. The present study has revealed that the organization of the afferent connections to the BG in amphibians is basically similar to that of amniotes. According to their afferent connections, the striatum and the nucleus accumbens of amphibians may play a key role in processing olfactory, visual, auditory, lateral line, and visceral information. However, contrary to the situation in amniotes, only a minor involvement of pallial structures on the BG functions is present in amphibians.
9121734	The localization of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) immunoreactivity and mRNA in the adult rat brain was examined by light microscopic and electron microscopic immunohistochemistries, and in situ hybridization. For the purpose of detailed investigation of the distribution and comparison of GR immunoreactivities and mRNAs, specific polyclonal antibodies against a part of the transcription modulation (TR) domain of rat GR were used in the immunohistochemistry, whereas fluorescein-labeled RNA probes, complementary to the TR domain in the GR cDNA were used in the in situ hybridization. In the rat brain, GR immunoreactivity was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus, and the expression of GR mRNA was detected in the cytoplasm. GR-immunoreactive and GR mRNA-containing cells were widely distributed from the olfactory bulb of the forebrain to the gracile-cuneate nuclei of the medulla oblongata. The highest densities of GR-immunoreactive and mRNA-containing cells were observed in the subfields of cerebral cortex, olfactory cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala, septal region, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, trapezoid body, cerebellar cortex, locus coeruleus and dorsal nucleus raphe. The distributional pattern of GR immunoreactivity in many regions was well-correlated with that of GR mRNA, but in the CA3 and CA4 pyramidal layers of the hippocampus, different localization was noted. The present study provides the groundwork for elucidating the role of GRs in brain function.
9124010	Fluoro-Gold (FG) injected into the cerebello-medullary cistern (CMC) is accumulated in several nuclei and neurons of the brain. These structures include: taenia tecta, some fusiform perikarya in the diagonal band of Broca, pyramidal cells in the fifth layer of the cerebral cortex, paraventricular nuclei, zona incerta, medial habenular nuclei, red nuclei, dorsal tegmental nuclei, median raphe nucleus, nuclei pontis, cochlear and vestibular nuclei and some Purkinje cells in the most lateral segment of the cerebellar cortex. The supraoptic nucleus and the median eminence are free of FG. Many nuclei in the myelencephalon and large groups of neurons in the dorsal, intermediate and anterior horns of the spinal cord are also labeled with FG, but exact identification of these cell groups needs further experimentation. Our findings indicate that FG can be picked up from the subarachnoid space into many cell groups of the brain and spinal cord. It is concluded that possible leaking of FG into the subarachnoid space following its injection into the central nervous system has to be taken into account whenever FG is used in tract tracing experiments.
9125408	Recent studies have explored certain changes with aging of neurons containing neuropeptides. The degree of loss of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-, neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and somatostatin-containing neurons in the aged CNS has not yet been established with certainty however, and available data is often contradictory. Changes with aging of VIP- and NPY-containing neurons were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in this study. A major loss of VIP-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in aged rat brain was observed in the frontal cortex area 3, parietal cortex area 1, hindlimb area, temporal cortex area 1 and 2, monocular part of occipital cortex area 1, occipital cortex area 2, and retrosplenial cortex. VIP-ir cells in the frontal cortex areas 1 and 2, parietal cortex area 2, forelimb area, binocular part of the occipital cortex area 1, and the dentate gyrus were moderately decreased. The axis of VIP neurons in the aged group showed an irregular orientation tendency, especially in layers II and III. Major loss of NPY-ir neurons in aged rat brain were observed in the retrosplenial cortex, frontal cortex areas 1 and 2, parietal cortex areas 1 and 2, occipital cortex areas 1 and 2, the temporal cortex, hippocampus proper and cingulate cortex. Loss of NPY-ir neurons was observed mostly in layers V and VI. The number and length of dendritic branches also appeared to have decreased and shortened in the aged group. There were only slight decreases of somatostatin-ir cell numbers in the parietal and occipital cortex of the aged group. These results indicate the involvement of VIP and NPY-ir neurons in the aging process of cerebral cortex, and provide the morphological evidence for the decreased number of VIP and NPY neurons by immunocytochemistry in each area of cerebral cortex of aged rats.
9134981	We have recently reported that midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist that is also a short acting anesthetic and analgesic drug, can produce analgesia and decrease morphine tolerance and dependence in the rat by interacting with the opioidergic system. This study was designed to investigate the chronic effect of midazolam and/or morphine on the levels of dynorphin(1-13) in the pituitary gland, different brain regions, spinal cord and peripheral tissues of the rat. Four sets of animals were used: (I) saline-saline; (II) midazolam (0.03, 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg, body wt., i.p.)-saline; (III) saline-morphine (10.0 mg/kg, body wt., s.c.); and (IV) midazolam-morphine (0.03, 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg midazolam + 10.0 mg/kg morphine) groups. The first saline or midazolam injection was given i.p. and after 30 min, the second injection of saline or morphine was given s.c. daily for 11 days. Animals were sacrificed on the 11th day, 60 min after the last injection and dynorphin(1-13) was measured in indicated tissues by radioimmunoassay method. The midazolam treated animals showed a significant decrease in dynorphin(1-13) levels in the cortex, cerebellum, cervical region of spinal cord, heart and adrenals, and a significant increase in the hypothalamus, striatum and lumbar region of the spinal cord. The morphine treated animals showed a significant decrease in dynorphin(1-13) levels in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, pons, medulla, kidneys, adrenals and spleen, and a significant increase only in the lumbar region of the spinal cord. When both drugs were injected together there was no effect on pituitary gland, kidneys and spleen. These drugs antagonize each other's effect on dynorphin(1-13) in the hypothalamus, striatum, cerebellum, pons, medulla and heart. However, the midazolam-morphine combination significantly increases dynorphin(1-13) levels in the hippocampus, cortex, midbrain, cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, and adrenals. These results suggest the involvement of dynorphin(1-13) in the inhibition of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence by midazolam in the rat. These results may also help us in understanding the intrinsic mechanisms involved in narcotic tolerance and dependence.
9139238	The effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists on inositol phosphates (IP) accumulation were investigated in slices of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. EC(50) values for 1S, 3R-1-aminocyclopentane-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) did not differ significantly between various brain areas (range 10(-5) M), quisqualate was the most potent in all the brain areas (range 10(-7) - 10(-6) M), except the cerebellum (10(-5) M), ibotenate was the most potent in the striatum (range 10(-6) M) and the least potent in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (range 10(-4) M). The efficacy in the four brain areas showed the following trend of ranking order for ACPD and quisqualate: hippocampus > striatum > cerebral cortex > cerebellum, and for ibotenate: hippocampus > cerebral cortex > striatum > cerebellum, although the observed differences reached the level of statistical significance only in the case of ACPD (hippocampus and striatum vs cerebellum) and ibotenate (hippocampus vs cerebellum). Co-incubation of the agonists at maximally effective concentrations in any pairwise combination resulted in no substantial additivity of IP accumulation. D,L-1-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (AP3) and D,L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (AP4) at 0.5 mM concentration antagonized ACPD-induced IP accumulation by about 70 and 45 percent, respectively, without differences between brain areas. On the other hand, the antagonistic effects of L-serine-o-phosphate (SOP) at 1 mM concentration were the highest in the hippocampus (75 percent) and the lowest in the cerebellum (25 percent). The comparative data indicate considerable regional receptor heterogeneity, in terms of different ratios of response to the agonists (but not antagonists, except SOP). There is a robust responsiveness of mGluRs not only in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but also in the striatum which exhibits the highest affinity to both quisqualate and ibotenate.
9143014	We correlated trinucleotide CAG repeat numbers in the huntingtin gene with the regional brain atrophy and clinical phenotype in 23 adult autopsy cases of Huntington's disease (HD). CAG repeat number (39-56, mean 45.4 +/- 4.6) correlated inversely (P < 0.0001) with age at onset and death, but not with disease duration or initial symptoms. Cross-sectional areas of the striatum, pallidum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and the cortical grey and white matter within the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes at four levels (genu of the corpus callosum, amygdala, accumbens, hippocampus) were measured morphometrically from the coronal brain slices using image analysis. None of these morphometric variables correlated with number of CAG repeats. Thus, tissue atrophy in advanced HD is unrelated to the underlying genetic defect.
9174078	Following our initial mapping of preprogalanin messenger RNA in adult brain and its presence in a subpopulation of cerebellar Purkinje neurons [Ryan M. C. and Gundlach A. C. (1996) Neuroscience 70, 709-728], the present study examined the ontogenic expression of preprogalanin messenger RNA in the postnatal rat brain focussing on the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, preprogalanin messenger RNA was detected in the developing forebrain and hindbrain from postnatal day 4 to day 60 (adult). On postnatal day 4 very light hybridization signal (labelling) was observed in cells of a number of nuclei including the central amygdaloid nucleus, the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus of the forebrain while lightly-labelled cells were detected in neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract and locus coeruleus of the hindbrain. Hybridization signal was not apparent in other nuclei until later, with positively-labelled neurons first apparent in the dorsal cochlear nucleus at postnatal day 21. The abundance of preprogalanin messenger RNA-positive neurons and the intensity of the hybridization signal increased, in most regions, until postnatal day 28 when labelling resembled that of the mature rat. Preprogalanin messenger RNA was first detected in the cerebellum on postnatal day 10 only in Purkinje cells of lobule 10 of the posterior vermis and increased in distribution throughout Purkinje cell layers of the entire cerebellar cortex by postnatal day 13. The intensity of hybridization signal in Purkinje cells varied between lobules, with Purkinje cells in lobule 10 displaying a moderate to heavy degree of labelling, while lobules 6-9 and the more posterior lobules of the hemisphere including crus 2 of the ansiform lobule, the paramedian lobule and the copula pyramis, displayed only light labelling. The intensity of labelling in the anterior vermis and the remaining lobules of the hemisphere including crus 1 of the ansiform lobule, the simple lobule, the paraflocculus and the flocculus, was homogeneously weak. By postnatal day 21, Purkinje cell labelling reached maximum intensity in all lobules. Regional differences were still apparent, however, with labelling in the posterior vermis and hemisphere ranging from moderate to heavy, with only light to moderate labelling detected in the anterior vermis. The intensity of labelling in the posterior vermis and most lobules of the hemisphere was similar from postnatal day 21 to adulthood, while, in the anterior vermis, crus 1 of the ansiform lobule and the simple lobule, the intensity of hybridization decreased slightly by postnatal day 28 and was completely absent in Purkinje cells of the adult rat. Differential expression of preprogalanin messenger RNA in Purkinje cells of the developing rat cerebellum and transient expression in certain lobules suggests that galanin gene products may have a role in both the developing and mature rat brain and that galanin gene expression may represent a useful marker for differentiating the anterior and posterior cerebellar lobes.
9183692	We have recently shown that spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by motor neuron loss, is associated with deletion of a gene that encodes the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP). In the present study, we have examined the distribution of NAIP-like immunoreactivity (NAIP-LI) in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against NAIP. In the forebrain, immunoreactive neurons were detected in the cortex, the hippocampus (pyramidal cells, dentate granule cells, and interneurons), the striatum (cholinergic interneurons), the basal forebrain (ventral pallidum, medial septal nucleus, and diagonal band), the thalamus (lateral and ventral nuclei), the habenula, the globus pallidus, and the entopenduncular nucleus. In the midbrain, NAIP-LI was located primarily within neurons of the red nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the oculomotor nucleus, and the trochlear nucleus. In the brainstem, neurons containing NAIP-LI were observed in cranial nerve nuclei (trigeminal, facial, vestibular, cochlear, vagus, and hypoglossal nerves) and in relay nuclei (pontine, olivary, lateral reticular, cuneate, gracile nucleus, and locus coeruleus). In the cerebellum, NAIP-LI was found within both Purkinje and nuclear cells (interposed and lateral nuclei). Finally, within the spinal cord, NAIP-LI was detected in Clarke's column and in motor neurons. Taken together, these results indicate that NAIP-LI is distributed broadly in the CNS. However, high levels of NAIP-LI were restricted to those neuronal populations that have been reported to degenerate in SMA. This anatomical correspondence provides additional evidence for NAIP involvement in the neurodegeneration observed in acute SMA.
9191079	In sheep maternal behaviour and the formation of the selective olfactory, ewe/lamb bond are induced by feedback to the brain from stimulation of the vagina and cervix during parturition. In the present study, we have used in situ hybridization histochemistry to quantify changes in cellular expression of two immediately-early genes, c-fos and zif/268, in order to identify activated brain regions during the induction of maternal behaviour and olfactory bonding as well as regions where plastic changes are occurring during with the formation of the olfactory memory associated with bonding. Three different treatment groups were used. One group gave birth normally, became maternal and were allowed to interact with their lambs for 30 min. A second group received exogenous treatment with oestradiol and progesterone to induce lactation and then received a 5-min period of artificial stimulation of the vagina and cervix (VCS) which reliably induces maternal behaviour but could not interact with lambs. A final control group received exogenous hormone treatment but no VCS or interaction with lambs. Compared to the control group, post-partum animals and animals that had received VCS showed increased c-fos expression in a number of cortical regions (cingulate, entorhinal and somatosensory), the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and the lateral habenula, the limbic system (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, medial arnygdala, dentate gyrus and the CA3 region of the hippocampus) and the hypothalamus (medial preoptic area, mediobasal hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus and periventricular complex). The group that gave birth and had contact with their lambs for 30 min had significantly enhanced c-fos mRNA expression in the cingulate cortex compared to those receiving VCS and additionally showed significantly increased c-fos mRNA expression in olfactory processing regions (olfactory bulb, piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex). Expression of zif/268 was significantly increased in the entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and dentate gyrus of the parturition group compared to either the control or the VCS alone groups. These results show a clear differentiation between neural substrates controlling the expression of maternal behaviour and those involved in the olfactory memory process associated with selective recognition of offspring although at the level of the hippocampus and cingulate cortex there may be some degree of overlap. Alterations in zif/268 at tertiary processing sites for olfactory information (orbitofrontal cortex) and the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus may reflect plastic changes occurring during the early stages of olfactory memory formation.
9191083	Previous data showed the development of tolerance to a variety of pharmacological effects of plant and synthetic cannabinoids when administered chronically. This tolerance phenomenon has been related both to enhancement of cannabinoid metabolism and, in particular, to down-regulation of brain CB1 cannabinoid receptors, although this has been only demonstrated in extrapyramidal areas. In the present study, we have tested, by using autoradiographic analysis of CB1 receptor binding combined with analysis of CB1 receptor mRNA levels in specific brain regions by Northern blot, whether the reduction in binding levels of CB1 receptors observed in extrapyramidal areas after a chronic exposure to delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC), also occurs in most brain areas that contain these receptors. Results were as follows. The acute exposure to delta9-THC usually resulted in no changes in the specific binding of CB1 receptors in all brain areas studied, discarding a possible interference in binding kinetic of the pre-bound administered drug. The only exceptions were the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the cerebral cortex, which exhibited decreased specific binding after the acute treatment with delta9-THC presumably due to an effect of the pre-bound drug. The specific binding measured in animals chronically (5 days) exposed to delta9-THC decreased ranging from approximately 20 up to 60% of the specific binding measured in control animals in all brain areas. Areas studied included cerebellum (molecular layer), hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4 and dentate gyrus), basal ganglia (medial and lateral caudate-putamen and substantia nigra pars reticulata), limbic nuclei (nucleus accumbens, septum nucleus and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus), superficial (CxI) and deep (CxVI) layers of the cerebral cortex and others. There were only two brain regions, the globus pallidus and the entopeduncular nucleus, where the specific binding for CB receptors was unaltered after 5 days of a daily delta9-THC administration. In addition, we have analyzed the levels of CB1 receptor mRNA in specific brain regions of animals chronically exposed to delta9-THC, in order to correlate them with changes in CB1 receptor binding. Thus, we observed a significant increase in CB1 receptor mRNA levels, but only in the striatum, with no changes in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In summary, CB1 receptor binding decreases after chronic delta9-THC exposure in most of the brain regions studied, although this was not accompanied by parallel decreases in CB receptor mRNA levels. This might indicate that the primary action of delta9-THC would be on the receptor protein itself rather than on the expression of CB1 receptor gene. In this context, the increase observed in mRNA amounts for this receptor in the striatum should be interpreted as a presumably compensatory effect to the reduction in binding levels observed in striatal outflow nuclei.
9191100	The expression of the alpha and beta isoforms of phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PI-TP alpha and PI-TP beta) in the adult rat brain was examined by in situ hybridization analysis with isoform-specific RNA probes. PI-TP alpha mRNA was detected in rather restricted regions of the brain whereas PI-TP beta mRNA was widely distributed in the brain. PI-TP alpha mRNA signals were remarkable in neocortex layers II/III and V/VI, Purkinje cell layer, deep cerebellar nuclei of the cerebellum, red nucleus and most part of brain stem. Low levels of PI-TP alpha transcript were present in CA3 of the hippocampus, ventral and dorsal thalamic nuclei, and motoneurons of spinal cord. No hybridization signals was obtained in the olfactory bulb, basal ganglia, amygdala, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland. In contrast, strong signals of PI-TP beta mRNA were detected in the dentate gyrus. The beta isoform mRNA was moderately expressed in olfactory bulb, layers II/III of the neocortex, striatum, CA1-CA4 regions of the hippocampus, medial habenula, cerebellum, amygdala, hypothalamus, spinal cord, and pituitary gland. Thalamus and brain stem contained relatively low, but significant levels of PI-TP beta transcript. The distinct distribution of PI-TP alpha and PI-TP beta mRNAs suggests different functional roles for each of the gene products in the mature nervous system.
9203087	We investigated age-related changes in excitatory amino acid transport sites and FK506 binding protein (FKBP) in 3-week-, and 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month-old Fischer 344 rat brains using receptor autoradiography. Sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate and [3H]FK506 were used to label excitatory amino acid transport sites and immunophilin (FKBP), respectively. In immature rats (3-week-old), sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding was lower in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, whole hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum as compared to adult animals (6-month-old), whereas [3H]FK506 binding was significantly lower in only the hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum. 3[H]FK506 binding exhibited no significant change in the brain regions examined during aging. However, sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding showed a conspicuous reduction in the substantia nigra in 18-month-old rats. Thereafter, a significant reduction in sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding was found in the thalamus, substantia nigra and cerebellum in 24-month-old rats. Other regions also showed about 10-25% reduction in sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding. The results indicate that excitatory amino acid transport sites are more susceptible to aging process than immunophilin. Further, our findings demonstrate the conspicuous differences in the developmental pattern between excitatory amino acid transport sites and immunophilin in immature rat brain.
9208409	A study was performed in 48 neurologically normal preterm and term-born infants, with a postconceptional age at MRI varying between 30 2/7 and 46 weeks and a mean age of 34 2/7 weeks. The purpose of the study was to determine the normal progress of myelination on MRI in that age range. T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were assessed for changes in signal intensity of white matter relative to gray matter. Multiple sites in the brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres were assessed separately. The findings were correlated with the ages of the infants. As judged from relative signal intensities, myelin was present at the post-conceptional age of 30-34 weeks in the following structures: tegmentum pontis (in particular medial lemniscus), superior and inferior colliculi, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, crura cerebri, ventrolateral thalamus, lateral globus pallidus, dorsolateral putamen, dentate nucleus, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, vermis cerebelli, cortex bordering the central sulcus and hippocampus. Little progress in myelination was noticed up to the post-conceptional age of 46 weeks. Between 34 and 46 weeks, myelin appeared in the lateral part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule and in the central part of the corona radiata and became more prominently visible in the cortex bordering the central sulcus.
9215719	The distribution of preprodynorphin messenger RNA-containing perikarya in the central nervous system of the rat was determined with in situ hybridization histochemistry using a 35S-labelled complementary RNA probe. All of the regions of the central nervous system reported by other investigators to contain perikarya that synthesize prodynorphin-derived peptides, except the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, the accessory trigeminal nucleus, and the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body, also contained perikarya that synthesize preprodynorphin messenger RNA. However, the olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the islands of Calleja, the CA1-CA3 fields of the hippocampus, the septohippocampal nucleus, the diagonal band of Broca, the basal and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, the entopeduncular nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the superior colliculus, the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the dentate nucleus, the raphes linearis and pontis, the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the medial vestibular nucleus, the inferior olive, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve also contained preprodynorphin messenger RNA-synthesizing perikarya. These observations suggest that prodynorphin-derived peptides have a much more pervasive role in central nervous system function than previously suspected. However, before the physiological significance of these observations can be judged, it will be necessary to determine whether all of the novel sites of preprodynorphin messenger RNA synthesis are sites of prohormone synthesis and conventional processing.
9222533	The distribution of neurones that could be stained immunohistochemically with antibody to the p75 neurotrophin protein was studied in the forebrain of the common marmoset. The p75-immunoreactive forebrain cells appear to correspond to choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (i.e., cholinergic) neurones. Two populations of cells could be distinguished on the basis of the intensity of p75 immunostaining. Moderately stained cells correspond to cholinergic interneurones of the caudate and putamen, while intensely stained cells correspond to the cholinergic neurones projecting to the cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, located in the septum, diagonal band, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The distribution of cells of the diagonal band/basal nucleus complex is more extensive in the marmoset than in other primate species, extending into parts of the postcommissural fornix via the posterior septum, and by small projections dorsal to the anterior commissure and via the thalamic fasciculus from the basal nucleus; the posterior extent of the basal nucleus continues extensively into the lamina between the globus pallidus and the putamen.
9222537	To determine the extent and time course of local and distant neuronal damage produced by microiontophoretic administration of kainic acid (KA) into the central amygdaloid nucleus, distribution of neuronal damage was compared in various brain areas after different survival times. For demonstration of damaged, so-called "dark" neurons, a newly developed silver stain was employed. In addition, silver staining method was used to visualize microglia cells. In a separate experiment, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from the amygdaloid body, hippocampus, and the frontal cortex before and after microiontophoretic KA lesion of the central amygdaloid nucleus. It was observed that (1) even a minute amount of KA into this nucleus caused transient neuronal damage in distant brain areas; (2) the hippocampal formation, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, piriform cortex, and lateral septum were consistently affected; (3) the extent and time course of neuronal damage and appearance of microglia cells varied from area to area; (4) the KA neurotoxicity in distant brain areas appeared to depend on specific excitatory circuits, especially in the hippocampal formation; (5) the appearance and time course of pathologic EEG activity paralleled the appearance of dark neurons; and (6) the absence of pathologic EEG activity and the lack of massive neuronal loss or microglia proliferation in distant brain areas of rats surviving longer than 48 h suggested that these areas may have recovered both morphologically and functionally. Although details of cellular mechanism responsible for development of "dark" degeneration of neurons are not known, the silver method employed in the present study proved to be sensitive, useful tool for fine histological analyses of early and distant consequences of excitotoxic lesions.
9231707	A comparative study was undertaken to correlate the immunohistochemical localization of polysialic acid (PSA) and the in situ localization of ST8Sia II mRNA. In situ hybridization of postnatal day 3 mouse brain showed high levels of ST8Sia II mRNA expression in the cerebral neocortex, striatum, hippocampus, subiculum, medial habenular nucleus, thalamus, pontine nuclei, and inferior colliculus; intermediate-level expression in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, and cerebellum; and low-level expression in other regions. The distribution of ST8Sia II mRNA in the neocortex and cerebellum coincided with the immunohistochemical localization of PSA. During brain development, ST8Sia II mRNA started decreasing and had almost disappeared by postnatal day 14. Comparison between ST8Sia II and IV mRNA expression was also undertaken by northern blot analysis and competitive PCR analysis. During the late embryonic to early postnatal stages of the mouse CNS, the ST8Sia II mRNA showed abundant mRNA expression compared with the ST8Sia IV mRNA. Competitive PCR analysis of the adult mouse CNS showed weak expression of the two genes in the olfactory bulb, thalamus, hippocampus, and eyes. The regional and transient expression of ST8Sia II mRNA coincides with that of PSA, suggesting that ST8Sia II is closely involved in the biosynthesis and expression of PSA in the developing mouse CNS.
9237528	Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a regulatory peptide that modulates gastrointestinal function. Previously we demonstrated PP receptors in the brainstem and interpeduncular nucleus, and the PP receptors in the brainstem appear to modulate gastric motility and pancreatic exocrine secretion. The purpose of this study is to extend our understanding of the distribution of PP receptors in the rat brain in order to determine the systems that are potentially modulated by PP. Rat brains were studied using 125I-PP receptor autoradiography on cryostat sections of the entire brain cut in three planes (horizontal, sagittal, and coronal). Brain regions exhibiting PP binding sites were confirmed when identified in all three planes of section. Saturable PP binding was identified in the hypothalamus (arcuate and paraventricular n), the rostral forebrain (medial preoptic area, anterior olfactory nucleus, islands of Calleja, the dorsal endopiriform n, piriform cortex, and the bed n of the stria terminalis), medial amygdaloid n; the thalamus (anteromedial thal. n; reuniens thal. n; and paraventricular thal n), the interpeduncular red nucleus, substantia nigra, parabrachial n; locus coeruleus, mesencephalic trigeminal n, dorsal motor n of the vagus, the n solitary tract, and the area postrema. We conclude that PP receptors are distributed widely throughout the rat brain. The distribution of many of these PP binding sites corresponds to brain regions regulating digestion and autonomic function. We speculate, based on the patterns of binding in the olfactory and limbic systems, that PP receptors might be involved in positive reinforcement of ingestion behavioral as well as modulation of gastrointestinal function.
9252228	Stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase is a dual-specificity kinase which phosphorylates and activates stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, a recently discovered mitogen-activated protein kinase that is stimulated by stressful stimuli and that regulates cellular transcriptional activity. The distribution of the messenger RNA encoding for stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 was evaluated in the adult and developing rat central nervous system. In situ hybridization with a 35S-labelled 45mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe was used to map the distribution of the stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 messenger RNA in postnatal day 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and adult rat brains. Specific labelling was generally associated with neuronal profiles. In the adult central nervous system, high hybridization signals were observed in the hippocampus, the granular layer of the cerebellum, the medial habenula, the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, the red nucleus, the pontine nuclei, the facial nucleus, the motor and mesencephalic nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, the hypoglossal nucleus, the vestibular nucleus and the nucleus ambiguus. Intermediate levels were present in diencephalic and mesencephalic regions and in the neocortex, while basal ganglia displayed a low hybridization signal. In the developing brain, the heterogeneous distribution of the hybridization signal observed in the adult brain was already present, but in the hippocampus and basal ganglia the stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 messenger RNA levels were significantly higher at postnatal day 3 and during the second postnatal week than in the adult. The results show that stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 is widely expressed in the rat central nervous system and co-localizes with its substrate stress-activated protein kinase. The observed changes in stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 messenger RNA levels during postnatal development suggest a role for this protein in the maturation of brain circuits.
9252239	Differential activation of neural substrates was investigated in female sheep exposed to a male when they were in oestrus, and sexually receptive and attracted to males, as opposed to anoestrus when they were not. Changes in neuronal activation were visualized in ovariectomized, hormone-treated ewes by quantifying changes in cellular expression of c-fos messenger RNA by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Results showed that, while oestrus induction had no significant effects on c-fos expression per se, a 5-min exposure to a male significantly increased it in a number of primary and association cortical regions (the mitral and granule cell layers of the olfactory bulb, visual, somatosensory, orbitofrontal, piriform, cingulate and temporal cortices), the limbic system (CA1 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, lateral septum, lateral and basolateral amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and hypothalamus (mediobasal hypothalamus, medial preoptic area and paraventricular nucleus) as well as the nucleus accumbens and mediodorsal thalamus. Intromissions did not contribute significantly to these c-fos changes however. In anoestrus females, exposure to a male only produced a small significant increase in c-fos messenger RNA expression in the temporal cortex inspite of receiving similar amounts of visual and olfactory cues from him and a number of mating attempts. These results clearly demonstrate that changes in sexual motivation markedly alter the neural processing of sensory cues from males. They also show that the hormonal induction of sexual attraction to males cues and the resultant stimulation of sexual behaviour is due not only to altered responsiveness of oestrogen-sensitive brain regions involved in mediating behavioural responses towards the male, but also to changes in primary and secondary/tertiary somatosensory, olfactory and visual processing regions which relay sensory information to them.
9259487	The nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) of the accessory optic system is known to be involved in the analysis of the visual consequences of self-motion. Previous studies have shown that the nBOR in pigeons projects bilaterally to the vestibulocerebellum, the inferior olive, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and the oculomotor complex and projects unilaterally to the ipsilateral pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali and the contralateral nBOR. By using the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine, we confirmed these projections and found (previously unreported) projections to the nucleus Darkshewitsch, the nucleus ruber, the mesencephalic reticular formation, and the area ventralis of Tsai as well as ipsilateral projections to the central gray, the pontine nuclei, the cerebellar nuclei, the vestibular nuclei, the processus cerebellovestibularis, and the dorsolateral thalamus. In addition to previous studies, which showed a projection to the dorsomedial subdivision of the contralateral oculomotor complex, we found terminal labelling in the ventral and dorsolateral subdivisions. Individual fibers were reconstructed from serial sections, and collaterals to various nuclei were demonstrated. For example, collaterals of fibers projecting to the vestibulocerebellum terminated in the vestibular or cerebellar nuclei; collaterals of fibers to the inferior olive terminated in the pontine nuclei; many individual neurons projected to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the nucleus Darkshewitsch, and the central gray and also projected to the nucleus ruber and the mesencephalic reticular formation; collaterals of fibers to the contralateral nucleus of the basal optic root terminated in the mesencephalic reticular formation and/or the area ventralis of Tsai; neurons projecting to the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali also terminated in the dorsolateral thalamus. The consequences of these data for understanding the visual control of eye movements, neck movements, posture, locomotion, and visual perception are discussed.
9268064	A synthetic peptide, corresponding to the N-terminal decapeptide (+Y11C12) of the rat 5-hydroxytryptamine2C (5-HT2C) receptor protein was used to produce a sheep polyclonal antiserum. Western blot analysis showed that the resultant antibody G241 recognised two membrane proteins, one (55 kDa) approximating the molecular mass of the 5-HT2C receptor (52 kDa) and a second (63 kDa), which may be a glycosylated form of the receptor protein. HEK 293 cells transfected with human 5-HT2C cDNA displayed intense cell surface immunoreactivity with the 5-HT2C antiserum, which was completely prevented by incubating the antibody with the synthetic 5-HT2C peptide (10 microM), whilst neither non-immune serum nor untransfected cells displayed any immunoreactivity. A radioimmunoassay was developed to quantify the regional distribution of 5-HT2C-like immunoreactivity (LI) in the adult rat brain. The choroid plexus contained five-fold higher levels of 5-HT2C-LI than any brain region but high levels were found in the frontal cortex, septum, hypothalamus, and striatum, intermediate levels in the thalamus and midbrain, and lower levels in brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. In rat cortical membranes, the B(max) value from [3H]-mesulergine binding was ten-fold lower than 5-HT2C-LI levels determined by radioimmunoassay, which may reflect measurement of internalised receptor protein by radioimmunoassay which is not detected with conventional 5-HT2C ligands. Ten days after depletion of 5-HT with the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), there was a significant increase in 5-HT2C-LI in the choroid plexus and the ventral cervical spinal cord, suggesting that receptors therein are located post-synaptic to destroyed serotonergic nerve terminals. In contrast, the significant reduction in 5-HT2C-LI observed in the midbrain, brainstem, and dorsal thoracic spinal cord following 5,7-DHT implies that 5-HT2C receptors may be located on 5-HT nerve terminals in these regions.
9268118	Estimates of neuron numbers have been useful in studies of neurodegenerative disorders, and in their animal models, and in the computational modeling of hippocampal function. Although the retrohippocampal region (presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area) is an integral part of the hippocampal circuitry and is affected selectively in a number of disorders, estimates of neuron numbers in the rat retrohippocampal region have yet to be published. Such data are necessary ingredients for computational models of the function of this region and will also facilitate a comparison of this region in rats and primates, which will help to determine how well we may expect rat models to predict function and dysfunction in primate brains. In the present study, we used the optical fractionator to estimate the number of neurons in the rat retrohippocampal region. The following estimates were obtained: 3.3 x 10(5) in presubicular layers II and III, 1.5 x 10(5) in parasubicular layers II and III, 2.2 x 10(5) in the combined pre- and parasubicular layers V and VI, 6.6 x 10(4) in medial entorhinal area (MEA) layer II, 1.3 x 10(5) in MEA layer III, 1.9 x 10(5) in MEA layers V and VI, 4.6 x 10(4) in lateral entorhinal area (LEA) layer II, 1.2 x 10(5) in LEA layer III, and 1.4 x 10(5) in LEA layers V and VI. A surprising finding was the large numbers of neurons in the pre- and parasubiculum, which indicate an important role of these areas in the control of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. A comparison of the numbers of neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal areas in rats with similar estimates in humans revealed that gross input-output relations are largely conserved. Differences between rats and humans may be accounted for by more prominent entorhino-neocortical projections in primates and consequent increases in the number of neurons in the hippocampus and retrohippocampal region, which are dedicated to these projections.
9271192	The aim of the present study was to identify the specific afferent projections to the rostral and caudal nucleus raphe magnus, the gigantocellular reticular nucleus pars alpha and the rostral nucleus raphe pallidus. For this purpose, small iontophoretic injections of the sensitive retrograde tracer choleratoxin (subunit b) were made in each of these structures. In agreement with previous retrograde studies, after all injection sites, a substantial to large number of labeled neurons were observed in the dorsal hypothalamic area and dorsolateral and ventrolateral parts of the periaqueductal gray, and a small to moderate number were found in the lateral preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, parafascicular area, parabrachial nuclei, subcoeruleus area and parvocellular reticular nucleus. In addition, depending on the nucleus injected, we observed a variable number of retrogradely labeled cells in other regions. After injections in the rostral nucleus raphe magnus, a large number of labeled cells were seen in the prelimbic, infralimbic, medial and lateral precentral cortices and the dorsal part of the periaqueductal gray. In contrast, after injections in the other nuclei, fewer cells were localized in these structures. Following raphe pallidus injections, a substantial to large number of labeled cells were observed in the medial preoptic area, median preoptic nucleus, ventromedial part of the periaqueductal gray, Kölliker-Fuse and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei. Following injections in the other areas, a small to moderate number of cells appeared. After gigantocellular reticular pars alpha injections, a very large and substantial number of labeled neurons were found in the deep mesencephalic reticular formation and oral pontine reticular nucleus, respectively. After the other injections, fewer cells were seen. Following rostral raphe magnus or raphe pallidus injections, a substantial number of labeled cells were observed in the insular and perirhinal cortices. Following caudal raphe magnus or gigantocellular reticular pars alpha injections, fewer cells were found. After raphe magnus or gigantocellular reticular pars alpha injections, a moderate to substantial number of cells were localized in the fields of Forel, lateral habenular nucleus and ventral caudal pontine reticular nucleus. Following raphe pallidus injections, only a small number of cells were seen. Our data indicate that the rostral and caudal parts of the nucleus raphe magnus, the gigantocellular reticular nucleus pars alpha and the nucleus raphe pallidus receive afferents of comparable strength from a large number of structures. In addition, a number of other afferents give rise to stronger inputs to one or two of the four nuclei studied. Such differential inputs might be directed to populations of neurons with different physiological roles previously recorded specifically in these nuclei.
9271193	Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) are proteins that are required for cholinergic neurotransmission. Present knowledge concerning the organization of cholinergic structures has been derived primarily from immunohistochemistry for ChAT. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of mRNAs and the corresponding proteins for ChAT and VAChT by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The patterns of distribution of perikarya containing ChAT mRNA. ChAT protein, VAChT mRNA and VAChT protein were similar in most regions, and co-localization in the same neuron of mRNAs for ChAT and VAChT, that of ChAT mRNA and ChAT protein, and that of VAChT mRNA and VAChT protein were demonstrated. However, in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, ChAT-immunoreactive perikarya were present, but they did not contain mRNAs for ChAT and VAChT, and VAChT protein. On the other hand, in the cerebellum, Purkinje cell bodies contained VAChT mRNA and VAChT protein, but they did not contain either ChAT mRNA or ChAT protein. Axon bundles were clearly revealed by immunohistochemistry for ChAT, but they were not detected by that for VAChT. Both ChAT and VAChT antibodies revealed preterminal axons and terminal-like structures. In the forebrain, they were present in the olfactory bulb, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, olfactory tubercle, lateral septal nucleus, amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus and median eminence of the hypothalamus. In the brainstem, they were localized in the superior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus and some cranial nerve motor nuclei, and further in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These results indicate strongly that ChAT and VAChT are expressed in most of the cholinergic neurons, and that immunohistochemistry for VAChT is as useful to detect cholinergic terminal fields as that for ChAT.
9285356	The technique of in situ hybridization with specific ribonucleotide probes was used to determine the distribution patterns of mRNA encoding the alpha 1a-, alpha 1b- and alpha 1d-adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes in rat brain and spinal cord. The expression pattern of alpha 1a-AR mRNA has not been reported previously, and was found to be widespread throughout the rat central nervous system. High levels were found in regions of the olfactory system, several hypothalamic nuclei, and regions of the brainstem and spinal cord, particularly in areas related to motor function. Regions expressing moderate levels of mRNA for this receptor were the septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, cerebral cortex, amygdala, cerebellum and pineal gland. Low expression levels were detected in the hippocampal formation. Most nuclei in the basal ganglia and thalamus expressed extremely low or undetectable levels of alpha 1a-AR mRNA. The expression patterns of the alpha 1b- and alpha 1d-AR mRNAs were similar to those described using oligonucleotide probes in earlier studies. High expression of alpha 1b-AR mRNA was noted in the pineal gland, most thalamic nuclei, lateral nucleus of the amygdala and dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Moderate expression levels were noted throughout the cerebral cortex, and in some olfactory, septal, and brainstem regions. The distribution of alpha 1d-AR mRNA was the most discrete of the three receptors examined. Expression was strong in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, reticular thalamic nucleus, regions of the amygdala, motor nuclei of the brainstem, inferior olivary complex and spinal cord. Comparison of the distributions of the alpha 1a-, alpha 1b- and alpha 1d-AR mRNA suggests unique functional roles for each of these receptors.
9300265	Increasing evidence indicates that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist R(+)-zacopride labels an additional site in brain tissue that is not sensitive to 5-HT (non-5-HT R(+)-zacopride site, R(+)-site). Since the levels of R(+)-sites in the brain are relatively low, the present studies explored the use of [125I]R(+)-zacopride to label the R(+)-site; the incorporation of an [125I] atom considerably increasing the specific activity of the radioligand relative to [3H]R(+)-zacopride that has been utilised previously. Competition experiments with [125I]R(+)-zacopride (1.0 nM) binding to rat whole brain homogenates, in the presence of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron (1.0 microM), identified that R(+)-zacopride and prazosin bound to two sites (pIC50: 7.59 and 5.28, respectively, for R(+)-zacopride; 6.75 and 4.42, respectively, for prazosin) whereas S(-)-zacopride and mianserin possessed relatively low affinity (pIC50: 4.37 and 3.80, respectively) while (-)sulpiride and 5-HT failed to compete for [125I]R(+)-zacopride binding at concentrations up to 10 microM. Autoradiographic radioligand binding studies using [125I]R(+)-zacopride (0.5 nM) identified a heterogeneous distribution of specific binding sites (defined by unlabelled R(+)-zacopride, 1.0 microM) throughout the rat brain. In the presence of a saturating concentration of granisetron (1.0 microM), highest levels of specific [125I]R(+)-zacopride, binding sites (defined by R(+)-zacopride, 1.0 microM; R(+)-site), were detected in the olfactory tubercle, thalamus, corpus callosum, colliculus, dorsal and median raphe nucleus, spinal cord and the pons (8.0-13.0 fmol/mg). Moderate densities of R(+)-sites were located in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, globus pallidus, septal nuclei, frontal cortex and cerebellum (2.0-7.9 fmol/mg). In the hippocampus, amygdala and cortical areas. R(+)-site levels were low but detectable (0.1-1.9 fmol/mg). [125I]R(+)-zacopride labelled R(+)-sites were also detected in some rat peripheral tissues, for instance kidney cortex, adrenal gland and liver (2.4-6.8 fmol/mg). The present results indicate that specific non-5-HT [125I]R(+)-zacopride sites are heterogeneously distributed throughout the rat brain and are expressed in various peripheral tissues.
9300625	Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation increases monoaminergic (noradrenergic and serotonergic) turnover and their metabolites in whole brain of rats. This increase in metabolites may indicate increased activity of the enzymes responsible for the inactivation of monoamines. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the activity of monoamineoxidases (MAOs) A and B in hippocampus, hypothalamus, brainstem and its divisions pons and medulla oblongata in rats deprived of REM sleep for 96 h. REM sleep deprivation was carried out by the flower-pot technique. A control group remained in their home cages. MAO A was assayed by using [14C]-5-hydroxytryptamine as the substrate (50 microM final concentration) and MAO B by using [14C]-beta-phenylethylamine (2 microM final concentration). The enzymes were assayed in the mitochondrial fraction.The results obtained showed that a significant decrease in the activity of MAO A was obtained in the brainstem and an increase in medulla oblongata and no statistical differences in the activity of MAO B in brainstem, pons and medulla oblongata and MAO A in pons; there were also no differences in the activities of both MAO A and B in hippocampus and hypothalamus. Although our results confirmed previous data regarding changes in MAO A activity in brainstem and medulla oblongata, they did not confirm our hypothesis that the increase in monamine turnover and metabolites in the brain would be the result of increased MAO activity.
9302109	This paper is an account of the afferent and efferent projections of the nucleus sphericus (NS), which is the major secondary vomeronasal structure in the brain of the snake Thamnophis sirtalis. There are four major efferent pathways from the NS: 1) a bilateral projection that courses, surrounding the accessory olfactory tract, and innervates several amygdaloid nuclei (nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, dorsolateral amygdala, external amygdala, and ventral anterior amygdala), the rostral parts of the dorsal and lateral cortices, and the accessory olfactory bulb; 2) a bilateral projection that courses through the medial forebrain bundle and innervates the olfactostriatum (rostral and ventral striatum); 3) a commissural projection that courses through the anterior commissure and innervates mainly the contralateral NS; and 4) a meager bilateral projection to the lateral hypothalamus. On the other hand, important afferent projections to the NS arise solely in the accessory olfactory bulb, the nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, and the contralateral NS. This pattern of connections has three important implications: first, the lateral cortex probably integrates olfactory and vomeronasal information. Second, because the NS projection to the hypothalamus is meager and does not reach the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, vomeronasal information from the NS is not relayed directly to that nucleus, as previously reported. Finally, a structure located in the rostral and ventral telencephalon, the olfactostriatum, stands as the major tertiary vomeronasal center in the snake brain. These three conclusions change to an important extent our previous picture of how vomeronasal information is processed in the brain of reptiles.
9303423	Norepinephrine has been implicated in a number of physiological, behavioral, and cellular modulatory processes in the brain, and many of these modulatory effects are attributable to alpha1 adrenergic receptors. At least three alpha1 receptor subtypes have been identified by molecular criteria, designated alpha1A, alpha1B, and beta1D. The distributions of alpha1B and alpha1D receptor mRNA expression in rat brain have been described previously, but the cDNA for the rat alpha1A receptor has only recently been cloned and characterized. In the present study, we used a radiolabelled riboprobe derived from the rat alpha1A receptor cDNA to describe the distribution of alpha1A message expression in the rat brain. The highest levels of alpha1A adrenergic receptor mRNA expression were seen in the olfactory bulb, tenia tectae, horizontal diagonal band/magnocellular preoptic area, zona incerta, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral mammillary nuclei, ventral dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, medial and cortical amygdala, magnocellular red nuclei, pontine nuclei, superior and lateral vestibular nuclei, brainstem reticular nuclei, and several cranial nerve motor nuclei. Dual in situ hybridization combining a radioactive riboprobe for choline acetyltransferase mRNA with a digoxigenin-labeled alpha1A riboprobe in the fifth and seventh cranial nerve motor nuclei showed that the alpha1A mRNA is expressed in cholinergic motor neurons. Prominent alpha1A hybridization signal was also seen in the neocortex, claustrum, lateral amygdala, ventral cochlear nucleus, raphe magnus, and in the ventral horn of thoracic spinal cord. This overall pattern of expression, considered in comparison with that previously described for the other alpha1 adrenergic receptor subtypes, may shed light on the different roles of the alpha1 receptors in mediating the neuromodulatory effects of norepinephrine in processes such as arousal, neuroendocrine control, sensorimotor regulation, and the stress response.
9310315	The present study examined the organization of afferent and efferent connections of the rat ventrolateral tegmental area (VLTg) by employing the retrograde and anterograde axonal transport of Fluorogold and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, respectively. Our interest was focused on whether the anatomical connections of the VLTg would provide evidence as to the involvement of this reticular area in audiomotor behavior. Our retrograde experiments revealed that minor inputs to the VLTg arise in various telencephalic structures, including the cerebral cortex. Stronger projections originate in the lateral preoptic area, the zona incerta, the nucleus of the posterior commissure and some other thalamic areas, the lateral substantia nigra, the deep layers of the superior colliculus, the dorsal and lateral central gray, the deep mesencephalic nucleus, the paralemniscal zone, the intercollicular nucleus, the external cortex of the inferior colliculus, the oral and caudal pontine reticular nucleus, the deep cerebellar nuclei, the gigantocellular and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei, the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, the spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the intermediate layers of the spinal cord. Most importantly, we disclosed strong auditory afferents arising in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei and in the cochlear root nucleus. The efferent projections of the VLTg were found to be less widespread. Telencephalic structures do not receive any input from the VLTg. Moderate projections were seen to diencephalic reticular areas, the zona incerta, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, and to various other thalamic areas. The major VLTg projections terminate in the deep layers of the superior colliculus, the deep mesencephalic nucleus, the intercollicular nucleus and external cortex of the inferior colliculus, the oral and caudal pontine reticular nucleus, the gigantocellular and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei, and in the medial column of the facial nucleus. From our data, we conclude that the VLTg might play a role in sensorimotor behavior.
9314579	The conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom) is an important step in the mechanism of androgen action in the brain. However, the distribution of P450arom mRNA in adult rhesus monkey brains has not been studied because specific probes have not been available. To address this deficit, we cloned and sequenced a 455-basepair segment of the 5' coding region of the rhesus P450arom cDNA. Total RNA was extracted from a rhesus monkey placenta (Day 47 of gestation and subjected to reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus oligonucleotide primers selected from published human and rat P450arom DNA sequences. The RT-PCR product was subcloned into a vector and sequenced. The monkey P450arom cDNA was 97% identical to the human sequence but shared only 86% homology with the rat sequence. We then developed a ribonuclease protection assay using a monkey P450arom cDNA and studied the distribution of P450arom mRNA in adult monkey brains. This assay protected two RNA fragments, one 455 nucleotides (nt) in length and the second approximately 300 nt. The relative distribution of P450arom mRNA (the 455-nt fragment) between brain areas of the adult (n = 3) was high in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis > medial preoptic/anterior hypothalamus > amygdala; intermediate in the medial basal hypothalamus (infundibular nucleus, median eminence, ventromedial nucleus) > lateral preoptic/anterior hypothalamus; and low in the septum > lateral-dorsal-medial hypothalamus. P450arom mRNA was undetectable in cingulate and parietal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. P450arom activity, as measured by the 3H2O assay, correlated well with the distribution of P450arom mRNA (the 455-nt protected fragment; r = 0.9) in the same tissues. A shorter protected RNA fragment was found in the medial basal hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the amygdala, and the cingulate and parietal cortex but not in the other brain areas investigated. Its presence did not correlate with aromatase activity in brain tissue. This study describes the development of a ribonuclease protection assay using a monkey cDNA produced by RT-PCR and its usefulness for studying the distribution of P450arom mRNA in brains of nonhuman primates.
9316028	In the present study we have investigated the efferent projections of both the dorsal and the ventral pallidum of the pigeon basal ganglia, using the sensitive anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine [Veenman C. L. et al. (1992) J. Neurosci. Meth. 41, 239-254]. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine in the pigeon dorsal pallidum produced numerous fibers and terminals in specific nuclei of the thalamus, hypothalamus, pretectum and midbrain tegmentum. In the thalamus, labeled fibers and terminals were observed in the avian thalamic reticular nucleus, the proposed motor part of the avian ventral tier (ventrointermediate area), the avian parafascicular nucleus (nucleus dorsointermedius posterior), as well as in the avian nucleus subrotundus (which may be comparable to the posterior intralaminar nuclei of mammals). Labeled fibers and terminals were also observed in the avian subthalamic nucleus (anterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis), in the pretectum (nucleus spiriformis lateralis) and in the avian substantia nigra pars reticulata. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine in the pigeon ventral pallidum produced fibers and terminals in specific centers of the telencephalon, hypothalamus, thalamus, epithalamus, and midbrain and isthmic tegmentum. Labeled fibers and terminals were also observed in the avian subthalamic nucleus and the inmediately adjacent lateral hypothalamus, the avian thalamic reticular nucleus, the avian medidorsal nucleusaand posterior intralaminar nuclei, and the lateral habenula. Finally, labeled fibers and terminals were found in the ventral tegmental area, the avian substantia nigra pars compacta and the midbrain/isthmic tegmentum, which includes the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Our results indicate that both the dorsal and ventral pallida of birds have unique and specific projection patterns, which are very similar to those of their counterparts in mammals. Our study suggests that these avian basal ganglia regions may be related mainly to somatomotor and limbic functions, respectively.
9316291	A 4-year-old boy was admitted with disturbed consciousness following a convulsion. He developed bilateral pyramidal tract signs and showed a decerebrate posture. Laboratory findings revealed severe liver dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation. On the eighth day eight in hospital he developed parkinsonism. However, 5 months from onset he had recovered almost completely. Brain CT on admission showed low density areas in the basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain and pons. A T2-weighted scan in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed almost symmetrical high signal intensities in both basal ganglia (including putamen, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus), external capsule, internal capsule thalamus, midbrain, pons and white matter of the peribasal ganglia; but a T1-weighted scan showed low signal intensities in the same regions during all phases. Therefore hemorrhagic lesions or the presence of thalamic methemoglobin were excluded. It was considered that the pathogenesis may be cytotoxic cellular edema due to cytotoxic agents or acute metabolic factors. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings and radiological findings were most suggestive of acute necrotizing encephalopathy. As differential diagnoses, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and brainstem encephalitis were considered.
9329072	The neurochemical consequences of aversive behavior based on novelty, rat social interaction, have been assessed in various rat brain regions utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) technique. The present studies indicated that compared to animals from the home cage, those exposed to the high-light aversive unfamiliar test condition, had significantly increased levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the metabolite of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), in the tested brain regions including amygdala, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, tuberculum olfactorium, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and striatum. The levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), the metabolites of dopamine (DA), were increased in tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus accumbens, and striatum. When compared to the low-light familiar test condition (LF), the levels, following exposure to the highlight unfamiliar situation, of 5-HIAA were significantly increased in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, tuberculum olfactorium, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, while the 5-HIAA levels remained unchanged in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and striatum. The DOPAC and HVA levels were also increased by the HU situation in the amygdala, tuberculum olfactorium, and nucleus accumbens. An increase was also found for the levels of DA in the amygdala. Such effects were prevented by diazepam or the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. It is concluded that the aversive test condition of the social interaction test (HU) increases 5-HT and DA turnover throughout the rat brain. Such effects might be related to the sensitivity to novel anxiolytic drug of the social interaction test.
9331351	We investigated brain circuitry mediating cocaine-induced euphoria and craving using functional MRI (fMRI). During double-blind cocaine (0.6 mg/kg) and saline infusions in cocaine-dependent subjects, the entire brain was imaged for 5 min before and 13 min after infusion while subjects rated scales for rush, high, low, and craving. Cocaine induced focal signal increases in nucleus accumbens/subcallosal cortex (NAc/SCC), caudate, putamen, basal forebrain, thalamus, insula, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate, lateral prefrontal and temporal cortices, parietal cortex, striate/extrastriate cortices, ventral tegmentum, and pons and produced signal decreases in amygdala, temporal pole, and medial frontal cortex. Saline produced few positive or negative activations, which were localized to lateral prefrontal cortex and temporo-occipital cortex. Subjects who underwent repeat studies showed good replication of the regional fMRI activation pattern following cocaine and saline infusions, with activations on saline retest that might reflect expectancy. Brain regions that exhibited early and short duration signal maxima showed a higher correlation with rush ratings. These included the ventral tegmentum, pons, basal forebrain, caudate, cingulate, and most regions of lateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, regions that demonstrated early but sustained signal maxima were more correlated with craving than with rush ratings; such regions included the NAc/SCC, right parahippocampal gyrus, and some regions of lateral prefrontal cortex. Sustained negative signal change was noted in the amygdala, which correlated with craving ratings. Our data demonstrate the ability of fMRI to map dynamic patterns of brain activation following cocaine infusion in cocaine-dependent subjects and provide evidence of dynamically changing brain networks associated with cocaine-induced euphoria and cocaine-induced craving.
9336230	The expression of cadherin-8 was mapped by in situ hybridization in the embryonic and postnatal mouse central nervous system (CNS). From embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 6 (P6), cadherin-8 expression is restricted to a subset of developing brain nuclei and cortical areas in all major subdivisions of the CNS. The anlagen of some of the cadherin-8-positive structures also express this molecule at earlier developmental stages (E12.5-E16). The cadherin-8-positive neuroanatomical structures are parts of several functional systems in the brain. In the limbic system, cadherin-8-positive regions are found in the septal region, habenular nuclei, amygdala, interpeduncular nucleus, raphe nuclei, and hippocampus. Cerebral cortex shows expression in several limbic areas at P6. In the basal ganglia and related nuclei, cadherin-8 is expressed by parts of the striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta, and pedunculopontine nuclei. A third group of cadherin-8-positive gray matter structures has functional connections with the cerebellum (superior colliculus, anterior pretectal nucleus, red nucleus, nucleus of posterior commissure, inferior olive, pontine, pontine reticular, and vestibular nuclei). The cerebellum itself shows parasagittal stripes of cadherin-8 expression in the Purkinje cell layer. In the hindbrain, cadherin-8 is expressed by several cranial nerve nuclei. Results from this study show that cadherin-8 expression in the embryonic and postnatal mouse brain is restricted to specific developing gray matter structures. These data support the idea that cadherins are a family of molecules whose expression provides a molecular code for the regionalization of the developing vertebrate brain.
9345543	Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to identify cortical and subcortical regions involved in the control of reaching to visual targets. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight healthy subjects using H2(15)O PET during the performance of three different tasks. All tasks required central fixation while a 400-ms target was flashed every 5 s at a random location around a virtual circle centered on the fixation target. Additional instructions differed according to the task: (i) visual detection of the target without overt responses; (ii) immediate pointing to the most recent target in the sequence, and (iii) pointing to the previous target in the sequence. By design, the two motor tasks differed in the cognitive processing required. In each trial of immediate pointing, the spatial location of only the most recent target needed to be processed. In each trial of pointing to the previous, instead, while the most recent target was stored in memory for the movement of the next trial, the previous target had to be retrieved from memory to direct the current movement. Limb trajectories were comparable between the two motor tasks in terms of most spatiotemporal parameters examined. Significant rCBF increases were identified using analysis of covariance and t statistics. Compared with visual detection there was activation of primary sensorimotor cortex, ventrolateral precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus in the opercular region, supramarginal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, all these sites in the hemisphere (left) contralateral to the moving limb, and cerebellar vermis, during both immediate pointing and pointing to the previous. During immediate pointing there was additional activation of left inferior parietal lobule close to the intraparietal sulcus, and when compared with pointing to the previous, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. During pointing to the previous, instead, there was additional activation of supplementary motor cortex, anterior and midcingulate, and inferior occipital gyrus in the left hemisphere; superior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior hippocampus in the right hemisphere; lingual gyri and cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally; anterior thalamus; and pulvinar. The activation of two partially distinct cerebral networks in these two motor tasks reflects the different nature of signal processing involved. In particular, the specific activation of intraparietal sulcus and prefrontal cortex in immediate pointing appears characteristic of a network for visuospatial working memory. By contrast, the corticolimbic network engaged in pointing to the previous could mediate spatial attention and the sequence of encoding, recording, and decoding of spatial memories required by a dual task with two competing targets.
9348334	The potent neurotrophic factor glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of proteins. We report a transcription factor that is the first nuclear protein known to be induced by GDNF, thus designated murine GDNF inducible factor (mGIF). The cDNA was cloned in the course of investigating transcription factors that bind to Sp1 consensus sequences, using the in situ filter detection method, and it was found to encode a protein having the same C2-H2 zinc finger motif as Sp1. Sequence analysis indicated that mGIF is homologous to the human TGF-beta inducible early gene (TIEG) and human early growth response gene-alpha (EGR-alpha). mGIF is widely distributed in the adult mouse with high mRNA levels in kidney, lung, brain, liver, heart, and testis. In the adult brain, mGIF is abundantly expressed in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and amygdala with lower amounts in striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, thalamus, and substantia nigra. During development, mGIF mRNA also has a wide distribution, including in cerebral cortex, cerebellar primordium, kidney, intestine, liver, and lung. GDNF induces the expression of mGIF rapidly and transiently both in a neuroblastoma cell line and in primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical neurons. Co-transfection of the Drosophila SL2 cells using mGIF expression plasmid and reporter constructs having Sp1 binding sites indicated that mGIF represses transcription from a TATA-containing as well as from a TATA-less promoter. These observations suggest that the zinc finger transcription factor mGIF could be important in mediating some of the biological effects of GDNF.
9348352	During an agonistic encounter, subordinate male hamsters display defensive and submissive postures and show increased secretion of glucocorticoids, whereas dominant males do not. To determine whether specific neuronal pathways are activated during the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses of subordinate males, expression of c-fos mRNA within the brains of subordinate males was compared with the pattern in dominant males after fighting. After 1 week of handling, pairs of hamsters were either swapped between cages (handled control males), or were allowed to interact for 30 min [dominant (DOM) males and subordinate (SUB) males]. A second group of control animals that received no handling or social stimulation (unhandled control males) were also included. After testing, all animals were killed by decapitation, their brains were removed for c-fos in situ hybridization, and trunk blood was collected for analysis of plasma cortisol and corticosterone levels. Exposure of males to their partner's cage for 30 min resulted in increased expression of c-fos mRNA in multiple brain regions. In addition, fighting increased c-fos expression in the medial amygdaloid nucleus of both DOM and SUB males as well as having more selective effects. In DOM males, c-fos expression was elevated within the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In SUB males, c-fos expression increased within a multitude of brain areas, including cingulate cortex, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, several hypothalamic nuclei, central amygdaloid nucleus, amygdalohippocampal area, dorsal periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe, cuneiform nucleus, and locus coeruleus. These findings are discussed in relation to neurocircuits associated with behavioral arousal and stress.
9350512	In altogether seven tree shrews, Tupaia belangeri, the anterograde projections of the motorcortical tongue area were investigated as part of a larger comparative study. Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Three different tracers were used: biotin-conjugated dextranamine (BDA), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and 3H-leucine. Intracortical projections were found to the motor cortex around the injection site, the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, the homologues of the primate frontoparietal operculum and insula, the anterior cingulate and agrannular retrosplenial cortex, the somatosensory and bordering inferior parietal cortex as well as to the perirhinal cortex. Except the very weak projections into the retrosplenial, posterior parietal and perirhinal region which were ipsilateral, all other projections were bilateral. Subcortically, there was a projection into the ventral putamen, rostrodorsal claustrum and, very sparsely, into the caudate nucleus. In the thalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei reticularis, anteroventralis, anteromedialis, ventralis lateralis, ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis posterior inferior, medialis dorsalis, in the intralaminar nuclei paracentralis, centralis lateralis, centrum medianum and parafascicularis, in the midline thalamus and in the nuclei posterior and pulvinaris. Further diencephalic projections, however all of them wak, could be traced into the zona incerta, dorsolateral subthalamus, dorsomedial, lateral and supraoptic hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the lateral superior colliculus, in the bordering reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal grey. In the lower brain-stem, fibres ended in the griseum pontis, dorsolateral reticular formation, principal and spinal trigeminal nucleus and, sparsely, in the lateral parabrachial region, solitary tract nucleus, inferior olive and magnocellular reticular formation. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus. The projection system revealed with PHA-L was less extensive than that demonstrated with BDA and 3H-leucine, both of which were similar.
9355037	Using quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH), we determined the effect of castration on single cell levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA in discrete hypothalamic regions of the male rat brain associated with the control of gonadotropin secretion. A 48-base oligodeoxynucleotide probe was used to detect with equal affinity the two isoforms of GAD message, GAD65 and GAD67. GAD message also was quantitated in a number of selected areas of the brain to contrast GAD gene expression amongst several populations of GABAergic neurons. Comparison of 11 brain regions demonstrated a 9.3-fold range in the quantity of single cell GAD mRNA with levels being highest in the amygdala and the diagonal band of Broca, moderate in the piriform cortex, caudate nucleus, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex and medial septal nucleus, and lowest in the lateral septal nucleus and the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN). Castration markedly reduced single cell GAD mRNA levels in the DBB and the MPN, two discrete hypothalamic structures known to contain dendritic fields, cell bodies, and axons of GnRH neurons projecting to the median eminence. A striking finding was a dense core of steroid-sensitive GABAergic neurons within the MPN comprising the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA). Similar to the MPN as a whole, the amount of GAD mRNA expressed by cells in the SDN-POA of sham operated control rats was greater than in castrated animals. GAD mRNA levels were inversely related to serum LH titers, suggesting a role for these neurons in the mechanism controlling gonadal steroid negative feedback on LH secretion. This report provides the basis for future work to determine if GAD65, GAD67 or whether both isoforms are affected by gonadal steroid input.
9369318	Glutamate is the principal excitatory transmitter of the mammalian brain and plays a particularly important role in the physiology of the basal ganglia structures responsible for movement regulation. Using in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes, we examined the expression patterns of the five known kainate type glutamate receptor subunit genes, KA1, KA2 and GluR5-7, in the basal ganglia of adult and developing rat brain. In the adult rat, a highly organized and selective pattern of expression of the kainate subunits was observed in the basal ganglia and associated structures as well as in other regions of the brain. KA2 mRNA was abundant in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta, and was present at lower levels in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Neither KA1 nor GluR5 expression was observed in the basal ganglia of adult rats, although these messages were present in other regions. GluR6 was highly expressed in the striatum and subthalamic nucleus and to a lesser extent in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, while no hybridization signal was detectable in the large, presumably dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, GluR7 was strongly expressed in the substantia nigra pars compacta, was present at lower levels in the striatum, globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, and was not detectable in the subthalamic nucleus. During postnatal development, expression of the kainate receptor subunits was characteristically highest on postnatal day 1 and declined to adult levels by day 20; however, in the globus pallidus we did observe the transient expression of KA1 and GluR5 between day 1 and day 10. These results demonstrate that the neuronal structures comprising the basal ganglia express a distinct combination of kainate receptor subunit genes, suggesting that the pharmacological properties of the resultant glutamate receptors are likely to be regionally specific. The organization of expression of these genes is established early in life, which is consistent with the important role they may play in establishing the functions of the motor system.
9375969	1. The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the NK3 tachykinin receptor agonist, senktide (10 nmol each side), in guinea-pigs pretreated with the selective NK3 tachykinin receptor antagonist, SR142801 (3 mg kg(-1) subcutaneous, s.c., 30 min before senktide), or its less active enantiomer, SR142806 (3 mg kg(-1) s.c. 30 min before senktide), on behaviour and on the distribution of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in central neurones were investigated. Guinea-pigs were chosen for the study since they possess NK3 tachykinin receptors with pharmacological characteristics similar to those in man. 2. Wet-dog shakes, but not locomotor activity, elicited by senktide i.c.v. were significantly reduced by SR142801 but not by SR142806, confirming the involvement of NK3 tachykinin receptors in wet-dog shake behaviour. 3. Senktide induced increased numbers of Fos-LI neurones in the following brain areas: frontal, parietal and piriform cortex, the lateral septum, the CA1, CA2, subiculum and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, most areas in the amygdala, thalamus and hypothalamus, medial geniculate nucleus and the ventral cochlear nucleus. Pretreatment with SR142801, but not with SR142806, before administration of senktide inhibited Fos-LI expression in the cingulate cortex, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, some regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala and the ventral cochlear nucleus. 4. The present results are the first demonstration that senktide induces Fos-LI in widespread areas of the guinea-pig brain. It is proposed that NK3 tachykinin receptors may play a more extensive role in the control of diverse brain functions, including cortical processing, learning and memory, neuroendocrine and behavioural regulation, than is currently recognized.
9378850	We have used in situ hybridization to characterize the ontogeny of alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit mRNA expression in rat brain. Transcripts for both subunits were detected in embryonic brain, although overlapping expression of alpha3 mRNA was only evident in areas of strong beta4 mRNA expression, including the medial habenula, locus coeruleus, the cerebellar primordium, and several motor and sensory brainstem nuclei. During the perinatal period, the independent expression of alpha3 mRNA declined, and greater correspondence in the temporal and spatial expression of alpha3 and beta4 subunit mRNAs emerged. In general, beta4 mRNA expression preceded that of alpha3 mRNA by 1 to 2 days. Overlapping expression patterns were transiently detected in the caudate putamen, basal forebrain, frontal and visual cortices, and in the CA3 field of hippocampus. Codistribution that lasted throughout development and into adulthood was noted in a number of brain areas, including the retrosplenial cortex, subiculum, medial habenula, interpeduncular nucleus, locus coeruleus, and brainstem motor nuclei. In many of these regions, alpha5 subunit mRNA was also expressed. Colocalization of alpha3 and beta4 mRNAs with choline acetyltransferase mRNA was detected in cholinergic neurons of the brainstem motor nuclei, nucleus ambiguus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, motor trigeminal nucleus, and facial nucleus, but not in most forebrain cholinergic cells. The extensive correspondence in temporal and spatial distribution of alpha3 and beta4 mRNAs throughout postnatal brain development suggests that these subunits may be coordinately regulated and may form functional neuronal nAChRs with significant developmental roles.
9388012	Estrogen plays a profound role in regulating the structure and function of many neuronal systems in the adult rat brain. The actions of estrogen were thought to be mediated by a single nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) until the recent cloning of a novel ER (ER-beta). To ascertain which ER is involved in the regulation of different brain regions, the present study compared the distribution of the classical (ER-alpha) and novel (ER-beta) forms of ER mRNA-expressing neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat with in situ hybridization histochemistry. Female rat brain, spinal cord, and eyes were frozen, and cryostat sections were collected on slides, hybridized with [35S]-labeled antisense riboprobes complimentary to ER-alpha or ER-beta mRNA, stringently washed, and opposed to emulsion. The results of these studies revealed the presence of ER-alpha and ER-beta mRNA throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the brain and spinal cord. Neurons of the olfactory bulb, supraoptic, paraventricular, suprachiasmatic, and tuberal hypothalamic nuclei, zona incerta, ventral tegmental area, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), laminae III-V, VIII, and IX of the spinal cord, and pineal gland contained exclusively ER-beta mRNA. In contrast, only ER-alpha hybridization signal was seen in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and subfornical organ. Perikarya in other brain regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, preoptic area, lateral habenula, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, locus ceruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus and superficial laminae of the spinal cord, contained both forms of ER mRNA. Although the cerebral cortex and hippocampus contained both ER mRNAs, the hybridization signal for ER-alpha mRNA was very weak compared with ER-beta mRNA. The results of these in situ hybridization studies provide detailed information about the distribution of ER-alpha and ER-beta mRNAs in the rat CNS. In addition, this comparative study provides evidence that the region-specific expression of ER-alpha, ER-beta, or both may be important in determining the physiological responses of neuronal populations to estrogen action.
9389555	Neurons in the hypothalamus of estrogen receptor alpha-knockout (ER alphaKO) mice have been shown to concentrate radiolabeled estrogen and estrogen treatment regulates the expression of progesterone receptor mRNA. The purpose of the present study was to utilize in situ hybridization histochemistry to determine the anatomical distribution of ER beta mRNA in ER alphaKO mouse forebrain. The results of these studies revealed an extensive distribution of ER beta mRNA in the hypothalamic regions including medial preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, medial tuberal nucleus, and the premammillary nuclei. Additional labeled perikarya were also detected in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb; tenia tecta; anterior septum; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; medial, basolateral and cortical nuclei of the amygdala; cerebral and entorhinal cortex; the septohippocampal nucleus; Ammon's horn of the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe. The results of these in situ hybridization histochemical studies have provided novel information about the distribution of ER beta mRNA in the ER alphaKO mouse forebrain. In addition, these morphological data provides evidence that estrogen may exert its actions in the ER alphaKO mouse brain via ER beta and thereby maintain organizational and activational effects.
9390761	Estrogen has been considered as a key substance that induces sexual differentiation of the brain during fetal and neonatal life in the rat. Thus, to define the brain regions involved in the brain sexual differentiation, we examined the regions where the estrogen receptor (ER) is located in the developing rat brain. We examined immunohistochemical distribution of the cells containing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) in the preoptic region, the diencephalon, and the amygdala in male and female rats on postnatal days 1-35 (PD1-PD35). The antibody used recognizes ER-alpha equally well for both occupied and unoccupied forms. ER-alpha immunostaining was restricted to the cell nuclei of specific cell groups. In PD1 rats, ER-alpha-immunoreactive (ER-IR) signals were detected in the lateral septum, the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis, the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), the median preoptic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus, the lateral habenula, the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala nucleus, the posterior part of the cortical amygdala nucleus, the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH), the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, and the posterior hypothalamic periventricular nucleus. The distribution pattern of ER-IR cells in the newborn rat was much the same as that in the adult in the preoptic-hypothalamic and amygdala regions. Moreover, the signals in the MPN and the VMH were stronger in the female than in the male, perhaps reflecting the ability ofestrogen generated by aromatization of testosterone in the male to down-regulate the ER signal. Thus, the brain regions showing sex differences may be sites of sexual differentiation of the brain by aromatizable androgen during the neonatal period.
9392450	The regional distribution of metallothionein (MT), zinc and copper was measured in brains of transgenic MT-I overexpressor (MT-I*) mice, MT-I/MT-II gene knockout (MT-I/MT-II null) mice, and in brains of control C57BL/6J mice with normal MT expression. Toxic milk (tx) mutant mice with abnormally high MT and copper accumulation were also assessed. Although there were significant differences in MT levels (assessed by a cadmium-binding assay) in whole brain of MT-I/MT-II null and control mice (16.5 +/- 2.9 microg/g vs 25.6 +/- 7.4 microg/g), different regions of the brain (cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, thalamus plus hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem) contained similar amounts of MT. Male MT-I* mice had significantly higher whole brain MT level than controls (35.5 +/- 8.1 microg/g vs 25.6 +/- 7.4 microg/g), and had a 2-fold higher MT level in cerebellum, but not in other brain regions. Female MT-I* mice had significantly increased MT levels in all brain regions, with the highest increase in cerebellum (3.5-fold), and the lowest increase in cortex (2-fold). MT level in whole brain of female MT-I* mice was also significantly higher than that of male MT-I* (75.2 +/- 8.0 microg/g vs 35.4 +/- 8.1 microg/g). Toxic milk mice had significantly higher MT levels in all brain regions compared to age-matched controls (51.8 +/- 10.8 microg/g vs 30.3 +/- 5.8 microg/g), while no specific region of tx mouse brain showed a preferential increase in MT. In MT-I* and MT-I/MT-II null mice, altered MT levels did not always result in altered zinc and/or copper concentrations. However, all mouse strains exhibited region-specific accumulation of zinc, with the highest level in hippocampus. In control, MT-I/MT-II null, and male MT-I* mice, the hippocampus accumulated the highest level of copper. However, MT-I/MT-II null and both male and female MT-I* mice had similar levels of copper, compared to control mice. Toxic milk mice, on the other hand, had significantly higher copper levels in cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, thalamus/hypothalamus, and brain stem, compared to control mice. Zinc levels in corpus striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum were also significantly increased. These data indicate that, in normal control and MT-I/MT-II null mice, MT is expressed uniformly in different regions of the brain. MT-I* mice, on the other hand, exhibit regional and gender-associated change in brain MT, and tx mice have markedly increased MT, copper, and zinc levels in most brain regions. These mouse strains will be useful models in elucidating the role of MT in the pathological effects of altered zinc and copper in brain.
9406940	The in situ hybridization technique was used to examine the expression of type 2 interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R2) mRNA in the rat brain following the systemic injection of kainic acid at a convulsive dose. The expression of IL-1R2 mRNA was not detected in any brain regions of the saline-injected control rats. 8 h after the systemic injection of kainic acid, weak expression of IL-1R2 mRNA was observed in the dentate gyrus and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. At 12 and 24 h after the injection of kainic acid, IL-1R2 mRNA was markedly induced in various brain regions including the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, piniform cortex, claustrum, tenia tecta, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, tuberal magnocellular nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. In these regions, the signals of IL-1R2 mRNA were observed on likely neuronal cells. Around the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, dispersed intense signals were observed on the non-neuronal cells. In addition, the expression of the mRNA on the venules was observed at 12 h. The strength of signals significantly decreased by 48 h after the injection. These findings revealed the spatiotemporal induction of IL-1R2 mRNA in the rat brain following the systemic administration of kainic acid, which has shown to cause neuronal degeneration, suggesting the pathological roles of IL-1R2 in the brain.
9414010	The circadian timing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is modulated by its neural inputs. In the present study, we examine the organization of the neural inputs to the rat SCN using both retrograde and anterograde tracing methods. After Fluoro-Gold injections into the SCN, retrogradely labeled neurons are present in a number of brain areas, including the infralimbic cortex, the lateral septum, the medial preoptic area, the subfornical organ, the paraventricular thalamus, the subparaventricular zone, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the posterior hypothalamic area, the intergeniculate leaflet, the olivary pretectal nucleus, the ventral subiculum, and the median raphe nuclei. In the anterograde tracing experiments, we observe three patterns of afferent termination within the SCN that correspond to the photic/raphe, limbic/hypothalamic, and thalamic inputs. The median raphe projection to the SCN terminates densely within the ventral subdivision and sparsely within the dorsal subdivision. Similarly, areas that receive photic input, such as the retina, the intergeniculate leaflet, and the pretectal area, densely innervate the ventral SCN but provide only minor innervation of the dorsal SCN. A complementary pattern of axonal labeling, with labeled fibers concentrated in the dorsal SCN, is observed after anterograde tracer injections into the hypothalamus and into limbic areas, such as the ventral subiculum and infralimbic cortex. A third, less common pattern of labeling, exemplified by the paraventricular thalamic afferents, consists of diffuse axonal labeling throughout the SCN. Our results show that the SCN afferent connections are topographically organized. These hodological differences may reflect a functional heterogeneity within the SCN.
9416926	Endothelin (ET) was originally identified as a vasoactive peptide biosynthesized in vascular endothelial cells. Because ET has also been found in the brain as a neuropeptide, it has been thought to belong to the group of brain-vascular peptide hormones. To date, type A and type B receptors for ET have been found. To elucidate the topographic distribution of type A receptor (ET-AR) in the brain, we raised a specific antibody to the C-terminal (64 amino acids) peptide of rat ET-AR and immunostained rat brain sections with this antibody. Immunoreactivity for ET-AR was detected in neuronal cell bodies and also in the many proximal and some distal parts of their fibers. Nerve cell bodies containing strong ET-AR-immunoreactivity were distributed in the lateral part of the reticular formation, the nucleus of the solitary tract and its surrounding area, the dorsal midline area and medial longitudinal fasciculus, the subependymal layer of the fourth ventricular roof, the caudolateral area of the pontine tegmentum, the locus coeruleus, the rostral pontine area of the lateral reticular formation, the retrorubral area, the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmental area, the periventricular region lateral to the rostral mesencephalic aqueduct and caudal third ventricle, the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, the caudomedial area of the zona incerta, the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the parvocellular portion of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and the periglomerular region of the olfactory bulb. In addition, the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex, the nerve cells in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, and the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei showed weak immunoreactivity. The distribution of highly ET-AR-immunoreactive neurons is quite similar to that ofcatecholamine neurons.
9425263	RGS proteins (regulators of G protein signaling) are a newly identified group of proteins that negatively regulate G proteins. Some, including RGS4, have been shown to act as GTPase-activating proteins for several members of the Gi alpha subunits and the Gq alpha subunit. However, the signaling pathways of G protein-coupled receptors regulated by RGS4 are not well understood. We isolated the mouse RGS4 cDNA to investigate the roles of RGS4 protein in mouse brain. Expression of mouse RGS4 in yeast stimulated adaptation to mating pheromone, suggesting that it negatively regulates that G protein-mediated signaling pathway. Northern blot analysis of various mouse tissues revealed that RGS4 is expressed at high levels in brain, moderately low levels in heart, and very low levels in lung, liver, and skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization of mouse brain showed RGS4 mRNA mainly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, islands of Calleja, substantia nigra, amygdala, the granular layer of cerebellum, middle cerebellar peduncle, and perifacial zone. These results suggest that RGS4 is expressed in various types of cells in the brain and may regulate multiple G protein-mediated signaling pathways.
9437715	Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) exerts its biological effects through interaction with two high affinity receptors named the VIP1- and the VIP2 receptors. Their messenger RNAs have been mapped in rat brain by in situ hybridization. A cyclic peptide (RO 25-1553) and a secretion analogue ([R16]chicken secretin) were identified as selective agonist peptides for the VIP2- and VIP1 receptors, respectively. The iodinated peptides retained the high affinity and selectivity of the unlabelled peptides and were used for the mapping of each receptor subclass in rat brain. VIP1 receptors were present in the cerebral cortex, the piriform cortex, the claustrum, the caudate-putamen, the dentate gyrus, the lateral amygdaloïd nucleus, the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, the rhomboïd nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus and the choroïd plexus. VIP2 receptors were present in the cerebral cortex, the claustrum, the caudate-putamen, the nucleus accumbens, the lateral septal nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the basolateral amygdaloïd nucleus, the Ammon's horn, the thalamic nuclei except some centromedial nuclei, the medial habenula, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the periventricular nucleus, the mammilary nucleus, the superior colliculus and the choroïd plexus.
9438801	Experiment 1 examined whether microinjections of morphine (1 microg in 0.5 microl over 1 min x 2 pairings) into 13 different CNS sites produced a conditioned place preference (CPP). Injections into the lateral ventricles (LV), ventral tegmental area (VTA), or periaqueductal gray (PAG) produced a CPP; injections 1 mm dorsal to the PAG or VTA, or into the caudate putamen, medial frontal cortex, hippocampus, lateral nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, posterior hypothalamus, ventral palladium, or nucleus accumbens septi (core or shell) did not. In Experiment 2, morphine 0.2 microg produced a CPP when injected into the VTA but not in the PAG, while 5.0 microg was effective in both sites. The CPP induced by systemic morphine (4 mg/kg x 1 pairing) was blocked by naloxone methiodide (NM) injected (2 nmol in 0.5 microl) into the VTA. PAG injections of 2 nmol reduced, and 5 nmol NM eliminated, the CPP. The results confirm that morphine injections into the VTA or the PAG are rewarding, that blockade of opioid receptors in either site disrupts a morphine-induced CPP, and that the VTA is more sensitive to both effects.
9443842	Limbic system influences on motor behavior seem widespread, and could range from the initiation of action to the motivational pace of motor output. Motor abnormalities are also a common feature of psychiatric illness. Several subcortical limbic-motor entry points have been defined in recent years, but cortical entry points are understood poorly, despite the fact that a part of the limbic lobe, the cingulate motor cortex (area 24c or M3, and area 23c or M4), contributes axons to the corticospinal pathway. Using retrograde and anterograde tracers in rhesus monkeys, we investigated the ipsilateral limbic input to area 24c and adjacent area 23c. Limbic cortical input to areas 24c and 23c arise from cingulate areas 24a, 24b, 23a, 23b, and 32, retrosplenial areas 30 and 29, and temporal areas 35, TF and TH. Areas 24c and 23c were also interconnected strongly. The dysgranular part of the orbitofrontal cortex and insula projects primarily to area 24c while the granular part of the orbitofrontal cortex and insula projects primarily to area 23c. Afferents from cingulate area 25, the retrocalcarine cortex, temporal pole, entorhinal cortex, parasubiculum, and the medial part of area TH target primarily or only area 24c. Our findings indicate that a variety of telencephalic limbic afferents converge on cortex lining the lower bank and fundus of the anterior part of the cingulate sulcus. Because it is known that this cortex gives rise to axons ending in the spinal cord, facial nucleus, pontine gray, red nucleus, putamen, and primary and supplementary motor cortices, we suggest that the cingulate motor cortex forms a strategic cortical entry point for limbic influence on the voluntary motor system.
9460086	1. Sexual dimorphism of human brain anatomy has not been well-studied between 4 and 18 years of age, a time of emerging sex differences in behavior and the sexually specific hormonal changes of adrenarche (the predominantly androgenic augmentation of adrenal cortex function occurring at approximately age 8) and puberty. 2. To assess sex differences in brain structures during this developmental period volumes of the cerebrum, lateral ventricles, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus temporal lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus, and midsagittal area measurements of the corpus callosum were quantified from brain magnetic resonance images of 121 healthy children and adolescent and examined in relation to age and sex. 3. Males had a 9% larger cerebral volume. When adjusted for cerebral volume by ANCOVA only the basal ganglia demonstrated sex differences in mean volume with the caudate being relatively larger in females and the globus pallidus being relatively larger in males. The lateral ventricles demonstrated a prominent sex difference in brain maturation with robust increases in size in males only. A piecewise-linear model revealed a significant change in the linear regression slope of lateral ventricular volume in males after age 11 that was not shared by females at that or other ages. 4. Amygdala and hippocampal volume increased for both sexes but with the amygdala increasing significantly more in males than females and hippocampal volume increasing more in females. 5. These sexually dimorphic patterns of brain development may be related to the observed sex differences in age of onset, prevalence, and symptomatology seen in nearly all neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood.
9460758	In this study, c-fos immunohistochemistry was used to identify the brain regions activated by rewarding brain stimulation in rats. Rats had monopolar electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle and were allocated to either a self-stimulation (n = 4), yoked stimulation (n = 4) or no stimulation (n = 6) group. In a single 1 h test session, each rat in the self-stimulation group made 1000 nose poke responses with each response followed by a 0.5 s train of brain stimulation. Rats in the yoked-stimulation group were paired with a partner in the self-stimulation group and received brain stimulation whenever their partner did. However, their nose poke responses did not trigger stimulation. This yoked procedure was thus used to identify any Fos-like immunoreactivity due to operant responding. Rats in the no stimulation group were placed in the same apparatus as the other rats but received no brain stimulation and were thus used to assess baseline Fos-like immunoreactivity. Results showed that stimulation increased Fos-like immunoreactivity in many areas of the brain in both the self-stimulation and yoked groups. The areas with the highest Fos-like immunoreactivity were ipsilateral to the electrode site and included the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral septum, nucleus accumbens (shell), the medial and lateral preoptic areas, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central amygdala, lateral habenula, dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus and the anterior ventral tegmental area. Bilateral Fos-like immunoreactivity was evident in the nucleus accumbens core, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the retrorubral fields and the locus coeruleus. A double-labelling procedure identifying both Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to show that very few (< 5%) of the A10 dopamine cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area expressed Fos following brain stimulation. In contrast, most of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (A6), rubrospinal tract (A5) and pontine tegmental area (A7) were Fos positive. Overall, the results show that rewarding, brain stimulation induces Fos-like immunoreactivity in many forebrain regions but only sparsely in mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurons. The similar patterns of Fos-like immunoreactivity seen in the self-stimulation and yoked-stimulation groups suggests that the operant responding for brain stimulation causes minimal Fos expression in itself.
9466399	An influence of the prefrontal cortex on noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons would have profound implications for the function of the locus coeruleus system. Although the medial prefrontal cortex does not substantially innervate the core of the nucleus locus coeruleus, evidence indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex projects to regions containing locus coeruleus dendrites; indirect medial prefrontal cortex-locus coeruleus projections are also possible. Here, we examined influences of prefrontal cortex activity on locus coeruleus firing rates by activating or inactivating the medial prefrontal cortex while recording impulse activity of locus coeruleus neurons extracellularly in anaesthetized rats. Most of our electrical stimulation experiments were conducted in rats which underwent lesions of the ascending dorsal bundle of noradrenergic fibres from the locus coeruleus to eliminate locus coeruleus projections to the prefrontal cortex, because antidromic activation of locus coeruleus from the prefrontal cortex affects even non-driven locus coeruleus neurons through collaterals. Single pulse stimulation (1 mA, 0.3-0.5 ms) of the dorsomedial (frontal region 2) or prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex synaptically activated 13/16 (81%) or 16/56 (29%) locus coeruleus neurons, respectively. Train stimulation (20 Hz for 0.5 s) synaptically activated greater percentages of locus coeruleus cells, 11/12 cells (92%) for the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and 41/50 cells (82%) for the prelimbic cortex. No inhibitory responses in the locus coeruleus were obtained with dorsomedial prefrontal stimulation, and weak inhibition was found in 16% of locus coeruleus cells with prelimbic stimulation. Electrical stimulation of more lateral frontal cortex (Fr1 area) had no effects on locus coeruleus activity. Chemical stimulation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex with L-glutamate (10 or 100 mM) or D,L-homocysteic acid (10 mM) phasically activated 15/26 (55%) locus coeruleus cells, and 15/68 cells (22%) with prelimbic stimulation; such activation was sometimes followed by long-lasting oscillatory activity. No locus coeruleus cells exhibited purely inhibitory responses with chemical stimulation of any prefrontal cortex site. Inactivation of the dorsomedial or prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex with lidocaine microinjection (2%, 180 or 300 nl) reduced locus coeruleus firing rates in 6/10 (60%) or 7/19 (37%) locus coeruleus cells, respectively. In no case did lidocaine in any prefrontal cortex site activate a locus coeruleus neuron. These results indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex provides a potent excitatory influence on locus coeruleus neurons. The fact that inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex suppressed locus coeruleus firing indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex also provides a resting tonic excitatory influence on locus coeruleus activity.
9466440	In order to develop another selective marker for cholinergic cell bodies and fibres, we have raised a highly specific polyclonal antibody against a peptide derived from the C-terminus of a recently cloned putative vesicular acetylcholine transporter. This antibody recognizes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter protein on western blots of membranes from transfected monkey fibroblast COS cells as well as from various rat brain regions but not from untransfected COS cells or rat liver. In separate mapping studies, the antibody was found to stain cell bodies and fibres in all of the regions of the nervous system known to be cholinergic, including (i) the various nuclei of the basal nuclear complex and their projections to the hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral cortex, (ii) the caudate-putamen nucleus, accumbens nucleus, olfactory tubercle, and islands of Calleja complex, (iii) the medial habenula, (iv) the mesopontine cholinergic complex and its projections to the thalamus, extrapyramidal motor nuclei, basal forebrain, cingulate cortex, raphe and reticular nuclei, and some cranial nerve nuclei, and (v) the somatic motor and autonomic nuclei of the cranial and spinal nerves. In many of these cholinergic neurons, it is possible to detect immunoreactivity for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter in proximal portions of processes and their branches, as well as in numerous puncta in close association with them. Some of these puncta are large and surround cell bodies and processes of neurons in several regions, including the somatic motor neurons of cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem and in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Double immunofluorescence studies indicated that neurons positive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter also stained for the biosynthetic enzyme of acetylcholine, choline acetyltransferase. We conclude that antibody against the C-terminus of the putative vesicular acetylcholine transporter provides another marker for cholinergic neurons that, unlike in situ hybridization procedures, labels terminals as well as cell bodies. Therefore this antibody has the potential to reveal changes in number and morphology of cholinergic cell bodies and their terminal varicosities that occur in both physiologic and pathologic conditions.
9466454	The similar pharmacology of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, and the lack of selective compounds sufficiently distinguishing between the two receptor subtypes, have hampered functional studies on these receptors. In order to provide clues for differential functional roles of the two subtypes, we performed a parallel localization study throughout the guinea-pig brain and the trigeminal ganglia by means of quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry (using [35S]-labelled riboprobes probes for receptor messenger RNA) and receptor autoradiography (using a new radioligand [3H]alniditan). The anatomical patterns of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor messenger RNA were quite different. While 5-HT1B receptor messenger RNA was abundant throughout the brain (with highest levels in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampal formation, amygdala, thalamus, dorsal raphe and cerebellum), 5-HT1D receptor messenger RNA exhibited a more restricted pattern; it was found mainly in the olfactory tubercle, entorhinal cortex, dorsal raphe, cerebellum, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and in the trigeminal ganglion. The density of 5-HT(1B/1D) binding sites (combined) obtained with [3H]alniditan autoradiography was high in the substantia nigra, superior colliculus and globus pallidus, whereas lower levels were detected in the caudate-putamen, hypothalamus, hippocampal formation, amygdala, thalamus and central gray. This distribution pattern was indistinguishable from specific 5-HT1B receptor labelling in the presence of ketanserin under conditions to occlude 5-HT1D receptor labelling; hence the latter were below detection level. Relationships between the regional distributions of the receptor messenger RNAs and binding sites and particular neuroanatomical pathways are discussed with respect to possible functional roles of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.
9472392	The anatomical distribution and density of cannabinoid receptors in the human brain was studied in one fetal (33 weeks gestation), two neonatal (aged three to six months) and eight adult (aged 21-81 years) human cases using quantitative receptor autoradiography following in vitro labelling of sections with the synthetic cannabinoid agonist [3H]CP55,940. Cannabinoid receptors were distributed in a heterogeneous fashion throughout the adult human brain and spinal cord. The allocortex contained very high concentrations of cannabinoid receptor binding sites in the dentate gyrus, Ammons's horn and subiculum of the hippocampal formation; high concentrations of receptors were also present in the entorhinal cortex and amygdaloid complex. Cannabinoid receptor binding sites were also present throughout all regions of the neocortex, where they showed a marked variation in density between the primary, secondary and associational cortical regions: the greatest densities of receptors were present in the associational cortical regions of the frontal and limbic lobes, with moderate densities in the secondary sensory and motor cortical regions, and with the lowest densities of receptors in the primary sensory and motor cortical regions. Relatively high concentrations of cannabinoid receptors were consistently seen in cortical regions of the left (dominant) hemisphere, known to be associated with verbal language functions. In all of the cortical regions, the pattern and density of receptor labelling followed the neocortical laminar organization, with the greatest density of receptors localized in two discrete bands--a clearly delineated narrow superficial band which coincided with lamina I and a deeper broader, conspicuous band of labelling which corresponded to laminae V and VI. Labelling in the intervening cortical laminae (II-IV) showed lower densities, with a well delineated narrow band of label in the middle of laminae IV in the associational cortical regions. The thalamus showed a distinctive heterogeneous distribution of cannabinoid receptors, with the highest concentration of receptors localized in the mediodorsal nucleus, anterior nuclear complex, and in the midline and intralaminar complex of nuclei, i.e. in thalamic nuclei which have connectional affiliations with the associational cortical areas. The basal ganglia showed a distinctive heterogeneous pattern of receptor binding, with the very highest concentrations in the globus pallidus internus, moderate concentrations in the globus pallidus externus and ventral pallidum, and moderately low levels of binding throughout the striatal complex. In the midbrain, some of the highest levels of cannabinoid receptor binding sites in the human brain were present in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, with very low levels of labelling in all other midbrain areas. The highest densities of cannabinoid receptor binding in the hindbrain were localized in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, with moderate densities of receptors in the nucleus of the solitary tract. The spinal cord showed very low levels of receptor binding. Studies on the distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the fetal and neonatal human brain showed similar patterns of receptor distribution to that observed in the adult human brain, except that the density of receptor binding was generally markedly higher, especially in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. The pattern of cannabinoid receptor labelling in the striatum showed a striking patchy pattern of organization which was especially conspicuous in the fetal brain. These results show that cannabinoid receptor binding sites in the human brain are localized mainly in: forebrain areas associated with higher cognitive functions; forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain areas associated with the control of movement; and in hindbrain areas associated with the control of motor and sensory functions of the autonomic nervous system.

9473561	Regional distribution of neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase mRNA in the rat brain was examined by non-radioisotopic in situ hybridization, using digoxigenin-labeled complementary RNA probes. Clustering of intensely positive neurons was observed in discrete areas including the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, the islands of Calleja, the amygdala, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, several hypothalamic nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the magnocellular nucleus of the posterior commissure, the superior and inferior colliculi, the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the cerebellum. Strongly-stained isolated neurons were scattered mainly in the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia and the brain stem, especially the medulla reticular formation. In the hippocampus, an almost uniform distribution of moderately stained neurons was observed in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the Ammon's horn, while more intensely stained isolated neurons were scattered over the entire hippocampal region. These observations can serve as a good basis for studies on function and gene regulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase.
9473588	Considerable attention has been given to the association of the D3 dopamine receptor subtype and limbic function based on the abundant localization of D3 receptor sites and mRNA expression in the islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens in experimental animals. Though most human anatomical studies have focused on the role of D3 receptors in limited brain structures, detailed information about the overall anatomical organization of the D3 receptor in the human brain is still, however, not available. In the current study, we examined the anatomical distribution of D3 receptor mRNA expression at different levels of the human brain in whole hemisphere horizontal cryosections using in situ hybridization. This approach made it possible to establish for the first time the wide and heterogenous expression of the D3 receptor gene throughout the human brain. As expected, the most abundant D3 mRNA expression levels were found in the islands of Calleja and discrete cell cluster populations within the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens region. High levels were also evident within the dentate gyrus and striate cortex. Low to moderate D3 mRNA expression levels were apparent in most brain areas including all other cortical regions (highest in the anterior cingulate/subcallosal gyrus), caudate nucleus, putamen, anterior and medial thalamic nucleus, mammillary body, amygdala, hippocampal CA region, lateral geniculate body, substantia nigra pars compacta, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. While the current anatomical map of D3 receptor mRNA expression in the human brain does confirm previous reports that D3 receptors may play important roles in limbic-related functions such as emotion and cognition, the findings also suggest other non-limbic functions for D3 mRNA-expressing cell populations such as processing of motor and sensory information.
9477156	Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) comprise part of the cyclic metabolic pathway to produce nitric oxide (NO). ASS is one of the arginine synthesis enzymes which synthesizes argininosuccinate from aspartate and citrulline, and NOS forms NO and citrulline from arginine. This study examines the localization of ASS and NOS in the cat hypothalamus using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry and immunohistochemistry against ASS and NOS. NADPH-d positive and/or ASS-immunoreactive neurons were localized in the following areas: the anterior hypothalamic area, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the periventricular complex, the paraventricular nucleus, the parvocellular nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsal hypothalamic area, the posterior hypothalamic area, and the supramammillary nucleus. NOS and ASS double-labeled neurons were found in the anterior hypothalamic area, the supraoptic nucleus, the central part of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamic area, ventral part of the parvocellular hypothalamic nucleus, the posterior hypothalamic area, and the supramammillary nucleus. Double-labeled neurons in the hypothalamus comprised 20.7-32.0% of ASS-immunoreactive neurons and 10.2-26.3% of NOS-immunoreactive neurons. The results suggest the existence of the 'NO cycle' in situ and the physiological importance of NO and argininosuccinate in several regions of the cat hypothalamus.
9502251	A single microinjection of the cholinergic agonist carbachol into the feline caudolateral parabrachial nucleus produces an immediate increase in state-independent ipsilateral ponto-geniculooccipital waves, followed by a long-term rapid eye movement sleep enhancement lasting 7-10 days. Using retrogradely-transported fluorescent carbachol-conjugated nanospheres and choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry, afferent projections to this injection site for long-term rapid eye movement sleep enhancement were mapped and quantified. Six regions in the brain stem contained retrogradely-labelled cells: the raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and the pontine reticular formation. The retrogradely-labelled (rhodamine+) cells in the pontine reticular formation and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus contributed the predominant input to the parabrachial nucleus injection site (34.3 +/- 5.3% and 28.4 +/- 5.6%, respectively), compared to the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (5.8 +/- 3.8%), parabrachial nucleus (13.5 +/- 3.1%), raphe nuclei (12.9 +/- 2.7%), and locus coeruleus (5.1 +/- 2.4%). By comparison with findings of afferent input to the induction site for short-latency rapid eye movement sleep in the anterodorsal pontine reticular formation, the parabrachial nucleus injection site is characterized by a similar proportion of afferents, except that the raphe nuclei were found to provide more than a two-fold greater input. Retrogradely-labelled neurons quantified in these nuclear regions consisted of 21.5% double-labelled (rhodamine+/choline acetyltransferase+) cholinergic and 78.5% noncholinergic (rhodamine+/choline acetyltransferase-) cells. The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus contributed the predominant (51.7 +/- 8.2%) cholinergic input, compared to laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (20.7 +/- 10.2%), parabrachial nucleus (23.1 +/- 7.5%), and pontine reticular formation (4.4 +/- 2.1%). A comparative analysis of the total retrogradely-labelled cells within each nuclear region which were also double-labelled showed the highest proportion in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (76.2 +/- 7.5%) compared to pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (39.4 +/- 3.6%), parabrachial nucleus (37.3 +/- 2.8%), and pontine reticular formation (3.2 +/- 2.1%). These data indicate that while pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus neurons exert a powerful cholinergic influence on the injection site for long-term rapid eye movement enhancement, a major component of the afferent circuitry is non-cholinergic. Since the non-cholinergic input includes contributions from the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei, it is probable that the caudolateral parabrachial nucleus contains cholinergic and aminergic afferent systems that participate in the long-term enhancement of rapid eye movement sleep.
9502259	The neural mechanisms underlying idiopathic dystonia are currently unknown. Genetic animal models, such as the dt(sz) hamster, a model of idiopathic paroxysmal dystonia, may be helpful to providing insights into the pathophysiology of this common movement disorder. Recent metabolic mapping studies in the hamster model, using 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, demonstrated altered 2-deoxyglucose uptake in motor areas such as the striatum, ventral thalamic nuclei, red nucleus, and deep cerebellar nuclei, during dystonic attacks. Whereas the 2-deoxyglucose method is thought to reflect mainly acute alterations of synaptic activity, determination of cytochrome oxidase activity has been suggested as a method of choice to examine sustained baseline changes in neuronal activity. Therefore, in the present study quantitative cytochrome oxidase histochemistry was used to identify chronic regional alterations in the absence of dystonic attacks in mutant hamsters. For comparison with recent 2-deoxyglucose studies, cytochrome oxidase activity was also determined during a dystonic attack, which was induced by mild stress. Cytochrome oxidase was determined in 109 brain regions of dystonic hamsters and non-dystonic, age-matched control hamsters. In the absence of a dystonic attack, a tendency to decreased cytochrome oxidase activity was found in most brain regions, possibly due to retarded brain development in mutant hamsters. Significant decreases in cytochrome oxidase activity were found in motor areas and limbic structures, such as hippocampus, piriform cortex, fundus striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, ventral pallidum, and interpositus nucleus of the cerebellum. After induction of a dystonic attack, the trend of decreased cytochrome oxidase activity disappeared, except in globus pallidus and interpositus nucleus of the cerebellum. Although the significant alterations in cytochrome oxidase activity in the absence of a dystonic attack were moderate, the data are in line with previous findings in the mutant hamsters, indicating that dysfunctions of the basal ganglia and their output nuclei are involved in the dystonic condition. Altered neural activity in limbic structures, found in the absence of dystonic attacks in mutant hamsters, may contribute to the stress-susceptibility of the animals.
9502813	To characterize further the establishment of the opioid system during prenatal mouse development, we have examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptor mRNAs and find that the expression patterns of these mRNAs are distinct at all ages. Within the embryo, kappa is the first opioid receptor expressed, with transcripts detected in the gut epithelium as early as embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). By E10.5, mu receptor expression is first detected in the facial-vestibulocochlear preganglion complex, whereas delta receptor mRNA is first detected at E12.5 in several peripheral tissues, including the olfactory epithelium, heart, limb bud, and tooth. In the brain, both mu and kappa mRNAs are first detected at E11.5 in the basal ganglia and midbrain, respectively. During mid-gestation and late gestation, the expression of both mu and kappa receptors extends to other brain regions that exhibit high expression in the adult, including the medial habenula, hypothalamus, pons, and medulla for mu and the basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, raphe, and ventral tegmental area for kappa. Thus by E17.5, many aspects of the adult expression patterns of mu and kappa receptors already have been established. Compared with mu and kappa, delta receptor mRNA expression in the brain begins relatively late, and the expression levels remain very low even at E19.5. In contrast to its late appearance in the brain, however, delta is the first opioid receptor expressed in the dorsal root ganglion, at E12.5, before its expression in the spinal cord begins at E15.5. Mu receptor is the first opioid receptor expressed in the spinal cord, at E11.5. These results extend previous ligand-binding data to significantly earlier ages and suggest that early developmental events in both neural and non-neural tissues may be modulated by opioid receptors. Several examples of possible autocrine and paracrine loops of opioid peptide and receptor expression have been identified, suggesting a role for these local circuits in developmental processes.
9507161	Imidazoline (I) receptors have been implicated in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and behavior although their distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) remains in question. Presumptive I- receptor sites were detected in the rat central nervous system with a polyclonal antibody to an imidazoline receptor protein (IRP) with binding characteristics of the native receptor. IRP-like immunoreactivity (LI) was detected in neurons and glia by light and electron microscopy. Spinal cord: processes were heavily labeled in superficial laminae I and II of the dorsal horn, lateral-cervical and -spinal nuclei and sympathetic cell column. Medulla: label was concentrated in the area postrema, rostral, subpostremal and central subnuclei of nucleus tractus solitarii, spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and inferior olivary subnuclei. Visceromotor neurons in the dorsal vagal and ambigual nuclei were surrounded by high concentrations of immunoreactive processes. In reticular formation, label was light, though predominant in the intermediate reticular zone and ventrolateral medulla. Pons: label was detected in the neuropil of the periventricular gray, concentrated in the dorsal- and external-lateral subnuclei of lateral parabrachial nucleus, and present intracellularly in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. Midbrain: IRP-LI was most heavily concentrated in the interpeduncular nucleus, nuclei interfascicularis and rostral-linearis, the subcommissural organ, central gray, and in glia surrounding the cerebral aqueduct. Diencephalon: high densities were detected in the medial habenular nucleus, nucleus paraventricularis thalami, other midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the supramammillary and mediobasal hypothalamic nuclei. In the median eminence, immunolabeled processes were restricted to the lamina interna and lateral subependymal zone. Telencephalon: IRP-LI was concentrated in the central amygdaloid nucleus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and globus pallidus, followed by moderate labeling of the medial amygdaloid nucleus, amygdalostriatal zone and caudoputamen, the hilus of the dentate gyrus, and stratum lacunosum-moleculare of field CA1 of Ammon's horn. The subfornical organ and organum vasculosum lamina terminalis were filled with diffuse granular immunoreactivity. Ultrastructural studies identified IRP-LI within glia and neurons including presynaptic processes. I-receptor(s) localize to a highly restricted network of neurons in the CNS and circumventricular regions lying outside of the blood-brain barrier. Putative imidazoline receptors have a unique distribution pattern, show partial overlap with alpha 2 adrenoreceptors and are heavily represented in sensory processing centers and the visceral nervous system.
9509416	Quantitative immunoblot analyses were carried out to study the distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A and 2B (NR2A and NR2B, respectively) at the protein level in the adult rat brain. Highest levels of NR2A were detected in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, followed at more or less similar levels (about 36-72% of cerebral cortex) by striatum, thalamus, olfactory bulb, superior and inferior colliculi, and cerebellum. The lowest levels were detected in midbrain and lower brain stem (30-31% of cerebral cortex). The NR2B was more dramatic in differential distribution than the NR2A. Highest levels of NR2B were found in telencephalic (olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) and thalamic regions, and expression in superior and inferior colliculi, midbrain, lower brain stem, and cerebellum were significantly lower (4-25% of cerebral cortex). Interestingly, NR2B proteins were barely detectable in the cerebellum. When the postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions were compared, the amount of NR2B in the cerebellar PSD fraction was only 1.8% of that present in the cerebral PSD fraction where the subunit is highly enriched. Immunoblot analyses with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody showed that the molecular sizes of major phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in forebrain and hindbrain are 180 and 45 kDa, respectively. The regional distribution of the 180 kDa major phosphotyrosine protein was very similar to that of NR2B, and the protein could be immunoprecipitated by NR2B antibody. Our data shows that NR2A and NR2B subunits are differentially distributed in the brain in an overlapping manner, and that the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein of 180 kDa in forebrain is the NR2B.
9518626	The present study was designed to investigate Fos-positive neurons of the female rat brain at various reproductive states in order to analyze the metabolic map connected with pregnancy, parturition and lactation. The number of Fos-positive neurons in each brain nucleus was analyzed with a quantitative immunohistochemical method in virgin, pregnant, parturient, lactating and arrested lactating rats. In parturient rats, a significant number of Fos-positive neurons was observed as compared to virgin or pregnant females in the following brain regions; the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), lateral septal nucleus (LS), medial preoptic area (MPA), periventricular hypothalamic nucleus (Pe), parvocellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PaPVN), magnocellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (MaPVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PV), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), lateral hypothalamic area (LH), amygdaloid nucleus (AM), supramammillary nucleus (SuM), substantia nigra (SN), central grey (CG), microcellular tegmental nucleus (MiTg), subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (SPF), posterior hypothalamic area (PH), dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), locus coeruleus (LC), dorsal parabrachial nucleus (DPB), nucleus of solitary tract (Sol), and ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Significant differences were found in the number of Fos-positive neurons between parturient and lactating females, although localization of Fos-positive neurons in lactating females was quite similar to parturient ones. Between parturient and lactating rats: (1) In the MPA, PaPVN, AHA, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), MLT, and Ge, the number of Fos-positive neurons of lactating females were significantly higher than those of parturient ones; (2) In the LS, Pe, PV, LH, AM, SuM, CG, MiTg, SPF, PH, DR, LC, and VLM, there was no significant differences in the number of Fos-positive neurons; (3) In the BST, MaPVN, SON, SN, DPB and Sol, the number of Fos-positive neurons of lactating rats were significantly lower than those of parturient ones. These different patterns of Fos expression among many brain regions may be owing to the functional differences in each region. Fos expression in lactating rats was apparently induced by suckling stimulation because the removal of their litters immediately after parturition completely eliminated expression of Fos protein in each nucleus. These results suggest that the localization of Fos-positive neurons in a number of neural populations throughout the brain may be revealing the neural circuits in response to parturition or lactation.
9539209	Antibodies directed against the C-terminus of the rat vesicular acetylcholine transporter mark expression of this specifically cholinergic protein in perinuclear regions of the soma and on secretory vesicles concentrated within cholinergic nerve terminals. In the central nervous system, the vesicular acetylcholine transporter terminal fields of the major putative cholinergic pathways in cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex and interpeduncular nucleus were examined and characterized. The existence of an intrinsic cholinergic innervation of cerebral cortex was confirmed by both in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry for the rat vesicular acetylcholine transporter and choline acetyltransferase. Cholinergic interneurons of the olfactory tubercle and Islands of Calleja, and the major intrinsic cholinergic innervation of striatum were fully characterized at the light microscopic level with vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunohistochemistry. Cholinergic staining was much more extensive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter than for choline acetyltransferase in all these regions, due to visualization of cholinergic nerve terminals not easily seen with immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase in paraffin-embedded sections. Cholinergic innervation of the median eminence of the hypothalamus, previously observed with vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunohistochemistry, was confirmed by the presence of vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunoreactivity in extracts of median eminence by western blotting. Cholinergic projections to cerebellum, pineal gland, and to the substantia nigra were documented by vesicular acetylcholine transporter-positive punctate staining in these structures. Additional novel localizations of putative cholinergic terminals to the subependymal zone surrounding the lateral ventricles, and putative cholinergic cell bodies in the sensory mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, a primary sensory afferent ganglion located in the brainstem, are documented here. The cholinergic phenotype of neurons of the sensory mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus was confirmed by choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry. A feature of cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system revealed clearly with vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded sections is the termination of cholinergic neurons on cholinergic cell bodies. These are most prominent on motor neurons of the spinal cord, less prominent but present in some brainstem motor nuclei, and apparently absent from projection neurons of the telencephalon and brainstem, as well as from the preganglionic vesicular acetylcholine transporter-positive sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons visualized in the intermediolateral and intermediomedial columns of the spinal cord. In addition to the large puncta decorating motor neuronal perikarya and dendrites in the ventral horn, vesicular acetylcholine transporter-positive terminal fields are distributed in lamina X surrounding the central canal, where additional small vesicular acetylcholine transporter-positive cell bodies are located, and in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. Components of the central cholinergic nervous system whose existence has been controversial have been confirmed, and the existence of new components documented, with immunohistochemistry for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter. Quantitative visualization of terminal fields of known cholinergic systems by staining for vesicular acetylcholine transporter will expand the possibilities for documenting changes in synaptic patency accompanying physiological and pathophysiological changes in these systems.
9542726	The present study has employed quantitative receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridisation histochemistry to compare the expression of the mRNA encoding the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor and the binding density of mature GABAA receptors in the limbic system of alcohol-preferring Fawn-Hooded rats (FH) with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Quantifiable levels of mRNA encoding the alpha 1 subunit were found in cortical regions, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra, horizontal limb of the diagonal band and the hippocampus of both rat strains. Interestingly, expression of the alpha 1 subunit mRNA was decreased by approximately 30% in the hippocampus of FH compared to WKY rats. Following a 28-day period with free access to 10% ethanol, expression of the alpha 1 subunit transcript, was significantly increased in the piriform cortex and horizontal limb of the diagonal band, unaltered in the hippocampus but decreased in the substantia nigra of FH rats. Quantifiable levels of mRNA encoding the alpha 2 subunit were found in nucleus accumbens, amygdala, cortical regions, lateral septal nucleus, hippocampus, medial habenula and ventral pallidum of both strains. Expression of the alpha 2 subunit mRNA was decreased by approximately 35% in both the hippocampus and occipital cortex of FH compared to WKY rats. However, consumption of 10% ethanol in FH rats had no impact upon expression of the mRNA encoding the alpha 2 subunit in any region examined. Mature GABAA receptors were studied by autoradiography utilising the antagonist radioligand [3H]SR95531 and the agonist radioligand [3H]muscimol. Topographic binding throughout the limbic system of both strains was observed for both radioligands. Specifically, [3H]SR95531 binding was higher in the occipital cortex, hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus, superior colliculus and ventral pallidum of the FH rats compared to WKY rats; however, in the nucleus accumbens [3H]SR95531 binding was lower in FH compared to WKY. Ethanol consumption had no measurable effect on the binding of [3H]SR95531 in FH rats. In the case of [3H]muscimol, binding was higher in the cortex, lateral septum and ventral pallidum of FH compared to WKY. Furthermore, ethanol consumption resulted in a 25-30% increase in [3H]muscimol binding in the lateral septum and striatum of FH rats. These data provide evidence for differential expression of GABAA receptor subunits in FH and WKY rats, and additionally indicate anatomically defined variations in GABAA receptor binding between the two rat strains.
9543341	This study characterizes the developmental expression of NADPH-diaphorase from embryo to adulthood in the forebrain, midbrain and cerebellum of rat brain via histochemical staining. On embryonic day 12 no neurons stained. Labeling was observed in certain nuclei from E15 through the postnatal period to adulthood. Labeling in neurons increased or maintained a constant level with increased age. The embryo demonstrated substantial labeling in neurons of the caudate putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic area, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, magnocellular nucleus posterior commissure, and periaqueductal central gray. Additional neuronal labeling was observed postnatally in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, amygdala, various nuclei of the thalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, linear nucleus of the raphe, pretectal area and superior colliculus. In the cerebellum, labeling appeared only after P14 in cells of the molecular cell layer and granular cell layer. The sizes of labeled neurons developed significantly from P4 to P14 in several nuclei. The distinctive temporal and spatial expression pattern of NADPH-diaphorase implies that the NO/cGMP system may play an important role in physiological and developmental functions.
9548554	The distributions of two alternative splicing variants of metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7, mGluR7a and mGluR7b, were examined immunohistochemically in the rat and mouse by using variant-specific antibodies raised against C-terminal portions of rat mGluR7a and human mGluR7b. Many regions throughout the central nervous system (CNS) showed mGluR7-like immunoreactivities (LI). The distribution patterns of mGluR7-LI in the rat were substantially the same as those in the mouse, although some species differences were observed in a few regions. Intense mGluR7a-LI was seen in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, anterior olfactory nucleus, islands of Calleja, superficial layers of the olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex and entorhinal cortex, periamygdaloid cortex, amygdalohippocampal area, hippocampus, layer I of the neocortical regions, globus pallidus, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, locus coeruleus, and superficial layers of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns. The distribution of mGluR7b was more restricted. It was intense in the islands of Calleja, substantia innominata, hippocampus, ventral pallidum, and globus pallidus. The medial habenular nucleus also showed intense mGluR7a-LI in the rat but not in the mouse. For both mGluR7a- and mGluR7b-LI, localization in the active zones of presynaptic axon terminals was confirmed electron microscopically at synapses of both the asymmetrical and symmetrical types. It is noteworthy that mGluR7a-LI is seen preferentially in relay nuclei of the sensory pathways and that both mGluR7a- and mGluR7b-LI are observed not only in presumed glutamatergic axon terminals, but also in non-glutamatergic axon terminals including presumed inhibitory ones. Thus, mGluR7 may play roles not only as an autoreceptor in glutamatergic axon terminals, but also as a presynaptic heteroreceptor in non-glutamatergic axon terminals in various CNS regions.
9550144	VGF is a secretory peptide precursor that is expressed and processed by neuronal cells in a cell type-specific fashion. In addition, VGF transcription and secretion are rapidly and relatively selectively induced by neurotrophins and depolarization in vitro. To gain insight into the possible function(s) of VGF in the nervous system, we have carried out a detailed examination of the distribution of VGF mRNA in the adult rat central nervous system by using in situ hybridization. Robust expression was detected in many neurons throughout the brain and spinal cord, in several types of neurons in the retina, and in presumptive chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. In the brain, prominent expression of VGF mRNA was observed in neurons of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs; in the anterior olfactory nucleus; in the induseum griseum and taenia tecta; in the olfactory tubercle; in CA1-CA3, the hilus of the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex of the hippocampal formation; in the piriform, periamygdaloid, transitional, and lateral entorhinal cortices; in the endopiriform nucleus; in the hypothalamus, particularly the preoptic, periventricular, supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, and arcuate nuclei; and in a number of septal, thalamic, amygdaloid, and brainstem nuclei. Labeling was also seen in neurons of the neocortex and transitional cortical areas, particularly in layer V, and in basal ganglia and cerebellum. These data demonstrate that VGF mRNA is expressed much more extensively in the brain than has been described in previous RNA or immunohistochemical studies, and, furthermore, that VGF is widely expressed in the spinal cord and retina.
9554992	In the rat, approximately 20% of total body heat-loss occurs by sympathetically mediated increases in blood flow through an elaborate system of arteriovenous anastomoses in the skin of its tail. In this study, the CNS cell groups that regulate this sympathetic outflow were identified by the viral transneuronal labeling method. Pseudorabies virus was injected into the wall of the ventral tail artery in rats that had their cauda equina transected to eliminate the somatic innervation of the tail. After 4-7 days survival, the pattern of CNS transneuronal labeling was studied. Sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the T11-L2 (mainly L1) levels of the intermediolateral cell column (IML) were labeled by 4 days. After 5 days, sympathetic pre-motor neurons (i.e., supraspinal neurons that project to the IML) were identified near the ventral medullary surface; some of these contained serotonin immunoreactivity. Additional groups of the sympathetic premotor areas were labeled by 6 days post-injection, including the rostral ventrolateral medulla (C1 adrenergic neurons), rostral ventromedial medulla, caudal raphe nuclei (serotonin neurons in the raphe pallidus and magnus nuclei), A5 noradrenergic cell group, lateral hypothalamic area and paraventricular hypothalamic area (oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons). Seven days after the PRV injections, additional cell groups in the telencephalon (viz., bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and lateral preoptic areas and medial preoptic nucleus), diencephalon (viz., subincertal nucleus, zona incerta as well as dorsal, dorsomedial, parafascicular, posterior and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei) and midbrain (viz., periaqueductal gray matter, precommissural nucleus, Edinger-Westphal nucleus and ventral tegmental area) were labeled. The discussion is focused on the CNS cell groups involved in the control of body temperature and fever.
9572302	The in vitro binding of a new subtype-selective NMDA receptor antagonist, [3H]Ro 25-6981, to rat brain membranes and sections was characterized. The compound bound to a single site on the membranes with a K(D) of 3 nM and a Bmax of 1.6 pmol/mg of protein. Specific binding, defined with a new NR2B-specific antagonist, Ro 04-5595 [1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methyl-6-methoxy-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoqu inoline], at 10 microM, was fully inhibited by several compounds with the following rank order of affinities--Ro 25-6981 > CP-101,606 > Ro 04-5595 = ifenprodil >> eliprodil > haloperidol > spermine > spermidine > MgCl2 > CaCl2--and partially inhibited by competitive glutamate recognition site antagonists. A high density of binding sites was detected, radioautographically, in several layers of the cerebral cortex, in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, tuberculum olfactorium, caudate putamen, medium densities in the globus pallidus, thalamus, spinal cord dorsal horn, and motoneurons, whereas the cerebellum, pons, and medulla were, with a few exceptions, e.g., locus coeruleus, poorly labeled. Overall, the distribution of [3H]Ro 25-6981 binding sites correlated well with that of NR2B (but not NR2A) transcripts, revealed by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The high affinity of [3H]Ro 25-6981 for NR2B-containing receptors renders this compound the ligand of choice to study the regulation of NR2B-containing receptor expression.
9572581	The distribution of a metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 in the central nervous system was immunohistochemically examined in the rat and mouse with a monoclonal antibody raised against an N-terminal sequence of rat mGluR2 (amino acid residues 87-134). Neuronal cell bodies with mGluR2-like immunoreactivity (mGluR2-LI) were clearly shown in the horizontal cells of Cajal in the cerebral cortex, neurons in the triangular septal nucleus and medial mammillary nucleus, Golgi cells and the unipolar brush cells in the cerebellar cortex, and Golgi-like and unipolar brush-like cells in the cochlear nucleus. Neuropil was intensely immunostained in the accessory olfactory bulb, bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, neocortex, cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, subicular and entorhinal cortices, stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 and CA3, molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, periamygdaloid cortex, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, bed nucleus of the anterior commissure, caudate-putamen, accumbens nucleus, thalamic reticular nucleus, anteroventral and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, granular layer of the cerebellar cortex, anterior and ventral tegmental nuclei, granular layer of the cochlear nucleus, and parvicellular part of the lateral reticular nucleus. Many axons in the white matter and fiber bundles were also immunostained. No glial cells with mGluR2-LI were found. No particular species differences were found in the distribution pattern of mGluR2-LI between the rat and mouse. The results indicate that mGluR2 is expressed not only in somato-dendritic domain, but also in axonal domain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
9579795	Retrograde, transneuronal tracing with Bartha's strain of pseudorabies virus was used in rats to identify spinal cord, brainstem and hypothalamic loci of uterine-related neurons that could function in the regulation of uterine activity. Based on the premise that estrogen might influence such uterine-related neurons, the existence of estrogen receptors in neurons in these same loci was examined. Viral injections were made into the uterine cervix, body and cervical end of the uterine horns, and the rats allowed to survive for four to six days. After four days, mainly the spinal cord, medulla and pons contained virus-infected neurons. After longer survival times, progressively higher levels of the neuraxis contained viral-labeled neurons, so that by six days hypothalamic uterine-related neurons were identified. First-order virus-infected neurons were visualized by immunohistochemistry in the pelvic paracervical parasympathetic ganglia and in inferior mesenteric sympathetic ganglia. Preganglionic and putative interneurons were labeled in the lumbosacral spinal cord and thoracic spinal cord mainly in the lateral horn area (sacral parasympathetic nucleus and intermediolateral nucleus), lateral aspect of the dorsal horn, intermediate gray, lamina X and dorsal gray commissural area. In the brainstem, labeling was most evident and consistent in the nucleus tractus solitarius, ventrolateral medulla, raphe magnus and pallidus nuclei, parapyramidal area, A5 cell group, Barrington's nucleus of the pons and periaqueductal gray of the midbrain. In the hypothalamus, virus-infected neurons were most marked in the paraventricular nucleus, with fewer in the medial preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Estrogen receptor-immunoreactive neurons were most often present among the virus-labeled uterine-related neurons of the spinal cord, nucleus tractus solitarius, ventrolateral medulla, periaqueductal gray, medial preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. These results identify a multisynaptic pathway of neurons whose eventual output is involved in uterine functions, whose distribution is similar to that revealed by pseudorabies virus tracing from other visceral organs, and which are often mixed among estrogen-responsive neurons.
9596561	Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of proteins which in mammals is comprised of four isoforms (MT-I-IV). MT-I and MT-II are expressed in many tissues, whereas MT-III is expressed exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast to the liver, the knowledge of the regulation of the different MT isoforms in the brain is scarce. A number of cytokines have been shown to be important regulators of MT synthesis in vivo and in vitro. In accordance with this concept, the i.p. administration of endotoxin, which elicits the release of cytokines not only in peripheral tissues but also in the brain, caused an overall increase of MT-I + II levels in the rat brain which was very significant in medulla + pons and cerebellum. Among the putative cytokines involved in endotoxin-elicited brain MT-I+II induction, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are likely candidates. These cytokines have a variety of effects in the brain, and they are major regulators of MT-I+II synthesis in tissues such as the liver. Here we show the administration of IL-1 and IL-6 into the third ventricle increased MT-I+II protein levels in specific brain areas in the rat. IL-1 tended to increase MT-I+II levels in all brain areas studied, but significantly in the striatum, hypothalamus, medulla + pons and cerebellum. The effect of IL-6 was more restricted, but a significant increase of MT-I+II levels was still observed in frontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. The results suggest that IL-1 and IL-6 are important regulators of brain MT-I+II and that these cytokines could mediate MT-I+II induction after an immunological insult.
9600987	The central nervous system (CNS) effects of mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are unexplored. The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure brain correlates of mental stress induced by an arithmetic serial subtraction task in CAD and healthy subjects. Mental stress resulted in hyperactivation in CAD patients compared with healthy subjects in several brain areas including the left parietal cortex [angular gyrus/parallel sulcus (area 39)], left anterior cingulate (area 32), right visual association cortex (area 18), left fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum. These same regions were activated within the CAD patient group during mental stress versus control conditions. In the group of healthy subjects, activation was significant only in the left inferior frontal gyrus during mental stress compared with counting control. Decreases in blood flow also were produced by mental stress in CAD versus healthy subjects in right thalamus (lateral dorsal, lateral posterior), right superior frontal gyrus (areas 32, 24, and 10), and right middle temporal gyrus (area 21) (in the region of the auditory association cortex). Of particular interest, a subgroup of CAD patients that developed painless myocardial ischemia during mental stress had hyperactivation in the left hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (area 40), left middle (area 10) and superior frontal gyrus (area 8), temporal pole, and visual association cortex (area 18), and a concomitant decrease in activation observed in the anterior cingulate bilaterally, right middle and superior frontal gyri, and right visual association cortex (area 18) compared with CAD patients without myocardial ischemia. These findings demonstrate an exaggerated cerebral cortical response and exaggerated asymmetry to mental stress in individuals with CAD.
9607710	The present study examined projections of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons from the basal forebrain and preoptic-anterior hypothalamus to the "intermediate" part of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Retrograde transport from this region of the mediodorsal nucleus was investigated using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated wheatgerm agglutinin in combination with peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase. A relatively large number of retrogradely-labelled glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons are located in the basal forebrain, amounting to more than 7% of the total population of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells in this region. Moreover, retrogradely-labelled choline acetyltransferase-positive cells are interspersed among glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons, accounting for about 6% of the total choline acetyltransferase-positive cell population in the basal forebrain. The glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive and choline acetyltransferase-positive retrogradely-labelled neurons are distributed throughout several regions of the basal forebrain, including the medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca, the magnocellular preoptic nucleus, the substantia innominata pars anterior, the substantia innominata pars posterior, and the globus pallidus where only a few retrogradely-labelled neurons were seen. The choline acetyltransferase-positive mediodorsal-projecting neurons are morphologically different from the choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the basal forebrain, suggesting that those projecting to the mediodorsal nucleus are a small proportion of the cholinergic neuronal population in the basal forebrain. In the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, many retrogradely-labelled glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells were found, amounting to more than 7% of the total population of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells in this region. These retrogradely-labelled glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons are distributed throughout the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus in a continuous line with those in the basal forebrain, including the lateral preoptic area, the medial preoptic area, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the anterior and dorsal hypothalamic areas. The highest percentage of mediodorsal-projecting GABAergic neurons is in the anterior lateral hypothalamus where more than 25% of the total population of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells project to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Overall, of the large population of retrogradely-labelled neurons in the basal forebrain and preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, a significant proportion are glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons (> 60% in the basal forebrain and > 30% in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus), while the choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons amount to a smaller percentage of the neurons projecting to the mediodorsal nucleus (< 13% in the basal forebrain and < 2% in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus). These results provide anatomical evidence of direct GABAergic projections from the basal forebrain and preoptic-anterior hypothalamic regions to the "intermediate" part of the mediodorsal nucleus in the cat. This GABAergic projection field could be the direct pathway by which the basal forebrain directly modulates thalamic excitability and may also be involved in mechanisms modulating electroencephalographic synchronization and sleep through the "intermediate" mediodorsal nucleus.
9619195	The PET H2 15O-bolus method was used to image regional brain activity in normal human subjects during intense pain induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin and during post-capsaicin mechanical allodynia (the perception of pain from a normally non-painful stimulus). Images of regional cerebral blood flow were acquired during six conditions: (i) rest; (ii) light brushing of the forearm; (iii) forearm intradermal injection of capsaicin, (iv) and (v) the waning phases of capsaicin pain; and (vi) allodynia. Allodynia was produced by light brushing adjacent to the capsaicin injection site after ongoing pain from the capsaicin injection had completely subsided. Capsaicin treatment produced activation in many discrete brain regions which we classified as subserving four main functions: sensation-perception (primary somatosensory cortex, thalamus and insula); attention (anterior cingulate cortex); descending pain control (periaqueductal grey); and an extensive network related to sensory-motor integration (supplementary motor cortex, bilateral putamen and insula, anterior lobe and vermis of the cerebellum and superior colliculus). Comparison of the noxious and non-noxious stimuli yielded several new insights into neural organization of pain and tactile sensations. Capsaicin pain, which had no concomitant tactile component, produced little or no activation in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), whereas light brushing produced a prominent activation of SII, suggesting a differential sensitivity of SII to tactile versus painful stimuli. The cerebellar vermis was strongly activated by capsaicin, whereas light brush and experimental allodynia produced little or no activation, suggesting a selective association with C-fibre stimulation and nociceptive second-order spinal neurons. The experimental allodynia activated a network that partially overlapped those activated by both pain and light brush alone. Unlike capsaicin-induced pain, allodynia was characterized by bilateral activation of inferior prefrontal cortex, suggesting that prefrontal responses to pain are context dependent.
9637346	Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) has a variety of biological effects including the effect on CNS, such a promotion of sleep, fever, analgesic effect or some behavioural changes and of course a very potent effect on immune system. The latter effect is at least partly mediated through the structure in CNS. With the small electrolytic lesions which were placed in brain from the spinal cord through the brain stem up to the cerebral cortex we have identified a number of structures such as medial frontal cortex (area Cg1-Cg3), subnucleus basomedialis and centralis of amygdala, subnucleus medialis and dorsolateralis of nucleus parabrachialis, lateral part of reticular formation (monoaminergic groups A1-7) and the part of the reticular formation (serotonergic groups B6-B8) which are evidently involved in the immunomodulatory and immunoadjuvant effect of muramyl dipeptide. The results of experiments also suggest that the interaction between neuroendocrine and immune systems might take place on the level of some of above mentioned anatomical structures.
9671278	Striatin, a 110-kDa protein, is the first member of the tryptophane-aspartate repeat protein family known to bind calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+. We examined the distribution of striatin and its mRNA in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. Striatin immunostaining and mRNA labeling patterns are generally concordant. Regions showing the most intense staining are the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens (anterior and shell parts), olfactory tubercle, red nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, cranial nerve motor nuclei, and layer IX of the spinal cord (motoneurons). Low levels of both striatin and its mRNA are detected in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, septum, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain and cerebellum. Striatin-immunoreactive neuronal processes are found predominantly in the structures containing striatin-positive neurons, suggesting that these labeled processes represent dendritic arborization rather than axonal processes. Except for the medial forebrain bundle, all axonal fiber tracts examined are devoid of striatin immunolabeling. These data show that the somatodendritic localization of striatin, previously described in the striatum, may be a main feature of the subcellular distribution of this protein throughout the CNS. Although widely distributed in neurons throughout the rat CNS, striatin is expressed prominently in the structures belonging to the motor system, suggesting that this protein may play a preponderant role in motor control.
9674561	The myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and MARCKS-related protein (MRP) are both membrane-associated phosphoproteins that interact with calmodulin and filamentous actin in a protein kinase C phosphorylation-dependent manner. In the present study, we examined MARCKS and MRP gene expression in the postnatal (P) rat brain (1, 7, 14, 21, and 90 days after birth) by using quantitative in situ hybridization. At P1, MRP expression was high in neocortex, striatum, thalamus, cerebellar cortex, and hippocampus (CA1-CA3, hilus, and granule cell layer) but low in brainstem and, between P7 and P14, exhibited a dramatic decline in each of these regions except hippocampal CA1 and granule cell layers. Between P14 and P21, MRP expression increased in white matter regions including the corpus callosum, fimbria/fornix, and cerebellar deep white matter. At P90 (adult), MRP remained strongly expressed in the olfactory bulb, medial habenula, hippocampal CA1, and the inner two-thirds of granule cell layer, temporal, and entorhinal cortices, the corpus callosum and fimbria/fornix, and cerebellar white matter. At P1, MARCKS was strongly expressed in the majority of brain regions except the brainstem, which subsequently declined gradually to approximate adult levels by P14. Between P14 and P21, MARCKS expression declined gradually in the hilus, remained elevated in hippocampal CA1, CA3, and granule cell layers, and increased dramatically in the corpus callosum and fimbria/fornix. At P90, MARCKS expression declined in hippocampal CA3 and hilus and remained strongly expressed in hippocampal CA1 and granule cell layers, regions of the olfactory bulb, the medial habenula, temporal cortex, and cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells. Expression of both MARCKS and MRP in regions undergoing neuronal proliferation, migration, and neurite outgrowth suggest a common role in these developmental events, whereas differences in expression during development and in the adult brain provide evidence of differential regulation.
9681951	The subregional localization of different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in human cerebral cortex was estimated by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the nicotinic ligands [3H](-)nicotine, [3H]cytisine and [3H]epibatidine in large whole human forebrain hemispheres. Saturation experiments in frontal cortex revealed for [3H](-)nicotine two binding sites with affinity constants (Kd) of 0.45 and 6.3 nM and binding site densities (Bmax) of 3.0 and 14.2 pmol/g, for [3H]cytisine one binding site with Kd of 0.19 nM and Bmax of 21.8 pmol/g, and for [3H]epibatidine one binding site with Kd of 0.011 nM and Bmax of 20.0 pmol/g. The laminar binding distributions of the three ligands were compared in different cortical areas by creating binding profiles perpendicular to the entire cortical depth. The regional autoradiographic binding patterns of the three ligands were essentially similar, with higher receptor binding in cortical layers I, III and V. In the primary sensory cortex and inferior frontal sulcus, marked binding of all ligands was observed in layer III. [3H]Cytisine showed the lowest difference between maximal and minimal binding within the gray tissue in all other areas. In the primary motor cortex, [3H]epibatidine and [3H](-)nicotine showed high binding in layers III and V. The [3H](-)nicotine binding was higher than that of the other ligands in layers I and VI of the primary motor cortex, the deeper layer V of the primary sensory cortex, layer III of the superior temporal sulcus and layer VI of the parietal cortex. A distinct band of binding of [3H](-)nicotine and [3H]epibatidine but not of [3H]cytisine was found in layer IIlb of the occipital cortex and layer V of the superior temporal sulcus. [3H]Epibatidine showed higher binding than the other ligands in all layers of the medial frontal, superior frontal and superior temporal sulcus. The findings with the three nicotinic ligands suggest three binding sites in the cortex with different laminar distributions. All three ligands bound to an identical receptor site, most likely the alpha4 nicotinic receptor subunit. The morphological distribution of [3H]epibatidine and [3H](-)nicotine binding indicate that they bind to an additional site, especially in the primary motor cortex, in layer IIIb of the occipital cortex and layer V of the superior temporal sulcus. High binding of [3H](-)nicotine in layers I and VI of the primary motor cortex, the deeper layer V of the primary sensory cortex, layer III of the superior temporal sulcus and layer VI of the parietal cortex may indicate a third binding site.
9681962	The biological actions of somatostatin are mediated via a family of G protein-coupled receptors named sst1 to sst5. We used an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody AS-65, directed against a specific N-terminal peptide sequence of sst1 to determine the immunohistochemical distribution of N-terminal sst1 immunoreactivity in the rat brain. The specificity of the antibody was shown by western blotting experiments using an N-terminal sst1 fusion protein. Enzymatic deglycosylation experiments were combined with blotting experiments on a sst1-transfected cell line and rat brain membrane proteins and with immunocytochemistry on an sst1-transfected cell line. These studies showed that the antibody detected the deglycosylated sst1 receptor protein. Immunohistochemical staining showed that sst1 immunoreactivity (presumably the deglycosylated receptor) recognised by this N-terminal antiserum was widely distributed throughout the brain with cells and processes labelled in the cerebral cortex, regions of the limbic system (including the hippocampal formation and some basal ganglia nuclei), the epithalamus, the thalamus, different subthalamic structures (subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta), the colliculi, the hypothalamus, the reticular formation, the cerebellum and regions of the trigeminal nerve complex. The distribution of immunoreactivity was in good general agreement with that predicted from the localization of sst1 messenger RNA and radioligand binding studies. This study on the immunohistochemical distribution of the sst1 receptor in the brain will provide a better understanding of the central actions of somatostatin at its receptor types.
9685616	The biological actions of the neuropeptides somatostatin-14 and -28 are receptor-mediated. To date, five G protein-coupled receptors sst1 to sst5 have been characterised pharmacologically and their genes have been cloned. In this study, we used an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (AS-68) raised against a specific N-terminal peptide sequence of sst2 to localise N-terminal sst2-immunoreactive regions in the rat brain and the cervical spinal cord. The specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by Western and slot blotting experiments using a N-terminal sst2 fusion protein. Further blotting experiments with a sst2(A)-transfected cell line and rat CNS membrane proteins showed that the antibody detected the non-glycosylated and/or non-sialated receptor. A strong signal using an sst2(A)-transfected CHO-K1 cell line was obtained only if the cells had been treated with N-Glycosidase F prior to the immunochemical detection. Two variants of sst2 (sst2(A) and sst2(B)) have been identified by cloning procedures and gene expression studies in the rodents. They differ in their carboxy-termini: AS-68 would, however, be able to recognise the non-glycosylated form of both these variants. We present here the central nervous system distribution of non-glycosylated sst2-immunoreactivity in the rat using this N-terminal antibody. The sst2 non-glycosylated N-terminal like immunoreactivity was distributed throughout the brain with cells and processes labelled in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia (neostriatum, substantia nigra), in the limbic system (hippocampal formation, amygdala), in the diencephalon (epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus), the superior colliculus, the periaqueductal grey matter and some of the reticular formation nuclei. The distribution of the non-glycosylated sst2-like immunoreactivity detected here was consistent with that predicted from the localisation of sst2 mRNA and SRIF-ligand binding studies.
9693804	The temporal changes in intensity of myelination of the nervous pathways in 0 to 42-day-old Wistar rats were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti-proteolipid protein and compared with that obtained by immunohistochemistry with anti-myelin basic protein. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue according to the standard ABC technique. Intensity of myelination was examined by an image analyzing system. We analyzed nine nervous pathways: corpus callosum, optic tract, internal capsule, spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, inferior cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, pyramidal tract, medial longitudinal fasciculus, and cuneate fasciculus. The presence of immunoreactive fibers for proteolipid protein (PLP) in the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, medial longitudinal fasciculus and cuneate fasciculus was noted on postnatal day 0. Those of the corpus callosum, inferior cerebellar peduncle, cerebellar white matter, pyramidal tract and internal capsule were noted on day 7, and that of optic tract on day 14. The time required to reach the intensity of myelination of day 42 was day 14 for the cuneate fasciculus, day 21 for the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, inferior cerebellar peduncle and medial longitudinal fasciculus, day 28 for the optic and pyramidal tracts, day 35 for the corpus callosum and day 42 for the internal capsule and cerebellar white matter. The appearance of immunoreactive fibers for PLP was usually earlier than that for myelin basic protein (MBP) and the pattern of difference between PLP and MBP can be classified into three groups: (1) their time of appearance and progress are almost the same, as in the optic tract; (2) the appearance and progress of PLP occurs earlier than those of MBP, as in the pyramidal tract; (3) the appearance of PLP occurs earlier than that of MBP, but their progress is the same. Our findings revealed that the time of appearance and progress of myelination as measured by PLP are different among the nervous pathways, and that there is also a difference between PLP and MBP. This difference between PLP and MBP may indicate a functional difference between them.
9694194	Nitric oxide (NO) involvement has been demonstrated in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, particularly in hippocampal long-term potentiation, a mechanism that underlies certain forms of learning and memory. Several findings suggest that NO production may be decreased in the aged rats. Changes in the nNOS-containing neurons with ageing were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. NOS-immunoreactive (IR) cells in aged rats were present in all cortical areas and the hippocampus, and the pattern of distribution was similar to that of the control group. The number of NOS-IR cells in the cerebral cortex was significantly decreased in the aged rats, but the extent of changes was variable in each area, and ranged from mild decrease (< 30%) to severe decrease (> 50%). Severely decreased areas were the cingulate cortex, parietal cortex area 1, temporal cortex area 1, 2, 3, medial part of occipital cortex area 2, monocular and binocular part of occipital cortex area 1, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus proper, dentate gyrus and subiculum. Morphologically, the number of dendritic branches seemed to be decreased in aged group and the length of dendrites of NOS-IR neurons showed a tendency to shorten. These results indicate the involvement of neuronal system containing NOS in the ageing brain, and provide the first morphological evidence for the loss of NOS neurons in the cerebral cortex of the aged rats by immunocytochemistry.
9698188	Lurcher mutant mice are characterized by massive degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and granule cells and by deficits in motor coordination. Regional brain variations of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity were analyzed to identify those brain regions with abnormal metabolic activity as a secondary consequence of the cerebellar atrophy and to establish the relationship between CO activity and motor deficits. Lurcher mutants had higher CO activity in all three cerebellar deep nuclei than normal littermate controls of the same background strain. Higher CO activity was also found in Lurcher mutants in brain regions directly connected to the cerebellum, such as the lateral vestibular nucleus, the cochlear nucleus, the red nucleus, the ventrolateral thalamus, the dorsal raphe, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the inferior colliculus. By contrast, there was a sharp decrease in CO activity in the inferior olive. As for brain regions not directly connected to the cerebellum, higher CO activity was observed in the trigeminal motor nucleus and the CA1 molecular layer of the hippocampus, which highlights probable transsynaptic alterations as a secondary consequence of cerebellar atrophy. A positive correlation between CO activity in the red nucleus and latencies before falling in two motor-coordination tests indicates that a compensatory increase of metabolic activity in a cerebellar efferent region is associated with improved behavior.
9706388	Nerve growth factor signal transduction mediated through the trk receptor has been implicated in neuronal growth, differentiation, and survival. In this study, we examined the effects of gestational exposure to the developmental neurotoxicant methylmercury (CH3Hg) on the ontogeny of trk-immunoreactivity (IR). Long-Evans dams were dosed on gestational days 6-15 (p.o.) with 0, 1, or 2 mg/kg CH3Hg dissolved in saline. Pups were sacrificed and perfused with buffered paraformaldehyde on postnatal days (PND) 1, 4, 10, 21 and 85. The brains were sectioned sagitally, Nissl-stained or stained immunohistochemically for trk receptors or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and examined throughout the medial to lateral extent of the brain. The greatest density of IR in neural cell bodies was seen in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral, and cerebellar cortex, striatum, septum, nucleus basalis, inferior colliculus, pons, and brain stem nuclei. trk IR was not limited to nerve cell bodies, with prominent axonal and dendritic staining in the brainstem, neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory tract. The regional pattern of trk IR varied in an age-dependent manner. In controls, trk-like IR appeared to peak in most regions between PND4-10 and decreased dramatically after PND21. This age-related difference in trk IR was supported by western blot analysis of PND10 and adult neocortex. This reduced and more adult-like pattern of trk IR was apparent on PND21 with some persistent trk-like IR in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellum and basal forebrain. In contrast to the normal regional patterns of trk IR, CH3Hg produced a dose-related decrease in trk-like IR in the absence of overt maternal toxicity or neonatal toxicity. CH3Hg-induced decreases in trk-like IR were especially apparent during the early postnatal period when trk IR was the greatest. The effects of CH3Hg exposure were restricted regionally, with the largest decrease in trk-like IR apparent in cortical regions, basal forebrain nuclei, and brain stem nuclei. Subsequent to the effects of CH3Hg on cortical trk-like IR were alterations in the development of cortical laminae on PND10 and 21 of neocortex. These alterations were characterized by quantifiable decreases in cell density, cell size and the widths of the layers of posterior neocortex. Not all of the CH3Hg-induced effects were characterized by decreased trk-like IR. Robust increases in trk IR in glial cells in the corpus callosum and brain stem were observed coincident with increased GFAP IR in cells of similar morphology. The present results localize the cellular and regional ontogeny of trk and suggest that developmental exposure to CH3Hg alters the normal ontogeny of this trophic factor receptor which may be associated with the developmental neurotoxicity of this chemical.
9706389	Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation has been implicated in neuronal growth and differentiation [R.S. Turner, R.L. Mazzei, G.J. Raynor, P.R. Girard, J.F. Kuo, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 81 (1984) 3143-3147.]. We examined effects of gestational exposure to the neurotoxicant, methylmercury (CH3Hg), on the developmental profile of immunoreactivity (IR) for alpha, beta, gamma and epsilon PKC isoforms and cytosolic PKC activity. Long-Evans dams were dosed on gestational days (GD)6-15 (p.o.) with 0, 1, or 2 mg kg-1 day-1 CH3Hg dissolved in saline. Pups were sacrificed and perfused with buffered paraformaldehyde on post-natal days (PND) 1, 4, 10, 21, 45 and 85. The brains were sectioned sagittally, stained immunohistochemically, and examined throughout the medial to lateral extent. IR in neuronal cell bodies for PKC isoforms alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon was densest in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, shell of the inferior colliculus, pons, cerebral, piriform, and cerebellar cortex, whereas axonal staining was prominent in the brainstem, internal capsule, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, fornix and olfactory tract. In controls, the PKC alpha and epsilon IR was highest on PND1-4, decreased dramatically by PND10, and decreased further by PND21. In the neonate, the regional and cellular distributions of alpha and epsilon IR were similar. The PKC gamma IR was greater at post-weaning ages (PND21-85) with the greatest regional density apparent in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. Only the highest dose of CH3Hg (2 mg kg-1 day-1; GD6-15) produced a persistent decrease in regional alpha and epsilon, but not beta or gamma IR during the post-natal period. These regional and time-dependent changes in PKC isoforms were complemented by the examination of PKC activity in cortex, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and brainstem. Cytosolic PKC activity increased from PND1 to 10 in cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. On PND21, PKC activity decreased in the cortex and olfactory bulb, but remained high in the cerebellum. By contrast, PKC activity in the brainstem was highest on PND1 and 4 and decreased dramatically by PND21. CH3Hg (2 mg kg-1 day-1) significantly decreased PKC activity on PND1 and 4 in the cortex. The present results characterize the cellular and regional ontogeny of PKC isoenzymes alpha, beta, gamma and epsilon, and indicate that developmental exposure to CH3Hg can alter the ontogeny of specific isoforms and regional PKC activity.
9722159	The topological distribution of mouse cadherin-8 protein in the neonatal and adult mouse brain was studied immunohistochemically using a rabbit antiserum. Cadherin-8 expression was restricted to several areas in neonatal brains constituting particular neural circuits, i.e. the limbic system, the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, and the cerebellum and related nuclei. In addition, the nerve fibers linking some of the cadherin-8-positive areas, i.e. the habenulo-interpeduncular tract, decussation of the dorsal tegmentum, the medial longitudinal fasciculus, transverse pontine fibers, the brachium conjunctivum and the inferior cerebellar peduncle were cadherin-8 positive, as were the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, oculomotor nerve, facial nerve and trigeminal nerve. Cadherin-8 expression also showed a patch-like distribution in the intermediate gray layer of the superior colliculus, resembling acetylcholinesterase-rich patches in allocation. Segmentally organized cadherin-8-positive areas were found in the neonatal cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Some nuclei and fibers in the brainstem and cerebellum, expressing cadherin-8 at neonatal stages, were also stained in the adult mouse brain. These findings suggest that cadherin-8 is involved in the formation of particular neural circuits by connecting areas expressing this molecule with positive nerve fibers, and indicate its possible implication in subdivisional organization in the superior colliculus and cerebellum.
9753083	The AS/AGU mutant rat is characterized by a wide staggering gait and a movement disorder of the hindlimbs. Local cerebral glucose utilization in the brain was investigated using the [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique to map any functional alterations in the mutant AS/AGU (agu/agu) compared with Albino Swiss controls (+/+). Locomotor tests were also performed to confirm the phenotypic assignment of the animals. Statistically significant reductions in glucose utilization were apparent in 12 of the 44 regions examined in the AS/AGU animals. The regions showing the most significant differences (P < 0.01) from the control AS strain were the substantia nigra pars compacta (-23%) and medial geniculate body (-17%). Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02) in glucose utilization ranging from -15 to -26% were also displayed in the superior colliculus superficial layer, auditory cortex, ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus, molecular layer of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, median raphe nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus and anterior hypothalamus. In no region studied was the mean value of glucose use in the AS/AGU rat greater than in the control animals. The results of this study complement previous behavioural and neurochemical characterization studies of this mutant, confirm that the disorder involves functional disturbances of the basal ganglia, and demonstrate the involvement of the limbic system and some sensory systems.
9753110	Intraspecific confrontation between male rats represents a biologically relevant form of social stress. C-fos expression has been used to map the pattern of neural activation following either a single (acute) or repeated (10 times) exposure of an intruder male to a larger male in the latter's home cage. These conditions induce high levels of aggressive interaction. Sixty minutes after a single defeat, there was intense c-fos expression (quantified using image analysis) in restricted areas of the basal forebrain (including lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic area, paraventricular nucleus, and medial and central amygdala) as well as in the autonomic and monoaminergic nuclei of the brainstem (central grey, dorsal and median raphe, locus coeruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract). After the tenth defeat, this pattern was modified despite persistently high levels of aggression. Some areas in the forebrain (bed nucleus of stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus and medial amygdala) continued to express increased c-fos; others (the septum, lateral hypothalamic area, lateral preoptic area and central amygdala) no longer expressed c-fos. The brainstem response was equally varied: the central grey and the raphe nuclei continued to respond after repeated defeat, whereas the solitary nucleus and locus coeruleus did not. On the other hand, there was no change in the behaviour of intruder rats after repeated defeat. This study shows the pattern of adaptation at a cellular level in the basal forebrain and brainstem to repeated defeat. As in our previous studies of repeated restraint, modulation in the expression of c-fos following repeated stress is highly regionally specific, suggesting that differential neural processing is involved in adaptation to social stress.
9772218	Cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1A2 are involved in the oxidation of a wide spectrum of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Although their presence has been repeatedly confirmed in brain tissue, reports regarding their distribution in the brain are often contradictory. In the present study the possibility was examined that CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are localized and inducible in the brain-CSF barrier and regions with a leaky blood brain barrier, where they may serve as a protective metabolic barrier. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 levels were determined in subcellular fractions of multiple brain regions, as well as tissue homogenates of circumventricular organs, and the meninges by Western blotting and catalytic activity in control male rats and rats treated with the inducer beta-naphthoflavone (BNF). In control animals CYP1A1 immunoreactive protein was undetectable in regional brain microsomes or whole tissue homogenates of the arachnoid, dura mater, choroid plexus, pineal gland, median eminence, and pituitary. However, low levels of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity were observed in homogenates of the arachnoid, dura mater, choroid plexus, pineal gland, and pituitary. Western blotting revealed only low levels of CYP1A2 immunoreactive protein in brain microsomes from the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum from control animals. Following BNF treatment, EROD activity was induced 12-42-fold in the arachnoid, choroid plexus, dura mater, pineal gland, pituitary, and median eminence. Western blot analysis revealed CYP1A1 to be induced in the arachnoid, dura mater, choroid plexus, pineal gland, and pituitary, while CYP1A2 was undetectable. No induction of CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 protein was observed in brain microsomes from the olfactory bulb, cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, or brainstem following BNF treatment, providing that the arachnoid membranes and choroid plexus had been carefully removed prior to brain dissection. Neither CYP1A1, 1A2 protein, nor EROD activity were detected in purified brain mitochondria, regardless of treatment or region. In conclusion, catalytically active CYP1A1 is located in the meninges as well as certain circumventricular organs, is inducible by BNF, and appears to be absent or expressed constitutively at very low levels in the majority of the brain parenchyma. The localization of CYP1A1 in the blood-CSF barrier and circumventricular tissues likely plays a role in protecting the brain from xenobiotics.
9772339	In the present investigations the viral transneuronal labeling method, which is able to reveal hierarchial chains of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, was applied to identify sites in the CNS connected with the ovary and presumably involved in the control of ovarian functions. Pseudorabies virus was injected into the ovaries of rats and a few days later (at various times after the injection) the spinal cord and brain were examined for virus-infected neurons from the ovary. The virus-labeled nerve cells were identified by immunocytochemistry using polyclonal antiviral antibody. Virus-labeled neurons were detected both in the spinal cord and the brain. In the spinal cord such elements were observed in the intermediolateral cell column, in the dorsal horn close to the marginal zone and in the central autonomic nucleus. In the medulla oblongata and pons, neurons of several nuclei and cell groups (area postrema, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal vagal complex, nucleus ambiguus, paragigantocellular nucleus, parapyramidal nucleus, A1, A5 and A7 cell groups, caudal raphe nuclei, locus ceruleus, subceruleus nucleus, Barrington's nucleus, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus) were found to be transneuronally labeled. In the mesencephalon, the ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal gray matter contained virus-labeled neurons. In the diencephalon, a very intensive cell body labeling was observed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and a few virus-infected neurons could be detected in the lateral and dorsal hypothalamus, in the arcuate nucleus, zona incerta, perifornical area and in the anterior hypothalamus. Concerning the telencephalic structures, virus-labeled cells were found in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in the central amygdala nucleus. These findings provide the first neuromorphological evidence for the existence of a multisynaptic neuronal pathway between the ovary and the CNS, and give a detailed account of the structures involved in this pathway.
9797073	The neurological mutant 'Purkinje cell degeneration' (pcd) is characterized by a primary degeneration of Purkinje cells, as well as by retrograde and secondary partial degeneration of cerebellar granule cells and inferior olivary neurons, and can be considered as an animal model of human degenerative ataxias. The serotonin (5-HT) innervation was examined in wild type and pcd mice, by quantifying 5-HT uptake sites, or transporters, using [3H]citalopram binding autoradiography. In both wild type and pcd mutants, the highest densities of 5-HT transporters were in mesencephalic and rostral pontine regions, in limbic structures, in hypothalamus and in discrete thalamic divisions, while the lowest labelling was found in cerebellum and brainstem reticular formation. In pcd mice, although [3H]citalopram labelling was higher in cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei, when binding densities were corrected for surface area, the up-regulation of 5-HT transporters was present only in deep cerebellar nuclei. Also, higher labelling was found in nuclei raphe dorsalis and medialis, in ventral divisions of rostral neostriatum, caudal neostriatum, rostral globus pallidus, posteromedial amygdaloid nucleus, septum, olfactory tubercles, vertical limb of Broca's diagonal band, periventricular, latero-ventral and medio-ventral thalamic nuclei, medial geniculate nucleus, anterior hypothalamus and entorhinal cortex. The results indicate a relative integrity of the 5-HT innervation, but with a reorganization of serotoninergic terminals in the cerebellum, in particular in the deep cerebellar nuclei. This suggests that in progressive cerebellar degeneration, as found in the pcd mutant, the modified 5-HT system may still participate in motor functions by exerting an overall modulation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission, but the availability of 5-HT may be altered in defined brain targets, as is the case for other spontaneous cerebellar mutants, in particular for the 'Lurcher' mutant mouse, a model of human olivopontocerebellar atrophy.
9802702	Although caffeine is the most widely used central nervous system stimulant, the neuronal populations and pathways mediating its stimulant effects are not well understood. Using c-Fos protein as a marker for neuronal activation, the present study investigated the pattern of c-Fos induction at 2 hours after low locomotor-stimulant doses (1, 5, 10, and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) of caffeine and compared them with those after a higher dose (75 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline injection in adult male rats. Fos-immunoreactive neurons were counted in selected nuclei across the entire brain. Caffeine induced an increase in locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner up to doses of 30 mg/kg and a decline at 75 mg/kg. Quantitative analysis of Fos-immunoreactive neurons indicated that no structures showed significant Fos expression at doses below 75 mg/kg or a biphasic pattern of Fos expression, as in locomotion. In contrast, caffeine at 75 mg/kg induced a significant increase compared with the saline condition in the number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the majority of structures examined. The structures included the striatum, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata and autonomic and limbic structures including the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamus, paraventricular thalamic nuclei, parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. The locomotor-enhancing effects of low doses of caffeine did not appear to be associated with significant Fos expression in the rat brain.
9807014	The feather crest on the head of the White Crested Polish Chicken covers a bony protuberance, a skull modification typical of crested chickens. The telencephalon is displaced into this protuberance, giving the brain the shape of an hour-glass. Allometric comparison (i.e., consideration of the influence of body weight on brain size) shows that the brain is relatively larger in crested chickens. This enlargement is partly due to enlarged ventricles, which are observed in some individuals. Among the brain structures measured, the tegmentum, cerebellum, tectum, paleostriatum, hippocampus, septum and olfactory bulb are not significantly larger in White Crested Polish chickens in comparison to those structures in seven uncrested chicken breeds; the optic tract, diencephalon, telencephalon, accessory hyperstriatum, dorsal and ventral hyperstriatum, and neostriatum, however, are significantly enlarged in this breed.
9822147	The A2A adenosine receptor (A2A-AR) transcript and radioligand binding sites have a distinct distribution in rat brain, restricted primarily to the striatum, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercles. We describe here the use of purified recombinant human A2A-ARs to generate a monoclonal antibody that has been used to better resolve the distribution of A2A-ARs in rat brain. The antibody can detect 1 ng of purified recombinant receptor by Western blotting and is potent (EC50 = 0.62 microg/ml) and highly selective for the A2A-AR subtype. By Western blotting, the apparent molecular mass of recombinant and rat striatal receptors shifts upon deglycosylation from 43-48 to 42 kilodaltons. Analyses of chimeric A1/A2A-ARs and synthesis of a blocking peptide pinpointed the epitope (SQPLPGER) of the antibody to the center of the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Incubation of rat striatal membranes with antibody reduces receptor coupling to G-proteins. In rat brain, dense A2A-AR-like immunoreactivity that is eliminated by the blocking peptide was found in the neuropil of the striatum, nucleus accumbens (rostral pole, core and shell), cell bridges of the striatum, olfactory tubercles, and areas of extended amygdala with somewhat lighter labeling in the globus pallidus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Light perikaryal labeling was found in other areas of the brain, including the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum, and portions of the hindbrain. The observed distribution of A2A-AR immunoreactivity throughout the neuraxis is consistent with the receptors' role in modulating dopaminergic neurotransmission and central control of cardiovascular function.
9825937	The branching of dendrites of pyramidal neurons in premotor frontal, motor and limbic cortex have been identified by us using Golgi technique to be less in Rett Syndrome (RS) brains than in non-Rett control brains. Decreased dendritic branching per se is not pathognomonic of a particular condition and has been reported in numerous disorders associated with mental retardation. This study was designed to test whether the dendritic alterations in Rett Syndrome are the same or different from the alterations present in Down Syndrome (DS), 1 specific form of mental retardation. Sections from Brodmann's areas 6, 4, 20, 43, 28, and 17 of premotor frontal, motor cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, hippocampal formation and the striate cortex from 16 Rett brains, 9 non-Rett brains and 9 Down's brains were prepared for dendrite analysis using the rapid Golgi technique. Drawings of apical and basilar dendrites of pyramidal neurons from 2 cortical layers and Cal were submitted to Sholl analysis. The analyses of Rett brains were compared with the analyses of the Trisomy 21 brains using the repeated measures analysis of covariance, with age as a covariate. The studies demonstrate in our sample that basal dendrites of layer III and V of frontal, layer IV of subiculum, and layer V of motor cortex and apical dendrites of layer III of frontal cortex have a significantly reduced dendritic arborization in RS compared with Trisomy 21. This study suggests that the cortical distribution of the dendritic alterations is specific for Rett Syndrome, and that the premotor frontal, motor and subicular cortex are preferentially involved in the, as yet, undefined process which affects brain growth and function in RS.
9826276	The projections of the septum of the lizard Podarcis hispanica (Lacertidae) were studied by combining retrograde and anterograde neuroanatomical tracing. The results confirm the classification of septal nuclei into three main divisions. The nuclei composing the central septal division (anterior, lateral, medial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral nuclei) displayed differential projections to the basal telencephalon, preoptic and anterior hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamic area, dorsal hypothalamus, mammillary complex, dorsomedial anterior thalamus, ventral tegmental area, interpeduncular nucleus, raphe nucleus, torus semicircularis pars laminaris, reptilian A8 nucleus/substantia nigra and central gray. For instance, only the medial septal nucleus projected substantially to the thalamus whereas the anterior septum was the only nucleus projecting to the caudal midbrain including the central gray. The anterior and lateral septal nuclei also differ in the way in which their projection to the preoptic hypothalamus terminated. The midline septal division is composed of the dorsal septal nucleus, nucleus septalis impar and nucleus of the posterior pallial commissure. The latter two nuclei projected to the lateral habenula and, at least the nucleus of the posterior pallial commissure, to the mammillary complex. The dorsal septal nucleus projected to the preoptic and periventricular hypothalamus and the anterior thalamus, but its central part seemed to project to the caudal midbrain (up to the midbrain central gray). Finally, the ventromedial septal division (ventromedial septal nucleus) showed a massive projection to the anterior and the lateral tuberomammillary hypothalamus. Data on the connections of the septum of P. hispanica and Gecko gekko are discussed from a comparative point of view and used for better understanding of the functional anatomy of the tetrapodian septum.
9832441	The comparative distributions of the vasopressin V1b receptor (V1bR) and the oxytocin receptor (OTR) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are described in male rat brain using in situ hybridization histochemistry. V1bR transcripts were present in forebrain and hypothalamus and were less abundant in mid- and hindbrain regions, similar to the gradient observed with OTR transcripts. Microscopic analyses indicated that V1bR expressing cells typically demonstrated the morphology of neurons and confirmed V1bR gene expression in regions including the olfactory bulb, supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, piriform and entorhinal cortices, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Most regions that expressed V1bR mRNA also expressed OTR mRNA, although OTR gene expression was much more extensive than that of the V1bR. V1bR and OTR mRNA distributions were distinct from each other and from that of the V1a receptor mRNA in brain. A few brain regions express only V1bR transcripts such as the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb. Other brain regions, such as the fields of Ammon's horn, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, and the piriform cortex express mRNAs that encode all three receptor subtypes (V1a, V1b, and OTR), whereas brain areas including the red nucleus and supraoptic nucleus express V1bR and OTR transcripts only. These data suggest functional specialization of the V1b, OTR and V1a receptors in brain.
9851682	Ochratoxin A (OTA) a chlorodihydro-isocoumarin linked through an amide bond to phenylalanine, is a mycotoxin found as a contaminant in foodstuffs and shown to be nephrotoxic, teratogenic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic in rodents. Ochratoxin A is known to induce teratogenic effects in neonates (rats and mice) exposed in utero, characterised by microcephaly and modification of the brain levels of free amino acids. Since OTA has been found to accumulate in the brain according to the duration of exposure to doses in the range of natural contamination of feedstuffs, experiments were designed to determine more precisely the structural target of OTA in the brain. After intracerebral injection, OTA (403 ng/10 microl) was not found in the following parts of the brain: the frontal cortex (FC), striatum (ST), ventral mesencephalon (VM) and the cerebellum (CB) in contrast to the rest of the brain, probably due to the detection limit of 0.1 ng/g of tissue. However lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was increased in extracellular space in the VM to a greater extent than in the rest of the brain, indicating that this structure could be one of the targets of OTA in the brain. Contents of free amino acids were morever similarly modified in the VM and in the rest of the brain. Male rats were given OTA (289 microg/kg per 24 h) by gastric intubation for 8 days and the main brain structures analysed for OTA content and cytotoxicity. OTA was found in the following structures in decreasing order: rest of the brain (50.3%), cerebellum (34.4%), VM (5.1%), striatum (3.3%) and hippocampus (2.9%) of the total OTA amount found in the brain, which represents 0.022% to 0.028% of the given dose. Interestingly cytotoxicity as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the extracellular space was much more pronounced in the VM, hippocampus, and striatum than in the cerebellum, whereas no cytotoxicity was observed in the rest of the brain. Similarly deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity in relation to possible necrotic cells was increased in the VM and cerebellum. Altogether these results designated the ventral mesencephalon, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum as the main OTA-targets in the brain of adult rats and excluded the rest of the brain.
9873205	Antibodies directed to amino acids 877-894 (M-18) and 32-51 (K-20) were used to localize leptin receptor by immunocytochemistry in mouse brain. Both antibodies stained several hypothalamic nuclei (paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, supraoptic retrochiasmatic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, ventral and dorsal premammillary nuclei), the thalamic and amygdaloid nuclei, neurons of the neocortex and archicortex and the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. While M-18 staining was concentrated in the Golgi area, with K-20 it was dispersed in the cytoplasm. Glial cells were stained only by K-20. These results suggest that the trans-membrane forms of the receptor are concentrated at the membrane level of the Golgi complex of neurons and in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus while the soluble form is dispersed in their cytoplasm. Glial cells express only the soluble form.
9881299	Postnatal changes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 7 and beta 2 subunits mRNAs were investigated in rat brain using ribonuclease protection assay. Multiple developmental patterns were observed: (1) transient expression during the first few postnatal weeks; alpha 2 in the hippocampus and brain stem, alpha 3 in the striatum, cerebellum and cortex, alpha 4 in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum, alpha 7 in the cerebellum and beta 2 in the striatum. (2) Constant expression across development; alpha 2 and alpha 3 in the thalamus, alpha 4 in the cortex, thalamus and brain stem, alpha 7 in the thalamus and brain stem and beta 2 in all brain regions except striatum. (3) Non-detection across development; alpha 2 in the cortex, striatum and cerebellum. (4) Increase with age; alpha 7 in the cortex and hippocampus. (5) Bell-shaped development; alpha 7 in the striatum. Postnatal changes of nAChR isoforms in different brain regions of rat were investigated by receptor binding assays. The developmental patterns of [3H]epibatidine and (-)-[3H]nicotine binding sites were similar to each other in each brain region, but different from that of [3H] alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites. No obvious correlation was observed between the developmental patterns of [3H] alpha-bungarotoxin, [3H]epibatidine and (-)-[3H]nicotine binding sites and corresponding subunits mRNAs. These results indicate that multiple mechanisms are involved in changes of gene expression of nAChRs subunits in the brain of developing rats.
9881865	Susceptibility to develop Parkinson's disease has been linked to abnormalities of P450 enzyme function. Multiple P450 enzymes are expressed in brain but the relationship of these to Parkinson's disease is unknown. We have investigated the expression of P450 enzymes in the rat substantia nigra and their co-localization in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and astrocytes. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-peptide antisera against the following P450 enzymes: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1/2, CYP2C12, CYP2C13/2C6, CYP2D1, CYP2D4, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, CYP3A2 and NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase. Immunoreactivity in nigral cells was found only for CYP2E1 and CYP2C13/2C6. CYP2E1 immunoreactivity was localized to many midbrain nuclei including the substantia nigra pars compacta but not the substantia nigra pars reticulata while immunoreactivity to CYP2C13/2C6 was found in the substantia nigra pars compacta, substantia nigra pars reticulata and many other midbrain nuclei. Sections of rat midbrain double labelled for either CYP2E1 or CYP2C13/2C6 and tyrosine hydroxylase or glial fibrillary acidic protein were examined for co-localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy. CYP2E1 and CYP2C13/2C6 immunoreactivity was found in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta but not in glial cells. CYP2C13/2C6, but not CYP2E1, was also found in non-glial, non-tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Isoniazid induction increased CYP2E1 fluorescence signal intensity from nigral dopaminergic neurons. At least two P450 enzymes are found in nigral dopamine containing cells and one, namely CYP2E1, is selectively localized to this cell population. CYP2E1 is a potent generator of free radicals which may contribute to nigral pathology in Parkinson's disease. The expression of CYP2E1 in dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra raises the possibility of a causal association with Parkinson's disease.
9885786	The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors are members of the D2 subfamily that includes the D2, D3 and D4 receptor. In the rat, the D3 receptor exhibits a distribution restricted to mesolimbic regions with little overlap with the D2 receptor. Receptor binding and nonisotopic in situ hybridization were used to study the distribution of the D3 receptors and neurons positive for D3 mRNA in comparison to the D2 receptor/mRNA in subcortical regions of the human brain. D2 binding sites were detected in all brain areas studied, with the highest concentration found in the striatum followed by the nucleus accumbens, external segment of the globus pallidus, substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, medial preoptic area and tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. In most areas the presence of D2 receptor sites coincided with the presence of neurons positive for its mRNA. D3 binding sites and D3 mRNA positive neurons were most abundant in the limbic striatum and efferent structures, such as the nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, internal segment of the globus pallidus, anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus, and rostral pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. One important difference from the rat is that D3 receptors were virtually absent in the ventral tegmental area. D3 receptor and D3 mRNA positive neurons were observed in sensory, hormonal, and association regions such as the nucleus basalis, anteroventral, mediodorsal, and geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, mammillary nuclei, the basolateral, basomedial, and cortical nuclei of the amygdala. As revealed by simultaneous labeling for D3 and D2 mRNA, D3 mRNA was often expressed in D2 mRNA positive neurons. Neurons that solely expressed D2 mRNA were numerous and regionally widespread, whereas only occasional D3-positive-D2-negative cells were observed. The regions of relatively higher expression of the D3 receptor and its mRNA appeared linked through functional circuits, but co-expression of D2 and D3 mRNA suggests a functional convergence in many regions of the signals mediated by the two receptor subtypes.
9886047	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is derived from the peptide precursor pre-pro-glucagon (PPG) by enzymatic cleavage and acts via its receptor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). By using riboprobes complementary to PPG and GLP-1R, we described the distribution of PPG and GLP-1R messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the central nervous system of the rat. PPG mRNA-expressing perikarya were restricted to the nucleus of the solitary tact or to the dorsal and ventral medulla and olfactory bulb. GLP-1R mRNA was detected in numerous brain regions, including the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb; temporal cortex; caudal hippocampus; lateral septum; amygdala; nucleus accumbens; ventral pallium; nucleus basalis Meynert; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; preoptic area; paraventricular, supraoptic, arcuate, and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus; lateral habenula; zona incerta; substantia innominata; posterior thalamic nuclei; ventral tegmental area; dorsal tegmental, posterodorsal tegmental, and interpeduncular nuclei; substantia nigra, central gray; raphe nuclei; parabrachial nuclei; locus ceruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract; area postrema; dorsal nucleus of the vagus; lateral reticular nucleus; and spinal cord. These studies, in addition to describing the sites of GLP-1 and GLP-1R synthesis, suggest that the efferent connections from the nucleus of the solitary tract are more widespread than previously reported. Although the current role of GLP-1 in regulating neuronal physiology is not known, these studies provide detailed information about the sites of GLP-1 synthesis and potential sites of action, an important first step in evaluating the function of GLP-1 in the brain. The widespread distribution of GLP-1R mRNA-containing cells strongly suggests that GLP-1 not only functions as a satiety factor but also acts as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in anatomically and functionally distinct areas of the central nervous system.
9890431	Neurotransmitter transporters are involved in termination of the synaptic neurotransmission and are implicated as the sites of action of antidepressant medicines and illicit drugs. In addition to their function in neurotransmission, neurotransmitter transporters play a key role in neuroregulation and brain development. In this report, the developmental distribution of the "orphan" transporter NTT4, whose substrate has not yet been shown, is described. Immunohistochemical studies have previously shown NTT4 to be specifically and widely localized to the central nervous system. In this report, the distribution of NTT4 in brain areas enriched in glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic innervations is further substantiated. NTT4 is detected beginning at E18 in various parts of the rat brain, including the cerebral cortex, fimbria hippocampi, fornix, lateral lemniscus, anterior commissure, and spinal cord. At E18, strong immunoreactivity of NTT4 is observed in the cortical subplate and marginal layers that later develops into the fimbria hippocampi, and at P22, the expression of NTT4 in the hippocampal formation reaches the mature form. The expression of NTT4 in the spinal cord begins at E18 in the ventral white matter. Heavy staining for NTT4 is observed in the substantia nigra since birth and through all time points examined. Transient immunoreactivity is observed in the inferior colliculus, reaching maximal expression at P10, whereas the superior colliculus commences to express NTT4 only after this time point. The globus pallidus is highly stained after birth, and the caudate putamen shows strong staining for NTT4 only at P22. In the adult rat brain, NTT4 is strongly expressed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, substantia nigra, pontine nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The developmental distribution of NTT4 suggests involvement in central nervous system maturation.
9892705	We determined the immunohistochemical distributions of orexin-A and orexin-B, hypothalamic peptides that function in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Orexin-A and -B neurons were restricted to the lateral and posterior hypothalamus, whereas both orexin-A and -B nerve fibers projected widely into the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Dense populations of orexin-containing fibers were present in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, central gray, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus. Moderate numbers of these fibers were found in the olfactory bulb, insular, infralimbic and prelimbic cortex, amygdala, ventral, and dorsolateral parts of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus except the lateral magnocellular division, arcuate nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Small numbers of orexin fibers were present in the perirhinal, motor and sensory cortex, hippocampus, and supraoptic nucleus, and a very small number in the lateral magnocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus. Intracerebroventricular injections of orexins induced c-fos expression in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, locus coeruleus, arcuate nucleus, central gray, raphe nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, and paraventricular nucleus except the lateral magnocellular division. The unique neuronal distribution of orexins and their functional activation of neural circuits suggest specific complex roles of the peptides in autonomic and neuroendocrine control.
9932322	The territories of the central branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were examined in 21 injected human brains. It was noted that these central arteries supplied: the caudate nucleus (dorsolateral half of the rostral part of its head; the entire caudal part of the head; the body and rostral portion of the tail in some cases), the putamen (dorsolateral part of its rostral portion, the remainder of the putamen, except the most caudal part occasionally), the globus pallidus (the entire lateral segment, except the ventrorostral and, sometimes, the most caudal part), the basal forebrain (lateral parts of the basal nucleus of Meynert and the nucleus of the diagonal band, as well as fiber bundles in this region), the internal capsule (dorsal and ventrocaudal part of the anterior limb, dorsal part of the genu, dorsal and ventrorostral part of the posterior limb), the corona radiata (a narrow strip close to the internal capsule) and the cerebral cortex (the caudal orbitofrontal cortex occasionally). The presented data may have certain neuroradiologic, neurologic and neurosurgical significance.
9933786	The distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivity in the brain and hypophysis of the arctic lamprey, Lethenteron japonica, was studied by the use of polyclonal anti-synthetic porcine NPY antibody. Immunoreactivity was found throughout the brain, with varied densities among different areas. NPY-positive cell bodies were located in the dorsal pallium of the telencephalon; in the preoptic area, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus of the diencephalon; in the tegmentum of the mesencephalon; and in the octavolateralis nucleus, the middle reticular nucleus, and the vagal motor nucleus of the rhombencephalon. The majority of the NPY-positive cells in the thalamus and in the hypothalamus appeared as cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons. NPY-positive fibers were widely distributed in the brain and locally dense in the ventromedial part of the lateral pallium, in the posterior part of the interpeduncular nucleus, and in the raphe region. Conversely, they were less dense or well scattered in the olfactory bulb, the lateral pallium except for its ventromedial part, and the optic tectum. NPY-positive innervation in the neurohypophysis was evident, suggesting that involvement of NPY-related substance in the hypothalamo-hypophysial system had occurred in an early stage of vertebrate evolution.
9934997	S100A6 (calcyclin) is a member of the large S100 Ca2+-binding protein family, considered to activate several processes along the calcium signal transduction pathway including the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, secretion, and exocytosis. In the present study, the distribution of S100A6 in the rat nervous system was examined by immunohistochemistry with a goat antiserum against recombinant human S100A6, which recognizes the rat S100A6 homologue. The main S100A6-immunoreactive elements were 1) neuronal somata and dendrites in some specific regions of the limbic system (e.g., the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, ventral tip of the CA1-subicular border region, entorhinal cortex, and parasubiculum), most of which were identified as a subpopulation of pyramidal cells; 2) olfactory receptor cells and olfactory nerve fibers and terminals in the olfactory bulb; 3) some tracts of the hindbrain and spinal cord (e.g., the spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract, dorsal root fibers, and the tract of Lissauer) and their terminals (e.g., the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, marginal zone, substantia gelatinosa, and proper sensory nucleus of the dorsal horn), as well as some sensory neurons of their origins in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia; 4) a subpopulation of astrocytes in the white matter (e.g., the corpus callosum, cingulum, external capsule, internal capsule, and fimbria of the hippocampus) and around the ventricles; 5) some ependymal cells, especially around the central canal; and 6) Schwann cells. These results will improve our understanding of the diverse function of Ca2+-binding proteins in the CNS.
10024342	Integrins are a diverse family of heterodimeric (alphabeta) adhesion receptors recently shown to be concentrated within synapses and involved in the consolidation of long-term potentiation. Whether neuronal types or anatomical systems in the adult rat brain are coded by integrin type was studied in the present experiments by mapping the relative densities of mRNAs for nine alpha and four beta subunits. Expression patterns were markedly different and in some regions complementary. General results and areas of notable labeling were as follows: alpha1-limited neuronal expression, neocortical layer V, hippocampal CA3; alpha3 and alpha5-diffuse neuronal and glial labeling, Purkinje cells, hippocampal stratum pyramidale, locus coeruleus (alpha3); alpha4- discrete limbic regions, olfactory cortical layer II, hippocampal CA2; alpha6-most prominently neuronal, neocortical subplate, endopiriform, subiculum; alpha7-discrete, all neocortical layers, hippocampal granule cells and CA3, cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells, all efferent cranial nerve nuclei; alpha8-discrete neuronal, deep cortex, hippocampal CA1, basolateral amygdala, striatum; alphaV-all cortical layers, striatum, Purkinje cells; beta4-dentate gyrus granule cells; beta5-broadly distributed, neocortex, medial amygdala, cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells, efferent cranial nerve nuclei; alpha2, beta2, and beta3-mRNAs not detected. These results establish that brain subfields express different balances of integrin subunits and thus different integrin receptors. Such variations will determine which matrix proteins are recognized by neurons and the types of intraneuronal signaling generated by matrix binding. They also could generate important differences in synaptic plasticity across brain systems.
10048485	In this paper, we report the sequences of 100 cDNA clones newly determined from a set of size-fractionated human brain cDNA libraries and predict the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0819 to KIAA0918. These cDNA clones were selected on the basis of their coding potentials of large proteins (50 kDa and more) by using in vitro transcription/translation assays. The sequence data showed that the average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames are 4.4 kb and 2.5 kb (831 amino acid residues), respectively. Homology and motif/domain searches against the public databases indicated that the predicted coding sequences of 83 genes were similar to those of known genes, 59% of which (49 genes) were categorized as coding for proteins functionally related to cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility and nucleic acid management. The chromosomal locations and the expression profiles of all the genes were also examined. For 54 clones including brain-specific ones, the mRNA levels were further examined among 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, and fetal brain.
10065902	Dysfunction of brain 5-hydroxytryptaminergic systems has been associated with several neurological and psychiatric diseases which may have a viral aetiology. The effect of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A and 5-HT2A) receptors in mouse brain has been assessed by membrane homogenate binding and autoradiography. Adult mice were injected with saline or virus and brains removed 2, 6, 14, 22 and 35 days after infection. 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were characterised by saturation studies using [3H] 8-OH-DPAT and [3H] Ketanserin respectively. SFV infection increased 5-HT1A receptor numbers by up to 80% in the cortex on days 6, 14, and 22 but had no effect on Bmax in the midbrain, pons/medulla and the hypothalamus. SFV infection did not affect 5-HT2A receptor number in any of the brain regions studied and the affinity (Kd) of either ligand for 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A receptors was unaffected. Autoradiographic mapping of 5-HT1A receptors in SFV-infected brain showed substantially higher binding in nucleus accumbens, tenia tecta, septohippocampal nucleus, septum, medial and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, anterioventral preoptic nucleus, hippocampus, interpeduncular nucleus, frontal, lateral orbital, and entorhinal cortex and claustrum on days 6 and 14. Elevated binding persisted in tenia tecta, frontal, lateral orbital, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampal formation to day 22. Autoradiography of 5-HT2A receptors using [3H] Ketanserin showed no difference in the binding in SFV-infected brains. A decrease in plasma corticosterone levels in SFV-infected mice was observed on post infection days 6 and 22. These results show SFV infection induces a regionally selective upregulation of 5-HT1A but not 5-HT2A receptors.
10082856	There is considerable evidence for a role of stressful experiences in psychosomatic disorders in humans, but the mechanisms leading to altered responsivity and the relative contributions of central and peripheral neuronal changes, however, are still under debate. To investigate the contribution of specific brain areas to sensitized responsivity, rats were exposed to a single brief session of inescapable footshocks (preshocked) or no shocks (control) in a gridcage. Two weeks later, an electrified prod was inserted in the home cage for 15 min and the behaviour recorded. One hour later rats were perfused and brain sections were stained for Fos protein immunoreactivity. The number of Fos positive neurons was quantified in 27 brain areas. No significant difference in behaviour was found between the groups during the shock prod challenge. A significantly higher number of Fos positive neurons was found in preshocked rats compared to controls in the following brain areas: agranular insular cortex, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, basolateral amygdala, CA1 area of the hippocampus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, dorsolateral central grey, locus coeruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus. We conclude that altered reactivity to stressful challenges in brain areas involved in neuroendocrine and autonomic control may play a role in long-term sensitization of neuroendocrine and autonomic responses in preshocked rats under conditions where behavioural sensitization is not expressed.
10082895	P450 enzymes in the CYP2D subfamily have been suggested to contribute to the susceptibility of individuals in developing Parkinson's disease. We have used specific anti-peptide antisera and peroxidase immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of CYP2D enzymes in the rat brain and some possible factors that may affect their regulation. In male Wistar rats, CYP2D1 was not detected in the basal ganglia or in any other brain region. CYP2D2 was weakly expressed within neurones of the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and interpeduncular nucleus as well as in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, red nucleus and pontine nucleus. CYP2D3 and CYP2D4 were absent from the basal ganglia, although moderate amounts of CYP2D3 were detected within fibres of the oculomotor root, and very low levels of CYP2D4 were present in white matter tracts. In contrast, CYP2D5 was extensively expressed in the basal ganglia, including neurones in the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and interpeduncular nucleus, as well as other areas of the brain, including the ventral tegmental area, piriform cortex, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, medial habenular nucleus, thalamic nucleus and pontine nucleus. Lesioning of the nigro-striatal tract to cause almost a complete loss of tyrosine hydroxylase containing neurones in the substantia nigra, also reduced the number of neurones expressing CYP2D5 by 50%, indicating that CYP2D5 is expressed in dopaminergic neurones. Castration of pre-pubertal or adult Wistar rats had no effect on the number of CYP2D5-positive neurones in the substantia nigra. Although Dark Agouti rats lack hepatic CYP2D2, expression in the midbrain was similar to that of Wistar rats; furthermore, there was no difference in expression or distribution between male and female rats. In contrast to naive rats, extensive expression of CYP2D4 was found throughout the basal ganglia and in other brain nuclei in Wistar rats treated with not only clozapine, but also saline, suggesting that CYP2D4 may be induced as a result of mild stress. The function of CYP2D enzymes in the brain remains unknown, but their selective localisation suggests a physiological role in neuronal activity and in adaptation to abnormal situations.
10095086	Serine proteases are considered to play several important roles in the brain. In an attempt to find novel brain-specific serine proteases (BSSPs), motopsin (PRSS-12) was cloned from a mouse brain cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the postnatal 10-day mouse brain contained the most amount of motopsin mRNA. At this developmental stage, in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that motopsin mRNA was specifically expressed in the following regions: cerebral cortical layers II/III, V and VIb, endopiriform cortex and the limbic system, particularly in the CA1 region of the hippocampal formation. In addition, in the brainstem, the oculomotor nucleus, trochlear nucleus, mecencephalic and motor nuclei of trigeminal nerve (N), abducens nucleus, facial nucleus, nucleus of the raphe pontis, dorsoral motor nucleus of vagal N, hypoglossal nucleus and ambiguus nucleus showed motopsin mRNA expression. Expression was also found in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The above findings strongly suggest that neurons in almost all motor nuclei, particularly in the brainstem and spinal cord, express motopsin mRNA, and that motopsin seems to have a close relation to the functional role of efferent neurons.
10098939	Endomorphins are endogenous peptides that have high affinity and selectivity for the mu-opiate receptor and potent analgesic activity. The distributions of endomorphin 1 (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH2; EM1) and endomorphin 2 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH2; EM2) in the rat central nervous system were determined by immunocytochemistry with two antisera, each demonstrating clear preference for the target antigen. Perikarya expressing EM2-like immunoreactivity were present in the posterior hypothalamus, whereas those expressing EM1-like immunoreactivity were present in both the posterior hypothalamus and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). EM1-like immunoreactivity was more widely and densely distributed throughout the brain than was EM2-like immunoreactivity, whereas EM2-like immunoreactivity was more prevalent in the spinal cord than was EM1-like immunoreactivity. The greatest density of EM1-like-immunoreactive fibers was detected in the parabrachial nucleus and the NTS, with notable staining in the septum, diagonal band, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, organum vasculosum, nucleus of Meynert, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, posterior hypothalamic nucleus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala. The greatest density of EM2-like-immunoreactive fibers was detected in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord dorsal horn and the nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract. The overall pattern of immunoreactivities was similar in rat, mouse, and guinea pig, but some differences were observed. In many but not in all locations, immunoreactive fibers were prominently present in regions in which mu receptors are reported to be concentrated. The neuroanatomical results suggest that endomorphins participate in modulating nociceptive and autonomic nervous system processes and responsiveness to stress.
10192706	The neuropathological findings in a neonatal case of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS) were described. Two different types of lesions were revealed in the affected brain. The first type was classified as perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, associated with cyanotic congenital heart anomalies: subarachnoideal, intraventricular, and parenchymal hemorrhage, and multiple necrosis in the cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, mammillary bodies and dentate nucleus. This type may be non-specific and common in premature babies dying soon after birth. On the other hand, the second type was classified as congenital dysgenesis of the brain: microbrachycephaly, immature or simple convolution pattern of the cerebral gyri, thickened leptomeninges, persistent subpial granule cells, hypoplasia of the anterior thalamic nuclei, neurohypophysis, lateral geniculate body, cerebral peduncle, ventral pons and cerebellar internal granular layer, and heterotopic cell nests in the cerebellar white matter. This type may indicate that the maturation of the brain can be disturbed in the fetal period, particularly in the mid-gestational period. In conclusion, pathognomonic or specific changes of CDLS might be absent in the brain. However, congenital dysgenesis of the brain, especially that found in the diencephalon and the cortico-ponto-cerebellar system, may constitute morphologic evidence explaining the severe growth retardation and neurological abnormalities in CDLS.
10199628	The airpuff startle stimulus elicits both a behavioral and a concurrent sympathetic and parasympathetic activation, which have been shown to differ between inbred normotensive Wistar Kyoto and Spontaneously Hypertensive rat strains. Neither the brain sites responsible for the cardiovascular and motor responses, nor the origins of the strain differential responses, have yet been elucidated. The goals of the present study were (i) to define the neuronal pattern of immunoreactive Fos expression to the airpuff stimulus, and (ii) to determine whether this pattern of expression differed between the two contrasting inbred rat strains, thereby relating to observed differences in response. The airpuff stimulus induced Fos protein expression in discrete nuclei within the hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, pons and medulla of both strains, with strain-dependent differences evident in the hypothalamus (lateral, ventromedial and dorsomedial), pons (locus coeruleus) and medulla (rostroventrolateral medulla and solitary tract nuclei). To remove Fos expression arising from test chamber novelty, which was observed in both strains, a subset of animals was habituated to the test chamber for four days prior to testing. Habituation reduced Fos expression in several brain regions in the Wistar Kyoto, but failed to do so in the Spontaneously Hypertensive rat. The present results are the first to identify a set of brain regions likely to be responsible for the mediation of the cardiovascular and motor responses associated with the airpuff startle stimulus. Several of the identified areas contain neurotransmitters implicated by prior pharmacological studies. Further, these data identify differences in the degree of activation of specific neuronal structures that probably underlie strain differences in the cardiovascular response to the airpuff. Additionally, the results provide a cellular correlate to reported deficits in behavioral habituation by the Spontaneously Hypertensive rat and suggest a potentially profound difference between the ability of these two strains to adapt to repeated mild stress stimuli.
10200303	The central role of the hypothalamus in the origination and/or processing of feeding-related stimuli may be modulated by the activity of other functional areas of the brain including the insular cortex (involved in enteroceptive monitoring) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in the inhibition of inappropriate response tendencies). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a marker of neuronal activity, was measured in 11 healthy, normal-weight men by using positron emission tomography in a state of hunger (after 36-h fast) and a state of satiation (after a liquid meal). Hunger was associated with significantly increased rCBF in the vicinity of the hypothalamus and insular cortex and in additional paralimbic and limbic areas (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal and hippocampal formation), thalamus, caudate, precuneus, putamen, and cerebellum. Satiation was associated with increased rCBF in the vicinity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Changes in plasma insulin concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in rCBF in the insular and orbitofrontal cortex. Changes in plasma free fatty acid concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in rCBF in the anterior cingulate and positively correlated with changes in rCBF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, these findings raise the possibility that several regions of the brain participate in the regulation of hunger and satiation and that insulin and free fatty acids may be metabolic modulators of postprandial brain neuronal events. Although exploratory, the present study provides a foundation for investigating the human brain regions and cognitive operations that respond to nutritional stimuli.
10205026	Orphanin FQ (OFQ) is the endogenous agonist of the opioid receptor-like receptor (ORL-1). It and its precursor, prepro-OFQ, exhibit structural features suggestive of the opioid peptides. A cDNA encoding the OFQ precursor sequence in the rat recently has been cloned, and the authors recently generated a polyclonal antibody directed against the OFQ peptide. In the present study, the authors used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution of OFQ peptide and mRNA in the central nervous system of the adult rat. OFQ immunoreactivity and prepro-OFQ mRNA expression correlated virtually in all brain areas studied. In the forebrain, OFQ peptide and mRNA were prominent in the neocortex endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, lateral septum, ventral forebrain, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, central and medial nuclei of the amygdala, hippocampal formation, paratenial and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, medial habenula, and zona incerta. No OFQ was observed in the pineal or pituitary glands. In the brainstem, OFQ was prominent in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, nucleus of the posterior commissure, central gray, nucleus of Darkschewitsch, peripeduncular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe complex, lateral parabrachial nucleus, inferior olivary complex, vestibular nuclear complex, prepositus hypoglossus, solitary nucleus, nucleus ambiguous, caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus, and reticular formation. In the spinal cord, OFQ was observed throughout the dorsal and ventral horns. The wide distribution of this peptide provides support for its role in a multitude of functions, including not only nociception but also motor and balance control, special sensory processing, and various autonomic and physiologic processes.
10208761	This study was designed to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability characteristics of the WAG/Rij strain of rats that are an ideal model for human absence epilepsy, in controls and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures conditioned to Evans blue-albumin. For this, WAG/Rij and Wistar rats were treated with either saline or 55 mg kg-1 pentylenetetrazole i.v. after the rats were injected with 3 ml kg-1 of 2% Evans blue. Total duration of seizure activity and regional blood-brain barrier permeability changes were determined and compared with control Wistar rats. The duration of convulsive activity which was induced by pentylenetetrazole was significantly longer in WAG/Rij rats than in Wistar rats. The blood-brain barrier opening to Evans blue was not the case in saline- injected WAG/Rij or Wistar rats, but this was clearly seen in both strains after pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions. EB leakage was mainly seen in the cortical areas, cerebellum, pons, thalamus, hypothalamus and corpus striatum of WAG/Rij rat brain, whereas this was recorded in the preoptic area, bulbus olfactorius, midbrain, hypothalamus, corpus striatum and inferior colliculus of the Wistar rats brain. As a result, the WAG/Rij rats were more susceptible than Wistar rats to PTZ-induced generalised tonic-clonic convulsions, and a different pattern in PTZ-induced changes in BBB permeability was observed between WAG/Rij rats and Wistar rats.
10209238	FOS immunohistochemistry was used to map the distribution of neuronal pathways activated by hypoxia in fetal sheep. Conscious pregnant sheep were exposed to hypoxia (7-9% O2, 1-2% CO2, balance N2) for 2 h at either 100-105 days (n=5) or 130-133 days gestation (n=5); term is approximately 147 days. The hypoxia caused cessation of breathing movements at both fetal ages, and increased FOS staining in the medulla (area postrema, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, nucleus solitary tract, ventrolateral medulla); pons (locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus, lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei); midbrain (habenula, periaqueductal grey, substantia nigra, areas ventrolateral to Red Nucleus); and hypothalamus (anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei). The results were essentially the same at both gestational ages, except that hypoxia increased FOS-staining in the habenula only in the older fetuses. The presence of FOS protein in pontomedullary cardiorespiratory nuclei at 100-105 days gestation indicates that the peripheral chemoreceptors respond to hypoxia at this early age, and in the subcoeruleus and medial parabrachial regions of the pons is consistent with lesion studies suggesting these areas mediate the inhibition of fetal breathing in response to hypoxia. FOS staining in the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and habenula was unexpected, and suggests that pathways normally involved in response to noxious stimuli, or which are part of the hypothalamic 'defense' response are activated by hypoxia in the fetus. Some FOS-labelling could arise secondarily as a consequence of the cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hypoxia.
10213091	Recent studies have provided evidence for a specific role of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) in in vitro neuron differentiation, and in AT2 knock-out mice that display central neurological anomalies. The role of AT2 in brain development is currently unknown. By using radiolabeled cRNA probes for in situ hybridization histochemistry, we determined the ontogenic development of AT2 mRNA in fetal and neonatal rat brain, from 11 days of gestation (E11) to 28 days postnatal (P28). Brain AT2 mRNA is first detected in the lateral hypothalamic neuroepithelium at E13. AT2 mRNA is detected beginning at E15 in the subthalamic and hypoglossus nuclei; at E17 in the pedunculopontine nucleus, cerebellum, motor facial nucleus, and the inferior olivary complex; at E19 in the thalamus, bed nucleus of the supraoptic decussation, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, locus coeruleus, and supragenual nucleus; and at E21 in the lateral septal and medial amygdaloid nuclei, medial geniculate body, and the superior colliculus. The substantia nigra and many telencephalic and medullary nuclei express AT2 mRNA only after birth. Certain structures express AT2 mRNA strongly but transiently during embryonic life, such as the differentiating lateral hypothalamic area at E13, the superior olivary complex at E19 and E21, and the red nucleus at E15 and E17. In conclusion, during brain development, expression of AT2 mRNA appears early at E13, is strongly but transiently expressed in certain structures, and is high and persists until brain maturity in nuclei involved in motor functions and sensory integration. Our results support a dual role of AT2 during brain development in early maturation and differentiation, but also in modulation of established functions during perinatal and adult life.
10213185	The distribution of the P2X2 receptor subunit of the adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-gated ion channels was examined in the adult rat central nervous system (CNS) by using P2X2 receptor-specific antisera and riboprobe-based in situ hybridisation. P2X2 receptor mRNA expression matched the P2X2 receptor protein localisation. An extensive expression pattern was observed, including: olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, habenula, thalamic and subthalamic nuclei, caudate putamen, posteromedial amygdalo-hippocampal and amygdalo-cortical nuclei, substantia nigra pars compacta, ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei, supraoptic nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, tegmental areas, pontine nuclei, red nucleus, lateral superior olive, cochlear nuclei, spinal trigeminal nuclei, cranial motor nuclei, ventrolateral medulla, area postrema, nucleus of solitary tract, and cerebellar cortex. In the spinal cord, P2X2 receptor expression was highest in the dorsal horn, with significant neuronal labeling in the ventral horn and intermediolateral cell column. The identification of extensive P2X2 receptor immunoreactivity and mRNA distribution within the CNS demonstrated here provides a basis for the P2X receptor antagonist pharmacology reported in electrophysiological studies. These data support the role for extracellular ATP acting as a fast neurotransmitter at pre- and postsynaptic sites in processes such as sensory transmission, sensory-motor integration, motor and autonomic control, and in neuronal phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Additionally, labelling of neuroglia and fibre tracts supports a diverse role for extracellular ATP in CNS homeostasis.
10214976	The distribution in the rat brain of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide was studied by immunohistochemistry. An immunopurified, polyclonal antibody to the C terminal region of FAAH was used in these studies. The large principal neurons, such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells the hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and the mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, showed the strongest FAAH immunoreactivity. These FAAH-containing principal neurons except the mitral cells in the olfactory bulb are in close proximity with cannabinoid CB1 receptors as revealed by our previous immunohistochemical study. Moderately or lightly stained FAAH-containing neurons were also found in the amygdala, the basal ganglia, the deep cerebellar nuclei, the ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus, the optic layer and the intermediate white layer of the superior colliculus and the red nucleus in the midbrain, and motor neurons of the spinal cord. These data demonstrate that FAAH is heterogeneously distributed and this distribution exhibits considerable, although not complete, overlap with the distribution of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in rat brain.
10215161	Circulating angiotensin II acts on neurons in circumventricular organs, leading to activation of central pathways involved in blood pressure regulation and body fluid homeostasis. Apart from this primary effect, an increase in the level of circulating angiotensin II may also activate brain neurons as a secondary consequence of the associated increase in blood pressure, which will stimulate arterial baroreceptors and thus activate central neurons that are part of the central baroreceptor reflex pathway. The aim of this study was to identify the population of neurons that are activated as a consequence of the direct actions of circulating angiotensin II on the brain, independent of secondary baroreceptor-mediated effects. For this purpose, we have mapped the distribution of neurons in the brainstem and forebrain that are immunoreactive for Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) following intravenous infusion of angiotensin II in conscious rabbits with chronically denervated carotid sinus and aortic baroreceptors. The distribution was compared with that evoked by the same procedure in two separate groups of barointact rabbits, in which angiotensin II was infused either at a rate similar to that in the barodenervated group, or at a rate approximately five times greater. In barodenervated rabbits, angiotensin II infusion evoked a significant increase in Fos expression, compared to control animals infused with the vehicle solution alone, in several forebrain nuclei (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, subfornical organ, median preoptic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and suprachiasmatic nucleus), but little or no increase in Fos expression in any lower brainstem region. In barointact rabbits infused with angiotensin II at a similar rate to that in barodenervated rabbits, a similar degree of Fos expression was evoked in all of the above forebrain regions, but in addition a significantly greater degree of Fos expression was evoked in several medullary regions (nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, and ventrolateral medulla), even though the angiotensin II-evoked increase in mean arterial pressure (17 +/- 3 mmHg) was less than that evoked in the barodenervated rabbits (26 +/- 2 mmHg). In barointact rabbits infused with angiotensin II at the higher rate, the increase in mean arterial pressure was 29 +/- 3 mmHg. In these animals, the pattern of Fos expression was similar to that evoked in barointact rabbits infused at the lower rate, but the degree of Fos expression in all medullary regions and in some forebrain regions was significantly greater. The results of the present study, together with those of previous studies from our laboratory in which we determined the effects of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on brain Fos expression [Li and Dampney (1994) Neuroscience 61, 613-634; Potts et al. (1997) Neuroscience 77, 503-520], indicate that in conscious rabbits circulating angiotensin II activates primarily circumventricular neurons within the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and subfornical organ, but not the area postrema, and this in turn leads to activation of neurons in other forebrain regions, including the median preoptic, supraoptic, paraventricular and suprachiasmatic nucleus as well as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In contrast, the activation of neurons in medullary regions evoked by an increase in the level of circulating angiotensin II is primarily a secondary effect resulting from stimulation of arterial baroreceptors.
10218800	The acute self-stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle was reported to induce the expression of c-Fos, the protein product of c-fos, an immediate early gene, in the central nervous system. In the present study, we examined regional changes in c-Fos expression in several reward-related areas of rat brain in response to short- and long-term exposure to self-stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. Short-term one-hour stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle for one day after training, which evoked steady self-stimulation behavior, significantly increased the number of c-Fos-positive neurons bilaterally in all of 15 brain structures assayed, as compared to the non-stimulation control. Among them, structures showing a larger number of the stained neurons on the stimulated side were the anterior olfactory nucleus, amygdala, medial caudate-putamen complex, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminals, ventral pallidum, substantia innominata, lateral preoptic area, medial preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus rostral to the stimulating electrodes, and substantia nigra. Long-term stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle once daily for five successive days, which maintained consistently stable self-stimulation behavior, also increased the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the aforementioned structures, as compared to the control. However, the long-term rewarding stimulation diminished the increased number of labeled neurons, as compared to the short-term rewarding stimulation. Seven areas, medial caudate-putamen complex, ventral pallidum, substantia innominata, lateral preoptic area, medial preoptic area, rostral lateral hypothalamus and substantia nigra, showed asymmetrical, ipsilateral predominance after the short- and long-term stimulation. However, the stained neuron count in those areas after the long-term stimulation was reduced to less than 50% of that found after the short-term stimulation with the exception of lateral preoptic area and rostral lateral hypothalamus. The results suggest that the development of desensitization of c-Fos response may differ among the reward-relevant brain regions as a consequence of repeated self-stimulation. They also indicate that a larger portion of neurons in the lateral preoptic area and rostral lateral hypothalamus may be implicated in both short- and long-term self-stimulations of the medial forebrain bundle.
10231032	As a part of our cDNA project for deducing the coding sequence of unidentified human genes, we newly determined the sequences of 100 cDNA clones from a set of size-fractionated human brain cDNA libraries, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0919 to KIAA1018. The sequencing of these clones revealed that the average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames were 4.9 kb and 2.6 kb (882 amino acid residues), respectively. A computer search of the sequences against the public databases indicated that predicted coding sequences of 87 genes contained sequences similar to known genes, 53% of which (46 genes) were categorized as proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility and nucleic acid management. The chromosomal locations of the genes were determined by using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their mapping data were already available in the public databases. The expression profiles of all the genes among 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substania nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver were also examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
10235645	No previous report in any species has examined comprehensively the projections of the median raphe (MR) nucleus with modern tracing techniques. The present report represents an in depth analysis of the projections of MR by use of the anterograde anatomical tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. MR fibers descend along the midline within the brainstem and mainly ascend within the medial forebrain bundle in the forebrain. MR fibers distribute densely to the following brainstem/forebrain sites: caudal raphe nuclei, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, medial mammillary body, supramammillary nucleus, posterior nucleus and perifornical region of the hypothalamus, midline and intralaminar nuclei of thalamus, dopamine-containing cell region of medial zona incerta, lateral habenula, horizontal and vertical limbs of the diagonal band nuclei, medial septum, and hippocampal formation. Virtually all of these structures lie on or close to the midline, indicating that the MR represents a midline/para-midline system of projections. Overall, MR projections to the cortex are light. MR projects moderately to the perirhinal, entorhinal and frontal cortices, but sparingly to remaining regions of cortex. A comparison of MR with dorsal raphe (DR) projections (Vertes RP. 1991. J Comp Neurol 313:643-668) shows that these two major serotonin-containing cell groups of the midbrain distribute to essentially nonoverlapping regions of the forebrain; that is, the MR and DR project to complementary sites in the forebrain. A direct role for the MR in the desynchronization of the electroencephalographic activity of the hippocampus and its possible consequences for memory-associated functions of the hippocampus is discussed.
10320718	Orexin (ORX)-A and -B are recently identified neuropeptides, which are specifically localized in neurons within and around the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), the regions classically implicated in feeding behavior. Here, we report a further study of the distribution of ORX-containing neurons in the adult rat brain to provide a general overview of the ORX neuronal system. Immunohistochemical study using anti-ORX antiserum showed ORX-immunoreactive (ir) neurons specifically localized within the hypothalamus, including the perifornical nucleus, LHA, DMH, and posterior hypothalamic area. ORX-ir axons and their varicose terminals showed a widespread distribution throughout the adult rat brain. ORX-ir nerve terminals were observed throughout the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, regions implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior. We also observed strong staining of ORX-ir varicose terminals in areas outside the hypothalamus, including the cerebral cortex, medial groups of the thalamus, circumventricular organs (subfornical organ and area postrema), limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, and indusium griseum), and brain stem (locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei). These results indicate that the ORX system provides a link between the hypothalamus and other brain regions, and that ORX-containing LHA and DMH neurons play important roles in integrating the complex physiology underlying feeding behavior.
10333272	Bilateral lesions of the central tegmental field (CTF) in male rats virtually eliminate mating behavior. This study examined if mating-induced Fos expression (a measure of neuronal activation) and androgen receptors (AR) are colocalized in brain and spinal cord neurons which project to the CTF. Animals received unilateral injections of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) in the lateral part of the CTF (CTFl), and 10 days later were killed after ejaculating with females. Brains and spinal cords were examined for FG transport, AR-immunoreactivity (AR-ir), and Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-ir). AR-ir and Fos-ir were visualized with fluorescence microscopy using cyanine-conjugated and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies. The CTFl received projections from AR-containing neurons in forebrain structures (bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus), in the central amygdala and various mid- and hindbrain structures (dorsolateral tegmentum, superior and inferior colliculi, pedunculopontine nucleus), and in the lumbosacral spinal cord (lamina X). Some of the AR-containing neurons in bed nucleus of stria terminalis and in the dorsal part of the medial preoptic area with projections to the CTFl were activated by mating. Most AR-containing neurons in spinal lamina X with projections to the CTFl were also activated by mating. Information from spinal cord and pontine nuclei and from outputs descending from the forebrain may be relayed in the CTFl. Thus, as part of a network of hormone-sensitive neurons linking brain and spinal cord mechanisms for mating, the CTFl could participate in the integration of visceral and somatic information relevant for sexual behavior.
10340503	The endopiriform nucleus is a large group of multipolar cells located deep to the piriform cortex. The function of this nucleus is unknown, but studies with animal models suggest that it plays an important role in temporal lobe epileptogenesis. To address questions concerning mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to gain insights into its normal function, efferent axons from the endopiriform nucleus were labeled by anterograde transport from small extracellular injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. Several principles of organization were derived: (1) heavy local and long intrinsic connections are present throughout the endopiriform nucleus; (2) endopiriform efferents target cortical rather than nuclear structures; (3) extensive projections from the endopiriform nucleus extend to most basal forebrain areas including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, insular cortex, orbital cortex, and all cortical amygdaloid areas. The perirhinal cortex, olfactory tubercle, and most subdivisions of the hippocampal formation receive light projections; (4) projections are highly distributed spatially within all target areas; (5) efferent axons from the endopiriform nucleus are unmyelinated and give rise to boutons along their entire course rather than arborizing locally; and (6) the endopiriform nucleus and piriform cortex share target areas, but efferents from the endopiriform nucleus lack the precise laminar order of those from the piriform cortex, and provide a heavy caudal to rostral pathway that is lacking in the cortex. The significance of these findings for the triggering of generalized seizures from the deep piriform region are discussed. An hypothesis for a role of the endopiriform nucleus in memory storage is presented.
10340512	Two different corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors, CRF1 and CRF2, have been identified in rat and human brain. Although the two receptor subtypes show a markedly different distribution in the rat brain, their distribution in the primate brain has not been described previously. In this study, the neuroanatomic distribution of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor binding sites in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was assessed by using iodine 125 ([125I)-Tyr0]-sauvagine with or without the selective CRF1 receptor antagonist CP-154,526-1. Radiolabeled human cRNA probes were used to map the distribution of the two receptor mRNAs with in situ hybridization. Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors were found in the pituitary and throughout the neocortex (especially, in prefrontal, cingulate, striate, and insular cortices), amygdala, and hippocampal formation of the monkey brain. This is in contrast to the distribution of these receptors reported in the rat brain, in which generally only the CRF1 receptor is found in the pituitary and neocortex. These results suggest that, in primates, both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of CRF on cognition, behavior, and pituitary-adrenal function. The presence of CRF1 (but not CRF2) receptors within the locus coeruleus, cerebellar cortex, nucleus of the solitary tract, thalamus, and striatum and of CRF2 (but not CRF1) receptors in the choroid plexus, certain hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus prepositus, and the nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests that each receptor subtype also may have distinct functional roles within the primate central nervous system.
10354469	The nested expression patterns of the paired-box containing transcription factors Pax2/5 and Pax6 demarcate the midbrain and forebrain primordium at the neural plate stage. We demonstrate that, in Pax2/5 deficient mice, the mesencephalon/metencephalon primordium is completely missing, resulting in a fusion of the forebrain to the hindbrain. Morphologically, in the alar plate the deletion is characterized by the substitution of the tectum (dorsal midbrain) and cerebellum (dorsal metencephalon) by the caudal diencephalon and in the basal plate by the replacement of the midbrain tegmentum by the ventral metencephalon (pons). Molecularly, the loss of the tectum is demonstrated by an expanded expression of Pax6, (the molecular determinant of posterior commissure), and a rostral shift of the territory of expression of Gbx2 and Otp (markers for the pons), towards the caudal diencephalon. Our results suggest that an intact territory of expression of Pax2/5 in the neural plate, nested between the rostral and caudal territories of expression of Pax6, is necessary for defining the midbrain vesicle.
10370901	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive neuronal loss associated with Lewy bodies in many subcortical nuclei leading to multiple biochemical and pathophysiological changes of clinical relevance. Loss of nigral neurons causing striatal dopamine deficiency is related to both the duration and clinical stages (severity) of the disease. The clinical subtypes of PD have different morphological lesion patterns: a) The akinetic-rigid type shows more severe cell loss in the ventrolateral part of substantia nigra zona compacta (SNZC) that projects to the dorsal putamen than the medial part projecting to caudate nucleus and anterior putamen, with negative correlation between SNZC cell counts, severity of akinesia-rigidity, and dopamine loss in the posterior putamen. Reduced dopaminergic input causes overactivity of the GABA ergic inhibitory striatal neurons projecting via the "indirect loop" to SN zona reticulata (SNZR) and medial pallidum (GPI) leading to inhibition of the glutamatergic thalamo-cortical motor loop and reduced cortical activation. b) The tremor-dominant type shows more severe neuron loss in medial than in lateral SNZC and damage to the retrorubral field A8 containing only few tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter immunoreactive (IR) neurons but mainly calretinin-IR cells. A8 that is rather preserved in rigid-akinetic PD (protective role of calcium-binding protein?) projects to the matrix of dorsolateral striatum and ventromedial thalamus. Together with area A10 it influences the strial efflux via SNZR to thalamus and from there to prefrontal cortex. Rest tremor in PD is associated with increased metabolism in the thalamus, subthalamus, pons, and premotor-cortical network suggesting an increased functional activity of thalamo-motor projections. In essential tremor, no significant pathomorphological changes but overactivity of cerebello-thalamic loop have been observed. c) In the akinetic-rigid forms of multisystem atrophy, degeneration is more severe in the lateral SNZC with severe loss of calbindin-IR cells reflecting initial degeneration of the striatal matrix in the caudal putamen with transsynaptic degeneration of striatonigral efferences that remain intact in PD. This fact and loss of striatal D2 receptors--as in advanced stages of PD--are reasons for negative response to L-dopa substitution. These data suggest different pathophysiological mechanisms of the clinical subtypes of PD that have important therapeutic implications. d) Involvement of extranigral structures in PD includes the mesocortical dopaminergic system, the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, dorsal vagal nucleus and medullary nuclei, serotonergic dorsal raphe, nucleus basalis of Meynert and other cholinergic brainstem nuclei, e.g. Westphal-Edinger nucleus (controlling pupillomotor function), posterolateral hypothalamus and the limbic system, e.g. amygdaloid nucleus, part of hippocampal formation, limbic thalamic nuclei with prefrontal projections, etc. Damage to multiple neuronal systems by the progressing degenerative process causing complex biochemical changes may explain the variable clinical picture of PD including vegetative, behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions, depression, pharmacotoxic psychoses, etc. Future comparative clinico-morphological and pathobiochemical studies will further elucidate the pathophysiological basis of specific clinical symptoms of PD and related disorders providing a broader basis for effective treatment strategies. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and other subcortical neuronal systems leading to striatal dopamine deficiency and other biochemical deficits related to the variable clinical signs and symptoms of the disorder. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
10379831	Recent molecular cloning studies by our laboratory and others have identified the existence of a novel rat galanin receptor subtype, GALR2. In the present study, we examined the regional and cellular distribution of GALR2 mRNA in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by in situ hybridization. For comparative purposes, adjacent sections were probed for GALR1 mRNA expression. Our findings indicate that dorsal root ganglia express by far the highest levels of GALR2 mRNA in the rat CNS. Hybridization signal is mainly concentrated over small and intermediate primary sensory neurons. In spinal cord, the large alpha motoneurons of the ventral horn are moderately labeled and several small, but less intensely labeled, cells are scattered throughout the gray matter. In brain sections, the highest levels of GALR2 mRNA are detected in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, in the mammillary nuclei, and in the cerebellar cortex. Moderate levels of GALR2 mRNA are observed in the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, piriform and retrospinal cortices, hypothalamus (namely the preoptic area, arcuate nucleus, and dorsal hypothalamic area), substantia nigra pars compacta, and sensory trigeminal nucleus. Moderate to weak hybridization signal is also present in several other hypothalamic nuclei, specific layers of the neocortex, periaqueductal gray, and several nuclei within the pons and medulla, including locus coeruleus, lateral parabrachial, motor trigeminal, pontine reticular, hypoglossal, vestibular complex, ambiguus, and facial and lateral reticular nuclei. This novel pattern of GALR2 distribution within the rat CNS differs considerably from that of GALR1, suggesting that specific physiologic effects of galanin may be ascribed to the GALR2 galanin receptor subtype.
10385902	Manganese (Mn) is an essential mineral but is toxic when taken in excess. However, whether its interactions with other minerals in organs and cells are involved in mechanisms underlying Mn toxicity is poorly understood. We designed a developmental rat model of chronic Mn treatment (Group A: 1 mg MnCl2.4H2O per ml of drinking water; Group B: 10 mg MnCl2.4H2O per ml of drinking water; Group C: 20 mg MnCl2.4H2O per ml of drinking water; Control Group given water without manganese addition). Employing the model and instrumental neutron activation analysis, we investigated two hypotheses: (i) chronic manganese treatment alters the brain regional distribution of manganese and this altered manganese distribution also leads to region-specific changes of other metals; (ii) chronic manganese treatment induces differential changes in subcellular distributions of metals and electrolytes. In the treated rats, brain Mn level showed dose-related increases, the most pronounced being noted in striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus: these increases also led to alterations in regional distribution pattern of Mn. In the treated rats, Fe level was increased in hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, pons and medulla, and striatum. Cu level was increased in pons and medulla, hippocampus, midbrain, and striatum. Se level was increased in cerebellum, striatum, midbrain, hypothalamus, and pons and medulla. Zn level was increased in hypothalamus and striatum. Ca level was increased in midbrain but decreased in cerebellum; however, Mg and Al levels were not markedly affected. In brains of Mn-treated rats, Mn levels in subcellular fractions were all increased, being especially marked in nuclei, mitochondria, and synaptosomes; the subcellular distributions of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mg were differentially altered although those of Al and Ca were minimally affected. These results are consistent with our hypotheses and may have implications in manganese neurotoxicity. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying manganese-mineral interactions in brain are still poorly defined and merit further investigation.
10391477	The distribution of prepronociceptin messenger RNA, the recently identified endogenous ligand of the ORL1 receptor (opioid receptor-like-1), has been studied in the adult mouse central nervous system using in situ hybridization. Prepronociceptin is a new peptide precursor that generates, upon maturation, at least three bioactive peptides: nociceptin, noc2 and the recently described nocistatin. Considering both the density of labeled neurons per region and their intensity of labeling, the distribution of prepronociceptin messenger RNA-containing neurons can be summarized as follows: the highest level of prepronociceptin messenger RNA expression was detected in the septohippocampal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central amygdaloid nucleus, and in selective thalamic nuclei such as the parafascicular, reticular, ventral lateral geniculate and zona incerta. High to moderate levels of prepronociceptin messenger RNA expression were detected in the lateral, ventral and medial septum, and were evident in brainstem structures implicated in descending antinociceptive pathways (e.g., the gigantocellular nucleus, raphe magnus nucleus, periaqueductal gray matter), and also observed in association with auditory relay nuclei such as the inferior colliculi, lateral lemniscus nucleus, medioventral preolivary nucleus and lateral superior nucleus. A moderate level of prepronociceptin messenger RNA expression was observed in the medial preoptic nucleus, ventromedial preoptic nucleus, periventricular nucleus, pedonculopontine tegmental nucleus, solitary tract nucleus and spinal trigeminal nucleus. A weak level of prepronociceptin messenger RNA expression was present in some areas, such as the cerebral cortex, endopiriform cortex, hippocampal formation, medial amygdaloid nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, medial mammillary hypothalamic nuclei, retrorubral field and substantia nigra pars compacta. No labeled cells could be found in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. The present data confirm that nociceptin is expressed in a broad array of regions of the central nervous system. In good correlation with the presently known physiological actions of nociceptin, they include, amongst others, brain areas conveying/integrating pain and auditory sensory afferences.
10402222	We and others have recently demonstrated that the pharmacological tolerance observed after prolonged exposure to plant and synthetic cannabinoids in adult individuals seems to have a pharmacodynamic basis, based on the observed down-regulation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain of cannabinoid-tolerant rats. However, we were unable to elicit a similar receptor down-regulation after a chronic exposure to anandamide, the first discovered endogenous cannabinoid, possibly because of its rapid metabolic breakdown in arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The present study was designed to progress in these previous studies, by using R-methanandamide, a more stable analog, instead anandamide. In addition, we examined not only cannabinoid receptor binding, but also WIN-55,212-2-stimulated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding, by autoradiography, and cannabinoid receptor mRNA levels, by in situ hybridization. Results were as follows. The daily administration of R-methanandamide for a period of five days produced decreases in cannabinoid receptor binding in the lateral caudate-putamen, cerebellum, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra. The remaining areas, the medial caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, cerebral cortex (layers I and VI), hippocampus (dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn) and several limbic structures (nucleus accumbens, septum nuclei and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus), exhibited no changes in cannabinoid receptor binding. Similarly, the levels of cannabinoid receptor mRNA expression decreased in the lateral and medial caudate-putamen and in the CA1 and CA2 subfields of the Ammon's horn in the hippocampus after the chronic exposure to R-methanandamide, whereas the remaining areas showed no changes. WIN-55,212-2-stimulated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding did not change in the lateral caudate-putamen, cerebral cortex (layer I), septum nuclei and hippocampal structures (dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn) of animals chronically exposed to R-methanandamide, whereas a certain trend to decrease could be observed in the substantia nigra and deep layer (VI) of the cerebral cortex in these animals. In summary, as reported for other cannabinoid receptor agonists, the prolonged exposure of rats to R-methanandamide, a more stable analog of anandamide, was able to produce cannabinoid receptor-related changes in contrast with the absence of changes observed early with the metabolically labile anandamide. The observed changes exhibited an evident regional pattern with areas, such as basal ganglia, cerebellum and hippocampus, responding to chronic R-methanandamide treatment while regions, such as the cerebral cortex and limbic nuclei, not responding.
10403432	The levels of the two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) were measured in 12 regions of adult rat brain and three regions of mouse brain by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an antiserum that recognizes the identical C-terminal sequence in both isoforms from both species. In rat brain the amount of smaller isoform, GAD65, was greater than that of the larger isoform, GAD67, in all twelve regions. GAD65 ranged from 77-89% of total GAD in frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, olfactory bulb, periaqueductal gray matter, substantia nigra, striatum, thalamus and the ventral tegmental area. The proportion of GAD65 was lower in amygdala and cerebellum but still greater than half of the total. There was a strong correlation between total GAD protein and GAD activity. In the three mouse brain regions analysed (cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus) the proportion of GAD65 (35,47, and 51% of total GAD) was significantly lower than in the corresponding rat-brain regions. The amount of GAD67 was greater than the amount of GAD65 in mouse cerebellum and was approximately equal to the amount of GAD65 in mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
10404107	The mRNA expression for preprotachykinin-A (PPT-A) was studied throughout the human and cynomolgus monkey brain to assess the neuroanatomical expression pattern of the PPT-A gene in primates. In situ hybridization showed that the PPT-A mRNA is expressed highly in specific regions of the postmortem human brain, including the striatum, islands of Calleja, hypothalamus (posterior, premammillary, medial mammillary, and ventromedial nuclei), superior and inferior colliculi, periaqueductal gray, and oculomotor nuclear complex. PPT-A mRNA-expressing neurons also were present in the paranigralis (ventral tegmental area) and were scattered in the bed nucleus stria terminalis throughout the sublenticular substantia innominata region, including the diagonal band of Broca and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In the hippocampus, high PPT-A mRNA expression was localized predominantly to the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus; no labeled cells were present in the granular layer. Positively labeled cells also were found scattered in the CA regions as well as in the amygdaloid complex. Neocortical expression of PPT-A mRNA was localized mainly to the deep laminae (layers V/VI), except for the striate cortex (labeling was seen also in superficial layers). The subiculum, thalamus, globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra pars compacta, red nucleus, pontine nuclei, and cerebellum were characterized by very weak to undetectable expression of PPT-A mRNA. An expression pattern was evident in the monkey forebrain similar to that observed in the human, except for the absence of PPT mRNA-expressing cells in the medial mammillary nucleus despite intense expression in supramammillary, lateral mammillary, and premammillary nuclei. Overall, more similarities than differences are apparent between primate species in the expression pattern of the PPT-A gene. J. Comp. Neurol. 411;56-72, 1999.
10404113	We used immunocytochemistry to determine the regional and temporal distribution of Fos protein expression in awake and unrestrained rats after a unilateral stereotaxic microinjection of a cholinergic agonist, carbachol, in the thalamic ventroposterolateral and reticular nuclei, previously shown to cause limbic and generalized convulsive seizures. The microinjection of carbachol elicits behavioral alterations including immobilization, staring, facial and jaw clonus, rearing, and falling, followed by recurrent generalized convulsive seizures, and a pattern of c-fos expression throughout the brain. In addition to the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, the initial induction of c-fos expression was observed as early as 15 minutes after the carbachol microinjection, in the piriform and entorhinal cortices, the thalamic paraventricular, the supramammilary, the lateral parabrachial nuclei, and the central gray. From 30 minutes to 2 hours, corresponding to the occurrence of motor expression of limbic and recurrent generalized convulsive seizures, Fos immunoreactivity was seen in a number of functionally related brain regions including the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the anterior thalamic nucleus (limbic system); the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and the cortex (thalamo-striatal-cortical system); and the hypothalamus, the central nucleus of the amygdala, the pons, and the medulla (central autonomic system). On the basis of the present results showing regional and temporal c-fos expression and well known neuroanatomical connections, we have constructed a neural network relating the limbic, thalamo-striatal-cortical, and central autonomic systems. This analysis provides, for the first time, neuronal circuits and pathways relating epilepsy-elicited behavioral expression of convulsive seizures and adaptive homeostatic responses and could serve as a basis for studying central autonomic regulation during epileptic disorders.
10408612	Prohormone convertase 5 is an endoprotease of the kexin/subtilisin-like family, which has been postulated to play a role in the proteolytic maturation of a variety of pro-peptides in the mammalian brain. In order to gain insight into the functional role of prohormone convertase 5 in the central nervous system, the regional, cellular and subcellular distributions of the enzyme were investigated by immunohistochemistry in rat brain using an N-terminal-directed specific antibody shown previously to recognize both the mature and unprocessed forms of the enzyme. Throughout the brain, prohormone convertase 5 immunoreactivity was concentrated within nerve cell bodies and proximal dendrites. No prohormone convertase 5 immunoreactivity was associated with astrocytes, as confirmed by the absence of prohormone convertase 5 immunolabeling in cells immunopositive for the glial protein S-100alpha. Within neurons, prohormone convertase 5 immunoreactivity was concentrated within the Golgi apparatus, as revealed immunohistochemically within the same sections using antibodies against the medial cisternae protein MG-160. It was also present within small vesicular-like elements distributed throughout the cytoplasm of perikarya and dendrites, but not of axons, as confirmed by its lack of co-localization with the synaptic terminal marker Dynamin-1. These results suggest that prohormone convertase 5 is active within early compartments of the neuronal regulated secretory pathway and that it is unlikely to be released with its processed substrates. At the regional level, prohormone convertase 5-immunoreactive perikarya were distributed extensively throughout the forebrain. The most numerous and intensely labeled were detected in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, endopeduncular and subthalamic nuclei, septum, diagonal band of Broca, magnocellular and medial preoptic areas, supraoptic and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, and anterodorsal, laterodorsal, paraventricular and reticular nuclei of the thalamus. Moderate to dense neuronal labeling was also evident in the olfactory tubercle, caudate-putamen, claustrum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, hippocampus, amygdala, and remaining thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. This widespread distribution suggests that prohormone convertase 5 is involved in the processing of a variety of neuropeptide and/or neurotrophin precursors in mammalian brain.
10415657	The projections of the cerebral cortex to the extended amygdala were studied in the rat using anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing techniques. Most cortical areas with strong projections to the extended amygdala preferentially targeted either the medial extended amygdala (including the medial amygdalar nucleus, ventromedial substantia innominata, and the medial part of the bed nucleus the stria terminalis) or the central extended amygdala (including the central amygdalar nucleus, dorsolateral substantia innominata, and the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). Some cortical areas, however, had equal projections to both medial and central portions. The main areas projecting preferentially to the medial extended amygdala were the ventral subiculum, infralimbic cortex, ventral agranular insular area, and the rostral part of the ventrolateral entorhinal area. The main areas projecting preferentially to the central extended amygdala were the prefrontal cortex, viscerosensory and somatosensory portions of the insular cortex, and the amygdalopiriform transitional area. It is suggested that these cortical inputs may be important for cognitive, mnemonic, and affective aspects of emotional and motivated behavior.
10420166	Cannabinoid CB(1) receptors emerge early in the rat brain during prenatal development, supporting their potential participation in events related to neural development. In the present investigation, we completed earlier studies, analyzing CB(1) receptor binding and mRNA expression by using autoradiography and in situ hybridization, respectively, in the brain of rat fetuses at gestational day (GD) 21 and of newborns at postnatal days (PND) 1 and 5, in comparison with the adult brain. These analyses were paralleled by quantitation of levels of anandamide and its precursor, N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), and of 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), carried out by using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry of the tri-methyl-sylyl-ether derivatives. As expected, CB(1) receptor binding was detected at GD21 in a variety of brain structures. In most of them, such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and limbic nuclei, there were no marked differences in the density of CB(1) receptors in animals at GD21 as compared to early newborns (PND1 and 5), although it markedly increased in these regions in adulthood. However, with the exception of the cerebellum and, in part, the caudate-putamen, the pattern observed for binding in these regions was clearly different from that observed for mRNA expression of the CB(1) receptor, which currently exhibited the highest levels at PND1 and the lowest in the adult brain. This was also seen in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, medial habenula, and other structures. In the caudate-putamen and, particularly, in the cerebellum, mRNA expression was higher in the adult brain as compared with other ages. As previously reported, specific binding for CB(1) receptors was also detected at GD21 in white matter areas, such as the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, fornix, fimbria, stria medullaris, stria terminalis, and fasciculus retroflexum. With the exception of the anterior commissure and the fimbria, specific binding progressively decreased at PND1 and PND5 until disappearing in the adult brain. In the fimbria, the highest values of binding were seen at PND1, but binding also completely disappeared in the adult brain, whereas in the anterior commissure, specific binding at PND1 and PND5 was lesser than that observed at GD21 and, particularly, in adulthood. CB(1) receptor mRNA expression was not detected in these white matter areas, thus dismissing the possible presence of these receptors in glial cells rather than in neuronal axons. However, mRNA expression was detected in the brainstem, an area also rich in white matter, and it mostly correlated with receptor binding, exhibiting a progressive decrease from GD21 up to adulthood. CB(1) receptor mRNA expression was also detected at GD21 in atypical areas where binding was not detected. These areas are proliferative regions, such as the subventricular zones of the neocortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. This atypical location only persisted at PND1 and PND5 in the striatal subventricular zone, but disappeared in the adult brain. We also found measurable levels of different endogenous cannabinoids in the developing brain. High levels of 2-AG, comparable to those found in the adult brain, were measured at GD21, whereas significantly lower levels were measured for anandamide and NAPE at this fetal age compared with the levels found in the adult brain. Levels of anandamide and NAPE increased during the early postnatal period until reaching the maximum in the adult brain. By contrast, 2-AG levels peaked at PND1, with values approximately twofold higher than those found at the other ages. In summary, all these data demonstrate that the endogenous cannabinoid system, constituted by endogenous ligands and receptor signaling pathways, is present in the developing brain, which suggests a possible specific role of this system in key processes of neural development.

10430466	The cellular and subcellular localization of the two synaphin isoforms, proteins associated with the docking/fusion complex crucial to neurotransmitter release, was studied in the rat central nervous system by using light microscopic and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies specific to each isoform. Synaphin 1 (complexin II) was predominantly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system regions such as cerebral cortex (the II, III and VI cortical layers), claustrum, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdaloid nuclei, substantia nigra pars compacta, superior colliculus, pontine reticulotegmental nucleus and inferior olive, whereas synaphin 2 (complexin I) was in the cerebral cortex (the IV cortical layer), thalamus, locus coeruleus, gigantocellular reticular field, cuneate nucleus and cerebellar basket and stellate cells. In some regions, including the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, pontine reticular nucleus, cerebellar nuclei and spinal gray matter, synaphin 1 was mainly present in small or medium-sized neurons, while synaphin 2 was in large cells. Medial habenular nucleus and cerebellar granule cells showed both immunoreactivities. In the neuropil of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, synaphin 1 expression was accentuated in the axon terminals of axospinal and axodendritic synapses, while synaphin 2 was predominant in the axon terminals of axosomatic synapses. In the axon terminals, both immunolabelings were associated with synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, being accentuated in the vicinity of synaptic contacts. In the cerebral cortex, both immunoreactivities were also present occasionally in dendrites and dendritic spines, associated with microtubules and the plasma membrane including the postsynaptic densities. These results suggest that the two isoforms of synaphin are involved in synaptic function at the distinct presynaptic regions in the central nervous system, and that some dendrites are another functional site for the proteins.
10433347	The regional brain distribution of metallothionein (MT), zinc, and copper in the brain was determined in nine anatomical regions (olfactory bulb, cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, thalamus plus hypothalamus, pons plus medulla oblongata, cerebellum, midbrain, and white matter) and was compared between two different strains of rat (Sprague-Dawley [SD] and Lewis). No significant difference was observed in the whole-brain MT level between the two strains (17.8 +/- 3.4 microg/g in SD rats and 20.3 +/- 2.3 microg/g in Lewis rats). In SD rats, however, MT was more highly expressed in the white matter than in the other regions studied. In contrast, MT concentration was highest in the cortex and lowest in the olfactory bulb in Lewis rats. The MT levels in the cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus plus hypothalamus were significantly lower in SD rats than in Lewis rats. In both strains, the olfactory bulb contained markedly higher levels of both zinc and copper than the other regions (27.9 +/- 6.8 microg/g zinc in SD rats and 27.6 +/- 6.9 microg/g zinc in Lewis rats, and 5.2 +/- 1.5 microg/g copper in SD rats and 11.1 +/- 4.8 microg/g copper in Lewis rats). The next highest zinc levels were seen in the hippocampus, whereas the next highest copper levels were in the corpus striatum in both SD and Lewis rats. The high levels of zinc and copper in the olfactory bulb were not accompanied by concomitant high MT concentrations. These results indicate that the strain of rat as well as the anatomical brain region should be taken into account in MT and metal distribution studies. However, the highest concentrations of zinc and copper in olfactory bulb were common to both SD and Lewis rats. The discrepancy between MT and the metal levels in olfactory bulb suggests a role for other proteins in addition to MT in the homeostatic control of zinc and copper.
10450873	The olfactory bulb (OB) is involved in the processing of olfactory information particularly through the activation of its afferents. To localize their cell origin in sheep, a specific retrograde fluorescent tracer, Fluoro-Gold, was injected into the olfactory bulb of seven ewes. By using immunocytochemical techniques, retrogradely labeled neurons were colocalized with choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and serotonin to characterize cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic Fluoro-Gold-labeled neurons. Most afferents originated from the ipsilateral side of the injection site. The OB received major inputs from the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the piriform cortex (PC), the olfactory tubercle, the diagonal band of Broca (DBB) and the amygdala. Other retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the taenia tecta, the septum, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the preoptic area, the lateral hypothalamic area, the mediobasal hypothalamus, the lateral part of the premammillary nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, the central grey, the substantia nigra (SN), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the lateral nucleus to the interpeduncular nucleus (IIP), the raphe and the locus coeruleus (LC). Contralateral labeling was also found in the AON, the PC, the SN compacta, the VTA, the IIP and the LC. Cholinergic Fluoro-Gold-labeled neurons belonged to the horizontal and vertical branch of the DBB. Noradrenergic afferents came from the LC and serotoninergic afferents came from the medial raphe nuclei and the 1IP. These data are discussed in relation with olfactory learning in the context of maternal behavior in sheep.
10457163	It is currently believed that prostaglandin (PG) of E2 type plays a crucial role in transferring the information received from circulating immune factors to brain parenchymal cells. Although PGE2 is synthesized quite essentially by cells of the blood-brain barrier, the organization and regulation of its receptor subtypes within neuronal elements remain unknown. In this study, intravenous (i.v.) injection of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or recombinant rat interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and intramuscular (i.m.) injection of turpentine were used as different models of systemic immune stimuli. Rats were perfused at various times after the insults (30 min to 24 h), their brains cut and hybridized with full-length rat cRNA probes. Double-labelling procedures were accomplished to determine the cellular phenotype and activity. A very distinct distribution of both EP2 and EP4 receptors was found across the brain under basal conditions; the hybridization signal for the type 2 was detected in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral septum, subfornical organ (SFO), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), locus coeruleus (LC) and the area postrema (AP), whereas the ventral septal/anterior preoptic area, the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, LC, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) exhibited moderate to strong levels for the EP4 mRNA under basal conditions. Upregulation of the genes encoding EP2 and EP4 receptors was detected in selective regions and neuronal populations during systemic inflammatory challenges. The most dramatic one being the robust transcriptional activation of the EP4 subtype within corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons of the parvocellular PVN following i.v. LPS and IL-1beta injection, and the localized i.m. aggression. These neurons of the endocrine hypothalamus as well as those of numerous autonomic-related nuclei were activated by the proinflammatory cytokine, as they were immunoreactive (ir) to Fos nuclear protein. The EP4 transcript was also present in activated catecholaminergic neurons of the LC, NTS and VLM, although only the A1 cell group exhibited an increase in EP4 transcription in response to circulating IL-1beta. Moreover, the systemic immunogenic insults caused a significant increase in the EP2 mRNA levels in the CeA, SFO, AP and the leptomeninges. These data provide a distinct pattern of EP2 and EP4 expression throughout the rat brain under both basal and immune-challenged conditions, and underlie the possible role of the EP4 subtype in mediating the effects of PGE2 on different autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. The presence of Fos-ir nuclei in various populations of EP4 neurons of IL-1beta-treated animals clearly supports this concept and suggests that the selectivity of the neuronal response during systemic inflammation may depend on the expression of specific PGE2 receptors in key structures of the brain.
10464356	The recently discovered neuropeptide orphanin FQ (OFQ), and its opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptor, exhibit structural features suggestive of the micro, kappa, and delta opioid systems. The anatomic distribution of OFQ immunoreactivity and mRNA expression has been reported recently. In the present analysis, we compare the distribution of orphanin receptor mRNA expression with that of orphanin FQ binding at the ORL1 receptor in the adult rat central nervous system (CNS). By using in vitro receptor autoradiography with (125)I-[(14)Tyr]-OFQ as the radioligand, orphanin receptor binding was analyzed throughout the rat CNS. Orphanin binding sites were densest in several cortical regions, the anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, ventral forebrain, several hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampal formation, basolateral and medial amygdala, central gray, pontine nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, raphe complex, locus coeruleus, vestibular nuclear complex, and the spinal cord. By using in situ hybridization, cells expressing ORL1 mRNA were most numerous throughout multiple cortical regions, the anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, endopiriform nucleus, ventral forebrain, multiple hypothalamic nuclei, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, medial amygdala, hippocampal formation, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, central gray, raphe complex, locus coeruleus, multiple brainstem motor nuclei, inferior olive, deep cerebellar nuclei, vestibular nuclear complex, nucleus of the solitary tract, reticular formation, dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord. The diffuse distribution of ORL1 mRNA and binding supports an extensive role for orphanin FQ in a multitude of CNS functions, including motor and balance control, reinforcement and reward, nociception, the stress response, sexual behavior, aggression, and autonomic control of physiologic processes.
10466741	Tissue distribution of bikunin mRNA, which encodes a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor of the inter-alpha-inhibitor family (IalphaI), was studied in rats and mice by the reverse-transcripsion polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that the liver as well as other tissues, such as the kidney, testis and adrenal gland, expressed bikunin mRNA. Although signals of bikunin mRNA were faint in the whole brain of rats and mice, distinct signals were found in limited portions of rat brain, such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and pituitary, but undetectable in cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain and choroid plexus. In three distinct types of cells, such as neurons, astrocytes and meningeal cells, in primary cultures isolated from the cerebral cortex and meninges of 1-day-old newborn rats, only neurons positively expressed bikunin mRNA. These results suggest that, in addition to peripheral tissues, neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex produce bikunin, suggesting a potential role of bikunin/IalphaI family in these brain regions.
10468505	There is conjoining experimental and clinical evidence supporting a fundamental role of the basal ganglia as a sensory analyser engaged in central somatosensory control. This study was aimed at investigating the functional anatomy of sensory processing in two clinical conditions characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction, i.e. Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Based on previously recorded data of somatosensory evoked potentials, we expected deficient sensory-evoked activation in cortical areas that receive modulatory somatosensory input via the basal ganglia. Eight Parkinson's disease patients, eight Huntington's disease patients and eight healthy controls underwent repetitive H(2)(15)O-PET activation scans during two experimental conditions in random order: (i) continuous unilateral high-frequency vibratory stimulation applied to the immobilized metacarpal joint of the index finger and (ii) rest (no vibratory stimulus). In the control cohort, the activation pattern was lateralized to the side opposite to stimulus presentation, including cortical [primary sensory cortex (S1); secondary sensory cortex (S2)] and subcortical (globus pallidus, ventrolateral thalamus) regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increases (P < 0.001). Between-group comparisons (P < 0.01) of vibration-induced rCBF changes between patients and controls revealed differences in central sensory processing: (i) in Parkinson's disease, decreased activation of contralateral sensorimotor (S1/M1) and lateral premotor cortex, contralateral S2, contralateral posterior cingulate, bilateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and contralateral basal ganglia; (ii) in Huntington's disease, decreased activation of contralateral S2, parietal areas 39 and 40, and lingual gyrus, bilateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 8, 9, 10 and 44), S1 (trend only) and contralateral basal ganglia; (iii) in both clinical conditions relative enhanced activation of ipsilateral sensory cortical areas, notably caudal S1, S2 and insular cortex. Our data show that Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, beyond well-established deficits in central motor control, are characterized by abnormal cortical and subcortical activation on passive sensory stimulation. Furthermore, the finding that activation increases in ipsilateral sensory cortical areas may be interpreted as an indication of either altered central focusing and gating of sensory impulses, or enhanced compensatory recruitment of associative sensory areas in the presence of basal ganglia dysfunction. Altered sensory processing is thought to contribute to pertinent motor deficits in both conditions.
10470851	To extend our cDNA project for accumulating basic information on unidentified human genes, we newly determined the sequences of 100 cDNA clones from a set of size-fractionated human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA1019 to KIAA1118. The sequencing of these clones revealed that the average size of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames were 5.0 kb and 2.6 kb (880 amino acid residues), respectively. Database search of the predicted amino acid sequences classified 58 predicted gene products into the five functional categories, such as cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility, nucleic acid management, protein management and cell division. It was also found that, for 34 gene products, homologues were detected in the databases, which were similar in sequence through almost the entire regions. The chromosomal locations of the genes were determined by using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their mapping data were already available in the public databases. The expression profiles of all the genes among 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substania nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver were also examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
10547328	The frontal lobe is not a single anatomical and functional brain region. Several lines of research have demonstrated that particular subregions within the frontal lobe are associated with specific motor and cognitive functions in the human being. Our main purpose is to develop a magnetic resonance image (MRI)-based parcellation method of the frontal lobe that permits us to explore plausible abnormalities in functionally relevant frontal subregions in brain illnesses. We describe a procedure using MRI for subdividing the entire frontal cortex into 11 subregions: supplementary motor area (SMA), rostral anterior cingulate gyrus (r-ACiG), caudal anterior cingulate gyrus (c-ACiG), superior cingulate gyrus (SCiG), medial frontal cortex (MFC), straight gyrus (SG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), precentral gyrus (PCG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Our method posits to conserve the topographic uniqueness of individual brains and is based on our ability to visualize both the three-dimensional (3D) rendered brain and the three orthogonal planes simultaneously. The reliability study for gray matter volume and surface area of each subregion was performed on a set of 10 MR scans by two raters. The intraclass R coefficients for gray matter volume of each subregion ranged between 0.86 and 0.99. We describe here a reproducible and reliable topography-based parcellation method of the frontal lobe that will allow us to use new approaches to understand the role of particular frontal cortical subregions in schizophrenia and other brain illnesses.
10553119	A single small iontophoretic injection of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin labels projections from the area surrounding the spinal cord central canal at midthoracic (T6-T9) or lumbosacral (L6-S1) segments of the spinal cord. The projections from the midthoracic or lumbosacral level of the medial spinal cord are found: 1) ascending ipsilaterally in the dorsal column near the dorsal intermediate septum or the midline of the gracile fasciculus, respectively; 2) terminating primarily in the dorsal, lateral rim of the gracile nucleus and the medial rim of the cuneate nucleus or the dorsomedial rim of the gracile nucleus, respectively; and 3) ascending bilaterally with slight contralateral predominance in the ventrolateral quadrant of the spinal cord and terminating in the ventral and medial medullary reticular formation. Other less dense projections are to the pons, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and other forebrain structures. Projections arising from the lumbosacral level are also found in Barrington's nucleus. The results of the present study support previous retrograde tract tracing and physiological studies from our group demonstrating that the neurons in the area adjacent to the central canal of the midthoracic or lumbosacral level of the spinal cord send long ascending projections to the dorsal column nucleus that are important in the transmission of second-order afferent information for visceral nociception. Thus, the axonal projections through both the dorsal and the ventrolateral white matter from the CC region terminate in many regions of the brain providing spinal input for sensory integration, autonomic regulation, motor and emotional responses, and limbic activation.
10564379	In sheep, central oxytocin release at parturition induces maternal behaviour which is thought to be mediated by changes in the expression of central oxytocin receptors. The distribution, effects of parturition, previous maternal experience and hormonal status on the distribution of an oxytocin receptor was investigated using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. In ewes with no previous maternal experience, parturition induced significant increases in oxytocin receptor mRNA expression in the anterior olfactory nucleus, medial preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and diagonal band of Broca. In maternally experienced ewes, parturition induced additional increases in two areas, the paraventricular nucleus and the Islands of Calleja. The changes in progesterone and oestrogen that occur during late pregnancy and parturition appear to contribute to increases in expression in the anterior olfactory nucleus, Islands of Calleja, medial preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and diagonal band of Broca, but not in the paraventricular nucleus, lateral septum and medial amygdala. These results demonstrate that progesterone and oestrogen priming enhance oxytocin receptor mRNA expression in a number of regions in the olfactory system, hypothalamus and limbic brain. These effects appear to be independent of maternal experience. Parturition increases oxytocin receptor mRNA expression in all the areas influenced by hormonal priming and the lateral septum, medial amygdala and paraventricular nucleus. Maternal experience also enhances expression of oxytocin receptor mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus and the Islands of Calleja. Because the paraventricular nucleus is the main source of oxytocin release in the brain, this upgrading of autoreceptors as a result of maternal experience may serve to enhance release of this peptide in projection sites regulating maternal behaviour.
10566957	APG-2 protein is a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, and it is thought to play an important role in the maintenance of neuronal functions under physiological and stress conditions. However, neither the tissue-distribution of APG-2 protein nor developmental change of its expression has been studied at the protein level. Therefore, we generated an antiserum against APG-2 protein and studied expression of this protein in rat brain and other tissues by use of the Western blot method. The results showed a high expression of APG-2 protein in various regions of the central nervous system (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla pons, and spinal cord) throughout the entire postnatal stage. Similarly, a high level of APG-2 protein was detected in the whole brain of rat embryos and in adult rat tissues such as liver, lung, spleen, and kidney. In contrast, its expression in heart was high at postnatal days 1 and 3, but thereafter drastically decreased to a low level. Furthermore, APG-2 protein was detected in neuronal primary cultures prepared from rat cerebral cortex, and its level did not change notably during neuronal differentiation. These results show that APG-2 protein is constitutively expressed in various tissues and also in neuronal cells throughout the entire embryonic and postnatal period. suggesting that it might play an important role in these tissues under non-stress conditions.
10567054	A 59-year-old woman with slow progression of the loss of motor function and predominant lower motor manifestation during a 14-year period showed familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) with posterior column involvement, neuropathologically. Conglomerate inclusions (CIs) were observed in the remaining neurons in various areas, including the spinal anterior horn, posterior horn, Clark's column, accessory cuneate nucleus, tegmental reticular formation, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, nucleus of the facial nerve, hypoglossal nucleus, medial nucleus of the thalamus, dentate nucleus, and motor cortex (Betz cells). Immunohistochemically, it was newly identified that the CIs showed marked immunoreactions with antibodies to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilaments and to 64, 120, and 200 kD neurofilaments. The CIs were partially immunoreactive with the anti-ubiquitin antibody, although they reacted only weakly (or not at all) with anti-Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) antibody. Ultrastructurally, the CIs were comprised of neurofilaments. These data suggest that this case might have been different from an example of fALS with Ile 113 Thr mutation in the SOD1 gene.
10579225	Agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding allows the visualization of receptor-activated G-proteins, thus revealing the anatomical localization of functional receptor activity. In the present study, agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was used to demonstrate mu and kappa1 opioid-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in tissue sections and membranes from cynomolgus monkey brain using DAMGO and U50,488H, respectively. Concentrations of agonists required to produce maximal stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding were determined in membranes from the frontal poles of the brain. Receptor specificity was verified in both membranes and sections by inhibiting agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding with the appropriate antagonist. Mu opioid-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was high in areas including the amygdala, ventral striatum, caudate, putamen, medial thalamus and hypothalamus. Dense mu-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was also found in brainstem nuclei including the interpeduncular nucleus, parabrachial nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Kappa1 opioid-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was high in limbic and association cortex, ventral striatum, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, claustrum, amygdala, hypothalamus and substantia nigra. These results demonstrate the applicability of [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography to examine receptor-activated G-proteins in the primate brain and reveal functional mu and kappa1 opioid receptor activity that may contribute to the reported central nervous system effects of opiates.
10580289	These data demonstrate a chain of synaptically connected neurons extending to the rat kidney through several levels of the neuraxis from the forebrain, and the lamina terminalis -- an area known to be involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis. The Bartha strain of pseudorabies virus was injected into the kidney of male Sprague-Dawley rats, resulting in retrograde infections in spinal cord segments (T1-T8), and successive infection in five autonomic 'premotor' areas of the brain, the rostroventrolateral medulla, rostroventromedial medulla, raphe nuclei, A5 region of the pons, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, as well as the nucleus of the solitary tract, locus coeruleus, and subcoeruleus nuclei. Higher order labelling was found in regions of the forebrain, including the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, subfornical organ, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anteroventral periventricular nucleus, lateral preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, retrochiasmatic nucleus, primary motor cortex, and visceral cortex. This polysynaptic pathway to the kidney may form the substrate underlying the impact of forebrain structures on renal function.
10581409	Recent studies have identified a multi-component receptor system for the neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its homolog, neurturin (NTN), comprising the signaling tyrosine kinase, Ret and multiple GPI-linked binding proteins, GDNF family receptor alpha-1 and alpha-2 (GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2). In the present study the localization of c-ret and GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs was assessed in the developing rat brain from postnatal day 4 to 70 by in situ hybridization histochemistry, using specific [35S]-labeled oligonucleotides. GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs were differentially distributed throughout the brain at all ages studied, particularly in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and regions of the thalamus and hypothalamus - both distributions overlapping but different to that of c-ret mRNA. C-ret mRNA was abundant in areas such as the lateral habenula, reticular thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, cranial motor nuclei, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. GFRalpha-1 mRNA was abundant in dorsal endopiriform nucleus, medial habenula, reticular thalamic nucleus, pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampus, substantia nigra pars compacta and in cranial motor nuclei. GFRalpha-2 mRNA was highly expressed in many regions including olfactory bulb, lateral olfactory tract nucleus, neocortical layers IV and VI, septum, zona incerta, and arcuate and interpeduncular nuclei. GFRalpha-2 mRNA was detected in the pyramidal cell layers (CA3) of hippocampus at P4 and P7, but was no longer detectable at P14 and beyond, including P70 (adult). GFRalpha-2 mRNA was also detected in Purkinje cells throughout the cerebellum in young postnatal rats, but was enriched in the posterior lobes at P28 and P70. These localization studies support evidence of GDNF/NTN as target-derived and autocrine/paracrine trophic factors in developing brain pathways and earlier suggestions of unique and complex signaling mechanisms for these factors via a family of receptors. Strong expression of GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs in adult brain suggests possible non-trophic functions of GDNF/NTN, as described for other neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
10594838	Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine, is presently the most specific indicator for monitoring the functional state of cholinergic neurones in the central and peripheral nervous systems. ChAT is a single-strand globular protein. The enzyme is synthesized in the perikaryon of cholinergic neurones and transported to the nerve terminals probably by both slow and rapid axoplasmic flows. ChAT exists in at least two forms in cholinergic nerve terminals: (i) soluble; and (ii) non-ionically membrane-bound forms. Multiple mRNA species of ChAT (R-, N-and M-types) are transcribed from different promoter regions and produced by different splicing in the mouse, rat, and human. All transcripts encode the same ChAT protein in rodents, while in human M-type mRNA has the capability to generate both large and small forms of ChAT proteins and R-and N-types ChAT mRNA generate a small form, which corresponds to the rodent ChAT. The genomic structure of ChAT is unique compared with other enzymes for neurotransmitters. The first intron of the ChAT gene encompasses the open reading frame encoding another protein, vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which is responsible for the transportation of acetylcholine from the cytoplasm into the synaptic vesicles. The expressions of ChAT and VAChT appear to be coordinately regulated by multiple regulatory elements in cholinergic neurones. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies have revealed the localization of cholinergic neurones in the central nervous system: the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the basal nucleus of Meynert, the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the nucleus accumbens, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, the medial habenular nucleus, the parabigeminal nucleus, some cranial nerve nuclei, and the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Focally distributed cholinergic neurones project fibers to many areas in the central nervous system and construct a complicated cholinergic network, playing an important role in neuropsychic activities, such as learning, memory, arousal, sleep and movement. Central cholinergic neurones are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which disturbance of the central cholinergic system does not appear to be closely related to the etiology, but rather to the development of clinical symptoms. In addition, abnormalities of ChAT in the brain have been recently demonstrated in schizophrenia and sudden infant death syndrome.
10625051	The interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure is, like the striatum, very rich in tyrosine hydroxylase and acetylcholinesterase, but on the basis of most other neurochemical criteria displays features that are typical of the extended amygdala (Alheid, de Olmos and Beltramino, 1995). Its afferent connections were examined in the rat with retrograde (cholera toxin B subunit) and anterograde (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin) tracers and compared to those of the neighboring amygdalostriatal transition area and central amygdaloid nucleus. Deposits of cholera toxin B subunit in the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure result in retrograde labeling that is similar to that seen after cholera toxin B subunit injections in the central amygdaloid nucleus. Retrogradely labeled cells are found in insular, infralimbic, prelimbic, piriform, amygdalopiriform transition, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, as well as in temporal field CA1 of Ammon horn and ventral subiculum, amygdala (nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, anterior amygdaloid area, anterior cortical, posterolateral cortical, anterior and posterior basomedial, intercalated cells, basolateral and lateral nuclei), and extended amygdala, primarily in its central division. The latter includes the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal portions of the sublenticular region, the lateral pocket of the supracapsular bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central amygdaloid nucleus. Retrogradely labeled cells are also seen in midline thalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, retrorubral field, dorsal raphe nucleus, pedunculopontine and dorsolateral tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus and parabrachial area. The central extended amygdala, lateral hypothalamus and parabrachial area display a substantial retrograde labeling only when the injection involves districts of the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure apposed to the pallidum, i.e. its medial part. Our anterograde results confirm that projections from the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central amygdaloid nucleus to the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure target its medial part. They also indicate that structures which provide major afferents to the central extended amygdala (the lateral and posterior basolateral amygdaloid nuclei and the amygdalopiriform transition area) innervate chiefly the medial part of the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure and, to a much lesser degree, its lateral part. The piriform cortex, which has well-acknowledged projections to the ventral striatum, innervates only the rostral sector of the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure. Taken together, these data indicate that the medial part of the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure is closely related to the central extended amygdala. Rostral and lateral parts of the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure, on the other hand, appear as transitional territories between the central extended amygdala and ventral striatum. The afferent connections of the zone traditionally termed amygdalostriatal transition area are in general similar to those of the caudate-putamen, which does not receive projections from the central extended amygdala. After cholera toxin B subunit injections in the caudoventral globus pallidus, a dense retrograde labeling is observed in the amygdalostriatal transition area and overlying striatum, but not in the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure. Our results suggest that the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure and the amygdalostriatal transition area are engaged in distinct forebrain circuits; the former is a dopamine-rich territory intimately related to the central ext
10625053	The nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems of the rat were reconstructed using an organotypic culture model, whereby neonatal brain tissue was grown in vitro for approximately one month. The nigrostriatal system comprised of tissue from the substantia nigra, the dorsal striatum and the frontoparietal cortex, while the mesolimbic system included the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum (including the fundus striati, accumbens nucleus, olfactory tubercle, lateral septum, ventral pallidum and piriform cortex) and cingulate cortex. These regions were also cultured alone or in pairs. The cultures were monitored in vitro, and after one month fixed in a formalin-picric acid solution, and processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies raised against tyrosine hydroxylase, nitric oxide synthase, preprocholecystokinin, glutamate decarboxylase, neuropeptide Y, dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein-32 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The tissue survived in single, double or triple cultures, although differences were found depending upon the source and combination of cultured region. Neurons had localization and shape as in vivo. Local networks were especially prominent in the mesencephalon, where both tyrosine hydroxylase-positive axons spread from the "substantia nigra" to the rest of the tissue, and where nitric oxide synthase-positive networks also surrounded tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. Glutamate decarboxylase-positive nerve terminals formed dense networks around tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. In the striatum, nitric oxide synthase and dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein-32 neurons were surrounded by tyrosine hydroxylase-positive nerve terminals. The nigral and ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons projected to striatal and cortical structures, but the projection from the ventral tegmental area to the cingulate cortex was more prominent. With regard to co-existence, preprochole-cystokinin-like immunoreactivities was found in many tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and neuropeptide Y- and nitric oxide synthase-like immunoreactivity co-existed in striatal and cortical tissues. In general terms, the chemical neuroanatomy in the cultures was similar to that described earlier in vivo. Nitric oxide synthase staining was particularly intense. Taken together, the organotypic model captures many of the morphological and neurochemical features seen in vivo, providing a valuable model for studying neurocircuitries of the brain in detail, where 'normal' and 'pathological' conditions can be simulated.
10643726	Acupuncture, an ancient therapeutic technique, is emerging as an important modality of complementary medicine in the United States. The use and efficacy of acupuncture treatment are not yet widely accepted in Western scientific and medical communities. Demonstration of regionally specific, quantifiable acupuncture effects on relevant structures of the human brain would facilitate acceptance and integration of this therapeutic modality into the practice of modern medicine. Research with animal models of acupuncture indicates that many of the beneficial effects may be mediated at the subcortical level in the brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of acupuncture in normal subjects and to provide a foundation for future studies on mechanisms of acupuncture action in therapeutic interventions. Acupuncture needle manipulation was performed at Large Intestine 4 (LI 4, Hegu) on the hand in 13 subjects [Stux, 1997]. Needle manipulation on either hand produced prominent decreases of fMRI signals in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24), caudate, putamen, temporal pole, and insula in all 11 subjects who experienced acupuncture sensation. In marked contrast, signal increases were observed primarily in the somatosensory cortex. The two subjects who experienced pain instead of acupuncture sensation exhibited signal increases instead of decreases in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24), caudate, putamen, anterior thalamus, and posterior insula. Superficial tactile stimulation to the same area elicited signal increases in the somatosensory cortex as expected, but no signal decreases in the deep structures. These preliminary results suggest that acupuncture needle manipulation modulates the activity of the limbic system and subcortical structures. We hypothesize that modulation of subcortical structures may be an important mechanism by which acupuncture exerts its complex multisystem effects.
10651031	A 58-year-old Chamorro female patient, who died in 1993, was examined clinicopathologically. At the age of 51, she suffered from hemiparkinsonism, then bradykinesia, rigidity without tremor, and dementia. Extrapyramidal symptoms developed, and at the age of 57, vertical gaze palsy was noted. The clinical diagnosis was parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) with vertical gaze palsy. The brain showed atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, and the atrophy was accentuated in the dentate gyrus, Ammon's horn and parahippocampal gyrus. The basal ganglia, thalamus and midbrain were moderately atrophic. The substantia nigra and locus ceruleus were completely depigmented. Numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were seen in the subiculum and amygdaloid nucleus. Many NFTs were evident in the parahippocampal gyrus, lateral occipitotemporal gyrus, insula, Sommer sector, basal nucleus of Meynert, lateral nucleus of the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and brain stem, and several were observed in the globus pallidus and hypothalamus. The Sommer sector, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus and basal nucleus of Meynert showed severe loss of neurons, and a moderate loss of neurons was exhibited by the globus pallidus. These findings were apparently consistent with those associated with PDC. However, in this patient, severe neuronal loss was seen in the subthalamic nucleus and lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and grumose degeneration, which has not previously been reported in PDC, was seen in the dentate nucleus. In addition, many tufted astrocytes, which have been reported to occur in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and postencephalitic parkinsonism, but scarcely observed in PDC, were present. Furthermore, astrocytic plaques, which have been considered as a specific finding of corticobasal degeneration (CBD), were observed in the cerebral cortex. On the other hand, granular hazy astrocytic inclusions, previously reported to occur in PDC, were not seen. Chromatolytic neurons were not observed. The question thus arises as to whether it is appropriate to consider this patient as having suffered from a combination of PDC, PSP and CBD. From the view points of absence of granular hazy astrocytic inclusions and chromatolytic neurons, and of tufted astrocytes in the neostriatum, it is conceivable that this patient is a case of a new disease entity.
10660876	An avian "pyramidal tract" was defined in zebra finches and green finches by making injections of neuronal tracers into the hyperstriatum accessorium (HA) of the rostral Wulst. Extratelencephalic projections of rostral HA traveled in the septomesencephalic tract (TSM) and gave rise to nuclear-specific terminal fields in the precerebellar medial spiriform nucleus of the posterior thalamus, the red nucleus in the mesencephalon, the medial pontine nucleus in the pons, and the subtrigeminal, external cuneate, cuneate, gracile, and inferior olivary nuclei in the medulla. Extensive but more diffuse terminal fields were also present in the stratum cellulare externum of the posterior hypothalamus, the central periaqueductal gray, the prerubral field, and the lateral and ventrolateral tegmentum of the pons and medulla. There was also a sparse projection to the dorsal thalamic nucleus intermedius ventralis anterior, which supplies the somatosensory input to the rostral Wulst, and distinct projections to the intercollicular region surrounding the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, where they partly overlapped the projections of the dorsal column nuclei. Projections from HA to the cerebellum via the TSM are described separately. In the brainstem the ventral ramus of TSM was situated ventral to the medial lemniscus at the base of the brain, entered the spinal cord in the inner margin of the lateral funiculus, predominantly ipsilaterally, and terminated bilaterally but predominantly contralaterally in the medial part of the base of the dorsal horn of the upper six or seven cervical segments. After injections of tracers into putative targets, numerous retrogradely labeled cells were found in the rostral HA, predominantly ventrally. The results confirm the presence of a major descending fiber system in passerine birds that resembles in its brainstem course and several of its terminations the pyramidal tract of mammals. The reciprocal projections of HA with the hypothalamus suggest that rostral HA may also incorporate neuronal components that in mammals would be considered parts of prefrontal cortex.
10670454	To date, two structurally related RNA-editing enzymes with adenosine deaminase activity have been identified in mammalian tissue: ADAR1 and ADAR2 [Bass B. I. et al. (1997) RNA 3, 947-949]. In rodents, ADAR2 undergoes alternative RNA splicing, giving rise to two splice variants that differ by the presence or absence of a 10-amino-acid insert in the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. However, the physiological significance of the splicing and its regional and developmental regulation are as yet unknown. The present study examined spatial and temporal patterns of ADAR2 gene transcripts within specific neuronal populations of rat brain. The two rodent ADAR2 isoforms were expressed at comparable levels at all ages examined. rADAR2 messenger RNA expression was first detectable in the thalamic nuclei formation at embryonic day E19. The rADAR2b insert and rADAR2a splice probes produced images similar to that of the rADAR2 pan probe. At birth, rADAR2a messenger RNA splice variants were abundantly expressed in the thalamic nuclei. No signal for any probe was detectable in other brain regions, including neocortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum at this stage of development. During the first week of postnatal life, rADAR2 messenger RNA expression (detected with the pan probe) increased gradually in several brain regions, with low expression detected at postnatal day P7 in the olfactory bulb, inferior colliculus, and within the pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampus. Hybridization patterns of the rADAR2a variant probe reached peak expression at about the second week of life, while peak expression of the rADAR2b probe was reached at about the third week of life. At the end of the first week of life (P7), expression of both splice variants was strongest in the thalamic nuclei. By P14, rADAR2 messenger RNA expression was more consolidated in the deeper structures, including the thalamic nuclei and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. By P21, maximal levels of rADARb expression were observed in the thalamic nuclei, inferior colliculus, cerebellum and pontine nuclei. In the adult, rADAR2 messenger RNA expression was of highest intensity in the thalamic nuclei, with high levels of expression in the olfactory bulb, inferior colliculus, cerebellum and pontine nuclei. At the level of the hippocampus, positive labelling was restricted to the CA3 region of the Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus, with weak signals in the CA1 subfield. rADAR2 pan expression was at near background levels throughout the neocortex and caudate putamen. In summary, our study shows that ADAR2 messenger RNA expression is regulated in a cell-specific manner throughout development. At early ages, ADAR2 messenger RNA is expressed only within (and restricted to) the thalamic nuclei. By the third postnatal week, expression of the editase enzyme is more widely distributed throughout the olfactory bulb, CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, thalamus, inferior colliculus and the molecular cell layer of the cerebellum. ADAR2 is thought to act at specific nucleotide positions in primary transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits, thereby altering gating and ionic permeability properties of AMPA- and kainate-activated channels. ADAR2 also acts at pre-messenger RNA encoding the serotonin 5HT-2C receptor to alter G-protein coupling. Thus, RNA editing may be an important mechanism for fine-tuning of the physiological and pharmacological properties of transmitter receptors of the central nervous system.
10689933	The patient was 68 year-old woman with an 8-year history of parkinsonism which was followed by psychiatric symptoms and neurogenic amyotrophy 5 years after the onset. She had a family history of parkinsonism associated with dementia in all of her three siblings. They grew up in Hobara village, a focus of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Kii Peninsula of Japan, in their childhood. Their parents were neither consanguineous nor natives of the Kii Peninsula. The brain weight was 1,040 g, and there were mild frontal lobe atrophy, moderate atrophy of pes hippocampi, decoloration of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, and anterior spinal root atrophy. The microscopic examinations revealed degeneration of CA 1 portion of the hippocampus to parahippocampal gyrus, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus and spinal anterior horn with Bunina body. The spinal pyramidal tracts also degenerated mildly. The neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were observed in the cerebral cortex, especially in the cortices through hippocampus to lateral occipitotemporal gyri, basal nucleus of Meynert, basal ganglia, thalamus, substantia nigra and widespread regions of the central nervous system through the brainstem to the spinal cord including the nucleus of Onufrowicz. In spite of a few amount of the senile plaques in the cerebral cortex and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, abundant NFT distributed mainly in the third layer of the cerebral cortex, which is the characteristic finding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinsonism-dementia Complex (ALS/PDC) in the island of Guam. Thus this was verified ALS/PDC case outside the Guam island. The high incidence of neurological disease in her siblings and their history of living in the focus region in childhood suggest the genetic factor of ALS/PDC which is sensitive to certain environmental agents in the early stage of the life.
10710158	Understanding variability of human brain structure sizes during development is important for the design and interpretation of pediatric neuroimaging studies. In this study we analyze the effects of hemisphere, sex and age on size variability of the total cerebrum, cerebellum, lateral ventricles, temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, corpus callosum, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus in 115 healthy children and adolescents, ages 4-20 years. Variability differed significantly across structures, with the lateral ventricles demonstrating the highest coefficient of variation and the putamen the lowest. Males varied significantly more than females in the left cerebrum and left superior temporal gyrus, whereas females varied more than males in the right caudate and right putamen. Age effects were seen in increased variability after puberty for the lateral ventricles, hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus. These variances are important determinants of minimum sample sizes required to detect group differences in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.
10719219	To elucidate the sites of and mechanisms of analgesic effect of centrally injected calcitonin, we examined expression of calcitonin receptor mRNA in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization techniques. Calcitonin receptor mRNA was expressed in various brain regions, including the preoptic area, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, gigantocellular reticular nucleus alpha part, lateral paragigantocellular nucleus, raphe magnus nucleus and solitary tract nucleus, which are known to play important roles in pain modulation. In addition, a double in situ hybridization technique demonstrated the intense expression of calcitonin receptor mRNA on serotonergic neurons in some raphe nuclei and the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus, suggesting the involvement of central serotonergic pathways in analgesic effect of calcitonin.
10725386	The cloned vanilloid receptor VR1 has attracted recent attention as a molecular integrator of painful stimuli on primary sensory neurons. The existence of vanilloid-sensitive neurons in the brain is, however, controversial. In this study, we have used an antibody and a complementary RNA probe to explore the distribution of neurons that express VR1 in rat and in certain areas of human brain. In the rat, we observed VR1-expressing neurons throughout the whole neuroaxis, including all cortical areas (in layers 3 and 5), several members of the limbic system (e.g., hippocampus, central amygdala, and both medial and lateral habenula), striatum, hypothalamus, centromedian and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, reticular formation, locus coeruleus, cerebellum, and inferior olive. VR1-immunopositive cells also were found in the third and fifth layers of human parietal cortex. Reverse transcription-PCR performed with rat VR1-specific primers verified the expression of VR1 mRNA in cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. In the central nervous system, neonatal capsaicin treatment depleted VR1 mRNA from the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, but not from other areas such as the inferior olive. The finding that VR1 is expressed not only in primary sensory neurons but also in several brain nuclei is of great importance in that it places VRs in a much broader perspective than pain perception. VRs in the brain (and putative endogenous vanilloids) may be involved in the control of emotions, learning, and satiety, just to name a few exciting possibilities.
10727618	The gut-brain peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK), inhibits food intake when injected either systemically or within the brain. To determine whether CCK's effect in the brain is anatomically specific, CCK-8 (0. 8, 4, 20, 100, 500 pmol) was microinjected into one of 14 different brain sites of rats, and its impact on subsequent food intake was measured. CCK-8 at 500 pmol significantly suppressed intake during the first hour post-injection following administration into six hypothalamic sites (anterior hypothalamus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus) and two hindbrain sites (nucleus tractus solitarius, fourth ventricle). Although lower doses were sometimes effective (anterior hypothalamus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, nucleus tractus solitarius), there appeared to be no significant difference in potency among sites. Injections into the medial amygdala, nucleus accumbens, posterior hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and ventral tegmental area were either ineffective or produced a delayed response. The higher doses required for most sites, as well as the widespread effectiveness of CCK-8 within the hypothalamus, suggest that spread of CCK-8 to adjacent brain sites, and (or) to the periphery, may have been required for anorexia to occur. Findings reported in an accompanying paper provide strong evidence that paraventricular nucleus injection of CCK-8 (500 pmol) did not increase plasma CCK-levels sufficiently to suppress feeding by a peripheral mechanism. Together, these results suggest that CCK may be acting as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator within two different brain regions to produce satiety - one region which includes the nucleus tractus solitarius in the hindbrain, and another more distributed region within the medial-basal hypothalamus.
10734009	Specific cerebral lesions have shown the crucial role of the brain in the control of micturition. The precise identification of the anatomical cerebral structures involved in micturition can contribute to a better understanding of the control of micturition and the development of therapeutic models. Various neuropathological and animal studies have referred to the medulla oblongata, pons, limbic system, superior frontal lobe and premotor cortical regions as areas implicated in micturition control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the activity of these areas during micturition can be confirmed by PET in normal men. The distribution of the regional cerebral blood flow after bolus injection of (15)O water was used as an indirect measure of cerebral activation. PET scans were performed during the following three conditions: (i) at rest with the bladder empty; (ii) during simulated micturition after instillation of isotonic saline into the urinary bladder; and (iii) the withholding of urine (saline). Normal micturition using this model was achieved in eight out of 12 right-handed normal subjects. The changes in bladder contraction, bladder pressure and intra-abdominal pressure were monitored on-line during the whole scanning session by a cystometry device. The images were analysed using statistical parametric mapping at a significance threshold of P < 0.05 with correction for multiple independent comparisons. Micturition versus rest was associated with bilateral activation of areas close to the postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, globus pallidus, cortex cerebelli, vermis and midbrain. On the left side, activation of the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, superior precentral gyrus, thalamus and the caudal part of the anterior cingulate gyrus was seen, while on the right side we found activation in the supramarginal gyrus, mesencephalon and insula. When the threshold value was lowered to P < 0.001 (Z > 3.09) without correction for multiple comparisons, we found additional activation in the medial pontine tegmentum, mesencephalon, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus and left insula. When urine- withholding was compared with rest, the left insula showed a tendency to activate. We conclude from this study, in which urinary bladder contraction was verified cystometrically, that the onset and maintenance of micturition in normal men is associated with a vast network of cortical and subcortical regions, confirming observations from clinical and animal studies.
10753310	The lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (lMAN) is necessary for both initial learning of vocal patterns in developing zebra finches, as well as for modification of adult song under some circumstances. Lateral MAN is composed of two subregions: a core of magnocellular neurons and a surrounding shell composed primarily of parvocellular neurons. Neurons in lMAN(core) project to a region of motor cortex known as robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), whereas neurons in lMAN(shell) project to a region adjacent to RA known as dorsal archistriatum (Ad). We studied the axonal connections of Ad in adult male zebra finches. In contrast to RA, Ad neurons make a large number of efferent projections, which do not include direct inputs to vocal or respiratory motor neurons. The major efferent projections of Ad are to: (1) the striatum of avian basal ganglia; (2) a dorsal thalamic zone (including the song-control nuclei dorsomedial nucleus of the posterior thalamus [DMP] and dorsolateral nucleus of the medial thalamus [DLM]); (3) restricted regions within the lateral hypothalamus (stratum cellulare externum [SCE]), which may also relay information to the same dorsal thalamic zone; (4) a nucleus in the caudal thalamus (medial spiriform nucleus [SpM]); (5) deep layers of the tectum, which project to the thalamic song-control nucleus Uva; (6) broad regions of pontine and midbrain reticular formation; and (7) areas within the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (ventral tegmental area [AVT], substantia nigra [SN]), which overlap with regions that project to Area X, a song-control nucleus of avian striatum. Inputs to Ad derive not only from lMAN(shell), but also from a large area of dorsolateral caudal neostriatum (dNCL), which also receives input from lMAN(shell). That is, lMAN(shell) neurons project directly to Ad, and also multisynaptically to Ad via dNCL. Double-labeling studies show that lMAN(shell) contains two different populations of projection neurons: one that projects to Ad and another to dNCL. These results are exciting for two main reasons. The first is that some of these projections represent potential closed-loop circuits that could relay information back to song-control nuclei of the telencephalon, possibly allowing diverse types of song-related information to be both integrated between loops and compared during the period of auditory-motor integration. Because both auditory experience with an adult (tutor) song pattern and auditory feedback are essential to vocal learning, closed-loop pathways could serve as comparator circuits in which efferent commands, auditory feedback, and the memory of the tutor song are compared in an iterative fashion to achieve a gradual refinement of vocal production until it matches the tutor song. In addition, these circuits seem to have a strong integrative and limbic flavor. That is, the axonal connections of Ad neurons clearly include regions that receive inputs not only from somatosensory, visual, and auditory areas of cortex, but also from limbic regions, suggesting that they may be involved in higher order sensory processing, arousal, and motivation.
10754510	The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (VLG) are ventral thalamic derivatives within the lateral geniculate complex. In this study, IGL and VLG efferent projections were compared by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde transport of FluoroGold. Projections from the IGL and VLG leave the geniculate in four pathways. A dorsal pathway innervates the thalamic lateral dorsal nucleus (VLG), the reuniens and rhomboid nuclei (VLG and IGL), and the paraventricular nucleus (IGL). A ventral pathway runs through the geniculohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the anterior hypothalamus (IGL). A medial pathway innervates the zona incerta and dorsal hypothalamus (VLG and IGL); the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area (VLG); and the retrochiasmatic area (RCA), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and subparaventricular zone (IGL). A caudal pathway projects medially to the posterior hypothalamic area and periaqueductal gray and caudally along the brachium of the superior colliculus to the medial pretectal area and the nucleus of the optic tract (IGL and VLG). Caudal IGL axons also terminate in the olivary pretectal nucleus, the superficial gray of the superior colliculus, and the lateral and dorsal terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system. Caudal VLG projections innervate the lateral posterior nucleus, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the intermediate and deep gray of the superior colliculus, the dorsal terminal nucleus, the midbrain lateral tegmental field, the interpeduncular nucleus, the ventral pontine reticular formation, the medial and lateral pontine gray, the parabrachial region, and the accessory inferior olive. This pattern of IGL and VLG projections is consistent with our understanding of the distinct functions of each of these ventral thalamic derivatives.
10782258	The distribution of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-like immunoreactive structures was studied in the brainstem of the cat using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Immunoreactivity was observed in several brainstem nuclei of the cat in which no immunoreactivity had been previously reported. Immunoreactive fibres were observed in the following; the inferior central nucleus; the pontine gray nuclei; the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus; the motor trigeminal nucleus, the anteroventral cochlear nucleus; the abducens nucleus; the retrofacial nucleus; the superior, lateral, inferior, and medial vestibular nuclei; the lateral nucleus of the superior olive; the external cuneate nucleus; the nucleus of the trapezoid body; the postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe; the medial accessory inferior olive; the dorsal accessory nucleus of the inferior olive; the nucleus ambiguus; the principal nucleus of the inferior olive; the preolivary nucleus; the nucleus ruber; the substantia nigra; and in the area postrema. Our results point to a more widespread distribution of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-like immunoreactive structures in the cat brainstem than that reported in previous studies carried out in the same region of the cat, rat and humans.
10792584	We investigated the effect of 10 months ovariectomy and a correction therapy, 2 weeks before the rats were killed, of oestradiol, progesterone or their combination on NMDA and AMPA receptor binding in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, striatum, nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex of the rat brain as well as on amino acid levels in frontal cortex. NMDA and AMPA binding densities were assayed by autoradiography using, respectively, L-[3H]glutamate and [3H]AMPA; amino acid concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatograhy (HPLC) coupled with UV detection. Ovariectomy was without effect on NMDA and AMPA binding density in all brain regions assayed except in the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus where it decreased NMDA binding density compared to intact rats values. Oestradiol restored and increased NMDA binding density in the CA1 subfield and the dentate gyrus of ovariectomized rats but, by contrast, it decreased binding density in the striatum and in the frontal cortex while having no effect in the CA2/3 subfield of the hippocampus and in the nucleus accumbens. Oestradiol was without effect on AMPA binding density in the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus but it reduced AMPA binding density in the striatum, the frontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Progesterone, and oestradiol combined with progesterone, decreased NMDA but not AMPA binding density in the frontal cortex of ovariectomized rats, and they were without effect on these receptors in the other brain regions assayed. Amino acid concentrations in the frontal cortex were unchanged after ovariectomy or steroid treatments. The effect of oestradiol in the hippocampus confirmed in the present study and our novel findings in the frontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens may have functional significance for schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases.
10797128	We have been studying the ontogeny of the blood-brain barrier function in ovine fetuses and lambs. During these studies, we have found that the duration of ventilation also influences blood-brain barrier permeability in premature lambs. Chronically instrumented hysterotomy-delivered surfactant-treated premature lambs were studied at 90% or 137 days of gestation (n = 9). Blood-brain barrier function was quantified with the blood-to-brain transfer constant K(i) to alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Linear regression analysis was used to compare the K(i) values in the brain regions, as the dependent variable, to the duration of ventilation, as the independent variable. There were direct correlations (P < 0.05) between the K(i) values and the duration of ventilation [306 min (mean), 162-474 min (range)] in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, pons, cervical spinal cord, and choroid plexus, but not in the pituitary gland. Ventilatory pressures and rates were established before the onset of the permeability studies. Calculated mean airway pressures [14 cmH(2)O (mean), 7-20 cmH(2)O (range)] from similarly studied premature lambs did not correlate with the duration of positive-pressure ventilation. We conclude that increases in the duration of positive-pressure ventilation predispose premature lambs to increases in regional blood-brain barrier permeability. These alterations in barrier function occur over relatively short time intervals (minutes to hours). In our study, these changes in permeability are most likely not attributable to changes in mean airway pressure.
10797549	bcl-xbeta is a novel apoptosis-regulating member of the bcl-x family that has recently been isolated from rats and mice. To explore the functional role of Bcl-xbeta, we raised a monoclonal antibody against rat Bcl-xbeta protein and investigated the cellular localization of the molecule in the rat CNS. Immunohistochemistry revealed that, in the fetal and neonatal stages, Bcl-xbeta was intensively and widely expressed in the CNS. Many neurons in the diencephalon and brain stem showed intense cytoplasmic labeling. The immunoreactivity decreased during the postnatal development and reached to the level of adulthood by P14. In the adult brain and spinal cord, labeling was restricted to specific types of neurons and distributed throughout their somata and dendrites. Weak immunoreactivity was present in many CNS regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, locus ceruleus, pontine nuclei, inferior olive, reticular formation, cerebellar cortex and spinal anterior horn. Amygdaloid nuclei and hippocampal CA1 to CA3 sectors showed restricted expression of Bcl-xbeta in a subset of neurons. Neuronal labeling was almost undetectable in several regions, including the piriform cortex, hypothalamus, posterior column nuclei and spinal posterior horn. These results suggest that Bcl-xbeta plays an important role throughout the CNS in developing stage and may regulate the apoptosis of postnatal CNS neurons.
10802026	Goalpha is a guanine nucloetide-binding regulatory protein alpha subunit which is mainly distributed in the central nervous system, but it has not previously been reported how it is regulated by thyroid hormone in the brain of neonatal rat at transcriptional levels. In this report, we used quantitative competitive reverse transcriptional PCR to quantify the effects of TH deficiency on Goalpha gene expression in the brain of neonatal rat at mRNA levels. It was found that Goalpha mRNA levels in the brain of 14-day-old rats significantly increased over 3-fold after induction of perinatal hypothyroidism, and declined markedly after treatment of thyroxine replacement. In situ hybridization histochemistry was further employed to observe the time-course and spatial expression of Goalpha gene in the brain of neonatal rats affected by thyroid hormone deficiency during the developmental period. The data showed that perinatal hypothyroidism can enhance Goalpha mRNA levels in the temporal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, piriform cortex, amygdala, hippocampal CA1-4 subfields, dentate gyrus, arcuate nucleus (AR) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) of hypothalamus, but not in the striate cortex, cingulate cortex, claustrum, caudate/putamen and thalamus in the brain of rat at 7-21 days post-partum. The results suggest that up-regulation of Goalpha gene expression may be one kind of common mechanism responsible for neurological deficits in some brain areas arising from thyroid hormone deficiency in the critical periods of neonatal rats.
10814526	Leptin exerts its effects by interacting with specific membrane receptors (Ob-R). We studied the exact localization of long intracellular domain form (Ob-Rb) in human brain. In addition, we analyzed the regulatory features of Ob-Rb expression in two neuroblastoma cell lines. The Ob-Rb mRNAs were abundant in putamen, frontal lobe, medulla, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, and amygdala, indicating that Ob-Rb transcripts are expressed differently from that of other Ob-R isoforms. In SK-N-MC cells, the expression of Ob-Rb mRNA was induced by increasing doses of insulin, and the maximum amount of mRNA expression was 9.4-fold higher in the presence of insulin (100 nM for 24 h), compared to the absence of insulin. In IMR32 cells, the transcripts were increased 4.0-fold when cells were incubated with 1 nM of insulin for 48 h. In contrast, Ob-Rb expression in IMR32 cells decreased to 18% of control following a 24-h incubation period with 50 ng/mL of leptin, compared to incubation in the absence of leptin. These results indicate that expression of Ob-Rb is differentially regulated by inhibitory signals of energy balance in neuroblastoma cells. The identification of the novel regulatory mechanisms involving the Ob-Rb isoform by insulin and leptin now makes it possible to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involving increased food intake and uncontrolled energy balance associated with leptin resistance in obese individuals.
10824685	We have examined the patterns of projections from different nuclei of the brain stem to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) of the thalamus. Injections of biotinylated dextran were made into different nuclei of the brainstem (i.e., midbrain reticular nucleus, pontine reticular nucleus, deep layers of superior colliculus, periaqueductal grey matter [ventrolateral, dorsolateral, and lateral columns], pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus, substantia nigra [pars reticulata], locus coeruleus, and dorsal raphe) of Sprague-Dawley rats using stereotaxic coordinates. Our results show that all of the above mentioned brain-stem nuclei have overlapping projections to the medial regions of the vLGN, within the parvocellular lamina of the nucleus. This if the first instance of the parvocellular lamina being shown to receive a major set of projections. Very few labelled terminals from the brain stem were ever seen within the larger more lateral magnocellular lamina, which has been shown by previous studies to receive heavy inputs from visually associated structures, such as the retina and occipital cortex. Since many of the brain-stem nuclei injected in this study have little to do with visual processing, our results suggest that one can perhaps package the vLGN into distinct visual (magnocellular) and nonvisual (parvocellular) components.
10841454	The distribution of the GABA transporter GAT-1 was studied in the monkey brainstem and spinal cord, using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of GAT-1. Very dense staining was observed in the interpeduncular nucleus, the inferior olivary nucleus and the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, whilst dense labelling was observed in the substantia nigra, cochlear nuclei, vestibular nuclei, the spinal nucleus of V, the area postrema and the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Electron microscopy showed that the labelled profiles consisted of axon terminals that formed symmetrical synapses, consistent with GABAergic terminals. Many of the nuclei that were densely labelled for GAT-1 were those that received primary auditory, vestibular, or somatosensory inputs and the high density of GAT-1 in these nuclei suggests that GAT-1 plays an important role in terminating the inhibitory effects of GABA, at these nuclei.
10842346	Dystonia musculorum (dt(J)/dt(J)) mutant mice suffer from a degeneration of spinocerebellar tracts as well as a dystrophy of peripheral sensory tracts. This neurological mutant has been proposed as an animal model of human cerebellar ataxia, in particular of the Friedreich's type; thus, it was deemed of interest to examine the endogenous contents of dopamine (DA) and metabolites as well as the distribution of DA receptors of the D(1) and D(2) subtypes, in order to delimit the biochemical characteristics of this pathological disorder, and determine an eventual dopaminergic dysfunction in this mutant. Tissue DA and its major metabolites 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 3-methoxytyramine were measured by HPLC coupled to electrochemical detection in six cortical regions, in four divisions of rostral neostriatum and two halves of caudal neostriatum, as well as in olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, septum, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. The only significant difference between dt(J)/dt(J) mice and wild-type controls was an increase in hypothalamic DA contents (+47%). Quantitative autoradiography with [(3)H]SCH23390 and [(3)H]raclopride, to label D(1) and D(2) receptors, respectively, revealed only moderate changes in receptor densities in a few localized regions. In dt(J)/dt(J) mutants, D(1) receptor numbers were found to be higher in thalamus (+27%) as well as in the medio-dorsal (+16%) and in the latero-dorsal (+16%) quadrants of rostral neostriatum, while D(2) receptor densities were greater in the medio-ventral (+32%) and the latero-dorsal (+17%) quadrants. The present results indicate an overall conservation of dopaminergic functions, albeit the few localized sites of increased D(1) and D(2) receptor densities, and that are seemingly independent of the DA innervation pattern, as revealed by the tissue measurements of DA and metabolites. They also rule out a major pathology linked to deficits in DA neurotransmission, and validate this mutant as an animal model of human cerebellar ataxia, probably of the Friedreich type.
10858616	To reveal the somatotopy of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus that functions as a brainstem motor center, we examined the distribution patterns of corticotegmental inputs from the somatic motor areas of the frontal lobe in the macaque monkey. Based on the somatotopical map prepared by intracortical microstimulation, injections of the anterograde tracers, biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, were made into the following motor-related areas: the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas, the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex, and the frontal eye field. Data obtained from the present experiments were as follows: (i) Corticotegmental inputs from orofacial, forelimb, and hindlimb representations of the primary motor cortex tended to be arranged orderly from medial to lateral in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. However, the distribution areas of these inputs considerably overlapped; (ii) The major input zones from distal representations of the forelimb and hindlimb regions of the primary motor cortex were located medial to those from their proximal representations, although there was a substantial overlap between the distribution areas of distal versus proximal limb inputs; (iii) The main terminal zones from the forelimb regions of the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas, and the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex appeared to overlap largely in the mediolaterally middle aspect of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus; and (iv) Corticotegmental input from the frontal eye field was scattered over the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus.Thus, the present results indicate that the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is likely to receive partly separate but essentially convergent cortical inputs not only from multiple motor-related areas representing the same body part, but also from multiple regions representing diverse body parts. This suggests that somatotopical representations are intermingled rather than segregated in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus.
10895883	The human primary somatosensory cortex consists of four cytoarchitectonic subdivisions (3a, 3b, 1 and 2) that are likely to contain distinct somatosensory representations. The intraareal organization of these areas as well as that of the primary motor cortex (area 4) has been analyzed using histochemical stains of cytochrome oxidase, acetylcholinesterase and NADPH-diaphorase activity in normal human brains. Cytochrome oxidase activity was revealed in individual cortical neurons and neuropil. Areas 4, 3a and 3b were on average darker than areas 1 and 2. The laminar distribution of cytochrome oxidase activity varied in different areas. A prominent dark band was present in layers IV and lower III in areas 3a and 3b and in layer III in areas 1, 2 and 4. Acetylcholinesterase staining revealed fibers and pyramidal cells in layers III and V; stained layer III pyramids were rare in areas 3a and 3b and numerous in areas 1, 2 and 4. NADPH-diaphorase positive elements included Golgi-like stained non-pyramidal neurons and Nissl-like stained pyramidal neurons; the former were found, in small numbers, in layer II of areas 4, 3a, 3b and 1, and the latter in layers III and V of areas 4 and 3a and in layer V of areas 1 and 2. The dark cytochrome oxidase staining of layer IV and the paucity of acetylcholinesterase positive pyramids in areas 3a and 3b resemble the pattern found in primary visual and auditory areas, whereas the dark cytochrome oxidase staining in layer III and abundance of acetylcholinesterase positive pyramids in areas 1 and 2 that of association areas. These results suggest that the four areas included in human SI constitute hierarchical stages of cortical processing, with 3a and 3b corresponding to primary and 1 and 2 to secondary areas.
10906715	Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is an opioid-like heptadecapeptide agonist for the opioid receptor homolog, N/OFQ receptor. To explore the precise distribution of the peptide-receptor system, the authors examined the brain and spinal cord from receptor-deficient mice bearing the targeted mutation (morc(m1)), a lacZ insertional mutation in the N/OFQ receptor gene. Precursor protein N/OFQ (preproN/OFQ) mRNA was detected by using in situ hybridization, and the N/OFQ receptor was detected by using X-gal histochemistry. The N/OFQ receptor reflected by lacZ expression was observed at high levels in the dentate gyrus, lateral septum, subparafascicular thalamic nucleus, medial preoptic area, median preoptic nucleus, ventromedial preoptic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, auditory brainstem nuclei, pontine dorsal tegmentum, and nucleus of the solitary tract. In situ detection of the N/OFQ receptor mRNA by digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes coupled with tyramide signal amplification in normal and wild-type mice resulted in the regional distribution paralleling the lacZ expression in these regions. PreproN/OFQ mRNA was expressed at high levels in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus, central gray, central tegmental field, auditory brainstem nuclei, caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus, and spinal dorsal horn. Furthermore, variable levels of expression of the peptide and receptor were seen in distinct sites of the brain and spinal cord. These data indicate a correspondence of the peptide and the receptor in local distribution at limbic, hypothalamic, and brainstem sites. Together with concurrent physiologic and behavioral studies in mutant mice, the results suggest functional roles for the N/OFQ system, including the central regulation of learning and memory, hearing ability, water balance, food intake, and blood pressure.
10929318	Opinions on the evolutionary origins of mammalian neocortex have divided into two camps: (1) antecedents of the superior neocortex (i.e. occipital, parietal and frontal lobes) and temporal neocortex (i.e. temporal lobe) were present in stem amniotes, and these antecedent regions gave rise to dorsal cortex and dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), respectively, in living reptiles; (2) the stem amniote antecedent of mammalian superior neocortex gave rise to dorsal cortex in the reptilian lineage, while the stem amniote antecedent of mammal claustrum, endopiriform region and/or basolateral/basomedial amygdala gave rise to DVR in reptiles, with mammalian temporal neocortex being a newly evolved structure with no reptilian homologue. The latter hypothesis has the merit of being more consistent with some current homeobox gene data, but it has the disadvantages of positing that mammalian temporal neocortex arose de novo, and of assuming that the high similarity between DVR and temporal neocortex in the organization of thalamic sensory input and corticostriatal projections and in the topology of sensory areas is coincidental. If one assumes that the antecedent of superior and temporal neocortex in stem amniotes was one continuous field that histologically resembled dorsal cortex in living reptiles, the first hypothesis provides basis for a parsimonious account of the origin of superior and temporal neocortex and their considerable resemblance to dorsal cortex and DVR in reptiles, as well as to Wulst and DVR in birds.
10932182	Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau are prominent in Alzheimer disease (AD), Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Mutations in the gene (Mtapt) encoding tau protein cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), thereby proving that tau dysfunction can directly result in neurodegeneration. Expression of human tau containing the most common FTDP-17 mutation (P301L) results in motor and behavioural deficits in transgenic mice, with age- and gene-dose-dependent development of NFT. This phenotype occurred as early as 6.5 months in hemizygous and 4.5 months in homozygous animals. NFT and Pick-body-like neuronal lesions occurred in the amygdala, septal nuclei, pre-optic nuclei, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla, deep cerebellar nuclei and spinal cord, with tau-immunoreactive pre-tangles in the cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia. Areas with the most NFT had reactive gliosis. Spinal cord had axonal spheroids, anterior horn cell loss and axonal degeneration in anterior spinal roots. We also saw peripheral neuropathy and skeletal muscle with neurogenic atrophy. Brain and spinal cord contained insoluble tau that co-migrated with insoluble tau from AD and FTDP-17 brains. The phenotype of mice expressing P301L mutant tau mimics features of human tauopathies and provides a model for investigating the pathogenesis of diseases with NFT.
10943123	The organization of the cerebellum is characterized by a number of parallel and parasagittally ordered olivocorticonuclear modules; as such, the cerebellar nuclei basically function as output system of these modules. The present study provides a comprehensive and detailed description of the organization of the connections from the cerebellar nuclei to the brain stem in the rat. Thirteen small injections with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin or biotinylated dextran amine which were centered on various aspects of the cerebellar nuclear complex are described and are illustrated with serial plots detailing the distribution of labeled varicosities throughout the brain stem. In every case at least 1,000 an up to 36,000 varicosities were plotted. All injections resulted in some or heavy labeling concentrated within specific regions of the contralateral inferior olivary complex and, usually, in some labeling of the contralateral ventrolateral thalamus. However, apart from these two areas it is shown that the cerebellar projections are generally very widespread and may be found throughout the entire brain stem. Below, only a survey of main projection areas will be given. Terminal arborizations originating from the rostral part of the medial cerebellar nucleus are mostly found in the caudal half of the brain stem with emphasis on the vestibular nuclear complex, whereas its caudal part rather connects to midbrain areas. Terminals that originate from the dorsolateral protuberance of the medial cerebellar nucleus are distributed more evenly throughout the brain stem and are mostly confined to reticular areas. The interstitial cell groups, interspersed between the medial and both interposed cerebellar nuclei, provide major projections to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclear complex and contralateral mesodiencephalic regions. However, reticular areas are also targeted over a large rostrocaudal range. The medial part of the posterior interposed nucleus sends most projections to the caudomedial red nucleus, prerubral regions and parvicellular reticular formation, all contralateral to the injection site. Projections that originate from more laterally placed injections are directed, apart from the inferior olivary complex, to the rostral half of the contralateral brain stem, where most labeled varicosities are found in the superior colliculus and zona incerta. The anterior interposed nucleus specifically targets the inferior olive, the red nucleus, the pontine reticulotegmental nucleus, the prectectum and the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. More laterally placed injections also project to the ipsilateral parvicellular reticular formation and deep layers of the spinal trigeminal complex. The latter areas are more specifically targeted by the dorsolateral hump. In addition, its projections are found in the red nucleus and pretectum but do not seem to reach the ventrolateral thalamus. Projections from the lateral cerebellar nucleus are all characterized by a widespread distribution of terminals. Especially, the caudal aspect of the nucleus sends, apart from projections to the deep mesencephalic nucleus, red nucleus, periaquaductal gray, pretectum, prerubral area, and several thalamic regions, prominent projections to the caudal brain stem which terminate in the inferior olive and gigantocellular reticular formation. Projections from the ventral, parvicellular part of the nucleus are mostly, but not exclusively, directed to the rostral half of the brain stem and mainly terminate in the pararubral area, accessory oculomotor nuclei, pretectal areas, zona incerta, and in the parafascicular and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. We conclude that the impact of the cerebellar nuclei on the brain stem is widespread; projections from different regions of the same cerebellar nucleus may show important differences in distribution of labeled terminals. On the other hand, injections placed in different cerebellar nuclei may result in a simila
10963126	Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine, is presently the most specific marker for identifying cholinergic neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The present article reviews immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies on the distribution of neurons expressing ChAT in the human central nervous system. Neurons with both immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals of ChAT are observed in the basal forebrain (diagonal band of Broca and nucleus basalis of Meynert), striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens), cerebral cortex, mesopontine tegmental nuclei (pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and parabigeminal nucleus), cranial motor nuclei and spinal motor neurons. The cerebral cortex displays regional and laminal differences in the distribution of neurons with ChAT. The medial septal nucleus and medial habenular nucleus contain immunoreactive neurons for ChAT, which are devoid of ChAT mRNA signals. This is probably because there is a small number of cholinergic neurons with a low level of ChAT gene expression in these nuclei of human. Possible connections and speculated functions of these neurons are briefly summarized.
10975881	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a novel putative peptide neurotransmitter. We studied the expression of CART mRNA throughout the human postmortem brain by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. The cortical expression was distinct with high mRNA expression levels in the piriform cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral orbital prefrontal cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and middle temporal cortex, but extremely low levels in immediately adjacent cortical areas, e.g., the medial prefrontal cortex, subcallosal gyrus, and superior temporal cortex. Within the striatum, CART mRNA was only detected in the nucleus accumbens, primarily in the most medial area. No positive CART mRNA-expressing neurons were found in the dorsal caudate nucleus and putamen. High mRNA expression levels were evident within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis as well as the amygdala (central, cortical, and medial nuclei). In the hippocampus, intense expression was found within the uncal gyrus and moderate to high levels in the CA3 and polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. CART mRNA expression was also detected in the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe, but no positive labeling was apparent in the substantia nigra. Overall, the most abundant CART mRNA expression levels in the human brain were detected within in the hypothalamus (posterior, paraventricular nucleus, premammillary, tuberomamillary, dorsomedial, arcuate) and the thalamus (mediodorsal, pulvinar, anterior, zona incerta, geniculate). Rat brain specimens were also studied and many similarities to the human CART mRNA expression were evident. However, the most marked species difference was the virtual absence of the CART mRNA in the rat thalamus.
10978692	In order to study neural systems which are involved in motor timing we used whole-brain functional resonance imaging while subjects performed a paced finger-tapping task (PFT) with their right index finger. During one condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with tones separated by a constant interval (auditory synchronisation, AS), followed by tapping without the pacing stimulus (auditory continuation, AC). In another condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with a visual stimulus presented at the same frequency as the tones (visual synchronisation, VS) followed by a tapping sequence without visual pacing (visual continuation, VC). The following main results were obtained: (1) tapping in the context of visual pacing was generally more variable than tapping in the context of auditory stimuli; (2) during all conditions, a fronto-parietal network was active including the dorsal lateral premotor cortex (dPMC), M1, S1, inferior parietal lobule (LPi), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), the right cerebellar hemisphere, and the paravermial region; (3) stronger activation in the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), the left LPi, the SMA, the right inferior cerebellum, and the left thalamus during both auditory conditions (AS and AC) compared to the visual conditions (VS and VC); (4) stronger activation in the right superior cerebellum, the vermis, and the right LPi during the visual conditions (VS and VC); (5) similar activations for the AS and AC conditions; but (6) marked differences between the VS and VC conditions especially in the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and LPi areas; and (7) finally, there were no activations in the auditory and visual cortices when the pacing stimuli were absent. These findings were taken as evidence for a general difference between the motor control modes operative during the auditory and visual conditions. Paced finger tapping in the context of auditory pacing stimuli relies more on brain structures subserving internal motor control while paced finger-tapping in the context of visual pacing stimuli relies on brain structures relying on the subserving processing or imagination of visual pacing stimuli.
10992247	Neurokinin B (NKB) is one member of an evolutionarily conserved family of neuropeptides, the tachykinins. Preferential binding of NKB to endogenous NK(3) receptors affects a variety of biological and physiological processes, including endocrine secretions, sensory transmission, and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. In light of its widespread biological actions, immunohistochemical detection of the c-Fos protein product was used to study the distribution of neuronal activation in the rat brain caused by intraventricular (icv) injections of the selective NK(3) receptor agonist (succinyl-[Asp(6), N-Me-Phe(8)] substance P [6-11]), senktide. Quantitative analysis revealed that treatment with isotonic saline or 200 ng senktide resulted in the differential expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) throughout the brain. Senktide induced the highest number of FLI neurons in the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, median preoptic nucleus, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, supraoptic nucleus, periaqueductal gray, and medial nucleus of the solitary tract compared to isotonic saline controls. Additional regions that contained elevated FLI following icv injection of senktide, relative to saline injection, included the cerebral cortex, lateral hypothalamic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, inferior colliculus, locus coeruleus, zona incerta, and arcuate nucleus. Our data indicate that activation of NK(3) receptors induces the expression of FLI within circumscribed regions of the rat brain. This pattern of neuronal activation overlaps with nuclei known to regulate homeostatic processes, such as endocrine secretion, cardiovascular function, salt intake, and nociception.
11012860	Functional neuroimaging using positron emission tomography has recently yielded original data on the functional neuroanatomy of human sleep. This paper attempts to describe the possibilities and limitations of the technique and clarify its usefulness in sleep research. A short overview of the methods of acquisition and statistical analysis (statistical parametric mapping, SPM) is presented before the results of PET sleep studies are reviewed. The discussion attempts to integrate the functional neuroimaging data into the body of knowledge already acquired on sleep in animals and humans using various other techniques (intracellular recordings, in situ neurophysiology, lesional and pharmacological trials, scalp EEG recordings, behavioural or psychological description). The published PET data describe a very reproducible functional neuroanatomy in sleep. The core characteristics of this 'canonical' sleep may be summarized as follows. In slow-wave sleep, most deactivated areas are located in the dorsal pons and mesencephalon, cerebellum, thalami, basal ganglia, basal forebrain/hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and in the mesial aspect of the temporal lobe. During rapid-eye movement sleep, significant activations were found in the pontine tegmentum, thalamic nuclei, limbic areas (amygdaloid complexes, hippocampal formation, anterior cingulate cortex) and in the posterior cortices (temporo-occipital areas). In contrast, the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, were the least active brain regions. These preliminary studies open up a whole field in sleep research. More detailed explorations of sleep in humans are now accessible to experimental challenges using PET and other neuroimaging techniques. These new methods will contribute to a better understanding of sleep functions.
11020231	Previous reports have shown that the supramammillary nucleus projects to the medial septum and to the hippocampus, and specifically to the dentate gyrus and the CA2/CA3a region of the hippocampus. The aim of the present study was to examine collateral projections from the supramammillary nucleus to the septum and hippocampus. The fluorescent retrograde tracers, Fluororuby and Fluorogold, were injected into regions of the septum and hippocampus, respectively, and the supramammillary nucleus was examined for the presence of single- and double-labeled neurons. The main findings were: 1) pronounced numbers of single-labeled cells (about 40-60/section) were present in the supramammillary nucleus following retrograde tracer injections in either the septum or hippocampus; 2) single and double retrogradely labeled neurons were intermingled within the supramammillary nucleus and mainly localized to the lateral two-thirds of the supramammillary nucleus; 3) approximately 5-10% of supramammillary cells were double-labeled, ipsilaterally, and 2-4%, contralaterally, with injections in medial or lateral parts of the medial septum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; and 4) approximately 3-5% of supramammillary cells were double-labeled, ipsilaterally, and 1-2%, contralaterally, with injections in the medial septum and CA2/CA3a of the dorsal hippocampus. Cells of the supramammillary nucleus have been shown to fire rhythmically in bursts synchronous with the hippocampal theta rhythm and have been implicated in the generation of the theta rhythm. The supramammillary cells that we identified with collateral projections to the septum and hippocampus may be directly involved in generation of the theta rhythm.
11032985	The binding sites of nociceptin (also named orphanin FQ), the endogenous ligand of ORL1 (opiate receptor like 1), were localized in rat brain, using an autoradiographic procedure. High levels of binding were observed in the cingulate, retrosplenial, perirhinal, insular and occipital cortex, anterior and posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nuclei, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, amygdaloid complex, posterior hippocampus, dorsal endopiriform, central medial thalamic, paraventricular, rhomboid thalamic, suprachiasmatic, ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, mammillary complex, superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus. More moderate labelling was observed in the prefrontal, fronto-parietal, temporal, piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, shell of nucleus accumbens, claustrum, lateral septum, laterodorsal thalamic, medial habenular, subthalamic, reuniens thalamic nuclei, subiculum, periaqueductal grey matter and pons. A lower binding site density was observed in the anterior and medial hippocampus, olfactory bulb, caudate putamen, the core of the nucleus accumbens, medial septum, ventrolateral, ventroposterolateral and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, hypothalamic area, substantia nigra, ventral tegmentum area and interpedoncular nucleus. A moderate and similar labelling was found in the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord. No labelling was apparent in the corpus callosum. Thus, it appears that the ORL1 receptor is particularly abundant in the cerebral cortex, limbic system of the rat brain and some areas involved in pain perception.
11036187	The cholecystokinin receptor, subtype 2 (CCK(2)R), is considered, based on receptor autoradiography, to be the predominant receptor for this peptide transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. To directly visualize the CCK(2)R we utilized a convenient and sensitive immunohistochemical procedure using antipeptide receptor antibodies raised in rabbits against unique portions of the carboxyl tail and third intracellular loop of the CCK(2)R. Antibodies were characterized by ELISA and Western blotting, and used for immunohistochemistry in rat brain sections. Studies with both antibodies revealed a widespread topographic distribution of CCK(2)R-like immunoreactivity (CCK(2)R-LI) in regions such as cortex, olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, septum, striatum, hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, habenula, hypothalamus, thalamus, ventral mesencephalon, inferior colliculus, parabrachial nucleus, pontine nucleus, supercolliculus, red nucleus, subcommisural and occulomotor nucleus, area postrema, solitary, olivary, cochlear, cuneate and trigeminal nuclei and spinal cord dorsal horn in agreement with the results of previous receptor autoradiography.
11036241	The endogenous opioid system, in particular the enkephalins, has been implicated in a vast array of neurological functions. The dog could be a suitable model for the study of complex interactions between behavioral state and regulatory physiology in which the opioid system appeared to be implicated. Moreover, opiate derivatives are currently used in veterinary clinic and sometimes pharmacologically tested in the dog. However, there are no anatomical data regarding the organization of the opioid system in this species. The present work represents the first attempt to map the distribution of Met(5)-enkephalin-like-immunoreactive (Met-enk-li) cell bodies and fibers in the diencephalon and the brainstem of the dog. In the diencephalon, labeled cells were present in all the mid-line and intralaminar thalamic nuclei; the lateral posterior, pulvinar and suprageniculate nuclei; the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body and the medial geniculate body. Additionally, Met-enk-li cells were seen in every hypothalamic nucleus except in the supraoptic. Variable densities of labeled fibers were also seen in all these nuclei except in the medial geniculate body and in most areas of the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei. In the mesencephalon, positive cells were found in the periaqueductal gray, the Edinger-Westphal and interpeduncular nuclei, delimited areas of the superior and inferior colliculi and the ventral tegmental area. In the rhombencephalon, labeled cells were seen in the majority of the nuclei in the latero-dorsal pontine tegmentum, the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the trapezoid, vestibular medial, vestibular inferior and cochlear nuclei, the prepositus hypoglossal, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the infratrigeminal nucleus and the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and in the rhombencephalic reticular formation. The distribution of fibers included additionally the substantia nigra, all the trigeminal nerve nuclei, the facial nucleus and a restricted portion of the inferior olive. These results are discussed with regard to previous reports on the distribution of Met-enk in other species.
11042588	Bradykinin has long been known to exist in the central nervous system and has been hypothesized to mediate specific functions. Despite an increasing understanding of the functions of bradykinin, little is known about the cell types expressing the bradykinin receptor within the brain. The present investigation employed a monoclonal antibody directed against the 15-amino-acid portion of the C-terminal of the human bradykinin B2 receptor to establish the cellular distribution of bradykinin B2 receptor immunoreactivity in the rat brain. Bradykinin B2 receptor immunoreactivity was ubiquitously and selectively observed in neurons, including those within the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem nuclei. Bradykinin B2 receptor immunoreactivity was also present in the circumventricular organs including choroid plexus, subfornical organ, median eminence, and area postrema. Double-labeling experiments colocalizing the bradykinin B2 receptor with the neuronal marker NeuN or the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that virtually 100% of the bradykinin B2 receptor-immunoreactive positive cells were neurons. The widespread distribution of bradykinin B2 receptor immunoreactivity in neuronal compartments suggests a greater than previously appreciated role for this peptide in neuronal function.
11067994	The isolated whole brain (IWB) preparation of the guinea pig was used to investigate the floccular modulation of vestibular-evoked responses in abducens and oculomotor nerves and abducens nucleus; for identification of flocculus target neurons (FTNs) in the vestibular nuclei and intracellular study of some of their physiological properties; to search for possible flocculus-dependent plasticity at the FTN level by pairing of vestibular nerve and floccular stimulations; and to study the possibility of induction of long-term depression (LTD) in Purkinje cells by paired stimulation of the inferior olive and vestibular nerve. Stimulation of the flocculus had only effects on responses evoked from the ipsilateral (with respect to the stimulated flocculus) vestibular nerve. Floccular stimulation significantly inhibited the vestibular-evoked discharges in oculomotor nerves on both sides and the inhibitory field potential in the ipsilateral abducens nucleus while the excitatory responses in the contralateral abducens nerve and nucleus were free from such inhibition. Eleven second-order vestibular neurons were found to receive a short-latency monosynaptic inhibitory input from the flocculus and were thus characterized as FTNs. Monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from the flocculus were bicuculline sensitive, suggesting a GABA(A)-ergic transmission from Purkinje cells to FTNs. Two of recorded FTNs could be identified as vestibulospinal neurons by their antidromic activation from the cervical segments of the spinal cord. Several pairing paradigms were investigated in which stimulation of the flocculus could precede, coincide with, or follow the vestibular nerve stimulation. None of them led to long-term modification of responses in the abducens nucleus or oculomotor nerve evoked by activation of vestibular afferents. On the other hand, pairing of the inferior olive and vestibular nerve stimulation resulted in approximately a 30% reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked in Purkinje cells by the vestibular nerve stimulation. This reduction was pairing-specific and lasted throughout the entire recording time of the neurons. Thus in the IWB preparation, we were able to induce a LTD in Purkinje cells, but we failed to detect traces of flocculus-dependent plasticity at the level of FTNs in vestibular nuclei. Although these data cannot rule out the possibility of synaptic modifications in FTNs and/or at other brain stem sites under different experimental conditions, they are in favor of the hypothesis that the LTD in the flocculus could be the essential mechanism of cellular plasticity in the vestibuloocular pathways.
11069127	We injected nitric oxide (NO)-releasing compounds and NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors into the brains of conscious, freely moving rats and measured the effects on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate, as well as on the expression of c-fos mRNA, neuronal NOS (nNOS) mRNA and NADPH-diaphorase, an indicator of NOS activity. When administered i.c.v., the NO donor, NOC-18, caused a significant fall in MAP and heart rate, whereas the NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), induced a significant rise in MAP. The same dose of NOC-18 or L-NAME when administered i.v. did not affect MAP and heart rate. Centrally administered NOC-18 induced c-fos mRNA expression in several regions of the brain involved in the baroreceptor response, including the nucleus of the solitary tract, the area postrema and the rostral ventrolateral medulla, as well as areas involved in the integration of autonomic, neuroendocrine and behavioural responses, including the medial preoptic area, the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the supraoptic nucleus (SON), the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) and the locus coeruleus. Most of the areas that expressed c-fos also contained nNOS mRNA and/or NADPH-d-positive neurones and fibres. i.c.v. injection of L-NAME induced c-fos mRNA expression in PVN, SON, locus coeruleus and NTS, suggesting a tonic inhibition of neuronal activity by NO or stimulation of neuronal activity by endogenous NO. i.v. injection of NOC-18 or L-NAME did not induce any significant c-fos mRNA expression in rat brain. These results demonstrate that NO acts directly in the brain to reduce the systemic blood pressure, and that the endogenous NO pathway may play a role in cardiovascular and autonomic regulation by modulating neuronal activities in discrete regions of the brain.
11074450	In the salamander Plethodon jordani, the morphology and axonal projections of thalamic (TH) neurons and their responses to electrical optic nerve stimulation were determined by intracellular recording and biocytin labeling under in vitro, whole-brain conditions. Based on their axonal projections, labeled neurons (n = 76) were divided into the following groups: TH1 neurons, with mostly ipsilateral projections to the striatum; TH2 neurons, with ipsilateral or bilateral projections to the medial amygdala and nucleus accumbens; TH3 neurons, with bilateral projections to the medial and dorsal pallium; TH4 neurons, with mostly ipsilateral projections to the striatum and ipsilateral projections to the tectum opticum, tegmentum, and rostral medulla oblongata; and TH5 neurons, with ipsilateral projections to the tegmentum, medulla oblongata, and rostral spinal cord without (TH5.1) or with (TH5.2) additional projections to the optic tectum. TH1-TH4 neurons are found in the dorsal thalamus and around the sulcus medialis, and TH5 neurons are found in the ventral thalamus. Labeled neurons with ascending projections, i.e., the more dorsally situated TH1-TH4 neurons, are mostly inhibited by electrical stimulation of the optic nerve and have significantly longer latencies (mean +/- S.D., 42.1 +/- 11.6 msec) than neurons with exclusively descending projections, i.e., the ventrally located TH5 neurons (8.5 +/- 6.1 msec), which receive the bulk of retinal afferents and show excitation at electrical optic nerve stimulation. Neurons recorded without labeling in the dorsal thalamus likewise exhibit mostly inhibition and have significantly longer latencies (35.7 +/- 18.9 msec) than those recorded in the ventral thalamus (10.9 +/- 7.7 msec), which mostly show excitation. None of the neurons recorded in the dorsal thalamus followed repetitive stimulation of the optic nerve. Thus, neurons situated in the dorsal thalamus and projecting to pallial or subpallial telencephalic targets are unlikely to receive monosynaptic or oligosynaptic, excitatory retinal input. Accordingly, no retino-thalamo-telencephalic pathway homologous to that found in amniotes appears to exist in salamanders.
11080213	We have investigated the binding properties of [(3)H]quisqualate to rat metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 1a and 5a receptors and to rat and human brain sections. Saturation isotherms gave K:(D) values of 27 +/- 4 and 81 +/- 22 nM: for mGlu1a and mGlu5a receptors, respectively. Several compounds inhibited the binding to mGlu1a and mGlu5a receptors concentration-dependently. (S:)-4-Carboxyphenylglycine, (S:)-4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenylglycine, and (R,S)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid, which completely inhibited [(3)H]quisqualate binding to the mGlu5a receptor, were inactive in a functional assay using this receptor. The distribution and abundance of binding sites in rat and human brain sections were studied by quantitative receptor radioautography and image analysis. Using 10 nM: [(3)H]quisqualate, a high density of binding was detected in various brain regions with the following rank order of increasing levels: medulla, thalamus, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, spinal cord dorsal horn, olfactory tubercle, dentate gyrus molecular layer, CA1-3 oriens layer of hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellar molecular layer. The ionotropic component of this binding could be inhibited by 30 microM: kainate, revealing the distribution of mGlu1+5 receptors. The latter were almost completely inhibited by the group I agonist (S:)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. The binding profile correlated well with the cellular sites of synthesis and regional expression of the respective group I receptor proteins revealed by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
11113313	Morphological and functional data indicate that glutamatergic innervation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus plays an important role in the control of this prominent cell group. Sources of this neural input are unknown. The present investigations were aimed at studying this question. The retrograde tracer [3H]D-aspartate, which is selectively taken up by the terminals of neurons that use glutamate or aspartate as a neurotransmitter, and is retrogradely transported to their perikarya, was injected into the paraventricular nucleus. The brain was examined for labelled neurons visualized by autoradiography. Labelled neurons were detected in the paraventricular nucleus itself, in several hypothalamic areas including medial and lateral preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, posterior part of arcuate nucleus, ventral premammillary nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. Outside the hypothalamus labelled neurons were found in the thalamic paraventricular nucleus and in certain telencephalic regions including lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala. All of them are known to project to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. We failed to detect labelled neurons in the lower brainstem. From these findings we conclude that firstly, there are glutamatergic/aspartatergic interneurons in the paraventricular nucleus; secondly, all intrahypothalamic and telencephalic, but not lower brainstem afferents to this nucleus contain glutamatergic/aspartatergic fibres; and thirdly, the glutamatergic/aspartatergic innervation of this heterogeneous cell group is extremely complex.
11113332	GABA(A) receptors are ligand-operated chloride channels assembled from five subunits in a heteropentameric manner. Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits deriving from 13 different genes (alpha1-alpha6, beta1-beta3, gamma1-gamma3 and delta) in the adult rat brain. Subunit alpha1-, beta1-, beta2-, beta3- and gamma2-immunoreactivities were found throughout the brain, although differences in their distribution were observed. Subunit alpha2-, alpha3-, alpha4-, alpha5-, alpha6-, gamma1- and delta-immunoreactivities were more confined to certain brain areas. Thus, alpha2-subunit-immunoreactivity was preferentially located in forebrain areas and the cerebellum. Subunit alpha6-immunoreactivity was only present in granule cells of the cerebellum and the cochlear nucleus, and subunit gamma1-immunoreactivity was preferentially located in the central and medial amygdaloid nuclei, in pallidal areas, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the inferior olive. The alpha5-subunit-immunoreactivity was strongest in Ammon's horn, the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus. In contrast, alpha4-subunit-immunoreactivity was detected in the thalamus, dentate gyrus, olfactory tubercle and basal ganglia. Subunit alpha3-immunoreactivity was observed in the glomerular and external plexiform layers of the olfactory bulb, in the inner layers of the cerebral cortex, the reticular thalamic nucleus, the zonal and superficial layers of the superior colliculus, the amygdala and cranial nerve nuclei. Only faint subunit gamma3-immunoreactivity was detected in most areas; it was darkest in midbrain and pontine nuclei. Subunit delta-immunoreactivity was frequently co-distributed with alpha4 subunit-immunoreactivity, e.g. in the thalamus, striatum, outer layers of the cortex and dentate molecular layer. Striking examples of complementary distribution of certain subunit-immunoreactivities were observed. Thus, subunit alpha2-, alpha4-, beta1-, beta3- and delta-immunoreactivities were considerably more concentrated in the neostriatum than in the pallidum and entopeduncular nucleus. In contrast, labeling for the alpha1-, beta2-, gamma1- and gamma2-subunits prevailed in the pallidum compared to the striatum. With the exception of the reticular thalamic nucleus, which was prominently stained for subunits alpha3, beta1, beta3 and gamma2, most thalamic nuclei were rich in alpha1-, alpha4-, beta2- and delta-immunoreactivities. Whereas the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was strongly immunoreactive for subunits alpha4, beta2 and delta, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus was predominantly labeled for subunits alpha2, alpha3, beta1, beta3 and gamma2; subunit alpha1- and alpha5-immunoreactivities were about equally distributed in both areas. In most hypothalamic areas, immunoreactivities for subunits alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2 and beta3 were observed. In the supraoptic nucleus, staining of conspicuous dendritic networks with subunit alpha1, alpha2, beta2, and gamma2 antibodies was contrasted by perykarya labeled for alpha5-, beta1- and delta-immunoreactivities. Among all brain regions, the median emminence was most heavily labeled for subunit beta2-immunoreactivity. In most pontine and cranial nerve nuclei and in the medulla, only subunit alpha1-, beta2- and gamma2-immunoreactivities were strong, whereas the inferior olive was significantly labeled only for subunits beta1, gamma1 and gamma2. In this study, a highly heterogeneous distribution of 13 different GABA(A) receptor subunit-immunoreactivities was observed. This distribution and the apparently typical patterns of co-distribution of these GABA(A) receptor subunits support the assumption of multiple, differently assembled GABA(A) receptor subtypes and their heterogeneous distribution within the adult rat brain.
11131125	Testican is a putative extracellular heparan/ chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of unknown function that is expressed in a variety of human tissues at widely different levels but is most abundant in the brain. In mice, testican mRNA has been detected only in brain and it is therefore likely to have an important function in the central nervous system. RNA blot analysis reveals the relative intensity of testican in various regions of the human brain. Levels of testican message are most pronounced in the thalamus, hippocampus, occipital lobe, nucleus accumbens, temporal lobe, and caudate nucleus, with somewhat lower levels in the cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, frontal lobe, amygdala, putamen, spinal cord, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. In situ hybridization reveals the cellular distribution of the mRNA within these areas to be highest in neurons and in choroid plexus epithelium, and moderately lower in ependymal cells lining the ventricles and in vascular endothelial cells. Testican mRNA is not detected in oligodendrocytes or in most astrocytes. However, astrocytes in regions of reactive gliosis do express testican mRNA. These findings, along with a cysteine-rich pattern similarity to neurocan, brevican, versican, and other proteoglycans found in brain, suggest that testican may be a part of the specialized extracellular matrix of the brain.
11134625	p38 has been implicated to play a critical role in regulating apoptosis in PC12 and cerebellar granule cells, and is inactivated in cultured fetal neurons in response to insulin. Though p38 is activated in microglia after ischemia, the physiological functions of p38 in the brain are not well understood. As a first step to elucidate the physiological functions of p38 in the central nervous system, we raised a polyclonal antibody against p38 and performed immunohistochemical examination to demonstrate the localization of p38 in mouse brain. Strong p38 immunoreactivity was apparent in fiber bundles including the olfactory tract, anterior commissure, corpus callosum, cingulum, internal capsule, stria terminalis, fimbria and alveus hippocampi, fornix, stria medullaris, optic chiasm and optic tract. Although similar regions were stained with both anti-p38 and anti-neurofilament antibodies, intense p38 immunoreactivity was often observed in myelin sheath-like structures but not in axons. This is the first demonstration of the localization of p38 in the central nervous system and provides an anatomical basis for understanding physiological roles of p38.
11146055	The infralimbic area (IL) and prelimbic area (PL) have been postulated as an autonomic motor region in the medial prefrontal cortex. The present study was conducted to reveal the projection sites of IL and PL of the monkey, Macaca fuscata, using biotinylated dextran amine as an anterograde tracer. IL and PL projected densely to the ventromedial caudate nucleus, the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens (Acb), parvicellular lateral basal and magnocellular accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala, lateral preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, tubero-mammillary nucleus (TM), medial part of the magnocellular and dorsal part of the parvicellular (MDpc) dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, reunience and medial part of the medial pulvinar nucleus, and dorso-lateral part of the periaqueductal gray (PAGdl) in the mesencephalon. Moderately to weakly projected areas were the intermediate and lateral parts of the agranular insular cortex, orbital part of area 12, agranular and dysgranular part of the temporal pole cortex (TPa-g), auditory temporal cortex, lateral and medial (MS) septal nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and medial preoptic area, dorsomedial, lateral, and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, magnocellular lateral basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei, paratenial, paraventricular (PV), inter-antero-medial (IAM), reticular, central medial (CeM), parafascicular (PF) and limitans nuclei of the thalamus, lateral habenular nucleus, pedunculo-pontine nucleus, dorsal part of the lateral lemniscal nucleus, ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal raphe, superior central nucleus, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei (PBl) and nucleus locus coeruleus (LC). A few scattered terminals were observed in the perifornical nucleus of the hypothalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta. PL and area 24 were characterized by projections to the entorhinal (Ent) and piriform (Pir) cortex as well as to the magnocellular part of the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus (VAmc). The morphology of the terminal arborization in each nuclei was different in appearance, perhaps reflecting the synaptic interaction between the nerve terminals and postsynaptic dendrites. PL projected uniquely to Ent, Pir and VAmc and IL projected uniquely to TPa-g, MS, IAM, CeM, MDpc, PF, PBl and LC. IL projected more strongly than PL to the shell of Acb, amygdaloid nuclei, PV, TM, VTA and PAGdl. The present results support the hypothesis that IL is a major cortical autonomic motor area and PL integrates limbic and autonomic inputs in the primate.
11151034	Some upper brainstem cholinergic neurons (pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei) are involved in the generation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and project rostrally to the thalamus and caudally to the medulla oblongata. A previous report showed that 96 h of REM sleep deprivation in rats induced an increase in the activity of brainstem acetylcholinesterase (Achase), the enzyme which inactivates acetylcholine (Ach) in the synaptic cleft. There was no change in the enzyme's activity in the whole brain and cerebrum. The components of the cholinergic synaptic endings (for example, Achase) are not uniformly distributed throughout the discrete regions of the brain. In order to detect possible regional changes we measured Achase activity in several discrete rat brain regions (medulla oblongata, pons, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex) after 96 h of REM sleep deprivation. Naive adult male Wistar rats were deprived of REM sleep using the flower-pot technique, while control rats were left in their home cages. Total, membrane-bound and soluble Achase activities (nmol of thiocholine formed min(-1) mg protein(-1)) were assayed photometrically. The results (mean +/- SD) obtained showed a statistically significant (Student t-test) increase in total Achase activity in the pons (control: 147.8 +/- 12.8, REM sleep-deprived: 169.3 +/- 17.4, N = 6 for both groups, P<0.025) and thalamus (control: 167.4 +/- 29.0, REM sleep-deprived: 191.9 +/- 15.4, N = 6 for both groups, P<0.05). Increases in membrane-bound Achase activity in the pons (control: 171.0 +/- 14.7, REM sleep-deprived: 189.5 +/- 19.5, N = 6 for both groups, P<0.05) and soluble enzyme activity in the medulla oblongata (control: 147.6 +/- 16.3, REM sleep-deprived: 163.8 +/- 8.3, N = 6 for both groups, P<0.05) were also observed. There were no statistically significant differences in the enzyme's activity in the other brain regions assayed. The present findings show that the increase in Achase activity induced by REM sleep deprivation was specific to the pons, a brain region where cholinergic neurons involved in REM generation are located, and also to brain regions which receive cholinergic input from the pons (the thalamus and medulla oblongata). During REM sleep extracellular levels of Ach are higher in the pons, medulla oblongata and thalamus. The increase in Achase activity in these brain areas after REM sleep deprivation suggests a higher rate of Ach turnover.
11160520	Functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal increases (activations) and BOLD signal decreases ("deactivations") were compared in six healthy volunteers during galvanic vestibular (mastoid) and galvanic cutaneous (neck) stimulation in order to differentiate vestibular from ocular motor and nociceptive functions. By calculating the contrast for vestibular activation minus cutaneous activation for the group, we found activations in the anterior parts of the insula, the paramedian and dorsolateral thalamus, the putamen, the inferior parietal lobule [Brodmann area (BA) 40], the precentral gyrus (frontal eye field, BA 6), the middle frontal gyrus (prefrontal cortex, BA 46/9), the middle temporal gyrus (BA 37), the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) as well as in both cerebellar hemispheres. These activations can be attributed to multisensory vestibular and ocular motor functions. Single-subject analysis in addition showed distinctly nonoverlapping activations in the posterior insula, which corresponds to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in the monkey. During vestibular stimulation, there was also a significant signal decrease in the visual cortex (BA 18, 19), which spared BA 17. A different "deactivation" was found during cutaneous stimulation; it included upper parieto-occipital areas in the middle temporal and occipital gyri (BA 19/39/18). Under both stimulation conditions, there were signal decreases in the somatosensory cortex (BA 2/3/4). Stimulus-dependent, inhibitory vestibular-visual, and nociceptive-somatosensory interactions may be functionally significant for processing perception and sensorimotor control.
11165367	We report the discovery and tissue distributions of four novel human genes, GPR61, GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, all of which encode G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPR61 was discovered in a search of the patent literature which retrieved a rabbit DNA sequence partially encoding a novel GPCR. This sequence was used to obtain a full-length human cDNA encoding GPR61, a receptor of 417 amino acid length. A search of the GenBank genomic sequence databases revealed three previously unrecognized intronless genes encoding the orphan GPCrs (oGPCRs) GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, with respective amino acid lengths of 368, 419 and 337. Sequence analysis revealed that GPR61 and GPR62, and a published orphan receptor p47MNR, shared the highest level of identities to each other, ranging from 36 to 45% in the transmembrane (TM) domains. Together, these three oGPCRs appear to comprise a novel subfamily of GPCRs, most closely related to the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor. Sequence analysis of GPR63 and GPR77 revealed highest sequence identities in the TM regions with the oGPCR PSP24 (58%) and the anaphylatoxin C5a receptor (49%) respectively. Tissue distribution analyses detected the expression of all four novel genes in the human brain. GPR61 mRNA expression was detected in the caudate, putamen and thalamus of human brain, with a more widespread expression pattern in rat brain, with mRNA signals in areas of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain. GPR62 mRNA expression was detected in the basal forebrain, frontal cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. GPR63 mRNA expression was detected in the frontal cortex, with lower levels in the thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus and midbrain. Analysis of GPR77 mRNA expression revealed signals in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus with high transcript levels in the liver.
11166682	This study provides an analysis of the chemoarchitecture of the posterior hypothalamic area (PHA) and a retrograde transport analysis of inputs to the PHA in the rat. The chemoarchitectural analysis reveals that the majority of PHA neurons contain glutamate. Hypocretin, melanin concentrating hormone, tyrosine hydroxylase, neuropeptide Y and gamma-aminobutyric acid are also found in subsets of PHA neurons, and fibers immunoreactive for these substances as well as for serotonin, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and met-enkephalin are observed in the area and aid in the delineation of its borders. The retrograde tracing study demonstrates that the PHA receives input from multiple, diverse neuron populations. Descending projections to the PHA arise from the limbic forebrain (cingulate cortex and lateral septum) and both the medial and lateral hypothalamus. Subcortical visual nuclei, including the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet, pretectal area, and superior colliculus, and the subthalamus (zona incerta, fields of Forel) also project to the PHA. Ascending projections to the PHA arise from brainstem cholinergic nuclei, the reticular formation, midbrain raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray and parabrachial nucleus. Retrograde transport studies using the psuedorabies virus (PRV) demonstrate that the PHA receives input indirectly from the hippocampus, amygdala and suprachiasmatic nucleus through circuits including nuclei in the limbic forebrain and hypothalamus. These data suggest that the PHA is important in the neural control of behavioral state, modulating aspects of hippocampal, autonomic and cortical function as they relate to the elaboration of adaptive behavior.
11166683	The diverse effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are mediated through interaction with G-protein coupled receptors. Pharmacological analysis suggests the Y1 receptor mediates several of NPY's central and peripheral actions. We sought to determine the distribution of Y1 protein throughout the rat central nervous system by means of indirect immunofluorescence using the tyramide signal amplification method and a novel, amino terminally-directed Y1 antisera. This antisera was verified as specific for Y1 by solution-phase competition ELISA, Western blot and in situ blocking experiments. High concentrations of Y1 immunoreactivity were found in the claustrum, piriform cortex (superficial layer), arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, paratrigeminal nucleus, and lamina II of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and entire spinal cord. Moderate levels of Y1 immunoreactivity were found the in the main olfactory bulb, dorsomedial part of suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus, pontine nuclei, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, external cuneate nucleus, area postrema, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Low levels of Y1 immunostaining were distributed widely throughout layers II-III of the cerebral cortex (i.e., orbital, cingulate, frontal, parietal, insular, and temporal regions), nucleus accumbens core, amygdalohippocampal and amygdalopiriform areas, dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA2 fields of hippocampus, principal and oral divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, islands of Calleja and presubiculum. These findings are discussed with reference to previously reported receptor autoradiography, immunohistochemistry and mRNA analyses to further support the role of Y1 in NPY-mediated biology.
11169484	Recent progress in study on the molecular component of mammalian clocks has claimed that mammals and Drosophila share the similar fundamental clock oscillating system. In the present study, we investigated expression of Per1, the first gene of the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila clock gene period, in the hamster brain, and we also examined its circadian expression pattern in the mammalian clock center, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In situ hybridization using isotope-labeled cRNA probes revealed a wide and region-specific distribution of Per1 in the hamster brain and spinal cord. High levels of Per1 were found in the internal granular layer of the granular cells of the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nuclei, tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and gyrus dentatus of hippocampus. Moderate levels of expression were detected in many brain regions including the granular layer of the cerebellum, anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus, caudate-putamen, inferior colliculus, pontine nuclei, inferior olive, and nucleus of the solitary tract. We examined the circadian profile of hamster Per1 mRNA in the SCN in constant darkness and found that Per1 expression showed a peak at subjective day (circadian time [CT] 4) and formed a trough at subjective night (CT16-CT20). A brief exposure of light at CT16 could acutely induce large quantities of Per1 mRNA in the hamster SCN, except for its dorsomedial subdivision. These findings suggest that the characteristics of Per1 gene expression in the mammalian circadian center (showing a peak in the daytime and a trough in the nighttime and a rapid inducibility by light) are common among mammalian species. Lastly, in hamster brain, Per1 gene is also inducible in extra-SCN brain nuclei, since light at night also elicited Per1 mRNA in neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus.
11172070	There are defined medullary, mesencephalic, hypothalamic, and thalamic functions in regulation of respiration, but knowledge of cortical control and the elements subserving the consciousness of breathlessness and air hunger is limited. In nine young adults, air hunger was produced acutely by CO(2) inhalation. Comparisons were made with inhalation of a N(2)/O(2) gas mixture with the same apparatus, and also with paced breathing, and with eyes closed rest. A network of activations in pons, midbrain (mesencephalic tegmentum, parabrachial nucleus, and periaqueductal gray), hypothalamus, limbic and paralimbic areas (amygdala and periamygdalar region) cingulate, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and anterior insula were seen along with caudate nuclei and pulvinar activations. Strong deactivations were seen in dorsal cingulate, posterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex. The striking response of limbic and paralimbic regions points to these structures having a singular role in the affective sequelae entrained by disturbance of basic respiratory control whereby a process of which we are normally unaware becomes a salient element of consciousness. These activations and deactivations include phylogenetically ancient areas of allocortex and transitional cortex that together with the amygdalar/periamygdalar region may subserve functions of emotional representation and regulation of breathing.
11173084	The effects of R(+)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OHDPAT) administration into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) or bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus (HIP) on fear behavior in a modified version of the light-dark transitions test and regional brain monoamines (NA, DA, 5-HT) and their metabolites (MHPG, DOPAC, 5-HIAA) in the hypothalamus, midbrain central gray matter, amygdala, hippocampus and pons were examined. The experiments were performed on 36 male, 3-month old Wistar rats. Administration of 8-OHDPAT (200 ng) into the DRN reduced time out from the illuminated part of the chamber and time of motionless behavior in the illuminated part, increased the number of returns from the dark to illuminated part and number of head dipping from the dark to illuminated part without effect on time of motionless behavior in the dark part and on time of locomotor activity in the illuminated as well as in dark part of the chamber. HPLC analysis showed reduction of 5-HT content in the midbrain and amygdala, reduction of 5-HIAA content in pons, increased 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the hippocampus and increased DOPAC/DA ratio in the hypothalamus, midbrain, hippocampus and pons without affecting the MHPG/NA ratio and NA content. The administration of 8-OHDPAT (100 ng per site) into the HIP reduced time out from the illuminated part of chamber, time of locomotor activity in the illuminated part and head dipping from the dark to illuminated part without effect on the number of returns from the dark to illuminated part, time of locomotor activity in the dark part and time of motionless in the illuminated as well as in the dark part of chamber. HPLC analysis showed reduction of NA content in the hypothalamus, amygdala and pons, increased the MHPG content in all the investigated structures, increased MHPG/NA ratio in all the investigated structures except the hypothalamus. Dopamine content decreased in the hypothalamus and amygdala, and DOPAC/DA ratio increased in the amygdala and hippocampus. Concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were unchanged. The results obtained indicate that 8-OHDPAT acting on the pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors decreases fear behavior and acting on 5-HT1A post-synaptic receptors increases fear behavior in the light-dark transitions test. The neurochemical base of anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects evoked by 8-OHDPAT is being discussed.
11202116	The authors investigated the cerebral projection of the vestibular system, using positron emission tomography, in right-handed subjects. Both sided cold caloric stimulation was used in every volunteer (n = 6). A detailed map of activated and deactivated brain regions is included. This portrays changes caused by vestibular stimulation. The contralaterally activated regions according to the stimulation side were: postcentral gyrus, transvers temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, posterior part of the insula, claustrum, putamen, inferior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, premotor cortex, cingulate gyrus. The ipsilaterally activated regions were: transvers temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, posterior part of the insula. There was no hemispherial dominance. The activated regions partially correspond with previous results in the literature. It would like to be pointed out the Brodmann 6 region as the cortical manifestation of involuntary isometric tightening of muscles. The contralaterally deactivated regions were: inferior, superior and medius temporal gyrus, medial and medius frontal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus. Ipsilaterally deactivated regions were: superior and medial frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, fusiform and inferior occipital gyrus. There was prominent hemispherial dominance in the stimulated, ipsilateral side. The deactivation based functional connection between the hippocampus and the vestibular system was pointed out in such a relation for the first time in this report.
11209931	Affinity-purified antibodies raised against the peptide sequence H3 (349-358) receptor specifically recognized two protein species with Mr 62,000 and 93,000 in adult mouse forebrain membranes. Both immunoreactive species were suppressed greatly by preincubation of the antibody with the respective peptide. Immunohistochemical analysis using affinity-purified anti-H3 (349-358) antibodies yielded a high degree of coincidence with ligand-autoradiographical information, with high levels detected in the CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, laminae V of the cerebral cortex, the olfactory tubercle, Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, thalamus and striatum. This study suggests further biochemical evidence for multiple H3 receptor subtypes and the widespread distribution of the H3 receptor in the mammalian brain.
11214504	The long-term effects of early postnatal exposure to aluminium on acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity and on biogenic amines were studied in different brain regions. The subjects were eight days old male Wistar rat pups. They were grouped into normal control and aluminium exposed groups. For aluminium exposure, the pups were gastric intubated with aluminium chloride (40 mg/Kg body weight) for two weeks. Control rats were given equal volumes of distilled water. After the treatment, they were rehabilitated for forty days. On the sixtieth day, the rats from both the groups were sacrificed and AChE activity, levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin were estimated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, septum, brainstem and striatum. In the aluminium exposed group: the AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus, septum, striatum and brainstem; serotonin levels were reduced by 20% in the cortex, hippocampus, septum and striatum; in brain stem, the serotonin level was decreased by 40%. A 60% reduction in noradrenaline levels was observed in the striatum whereas it was reduced by 25% in other regions except in hippocampus. Though dopamine levels were not altered in the cortex, septum and brainstem, they were reduced by 40% in the striatum. The study documents the long-term consequences of exposure to aluminium during the developmental periods.
11236004	B/K protein is a recently isolated member of the double C2-like-domain protein family, which is highly abundant in rat brain. We generated high-titer rabbit polyclonal antibodies with specificity to the 55-kDa rat B/K protein, and examined the expression pattern of B/K protein in rat brain using an immunohistochemical staining method. Immunoreactivity to B/K protein was widely found in distinct regions of rat brain: strongly in the hypothalamus, most of the circumventricular organs, the locus coeruleus, the A5 neurons of the pons, and the anterior pituitary; moderately in the anterior olfactory nucleus, the raphe nucleus, the subfornical organ, and the median eminence; and faintly in the olfactory bulb, the telencephalon, the substantia nigra pars compacta, and the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, immunoreactivity to B/K protein was not observed in the thalamus, the cerebellum, the posterior pituitary, or the spinal cord. In most of the B/K-expressing neurons, immunoreactivity was expressed mainly in soma but not in nerve fibers. B/K was also expressed in nonneuronal cells such as the tanycytes and the subcommissural organ. In the vasopressin-secreting supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, the site where B/K cDNA was originally isolated from, all of the neurons showing vasopressin immunoreactivity also expressed B/K protein, suggesting an overlap of their expression patterns.
11250948	Biological effects of vasopressin (VP) are mediated by four different receptors, two of which (the V1a and the oxytocin receptors) have been well characterized in the rodent brain, suggesting that these are the main receptors responsible for the central effects of VP. However, transcripts of the V1b VP receptor (V1bR) have been detected throughout the rat brain by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, indicating that the V1bR adds to the population of central VP receptors. Because there are no specific ligands for the V1bR, the receptor protein itself has been difficult to visualize. In the present study, the distribution of the V1bR protein was investigated in the rat forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and cerebellum by immunohistochemistry using an antiserum raised against a synthetic fragment of the carboxylterminal of the rat V1bR protein. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of the V1bR in pituitary corticotrophs as expected. In naive, untreated rats, fiber networks containing V1bR-immunoreactivity were mainly concentrated in the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebellum, and particularly in those areas with a leaky blood brain barrier or close to the circumventricular organs (medial habenula, subfornical organ, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, median eminence, and nuclei lining to the third and fourth ventricles). A strikingly dense network was present in the external zone of the median eminence. Colchicine treatment was required to reveal the localization of V1bR-immunoreactive cell bodies. V1bR-containing cell bodies and associated protrusions were mainly located in the hippocampus, caudate putamen, cortex, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. These results demonstrate the widespread distribution of the V1bR protein in the rat brain over multiple, functionally distinct neuronal systems. These data suggest that the V1bR mediates different physiological functions of VP in the brain.
11253171	Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-metabolizing enzyme of acetylcholine, is presently the most important therapeutic target for development of cognitive enhancers. However, AChE activity in brain has not been properly evaluated on the basis of age and sex. In the present study, AChE activity was investigated in different brain areas in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats of adult (3 months) and old (18-22 months) age. AChE was assayed spectrophotometrically by modified Ellman's method. Specific activity (micromoles/min/mg of protein) of AChE was assayed in salt soluble (SS) and detergent soluble (DS) fractions of various brain areas, which consists of predominantly G1 and G4 molecular isoforms of AChE respectively. The old male rats showed a decrease (40-55%) in AChE activity in frontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and pons in DS fraction and there was no change in SS fraction in comparison to adult rats. In the old female rats the activity was decreased (25-40%) in frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and medulla in DS fraction whereas in SS fraction the activity was decreased only in hypothalamus as compared to adult. On comparing with old male rats, old female rats showed increase in AChE activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of DS fraction and decrease in hypothalamus of SS fraction. There was a significant increase in AChE activity in DS fraction of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus and cerebellum in female as compared to male adult rats. However, no significant change in AChE activity was found in the SS fraction, except hypothalamus between these groups. Thus it appears that age alters AChE activity in different brain regions predominantly in DS fraction (G4 isoform) that may vary in male and female. These observations have significant relevance to age related cognitive deficits and its pharmacotherapy.
11257431	We have examined the patterns of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the ventral thalamus (thalamic reticular nucleus (Rt), zona incerta (ZI) and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv)) after electrical or chemical stimulation of nuclei in either the brainstem (midbrain reticular nucleus), basal forebrain (substantia innominata) or dorsal thalamus (parafascicular nucleus). Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetised with Halothane or Ketamil/Rompun and the above mentioned centres were stimulated either electrically or chemically (using kainic acid). Brains were then processed for Fos-like immunocytochemistry using standard methods. We detected no major differences in the labelling patterns after either electrical or chemical stimulation or after using Halothane or Ketamil/Rompun anaesthesia. After brainstem or dorsal thalamic stimulations, many Fos-like immunoreactive cells were seen within the rostral pole of the Rt, the dorsal sector of the ZI and the parvocellular lamina of the LGv. After basal forebrain stimulations, many Fos-like immunoreactive cells were seen in the rostral pole of the Rt and rostral sector of the ZI, but very few were apparent in the LGv. Overall, our results show that distinct groups of cells in the ventral thalamus show increased levels of Fos-like immunoreactivity after stimulation of different subcortical centres. These activated cells of the ventral thalamus, are in turn, in a position to influence particular thalamocortical pathways through their dorsal thalamic projections.
11275405	In the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements of the chicken, there are seven spinocerebellar nuclei, the Clarke's column, the spinal border cells, the ventral margin of the ventral horn of both enlargements, and the ventral marginal nucleus in the lumbosacral enlargement. In the present study, we investigated the laterality of spinocerebellar tract axons and the distribution of the spinocerebellar tract neurons projecting into the anterior or posterior part of the cerebellum in these seven nuclei by retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. The spinocerebellar tract neurons with uncrossed axons were found in the cervical Clarke's column and the cervical spinal border cells, and with crossed ones in the lumbar Clarke's column, lumbar spinal border cells, lumbar lamina IX included in the ventral margin of the ventral horn of the lumbosacral enlargement, and the ventral marginal nucleus. The ventral margin of the ventral horn of the cervical enlargement and lumbar lamina VIII included in the ventral margin of the ventral horn of the lumbosacral enlargement issued spinocerebellar tract axons bilaterally. The spinocerebellar tract neurons of the lumbar spinal border cells and lumbar lamina IX projected to the anterior part of the cerebellum only. And those of the other nuclei projected to both the anterior and posterior parts.
11283957	By using a monoclonal antibody to serotonin (5-HT), an immunohistochemical study was undertaken to provide a comprehensive description of the 5-HT-containing neurons and of the distribution of their axonal processes in the cat brain and spinal cord. The localization of cell bodies was comparable to that previously reported in studies using formaldehyde-induced fluorescence and other 5-HT antibodies, with a large proportion of labeled neurons in the raphe nuclei and a minor, yet not negligible number, in the ventral, lateral, and dorsal reticular formation. The ascending efferent non-varicose axons were best visualized in sagittal sections and mainly seen taking a rostroventral direction through the tegmentum. The varicose axons could be grossly classified into thin and large fibers, according to the size and shape of the immunoreactive varicosities, which were elongated (up to 2 microm in length and 1 microm in width) or round (2-4 microm in diameter). Varicose axonal arborizations invaded almost every region of the gray matter and avoided large myelinated bundles except in the spinal cord. Variations in the density of the plexuses of immunoreactive fibers generally followed the anatomical divisions and were also observed within nuclei, especially in laminated structures. Only the superior olivary complex could be regarded as devoid of 5-HT-containing axons. A few areas contained extremely rich fiber plexuses. These were the olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, ventral mesencephalon, periventricular gray from the hypothalamus to the pons, facial nucleus, subdivisions of the inferior olive, and the intermediolateral nucleus in the spinal cord. Varicose axons formed tight pericellular arrays in the neocortex, mainly the ectosylvian gyrus, and in the lateral septum and medullar magnocellular nucleus. These data, combined with those of the literature concerning the synaptic versus non-synaptic mode of termination of the 5-HT-immunoreactive varicosities and the high number of distinct receptors, are indicative of the multiple possible actions of serotonin in the central nervous system.
11303751	The brain localization of the neurotensin receptor NTS2 was studied with [3H]levocabastine, using an autoradiographic procedure. This study suggests that NTS2 receptors are mainly intracellular. High densities of binding sites were observed in the cingulate, insular, temporal, occipital, enthorhinal cortex, amygdaloid complex, septohippocampal nuclei, medial thalamus, mammillary bodies and superior colliculi; a moderate labelling was observed in the anterior and medial hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, septum, lateral thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus and cerebellum; finally, a low labelling was apparent in the ventral tegmentum area and substantia nigra. Thus it appears that NTS2 receptors are particularly abundant in the cerebral cortex, the limbic areas and some areas involved in pain perception.
11304716	Within the basal ganglia, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) exerts a fundamental role as neurotransmitter of local circuit and projection neurons. Its fast hyperpolarizing action is mediated through GABA(A) receptors. These ligand-gated chloride channels are assembled from five subunits, which derive from multiple genes. Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 12 major GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha1-5, beta1-3, gamma1-3, and delta) in the basal ganglia and associated limbic brain areas of the rat. Immunoreactivity for an additional subunit (subunit alpha6) was not observed. The striatum, the nucleus accumbens, and the olfactory tubercle displayed strong, diffuse staining for the subunits alpha2, alpha4, beta3, and delta presumably located on dendrites of the principal medium spiny neurons. Subunit alpha1-, beta2-, and gamma2-immunoreactivities were apparently mostly restricted to interneurons of these areas. In contrast, the globus pallidus, the entopeduncular nucleus, the ventral pallidum, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata revealed dense networks of presumable dendrites of resident projection neurons, which were darkly labeled for subunit alpha1-, beta2-, and gamma2-immunoreactivities. The globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, all areas receiving innervations from the striatum, displayed strong subunit gamma1-immunoreactivity compared to other brain areas. In the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area, numerous presumptive dopaminergic neurons were labeled for subunits alpha3, gamma3, and/or delta. This highly heterogeneous distribution of individual GABA(A) receptor subunits suggests the existence of differently assembled, and presumably also functionally different, GABA(A) receptors within individual nuclei of the basal ganglia and associated limbic brain areas.
11324527	In situ hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe was used to investigate the expression of opioid-receptor-like receptor (ORL1) gene in rat brain. It was observed that ORL1 mRNA is widely expressed in many regions of rat brain, particularly in cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, habenula, periaqueducted gray, raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus structure. These findings suggest that ORL1 receptor may participate in modulating a number of physiological functions in the brain in addition to pain.
11331523	The distribution of galaninergic immunoreactive (-ir) profiles was studied in the brain of colchicine-pretreated and non-pretreated mice. Galanin (GAL)-ir neurons and fibers were observed throughout all encephalic vesicles. Telencephalic GAL-ir neurons were found in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, lateral and medial septum, diagonal band of Broca, nucleus basalis of Meynert, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, amygdala, and hippocampus. The thalamus displayed GAL-ir neurons within the anterodorsal, paraventricular, central lateral, paracentral, and central medial nuclei. GAL-ir neurons were found in several regions of the hypothalamus. In the midbrain, GAL-ir neurons appeared in the pretectal olivary nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, the medial and lateral lemniscus, periaqueductal gray, and the interpeduncular nucleus. The pons contained GAL-ir neurons within the dorsal subcoeruleus, locus coeruleus, and dorsal raphe. In the medulla oblongata, GAL-ir neurons appear in the anterodorsal and dorsal cochlear nuclei, salivatory nucleus, A5 noradrenergic cells, gigantocellular nucleus, inferior olive, solitary tract nucleus, dorsal vagal motor and hypoglossal nuclei. Only GAL-ir fibers were seen in the lateral habenula nucleus, substantia nigra, parabrachial complex, cerebellum, spinal trigeminal tract, as well as the motor root of the trigeminal and facial nerves. GAL-ir was also observed in several circumventricular organs. The widespread distribution of galanin in the mouse brain suggests that this neuropeptide plays a role in the regulation of cognitive and homeostatic functions.
11337939	The cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) is involved in the biotransformation of many drugs which predominantly act in the central nervous system (CNS), including opioids, various psychotrophic drugs and neurotoxins. Until now, however, only controversial information is available regarding the presence of CYP2D6 in CNS. In this study, the regional and cellular expression of CYP2D6 transcripts and proteins in postmortem brain tissues of three individuals was analysed. A combination of in-situ hybridization coupled with immunohistochemistry on adjacent sections allowed simultaneous detection of CYP2D6 mRNA and protein. However, discrepancies existed in the results such that the mRNA was more widely distributed in the brain areas analysed compared to the protein. Neuronal cells, as well as glial cells, showed labelling for mRNA in brain regions such as the neocortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, substantia nigra and cerebellum. In contrast, CYP2D6 protein was primarily localized in large principal neurons such as pyramidal cells of the cortex, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In glial cells, CYP2D6 protein was absent. These results provide clear evidence of CYP2D6 expression in certain regions of the CNS and may indicate the role CYP2D6 plays in a number of drug interactions that are of potential clinical importance for neurological diseases.
11338212	We investigated neuronal response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in terms of c-Fos expression. In rats at postnatal day 49, six rTMS sessions induced widespread nuclear c-Fos-like immunoreactivity in frontal cortex, lateral orbital cortex, striatum, lateral septal nucleus, piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, Ammon's horn, cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, occipital cortex, and amygdala; this reactivity was greater than with two sessions of rTMS or sham rTMS. ECS produced even stronger c-Fos expression than six sessions of rTMS in all regions except thalamus (no difference) and striatum (stronger with rTMS). Thus, functional modification of neuroanatomic substrates as demonstrated by c-Fos expression may partially differ between rTMS and ECS.
11338407	Volumetric measurement of brain structure on brain images is regarded as a gold standard, yet is very time consuming. We wondered whether simple linear and area measurements might be as accurate and reproducible. Two observers independently measured the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum, lentiform and caudate nuclei, thalamus, amygdalas, hippocampi, lateral and third ventricles, and the width of the sylvian and frontal interhemispheric fissures and brain stem on brain MRI of 55 patients using a program written in-house; one observer also measured the volumes of the basal ganglia, amygdalo-hippocampal complex and ventricular system using Analyze, and performed qualitative assessment of four regions (lateral and third ventricles, cortex, and medial temporal lobe) using the Lieberman score. All measures were performed blinded to all other information. Test objects of known size were also imaged with MRI and measured by the two observers using the in-house program. The true sizes of the test objects were measured using engineering calipers by two observers blind to the MRI results. Differences between the two observers using the same measurement method, and one observer using different methods, were calculated. The simple linear and cross-sectional area measurements were rapid (20 min versus 5 h for volumetric); were highly accurate for test-object measurement versus true size; had excellent intraobserver reliability; and, for most brain structures, the simple measures correlated highly significantly with volumetric measures. The simple measures were in general highly reproducible, the difference (as a percentage of the area or width of a region) between the two raters being around 10%, range 0.1%-14.1%, (similar to inter-rater variability in previous studies of volume measurements). The simple linear and area measures are reproducible and correlate well with the measured volumes, and there is a considerable time saving with the former. In circumstances where a large volume of work precludes detailed volume measurement, simple methods are reliable and can be used instead.
11360237	The afferent and efferent cortical and subcortical connections of the medial posterior parietal cortex (area 7m) were studied in cebus (Cebus apella) and macaque (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys using the retrograde and anterograde capabilities of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. The principal intraparietal corticocortical connections of area 7m in both cebus and macaque cases were with the ipsilateral medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (MIP) and adjacent superior parietal lobule (area 5), inferior parietal lobule (area 7a), lateral bank of the IPS (area 7ip), caudal parietal operculum (PGop), dorsal bank of the caudal superior temporal sulcus (visual area MST), and medial prestriate cortex (including visual area PO and caudal medial lobule). Its principal frontal corticocortical connections were with the prefrontal cortex in the shoulder above the principal sulcus and the cortex in the shoulder above the superior ramus of the arcuate sulcus (SAS), the area purported to contain the smooth eye movement-related frontal eye field (FEFsem) in the cebus monkey by other investigators. There were moderate connections with the cortex in the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus (purported to contain the saccade-related frontal eye field; FEFsac), supplementary eye field (SEF), and rostral dorsal premotor area (PMDr). Area 7m also had major connections with the cingulate cortex (area 23), particularly the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. The principal subcortical connections of area 7m were with the dorsal portion of the ventrolateral thalamic (VLc) nucleus, lateral posterior thalamic nucleus, lateral pulvinar, caudal mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and medial pulvinar, central lateral, central superior lateral, and central inferior intralaminar thalamic nuclei, dorsolateral caudate nucleus and putamen, middle region of the claustrum, nucleus of the diagonal band, zona incerta, pregeniculate nucleus, anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei, intermediate layer of the superior colliculus, nucleus of Darkschewitsch and dorsomedial parvicellular red nucleus (macaque cases only), dorsal, dorsolateral and lateral basilar pontine nuclei, nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, locus ceruleus, and superior central nucleus. The findings are discussed in terms of the possibility that area 7m contains a "medial parietal eye field" and belongs to a neural network of oculomotor-related structures that plays a role in the control of eye movement.
11394198	Luteinizing hormone (LH) and its homologue, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are able to elicit multiple effects in the central nervous system (CNS) through binding to their receptors. Specific receptors for LH/hCG have been identified in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, hypothalamus, cortex, brain stem, area postrema, cerebellum, choroid plexus, ependymal cells, glial cells, neural retina, pituitary gland, and neuron processes of the spinal cord. Neurotropic effects of LH and hCG have been demonstrated in fetal rat brain, where the expression of LH/hCG receptors is developmentally regulated. Administration of hCG has been found to be beneficial in restoration of transected spinal cord function in rats. In adult rat brain, LH and hCG are involved in the feedback regulation of synthesis and secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the hypothalamus and LH in the pituitary gland. LH and hCG also induce several behavioral and other changes that are associated with the hippocampus, which contains the highest density of LH/hCG receptors. Many of the behavioral changes induced by hCG in rats parallel those in pregnant women. Some of these behavioral effects are correlated with changes of eicosanoid metabolism induced by LH and hCG in the brain. The LH/hCG receptors present in the choroid plexus, brain vessels, and perihypophyseal vascular complex may be involved in the modulation of transport of LH, hCG, and GnRH into the CNS. Thus, the CNS is one of the specific target tissues for LH and hCG, by which LH/hCG act as pleiotropic hormones that regulate several reproduction-related as well as reproduction-nonrelated functions in the CNS.
11406813	The present investigation is part of a broader effort to examine cortical areas that contribute to manual dexterity, reaching, and grasping. In this study we examine the thalamic connections of electrophysiologically defined regions in area 3a and architectonically defined primary motor cortex (M1). Our studies demonstrate that area 3a receives input from nuclei associated with the somatosensory system: the superior, inferior, and lateral divisions of the ventral posterior complex (VPs, VPi, and VPl, respectively). Surprisingly, area 3a receives the majority of its input from thalamic nuclei associated with the motor system, posterior division of the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VL), the mediodorsal nucleus (MD), and intralaminar nuclei including the central lateral nucleus (CL) and the centre median nucleus (CM). In addition, sparse but consistent projections to area 3a are from the anterior pulvinar (Pla). Projections from the thalamus to the cortex immediately rostral to area 3a, in the architectonically defined M1, are predominantly from VL, VA, CL, and MD. There is a conspicuous absence of inputs from the nuclei associated with processing somatic inputs (VP complex). Our results indicate that area 3a is much like a motor area, in part because of its substantial connections with motor nuclei of the thalamus and motor areas of the neocortex (Huffman et al. [2000] Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 25:1116). The indirect input from the cerebellum and basal ganglia via the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus supports its role in proprioception. Furthermore, the presence of input from somatosensory thalamic nuclei suggests that it plays an important role in somatosensory and motor integration.
11413547	The discovery of estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) and subsequent localization of its mRNA in the rat central nervous system (CNS) has provided new insights about estrogen action in brain. A critical step in understanding the role of ER beta is demonstrating that the mRNA is translated into functional protein. The present study used a new ER beta-specific polyclonal antiserum (Z8P) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) to investigate the distribution of ER beta in the rat CNS. Ovariectomized female rats were perfusion fixed, and free-floating sections were incubated with Z8P. After visualization with a standard ABC method, nuclear immunoreactivity was seen in neurons throughout the brain, including the olfactory nuclei, laminae IV-VI of the cerebral cortex, medial septum, preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, zona incerta, medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, cerebellum, nucleus of the solitary tract, ventral tegmental area, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. Moreover, the results of a double-label ICC/ in situ hybridization study revealed that ER beta mRNA and immunoreactivity were colocalized in neurons of the brain, thus confirming the specificity of the antiserum. Through the use of Western blot analysis, Z8P was shown to recognize in vitro translated ER beta, but not ER alpha, as well as a 60-kDa protein from rat granulosa cells and ovary extracts. The results of these studies have demonstrated that (1) ER beta mRNA is translated into immunoreactive protein throughout the rat brain, and (2) ER beta resides in the cell nucleus. Together, these data provide an anatomic foundation for future studies and advance our understanding of estrogen action in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain regions.
11420142	We have isolated a perchloric acid-soluble protein designated as B-PSP1 from the postmitochondria supernatant fraction of rat brain. It was purified by gel filtration and anti-PSP1 affinity chromatography. Immunoblotting, peptide mapping, partial amino acid sequencing and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that the amino acid sequence of B-PSP1 was identical with that of PSP isolated from rat liver. B-PSP1 was expressed in all regions including frontal cortex, posterior cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, entorhinal cortex, pons, medulla and spinal cord. Immunohistochemical study showed that the expression of B-PSP1 was observed in ependymal cells of choroid plexus and glial cells of the other region. The expression of B-PSP1 in brain increased gradually from the first day to the 60th day of postnatal age, but the expression of B-PSP1 was slower than that of GFAP which is a marker protein of glial cells. The expression of PSP may be related to the cellular function rather than the developmental regulation of the glial cells. Thus, our findings are the first report on the presence of a PSP in rat brain which may be involved in the regulation of cellular function.
11438924	The reptilian turtle brain has a remarkably higher endurance for anoxia than mammalian brains. Since the response to O(2) deprivation is dependent in a major way on the expression and regulation of membrane proteins, differences in such proteins may play a role in the species-related differences in hypoxic responses. Because opioid system is involved in the regulation of hypoxic responses, we asked whether there are differences between rat and turtle brains in terms of opioid receptor expression. In this work, we compared the expression and distribution of delta-and mu-opioid receptors in the turtle and rat brains. Our results show that (1) the dissociation constant (K(d)) for delta-receptor binding was approximately four times lower and B(max) was more than double in the turtle brain homogenates than in rat ones; (2) the delta-receptor binding density was heterogeneously distributed in the turtle brain, with a higher density in the rostral regions than in the brainstem and spinal cord, and was generally much higher than in rat brains from the cortex to spinal cord; (3) the delta-opioid receptors in the rat brains were mostly located in the cortex, caudate putamen, and amygdala with an extremely low density in most subcortical (e.g., hippocampus and thalamus) and almost all brainstem regions; and (4) in sharp contrast to delta-opioid receptors, mu-opioid receptor density was much lower in all turtle brain regions compared with the rat ones. Our results demonstrate that the turtle brain is actually an organ of delta-opioid receptors, whereas the rat brain has predominantly mu-opioid receptors. Because we have recently found that delta-opioid receptors protect neurons against glutamate and hypoxic stress, we speculate that the unique pattern of delta-receptor receptor expression and distribution plays a critical role in the tolerance of turtle brain to stressful situations characterized by glutamate excitotoxicity.
11471222	The drinking behavior and the c-fos expression in rat brain induced by electrical stimulation of the subfornical organ (SFO) were examined. SFO stimulation induced stable and significant drinking behavior and Fos protein expression in 8 areas of the forebrain (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, perifornical dorsal area, substantia innominata and thalamic reunions nucleus), and in 3 areas of the hindbrain (area postrema, solitary tract nucleus and lateral parabrachial nucleus). In certain neurons of paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, co-expression of Fos protein and vasopressin was induced by SFO stimulation. Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine partly blocked the SFO stimulation-induced drinking behavior and the Fos protein expression in the brain, suggesting that an M-cholinergic mechanism may be involved.
11474639	The nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis (PGL) is located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a brainstem region that regulates homeostatic functions, such as blood pressure and cardiovascular reflexes, respiration. central chemosensitivity and pain. In the present study, we examined anatomic relationships of the human nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis using a bidirectional lipophilic fluorescent tracer, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3.3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), in nine postmortem human fetal midgestational brainstems. The areas which were labeled by diffusion of DiI from the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis included the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the medulla, caudal raphe (nucleus raphe obscurus and pallidus), hilum and amiculum of the inferior olive, bilateral "reticular formation" (including the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis, nucleus gigantocellular-is and the intermediate reticular zone (IRZ)). vestibular and cochlear nuclei, cells and fibers at the floor of the fourth ventricle with morphologic features of tanycytes, parabrachial nuclei (PBN), medial lemniscus, lateral lemniscus, inferior cerebellar peduncle and cerebellar white matter, central tegmental tract, and the capsule of the red nucleus. This pattern of DiI labeling bears many similarities with the pattern of connections of the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis previously demonstrated by tract-tracing methods in experimental animals, and is consistent with the role of the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis in central regulation of homeostatic functions. In contrast to the animal studies, however, we did not demonstrate connections of the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (nTS) (only connections with the rostral subdivision were examined), locus coeruleus, or the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the human midgestational brainstem. In our previous studies, six medullary areas showed reduced serotonin receptor binding in a subset of victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The present study demonstrated DiI labeling in all of these six areas, suggesting that they are interconnected.
11489737	Olfaction is our basic sense phylogenetically and embryologically. Little is known, however, about how the human brain encodes the quality of odors, odor-associated memories, and emotions. Olfactory information is projected from the olfactory bulb to the primary olfactory cortex, which is composed of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the piriform cortex, the amygdala, the periamygdaloid region, and the entorhinal cortex. From there, the primary olfactory cortex projects to secondary olfactory regions including the hippocampus, ventral striatum and pallidum, hypothalamus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, agranular insular cortex, and cingulate gyrus. Functional MR studies using olfactory stimuli as paradigms show activation of many of these areas and can advance our understanding of odor perception in humans.
11503141	Incubation temperature during embryonic development determines gonadal sex in the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius. In addition, both incubation temperature and gonadal sex influence behavioral responses to androgen and estrogen treatments in adulthood. Although these findings suggest that temperature and sex steroids act upon a common neural substrate to influence behavior, it is unclear where temperature and hormone effects are integrated. To begin to address this question, we identified areas of the leopard gecko brain that express androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA. We gonadectomized adult female and male geckos from an incubation temperature that produces a female-biased sex ratio and another temperature that produces a male-biased sex ratio. Females and males from both temperatures were then treated with equivalent levels of various sex steroids. Region-specific patterns of AR mRNA expression and ER mRNA expression were observed upon hybridization of radiolabeled (35S) cRNA probes to thin sections of reproductive tissues (male hemipenes and female oviduct) and brain. Labeling for AR mRNA was very intense in the epithelium, but not within the body, of the male hemipenes. In contrast, expression of ER mRNA was prominent in most of the oviduct but not in the luminal epithelium. Within the brain, labeling for AR mRNA was conspicuous in the anterior olfactory nucleus, the lateral septum, the medial preoptic area, the periventricular preoptic area, the external nucleus of the amygdala, the anterior hypothalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, the premammillary nucleus, and the caudal portion of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Expression of ER mRNA was sparse in the septum and was prominent in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the caudal portion of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and a group of cells near the torus semicircularis. Many of these brain regions have been implicated in the regulation of hormone-dependent, sex-typical reproductive and agonistic behaviors in other vertebrates. Consequently, these nuclei are likely to control such behaviors in the leopard gecko and also are candidate neural substrates for mediating temperature effects on behavior.
11527064	The purpose of this morphological study was to investigate the relation between the meridian, meridian points and viscera using neuroanatomical tracers. The common locations of the spinal cord and brain projecting to the stomach and Zusanli were observed following injection of CTB (cholera toxin B subunit) and pseudorabies viruses (PRV-Ba, Bartha strain and PRV-Ba-Gal, galactosidase insertion) into the stomach and Zusanli (ST36). After 4-5 days of survival following injection into twelve rats, they were perfused, and their spinal cords and brains were frozen sectioned (30 microm). These sections were stained by X-gal histochemical, CTB and PRV-Ba immunohistochemical staining methods, and examined with the light microscope. The results were as follows: Commonly labeled medulla oblongata regions were dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve (DMV), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and area postrema (AP) following injection of CTB and PRV-Ba-Gal into stomach and Zusanli, respectively. In the spinal cord, commonly labeled neurons were found in thoracic, lumbar and sacral spinal segments. Densely labeled areas were found in lamina IV, V, VII (intermediolateral nucleus) and X of the spinal cord. In the brain, commonly labeled neurons were found in the Al noradrenalin cells/Cl adrenalin cells/caudoventrolateral reticular nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, raphe obscurus nucleus, raphe pallidus nucleus, raphe magnus nucleus, gigantocellular nucleus, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, Kolliker-Fuse nucleus, A5 cell group, central gray matter, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic nucleus, retrochiasmatic hypothalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and amygdaloid nucleus. Thus central autonomic center project both to the stomach and Zusanli. These morphological results suggest that there is a commonality of CNS cell groups in brain controlling stomach (viscera) and Zusanli (limb).
11532336	Receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) comprise a family of accessory proteins for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). They function as receptor modulators that determine the ligand specificity of receptors for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), amylin and adrenomedullin (ADM). Here we demonstrate for the first time the characteristic distributions of the RAMP family mRNAs in the brain. Northern blot analysis revealed that mRAMP 1 and 3 mRNAs were intensely expressed in the brain, but mRAMP2 mRNA less abundantly. In situ hybridization studies showed the heterogenous and unique distributions of mRAMP mRNAs; RAMP1 mRNA was widely expressed throughout the brain including the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, cerebellum and ependyma, mRAMP2 was most abundant in the hippocampus, cerebellum, pia mater and blood vessels, while mRAMP3 was specifically distributed in a variety of thalamic nuclei and the cerebellum. In addition, RAMP1 and -3 genes were also detected in the subfornical organ and area postrema, which are members of circumventricular organs lacking blood-brain barrier. The present results help in understanding the diversification and regulation of receptor functions for calcitonin family peptides, and potentially other GPCRs in the brain.
11672613	The selective and potent aminopeptidase N inhibitor [125I]RB 129 has been used for the radioautographic localization of this enzyme in rat brain, spinal cord and intestine. Brain microvessels and intestine brush-border cells were shown to present a high concentration of aminopeptidase N. Moreover, a labeling of various brain structures was observed. A very high level of binding occurred in the meninges, choroid plexus, pineal gland, paraventricular nucleus and pituitary gland. Moderate to high labeling was also observed in the cortex, caudate-putamen, subthalamic nucleus, central periaqueductal gray, thalamus, as well as in the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord, which are known to contain a high concentration of enkephalins, opioid receptors and neutral endopeptidase. This co-localization confirms the physiological implication of aminopeptidase N in the inactivation of enkephalins accounting for the requirement of dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N to observe highly significant morphine-like effects induced by the protected endogenous opioid peptides. Aminopeptidase N was also visualized in moderate to high levels in other brain structures such as the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, hypothalamus (dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei), raphe nucleus, pontine nucleus, inferior olive, and in high concentration in the granular layer of cerebellum. In summary, aminopeptidase N has been visualized for the first time in numerous brain areas using the selective inhibitor [125I]RB 129. This iodinated probe could allow the ex vivo and in vivo localization of aminopeptidase N in various tissues to be investigated and may also be used to evaluate quantitative changes in aminopeptidase N expression in pathological situations. Aminopeptidase N, which preferably removes NH2-terminal neutral amino acids from peptides, has probably a host of substrates. Nevertheless, a certain in vivo selectivity could be achieved by the presence of the enzyme in structures where the peptide effector and its receptors are also co-localized.
11679088	Argyrophilic glial inclusions, which are immunohistochemically positive for alpha-synuclein but negative for tau protein, were examined in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Autopsied brains of 10 individuals who died from PD, of two incidental Lewy body disease cases and of five age-matched individuals whose deaths were caused by non-neurological diseases were studied, histopathologically, by Gallyas-Braak staining and, immunohistochemically, with anti-alpha-synuclein antibody, anti-ubiquitin, and anti-tyrosine hydroxylase. All postmortem PD brains showed a significant number of argyrophilic glial inclusions, but no glial inclusions were found in control brains. The inclusions were found not only in the regions showing neuronal loss and gliosis, such as the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus and dorsal vagal nucleus, but also in regions without neuronal loss and gliosis, such as the cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter, striatum, globus pallidus, thalamus, cerebellum and spinal cord. The distribution and density of glial inclusions in PD brains varied from case to case but, in the cerebral cortex, the number of glial inclusions were fairly well correlated with the number of Lewy bodies. The distribution pattern of glial inclusions also showed a striking resemblance to that of catecholaminergic neurones and fibres. The abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in glial cells was more widespread than neurone loss, and appears to be an important pathological feature of PD.
11681303	A number of studies have demonstrated the involvement of parallel networks in the control of voluntary sequential motor procedures. We sought to determine whether a parallel network organization may be found for complex, sequentially based motor systems that are the product of both voluntary and automatic control processes. Specifically, we sought to determine whether the cortical organizational scheme for voluntary repetitive swallowing in adult humans is characterized by a hierarchical dual-projection model or by modules organized into parallel systems. We utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate cortical function during normal swallowing tasks in eight healthy human adults. Subjects performed both dry (saliva) and bolus (3 ml/bolus of water) swallows. Activation during swallowing tasks localized to sensorimotor areas (M1, S1, and SMA), S2, premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, the cerebellum, the insular cortex, auditory cortex, corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia and thalamus. Principal components analysis (PCA) of these regions revealed five functional clusters or modules: (1) sensorimotor areas and cingulate gyrus; (2) inferior frontal gyrus, S2, corpus callosum, basal ganglia and thalamus; (3) premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex; (4) cerebellum; and (5) insula. Analysis of the functional relationship between these areas demonstrated two parallel loops defined by connections to either the cerebellum or insula and connected through the sensorimotor-cingulate module. Path analysis was performed to test the hypothesis of modules organized into parallel loops versus a hierarchical dual-projection model consisting of two separate, singular hierarchical serial pathways from the sensorimotor cortex or insula to the thalamus. These results support the model of modules organized into parallel loops (P=0.8), but not the hierarchical dual-projection model (P<0.0001). Organization of the control of voluntary repetitive swallowing into two parallel systems may confer the ability to effectively coordinate and integrate this highly complex sequentially based motor behavior.
11718843	We have developed a feline cerebral hemispherectomy model as an analog to the surgical procedure used in pediatric intractable epilepsy. Previous work with this model has shown a remarkable plasticity associated with an early period of brain development, which we have defined using morphological, cerebral metabolic and behavioral methods. However, the important functional-metabolic bracketing of this period has not yet been performed. We have conducted the present study to answer questions raised by our previous findings using [14C] 2-deoxy-D-glucose autoradiography but only including animals lesioned at day 10 postnatally (P10) or in adulthood. The questions were; (a) is there any age better than P10 for an optimal metabolic outcome?, and (b) can we determine a cutoff point for the beneficial effects of the young age-at-lesion? Twenty-one adult cats were studied. Seven cats served as intact controls, five received a left hemineodecortication at P30, three at P60, three at P90 and three at P120, respectively. Histological analysis indicated that the extent of the lesion was similar between the age groups. Local glucose metabolic rates (LCMR(glc)) were measured in 50 structures bilaterally and used to calculate overall LCMR(glc) for seven grouped sites within the cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, mesencephalic tegmentum (and tectum), limbic system and cerebellum. Results indicated a widespread bilateral depression of LCMR(glc) in all age-at-lesion groups. The depression in overall LCMR(glc) across all structures measured in each hemisphere was significant (P<0.05) for the P120 group relative to intacts for both ipsilateral (left) and contralateral (right) sides of the brain. The ipsilateral thalamus was the region most effected by the injury, with significant losses for all age-at-lesion groups. In addition, while there were widespread depressions for all lesion groups, these losses were significant for the P120 group in five groups of structures ipsilaterally (thalamus, basal ganglia, tectum, limbic system, cerebellum) and in three contralaterally (thalamus, tectum, cerebellum). In contrast, significant depressions for the earlier age-at-lesion groups (P30, P60, P90) were found only in the ipsilateral thalamus and bilaterally in the tectum. These results, together with our previous results for the P10 group, indicate a relative sparing of LCMR(glc) after hemineodecortication during the first 60 days of life, with gradually decreasing plasticity thereafter, such that there is some residual sparing at 90 days of age, and afterwards an almost complete loss of metabolic plasticity, with lesions at P120 producing a dismal outcome. These results complement earlier morphological and behavioral studies and support the concept of a 'Critical Maturational Period' of reduced vulnerability to developmental injury.
11720708	JP05, also called GPR72 or GIR, is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPCR, showing significant structural similarity to the tachykinin receptors. The anatomical distribution of JP05 mRNA was first described in the central nervous system of the mouse, and recently the human JP05 orphan receptor gene has been cloned. In the present study the distribution of JP05 mRNA was examined in the human forebrain using in situ hybridization analysis. The results revealed a wide but discrete distribution of the transcript with strongly JP05 mRNA expressing cells, presumably neurons, present in the cerebral cortex (layer II), hippocampus (pyramidal CA3 neurons and granule cells), amygdala (basal and periamygdaloid cortical nuclei), in the endopiriform nucleus, diagonal band of Broca, thalamus (nucleus reuniens, parafascicular nucleus) and hypothalamus (posterior, dorsal, and around the medial mammillary). Weaker signals were detected in the deeper cortical layers and throughout the striatum. A few positive cells were evident in the raphe but not in the substantia nigra or pontine nuclei. The results indicate significant similarities between human and mouse brain with regard to JP05 mRNA expression. The distribution patterns of JP05 mRNA in the human brain suggest involvement in control of emotions and of neuroendocrine, cognitive and motor functions.
11735681	During the last 5 to 10 years, the microdialysis technique has been used to explore neurotransmitter release during exercise. Microdialysis can collect virtually any substance from the brains of freely moving animals with a limited amount of tissue trauma. It allows the measurement of local neurotransmitter release in combination with ongoing behavioural changes such as exercise. Several groups examined the effect of treadmill running on extracellular neurotransmitter levels. Microdialysis probes were implanted in different brain areas to monitor diverse aspects of locomotion (striatum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, spinal cord), food reward (hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex), thermoregulation (hypothalamus). Some studies combined microdialysis with running on a treadmill to evaluate motor deficit and improvement following dopaminergic grafts in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats, or combined proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cortical microdialysis to observe intra- plus extracellular brain glucose variations. This method allows us to understand neurotransmitter systems underlying normal physiological function and behaviour. Because of the growing interest in exercise and brain functioning, it should be possible to investigate increasingly subtle behavioural and physiological changes within the central nervous system. There is now compelling evidence that regular physical activity is associated with significant physiological, psychological and social benefits in the general population. In contrast with our knowledge about the peripheral adaptations to exercise, studies relating exercise to brain neurotransmitter levels are scarce. It is of interest to examine the effect of short and long term exercise on neurotransmitter release, since movement initiation and control of locomotion have been shown to be related to striatal neurotransmitter function, and one of the possible therapeutic modalities in movement, and mental disorders is exercise therapy. Until very recently most experimental studies on brain chemistry were conducted with postmortem tissue. However, in part because of shortcomings with postmortem methods, and in part because of the desire to be able to directly relate neurochemistry to behaviour, there has been considerable interest in the development of 'in vivo' neurochemical methods. Because total tissue levels may easily mask small but important neurochemical changes related to activity, it is important to sample directly in the extracellular compartment of nervous tissue in living animals. Since the chemical interplay between cells occurs in the extracellular fluid, there was a need to access this compartment in the intact brain of living and freely moving animals. Estimation of the transmitter content in this compartment is believed to be directly related to the concentration at the site where these compounds are functionally released: in the synaptic cleft. As measurements in the synapse are not yet possible, in vivo measurements in the extracellular fluid appear to provide the most directly relevant information currently available. This article provides an overview of the in vivo microdialysis technique as a method for measuring in the extracellular space, and its application in exercise science. Although this technique has been used in different tissues such as brain, adipose tissue, spinal cord and muscle, in animals as well as humans, we will focus on the use of this in vivo method in brain tissue. Recently two excellent reviews on the application of microdialysis in human experiments especially in subcutaneous tissue have been published, and we refer the interested reader to these articles.
11738135	Using the viral transneuronal tracing technique, the cell groups in the CNS transneuronally connected with the female mammary gland were detected. Lactating and non-lactating female rats were infected with pseudorabies virus injected into the mammary gland. The other group of animals was subjected to virus injection into the skin of the back. Four days after virus injection, infected neurons detected by immunocytochemistry, were present in the dorsal root ganglia ipsilateral to inoculation and in the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. In addition, a few labelled cells could be detected in the dorsal horn and in the central autonomic nucleus (lamina X) of the spinal cord. At this survival time several brain stem nuclei including the A5 noradrenergic cell group, the caudal raphe nuclei (raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus, raphe magnus), the A1/C1 noradrenergic and adrenergic cell group, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the area postrema, the gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and the locus coeruleus contained virus-infected neurons. In some animals, additional cell groups, among others the periaqueductal gray and the red nucleus displayed labelling. In the diencephalon, a significant number of virus-infected neurons could be detected in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. In most cases, virus-labelled neurons were present also in the lateral hypothalamus, in the retrochiasmatic area, and in the anterior hypothalamus. In the telencephalon, in some animals a few virus-infected neurons could be found in the preoptic area, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, in the central amygdala, and in the somatosensory cortex. At the longer (5 days) survival time each cell group mentioned displayed immunopositive neurons, and the number of infected cells increased. The pattern of labelling was similar in animals subjected to virus inoculation into the mammary gland and into the skin. The distribution and density of labelling was similar in lactating and non-lactating rats. The present findings provide the first morphological data on the localization of CNS structures connected with the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic motor system innervating the mammary gland. It may be assumed that the structures found virus-infected belong to the neuronal circuitry involved in the control of the sympathetic motor innervation of the mammary gland.
11743977	Previous studies, using a biochemical measure of serotonergic neuronal function, show that inescapable, randomly presented sound pulses activate serotonergic neurons in the rat median raphe but not dorsal raphe nucleus. The present study reveals that this activation also occurs in serotonin projection areas, in hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex but not in caudate nucleus. The selectivity of this response is examined by comparing the response to sound stress with that produced by morphine, a treatment known to selectively activate dorsal raphe but not median raphe serotonergic neurons. Two approaches are used in Sprague-Dawley rat to measure the activation of serotonergic neurons: (1) determination ex vivo of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in tissue from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, hippocampus, cortex, caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens following in vivo inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; and (2) measurement of extracellular serotonin levels in hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens. Sound stress increases 5-HTP accumulation in median raphe nucleus, hippocampus, cortex, and nucleus accumbens, but not dorsal raphe nucleus or caudate nucleus. Sound stress also enhances extracellular serotonin levels in hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, but not caudate nucleus. In contrast, the morphine treatment enhances 5-HTP accumulation in dorsal raphe nucleus, cortex and caudate nucleus, but not in median raphe nucleus, hippocampus or nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, it increases extracellular serotonin levels in only the caudate nucleus. The combined effects of sound stress and morphine on 5-HTP accumulation are identical to those obtained by each treatment individually. These findings provide further support for the presence of serotonergic neurons within the median raphe nucleus that have a unique response profile. These neurons may have an important role in responses or adaptations to stress.
11746720	In weaver mice, mutation of a G-protein inwardly rectifying K(+) channel leads to a cerebellar developmental anomaly characterized by granule and Purkinje cell loss and, in addition, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. To evaluate other deficits, ionotropic glutamate receptors sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainic acid (KA) were examined by autoradiography with [(3)H]MK-801, [(3)H]AMPA, and [(3)H]KA. These surveys were carried out in selected areas of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and related limbic regions, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum from heterozygous (wv/+) and homozygous (wv/wv) weaver mutants, and compared to wild-type (+/+) mice. In wv/+ and wv/wv mutants, NMDA receptor levels were lower in cortical areas, septum, hippocampus, subiculum, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, superior colliculus, and in the cerebellar granular layer. Densities of KA receptors were lower in cortical areas, hippocampus, limbic system structures, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and hypothalamus, superior and inferior colliculi, and cerebellar cortex of wv/wv mutants. Levels of AMPA receptors in the weaver were higher than in +/+ mice, particularly in somatosensory and piriform cortices and periaqueductal gray of wv/+, and in somatosensory cortex, CA1 field of Ammon's horn and cerebellar granular layer of wv/wv. Abnormal developmental signals, aberrant cellular responses, or a distorted balance between neurotransmitter interactions may underlie such widespread and reciprocal glutamate receptor alterations, while in the case of cerebellar cortex, NMDA receptors are lacking due to a massive disappearance of cerebellar granule cells and some loss of Purkinje neurons.
11820779	Neuroglobin is a recently discovered respiratory, porphyrin-containing protein that is expressed in the brain of mouse and human. However, the full-length cDNA sequence and genomic organization of human neuroglobin have not been reported. In this paper, the full-length cDNA sequence of human neuroglobin was cloned following bioinformatic analysis and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. It was shown that the full-length cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No. AF422796) of human neuroglobin is 1909 bp in size, and the genomic sequence is 8041 bp in size (GenBank Accession No. AF422797). To further study the characterization of this gene, the coding region of rat neuroglobin (GenBank Accession No. AF333245) was cloned by using degeneracy PCR. The result showed high conservation among human, rat, and mouse neuroglobin. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that NGB was extensively expressed in rat brain by using in situ hybridization and the immunohistochemical technique. Transcription of NGB mRNA was shown to be widely distributed throughout the adult rat brain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. NGB protein immunoreactive cells were also widely distributed throughout normal adult rat brain, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, pons, and cerebellum. It could be seen that the NGB-immunopositive signals were in the cytoplasma and processes of the neuron. These data strongly support the notion that neuroglobin is a highly conserved gene in evolution and is very important in the nervous system, possibly related to the oxygen supply of the neuron.
11825672	Neuronal calcium sensors (NCS) are important constituents in the intracellular signaling pathways. A novel human gene, NCS-1, was identified in the present study. Among the 16 human tissues examined, NCS-1 is expressed most abundantly in the brain. Among the brain regions, the expression level of NCS-1 in cerebral cortex is the highest, which is about six times higher than the average level of the whole brain and a hundred times higher than the spinal cord. In the 12 different anatomical regions of human brain, the expression level of NCS-1 is very high in the temporal lobe, occipital pole, frontal lobe, thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus; moderate in cerebellum, putamen, caudate nucleus; low in the medulla, substantia nigra and the lowest in corpus callosum. Our results suggest that NCS-1 in human brain might be involved in a variety of brain functions such as sensory processing, motor control, emotional control, learning and memory.
11835181	Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) is one of the best markers for glutamatergic neurons, because it accumulates transmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Differentiation-associated Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter (DNPI) shows 82% amino acid identity to VGluT1, and is another candidate for vesicular glutamate transporters. Here, we report the immunocytochemical localization of DNPI and compare it with that of VGluT1 in the adult rat brain. Both DNPI and VGluT1 immunoreactivities were found mostly in neuropil, presumably in axon terminals, throughout the brain. In the telencephalic regions, intense DNPI immunoreactivity was observed in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb, layer IV of the neocortex, granular layer of the dentate gyrus, presubiculum, and postsubiculum. In contrast, VGluT1 immunoreactivity was intense in the olfactory tubercle, layers I-III of the neocortex, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum. In the thalamic nuclei, DNPI-immunoreactive terminal-like profiles were much larger than VGluT1-immunoreactive ones, suggesting that DNPI immunoreactivity was subcortical in origin. DNPI immunoreactivity was much more intense than VGluT1 immunoreactivity in many brainstem and spinal cord regions, except the pontine nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, cochlear nuclei, and external cuneate nucleus. In the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex, climbing-like fibers showed intense DNPI immunoreactivity, whereas neuropil contained dense VGluT1-immnoreactive deposits. Both DNPI and VGluT1 immunoreactivities were observed as mossy fiber terminal-like profiles in the cerebellar granular layer. DNPI and VGluT1 immunoreactivities appeared associated with synaptic vesicles in the axon terminals forming asymmetric synapses in several regions examined electron microscopically. The present results indicate that DNPI and VGluT1 are used by different neural components in most, if not all, brain regions, suggesting the complementary functions of DNPI and VGluT1.
11861537	Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of three distinct small conductance (SK1-3) Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Because SK channels underlie the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that is critical for sculpturing phasic firing in hypothalamic neurons, we investigated the distribution of these channels in the female guinea pig. Both SK1 and SK3 cDNA fragments were cloned using PCR, and ribonuclease protection assay as well as in situ hybridization analysis illustrated that the SK3 channel was the predominant subtype expressed in the guinea pig hypothalamus. Combined in situ hybridization and fluorescence immunocytochemistry revealed that SK3 mRNA was expressed in GnRH, dopamine, and vasopressin neurons, and all of these neurons exhibited an AHP current. Moreover, SK3 mRNA was found in other brain areas, including the septum, bed nucleus, amygdala, thalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus. Using quantitative ribonuclease protection assay, the rank order of SK3 mRNA expression was septum >or= midbrain > rostral thalamus >or= rostral basal hypothalamus >or= caudal thalamus >or= preoptic area >> caudal basal hypothalamus >or= hippocampus. Moreover, 17beta-E2 treatment, which reduces plasma LH during the negative feedback phase, significantly increased SK3 mRNA levels in the rostral basal hypothalamus (P < 0.05; n = 6). Therefore, these findings suggest that estrogen increases the mRNA expression of SK3 channels, which may represent a mechanism by which estrogen regulates hypothalamic neuronal excitability during negative feedback.
11882374	The neural circuits that modulate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the rat were studied with the retrograde transneuronal tracer--pseudorabies virus. First-order afferents were also identified using cholera toxin beta subunit. Olfactory processing regions (viz., main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, endopiriform nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, piriform cortex, and posteriomedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus) were virally labeled. The subfornical organ directly innervates SCN; two other circumventricular organs: organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and area postrema provide multisynaptic inputs. Direct limbic afferents arise from lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdalohippocampal zone, and ventral subiculum; multineuronal connections come from the basolateral and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei, ventral hippocampus, amygdalopiriform area, as well as lateral entorhinal, perirhinal, and ectorhinal cortices. Most preoptic regions project directly to SCN. Multisynaptic inputs come from the lateral preoptic region. Hypothalamic inputs originate from the anterior, arcuate, dorsal, dorsomedial, lateral, paraventricular, posterior, periventricular posterior, retrochiasmatic, subparaventricular, ventromedial and tuberomammillary nuclei. Paraventricular thalamic nucleus, intergeniculate leaflet and zona incerta directly innervate SCN. Polyneuronal inputs arise from the subparafascicular parvicellular thalamic nucleus. Brainstem afferents originate from the pretectum, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray matter, parabrachial nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, raphe system, locus coeruleus, nucleus incertus and reticular formation. Nucleus tractus solitarius, C3 catecholamine region, rostral ventrolateral medulla and spinal trigeminal nucleus provide indirect inputs. We propose that the SCN receives feedback primarily from interoceptive systems such as the circumventricular, autonomic, and neuroendocrine systems that are important in the central regulation of glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin and glucocorticoids).
11907809	We present three cases of Raine syndrome occurring in siblings of consanguineous parents. Raine syndrome is characterised by generalised osteosclerosis with craniofacial anomalies and intracranial calcifications. So far, only nine cases have been reported, and no evaluation of the distribution and extent of the cerebral mineralisations, as well as their impact on the surrounding tissue, has been undertaken yet. In our cases, calcifications were unevenly distributed throughout the central nervous system, not associated with neuronal loss or dystrophic events and appeared mostly as single calcospherites within the neuropil with occasional confluent deposits at advanced gestational age. There was intense perifocal microgliosis around single immature calcospherites, as well as mild astrogliosis around and within the confluent lesions, in which occasional macrophages could be found. Rarely, mineralisations occurred in blood-vessel walls, mainly affecting basal ganglia. Preferential sites of calcification were parietal and occipital periventricular white matter and corpus callosum, while frontal lobes were mildly affected. The cortex, temporal lobes as well as internal capsule, brain stem, cerebellum, leptomeninges, pituitary gland and choroid plexus were devoid of mineralisations. The subcortical grey matter was moderately involved in the putamen and pallidum, mildly in the caudate nucleus and subependymal germ cell matrix and not at all in the thalamus, Ammon's horn, amygdala and substantia nigra. The distribution of mineral deposits was thus inversely correlated to regional blood circulation and capillary density, with calcifications being concentrated in more sparsely perfused areas but lacking in highly vascularised tissue. This inverse relationship between mineralisation and regional blood flow was reflected in the varying distribution of calcospherites in grey and white matter as well as in the white matter of different lobes.
11907810	A 65-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for forgetfulness, depression and eccentric behavior that had been first noticed 2 years prior to admission. She showed memory impairment, perseveration and repeated violent actions, but no limb-kinetic apraxia. She died 12 years after the onset of symptoms. At autopsy, the unfixed brain weighed 820 g. Atrophy was circumscribed in the frontal lobe on both sides. The globus pallidus and the caudate nucleus were markedly atrophic and gold yellow in color, and the substantia nigra was strikingly pale. The cortical area showed neuronal loss and status spongiosus of the second and third cortical layers with ballooned neurons. Marked neuronal loss was observed in the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, Meynert basal nucleus and substantia nigra. With Holzer stain, fibrillary gliosis was found to be severe in the frontal lobe, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus, substantia nigra, pontine tegmentum and inferior olivary nucleus. With Bielschowsky-Hirano stain, neurofibrillary tangles were observed in the cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, pontine nucleus, the inferior olivary nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and, to a lesser extent, the neostriatum. Strikingly numerous argyrophilic and tau-positive threads were present in the cerebral white matter. These neuropathological findings corresponded to corticobasal degeneration, but lesions characteristic of progressive supranuclear palsy were also found. Moreover, widespread iron deposition throughout the central nervous system was the most striking finding of the present case. To our knowledge, such a case has not been reported in the literature to date.
11923010	The expression of ErbB4 mRNA was examined in dorsal thalamic regions of chicks and rats. In rats, ErbB4 expression was observed in the habenular nuclei, the paraventricular nucleus, intermediodorsal nucleus, the central medial thalamic nucleus, the posterior nucleus, the parafascicular nucleus, the subparafascicular nucleus, the suprageniculate nucleus, the posterior limitans nucleus, the medial part of the medial geniculate nucleus, the peripeduncular nucleus, the posterior intralaminar nucleus, the lateral subparafascicular nucleus, the lateral posterior nucleus, and all ventral thalamic nuclei. In chicks, expression was observed in the subhabenular nucleus, the dorsomedialis posterior nucleus, the dorsointermedius posterior nucleus, the nucleus of the septomesencephalic tract, and areas surrounding the rotundus and ovoidalis nuclei, including the subrotundal and suprarotundal areas, and all ventral thalamic nuclei. Most cells within ovoidalis and rotundus were not labeled. The similar pattern of afferent and efferent projections originating from ErbB4-expressing regions of the mammalian and bird dorsal thalamus suggests that ErbB4 hybridizing cells may be derived from a single anlage that migrates into multiple thalamic regions. Most neurons in the rotundus and ovoidalis nuclei of chick may be homologous to unlabeled clusters of neurons intermingled with ErbB4-expressing cells of the mammalian posterior/intralaminar region.
11937069	We used the highly selective 5-HT(6) receptor radioligand [(125)I]SB-258585 (4-iodo-N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]benzene-sulfonamide) to perform autoradiographic binding studies on the rat brain. High levels of specific binding occurred in the corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens, Islands of Calleja and the olfactory tubercle. A high level of binding also appeared in the choroid plexus. Moderate levels occurred in several regions of the hippocampal formation and in certain regions of the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra; and very low levels in the globus pallidus, cerebellum, other mesencephalic regions, and the rhombencephalon. Displacement of total binding with 10 microM unlabelled SB-214111 (4-bromo-N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]benzene-sulfonamide), another selective 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist, or 10 microM unlabelled methiothepin, reduced binding to barely discernible levels. Some animals received unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the median forebrain bundle to lesion the nigro-striatal pathway before autoradiographic examination. Effectiveness of the 6-OHDA lesions in the substantia nigra and striatum was confirmed with tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. Such lesions resulted in no significant changes in [(125)I]SB-SB258585 binding in any brain region examined, suggesting that 5-HT(6) receptors in the striatum are not located on dendritic, somatic or terminal elements of dopaminergic neurones. Thus, the striatal binding sites seen in this study may be on intrinsic GABAergic or cholinergic neurones, or on terminals of projection neurones from the thalamus or cerebral cortex. The 5-HT(6) receptor ligand binding seen here in the striatum, accumbens, olfactory tubercle, Islands of Calleja, cerebral cortex and hippocampus are in concordance with previous immunohistochemical studies, and suggest a possible involvement of 5-HT(6) receptors in locomotor control, cognition, memory, and control of affect. The high levels of binding observed in the choroid plexus in this study have not been reported before. This finding suggests that 5-HT(6) receptors could play a role in the control of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.
11960899	Sleep is an essential human function. Although the function of sleep has generally been regarded to be restorative, recent data indicate that it also plays an important role in cognition. The neurobiology of human sleep is most effectively analysed with functional imaging, and PET studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In this study, PET was used to determine patterns of regional glucose metabolism in NREM sleep compared with waking. We hypothesized that brain structures related to waking cognitive function would show a persistence of function into the NREM sleep state. Fourteen healthy subjects (age range 21-49 years; 10 women, 4 men) underwent concurrent EEG sleep studies and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET scans during waking and NREM sleep. Whole-brain glucose metabolism declined significantly from waking to NREM sleep. Relative decreases in regional metabolism from waking to NREM sleep occurred in wide areas of frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital association cortex, primary visual cortex, and in anterior/dorsomedial thalamus. After controlling for the whole-brain declines in absolute metabolism, relative increases in regional metabolism from waking to NREM were found bilaterally in the dorsal pontine tegmentum, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex and extensive regions of the mesial temporal lobe, including the amygdala and hippocampus, and in the right dorsal parietal association cortex and primary somatosensory and motor cortices. The reductions in relative metabolism in NREM sleep compared with waking are consistent with prior findings from blood flow studies. The relative increases in glucose utilization in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and pontine reticular formation are new observations that are in accordance with the view that NREM sleep is important to brain plasticity in homeostatic regulation and mnemonic processing.
11988232	Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) were measured in aged and young monkeys by positron emission tomography (PET). Our purpose was to examine whether the age-related changes observed in the human brain also occur in the monkey brain. Studies were performed on six aged and six young-adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). rCBF and the rCMRglc were serially measured using PET with [(15)O]H(2)O and 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), respectively. In order to minimize the bias induced by anesthesia, the PET emission scans were performed in the conscious state. ROIs were taken for the cerebellum, hippocampus with adjacent cortex, striatum, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, frontal cortex and cingulate. Group differences and correlations between rCBF and rCMRglc in each group were determined. Aged monkeys had significantly lower rCBF in the cerebellum, hippocampus with the adjacent cortex, striatum, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and significantly lower rCMRglc in the cerebellum, hippocampus with the adjacent cortex, striatum, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, frontal cortex and cingulate, compared to young monkeys. There were significant correlations between rCBF and rCMRglc in both the aged and young groups, but no significant difference was found in relationship between the two groups. Age-related changes were observed not only in rCMRglc, but also in rCBF in aged monkeys, while the coupling between rCBF and rCMRglc was maintained even in aged monkeys. These results demonstrated the potential of aged monkeys to serve as an aged human model using PET.
12020685	It has been reported that two distinct types of jaw movements can be elicited by bilateral injections of drugs into the ventrolateral striatum: (1) dopamine receptor-mediated jaw movements that are elicited by a mixture of (+/-)-6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol (SKF 82958; 5 microg) and quinpirole (10 microg), and (2) acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements that are elicited by carbachol (2.5 microg). In the present study, electromyographic analysis was used to characterise these movements: the dopamine receptor-mediated jaw movements were marked by a dominant digastric activity during jaw opening and a dominant masseter activity during jaw closing (digastric/masseter type), whereas the acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements were marked by a dominant digastric activity during jaw opening without any significant change in masseter activity during jaw closing (digastric type). The main goal was to (in)validate the hypothesis that these two types of jaw movements are funnelled via distinct gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic output channels. Bilateral injections of both muscimol (25 and 50 ng/0.2 microl per side) and bicuculline (50 and 150 ng/0.2 microl per side) into the ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus or dorsolateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata essentially inhibited dopamine receptor-mediated jaw movements to various degrees. In contrast, acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements were inhibited by muscimol given into the entopeduncular nucleus and dorsolateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata, whereas these movements were enhanced by bicuculline. The acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements were not affected by muscimol injections into the ventral pallidum, but were inhibited by bicuculline injections. Studies on such injections into the ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus or dorsolateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of naive rats revealed that jaw movements of the digastric/masseter type were elicited either by muscimol injections into the dorsolateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata or by combined injections of muscimol and bicuculline into the entopeduncular nucleus, and that jaw movements of the digastric type were elicited only by combined injections of muscimol and bicuculline into the entopeduncular nucleus. Together, the data allow the conclusion that dopamine receptor-mediated and acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements are two distinct types of jaw movements that are funnelled via separate GABAergic output channels. It is suggested that the three different profiles of responses to GABAergic drugs in animals showing either dopamine receptor-mediated or acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements reflect the involvement of three distinct types of output neurons of the striatum, namely: type I neurons with collateralised axons to the ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus and dorsolateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata, mediating the dopamine receptor-mediated jaw movements; type II neurons with collateralised axons to the globus pallidus that, in turn, project to the entopeduncular nucleus and the dorsolateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata, mediating directly the acetylcholine receptor-mediated jaw movements; and type III neurons with a single axon to the ventral pallidum, mediating indirectly the acetylcholine receptor-mediated movements. It is evident that future studies are required to provide direct evidence in favour of the latter hypothesis.
12031341	The distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor-like immunoreactivity (Y1R-LI) has been studied in detail in the CNS of rat using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal 13 amino acids of the rat receptor protein. The indirect immunofluorescence technique with tyramide signal amplification has been employed. For specificity and comparative reasons Y1 knock-out mice and wild-type controls were analyzed. The distribution of Y1R mRNA was also studied using in situ hybridization. A limited comparison between Y1R-LI and NPY-LI was carried out.A widespread and abundant distribution of Y1R-LI, predominantly in processes but also in cell bodies, was observed. In fact, Y1R-LI was found in most regions of the CNS with a similar distribution pattern between rat and wild-type mouse. This staining was specific in the sense that it was absent in adjacent sections following preadsorption of the antibody with 10(-5) M of the antigenic peptide, and that it could not be observed in sections of the Y1 KO mouse. In contrast, the staining obtained with an N-terminally directed Y1R antiserum did not disappear, strongly suggesting unspecificity. In brief, very high levels of Y1R-LI were seen in the islands of Calleja, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, parts of the habenula, the interpeduncular nucleus, the mammillary body, the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, caudal part, the paratrigeminal nucleus, and superficial layers of the dorsal horn. High levels were found in most cortical areas, many thalamic nuclei, some subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex, the hypothalamus and the nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the parabrachial nucleus, and the inferior olive. Moderate levels of Y1R-LI were detected in the cornu Ammonis and the subicular complex, many septal, some thalamic and many brainstem regions. Y1R staining of processes, often fiber and/or dot-like, and occasional cell bodies was also seen in tracts, such as the lateral lemniscus, the rubrospinal tract and the spinal tract of the trigeminal. There was in general a good overlap between Y1R-LI and NPY-LI, but some exceptions were found. Thus, some areas had NPY innervation but apparently lacked Y1Rs, whereas in other regions Y1R-LI, but no or only few NPY-positive nerve endings could be detected. Our results demonstrate that NPY signalling through the Y1R is common in the rat (and mouse) CNS. Mostly the Y1R is postsynaptic but there are also presynaptic Y1Rs. Mostly there is a good match between NPY-releasing nerve endings and Y1Rs, but 'volume transmission' may be 'needed' in some regions. Finally, the importance of using proper control experiments for immunohistochemical studies on seven-transmembrane receptors is stressed.
12062466	There has been few studies of the globus pallidus in relation to epilepsy. In this study, kainic acid (KA)-induced globus pallidus seizure was electrophysiologically, electroencephalographically, histopathologically and metabolically investigated in rats. Sixteen Wistar rats weighing 250-350 g were used. Under intraperitoneal pentobarbital anesthesia, a stainless-steel cannula was inserted stereotaxically into the left globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) for KA injection. For recording EEG, a depth electrode was inserted into the left GPe, just posterior to the tip of the injection guide cannula. Electrodes were also inserted into the right globus pallidus and bilateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC). EEG changes after KA injection were classified as follows: Continuous low-voltage spikes were observed in the left GPe on EEG at stage 1. Intermittent multiple spikes and wave complexes began to propagate to the left SMC at stage 2. Continuous spikes and wave complexes began to propagate to the bilateral SMC at stage 3. Secondary generalized seizures were observed at stage 4. Globus pallidus seizures recurred every 7-9 min and lasted for 4-6 h. However, the seizures gradually subsided and became normal within 18 h. No spontaneous seizure was detected for the next 30 days. Histopathological study revealed a small gliotic lesion with neuronal cell loss around the cannula tip. Neither degeneration nor neuronal cell loss in the ipsilateral hippocampus were observed. The autoradiogram using [14C]2-deoxyglucose during seizure status demonstrated a remarkable increase of local cerebral glucose utilization not only in the GPe but also in the GPi. An increase glucose metabolism was also found in the follows: the medial and lateral septal nucleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, accumbens nucleus, ventral and lateral nucleus of the thalamus, amygdala, and ventral nucleus of hypothalamus. KA injection into the unilateral GPe evoked not only epileptic excitation of the cortex but also transient enhancement of the globus pallidus-substantia nigra circuit.
12064472	Recent studies demonstrated that the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CCL2 and its receptor, CCR2, play important roles in various brain diseases. In this study, using quantitative autoradiography, we studied the pharmacological properties of [125l]MCP-1/CCL2 binding in rat brain and we clearly showed the distribution of CCR2 receptors in cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, mammillary bodies and raphe nuclei. Moreover, using double fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we showed that CCR2 receptors were constitutively expressed on neurons and astrocytes. Using RT-PCR methods, we demonstrated that CCR2 mRNA is present in various brain areas described above. Four hours after an acute intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection, we showed that MCP-1/CCL2 binding was up-regulated in several brain structures; this effect took place on both CCR2B labelled neurons and astrocytes and to a lesser extent on activated microglia. To explore neurobiological function of CCR2, actimetric study was carried out. After intracerebroventricular injections of MCP-1/CCL2, we showed that motor activity was markedly decreased. Our results provide the first evidence for constitutive CCR2 receptor expression with precise neuroanatomical and cellular localizations in the brain, and its regulation during an inflammatory process, suggesting that MCP-1/CCL2 and CCR2 play important physiological and pathophysiological role(s) in the CNS.
12065723	The characterization and anatomical distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(7) receptor binding sites in brain tissue has been hampered by the lack of a specific radioligand. In the present autoradiographic study, we took advantage of 5-HT(1A) knockout and 5-HT(1A/1B) double-knockout mice to revisit the pharmacological characterization and anatomical localization of 5-HT(7) binding sites in mouse brain using [(3)H]5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and [(3)H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT). The distribution pattern of [(3)H]5-CT binding sites (2 nM) in the brain of mice lacking the 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor was scarce and confined to the septum, globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, cortex, and substantia nigra. The low densities of [(3)H]5-CT binding sites detected in septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and cortex were displaced by 10 microM of the selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist (R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol (SB-269970). The SB-269970-insensitive [(3)H]5-CT binding sites detected in globus pallidus and substantia nigra of 5-HT(1A/1B) knockout mice were displaced by N-[3-(2-dimethylamino)ethoxy-4-methoxy-phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'- (5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-carboxamide hydrochloride (SB-216641) (1 microM), demonstrating the 5-HT(1D) nature of these binding sites. In contrast to the low densities of [(3)H]5-CT binding sites, high-to-moderate densities of [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites (10 nM) were found throughout the brain of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1A/1B) knockout mice (olfactory system, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, CA3 field of the hippocampus, cortical mantle, and central gray). These [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites were displaced by 10 microM SB-269970, risperidone, and methiothepin but not by pindolol, N-tert-butyl-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-phenylpropanamide (WAY- 100135), or citalopram. We conclude that despite its high affinity for the 5-HT(7) receptor in tissue homogenates, [(3)H]5-CT is not a good tracer for measuring 5-HT(7) receptor binding sites autoradiographically. Also, the lower affinity ligand [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT is a much better tracer for autoradiographic studies at the 5-HT(7) receptor binding sites.
12115709	To obtain a better understanding of the evolution of the brain catecholaminergic systems of fishes, we have examined the distribution of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in two species of sturgeon (Acipenser baeri and Huso huso) using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta -hydroxylase (DBH; only analyzed in Acipenser). Both sturgeons showed TH-immunoreactive (THir) neurons widely distributed in most regions of the brain, the highest number of THir cells being located in the forebrain (olfactory bulb, preoptic area, and posterior tuberculum). THir cells were also seen in other forebrain areas (retrobulbar area, dorsal and ventral telencephalic areas, hypothalamus, ventral thalamus, pretectal area) and in the brainstem (locus coeruleus, viscerosensory area, caudal reticular formation, and area postrema). Immunoreactive fibers and varicosities showed a wide distribution, being particularly abundant in the diencephalon and mesencephalon. DBH-immunoreactive (DBHir) cells were observed in the anterior tuberal nucleus, where these cells were TH-negative, and in the locus coeruleus and the caudal rhombencephalon (vagal reticular formation), where the DBHir cells were also THir. DBHir fibers were scarce in the telencephalon and very abundant in the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The comparative analysis of the catecholaminergic systems of chondrosteans and those observed in other groups of fishes and tetrapods indicate a similar organization of many nuclei, as well as characteristics that are probably primitive, such as the presence of a large number of forebrain catecholaminergic groups.
12124914	Normative data on the in vivo size of the human brain and its major anatomically defined subdivisions are not readily available. In this study, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure regional brain volumes in 46 normal, right-handed adults (23 men, 23 women) between the ages of 22-49 years. Parcellation of the brain was based on neuroanatomical landmarks. The following brain regions were measured: the cerebral hemispheres, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, cingulate gyrus, insula, cerebellum, corpus callosum, and lateral ventricles. Males tend to be significantly larger than females, for the whole brain and for nearly all of its major subdivisions, including the corpus callosum. However, the proportional sizes of regions relative to total volume of the hemisphere are remarkably similar in males and females. Variation in size of region is always greater than variation in proportional representation. Asymmetries in brain regions are not profound, with the exception of the cingulate gyrus, which is larger in the left hemisphere. Brain regions are highly correlated in size, with the exception of the lateral ventricles. After controlling for hemisphere size, the volumes of the frontal and parietal lobes are significantly negatively correlated. The occipital lobe tends to be less sexually dimorphic than other major lobes, and less correlated with other brain regions for volume. These results have implications for understanding whether or not certain sectors of the brain have shown relative expansion over the course of hominid and hominoid evolution.
12150792	We hypothesize that a single exposure to an LD(50) dose of sarin induces widespread early neuropathological changes in the adult brain. In this study, we evaluated the early changes in the adult brain after a single exposure to different doses of sarin. Adult male rats were exposed to sarin by a single intramuscular injection at doses of 1, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 x LD(50). Twenty-four hours after the treatment, both sarin-treated and vehicle-treated (controls) animals were analyzed for: (i) plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity; (ii) brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, (iii) m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2 mAChR) ligand binding; (iv) blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability using [H(3)]hexamethonium iodide uptake assay and immunostaining for endothelial barrier antigen (EBA); and (v) histopathological changes in the brain using H&E staining, and microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining. In animals treated with 1 x LD(50) sarin, the significant changes include a decreased plasma BChE, a decreased AChE in the cerebrum, brainstem, midbrain and the cerebellum, a decreased m2 mAChR ligand binding in the cerebrum, an increased BBB permeability in the cerebrum, brainstem, midbrain and the cerebellum associated with a decreased EBA expression, a diffuse neuronal cell death and a decreased MAP-2 expression in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, and degeneration of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. Animals treated with 0.5 x LD(50) sarin however exhibited only a few alterations, which include decreased plasma BChE, an increased BBB permeability in the midbrain and the brain stem but without a decrease in EBA expression, and degeneration of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. In contrast, animals treated with 0.1 and 0.01 x LD(50) did not exhibit any of the above changes. However, m2 mAChR ligand binding in the brainstem was increased after exposure to all doses of the sarin.Collectively, the above results indicate that, the early brain damage after acute exposure to sarin is clearly dose-dependent, and that exposure to 1 x LD(50) sarin induces detrimental changes in many regions of the adult rat brain as early as 24 hours after the exposure. The early neuropathological changes observed after a single dose of 1 x LD(50) sarin could lead to a profound long-term neurodegenerative changes in many regions of the brain, and resulting behavioral abnormalities.
12169109	The present work is an analysis of the afferent projections to the thalamic nucleus rotundus in a lizard, both at the light- and electron-microscopic level, using biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) as a neuroanatomical tracer. This study has confirmed previously reported afferent projections to nucleus rotundus in reptiles and has also identified a number of new cellular aggregates projecting to this dorsal thalamic nucleus. After BDA injections into nucleus rotundus, retrogradely labelled neurons were observed consistently within the following neuronal groups in the midbrain and the diencephalon: (i) the stratum griseum centrale of the optic tectum; (ii) the nucleus subpretectalis in the pretectum; (iii) the nucleus ansa lenticularis posterior, the posterior nucleus of the ventral supraoptic commissure, and the posteroventral nucleus, in the dorsal thalamus and (iv) the lateral suprachiasmatic nucleus and part of the reticular complex in the ventral thalamus. Tectal axons entering nucleus rotundus were fine and varicose and formed exclusively asymmetric synaptic contacts, mainly on small dendritic profiles. Rotundal neurons had symmetric synapses made by large boutons probably of nontectal origin. After comparing our results with those in other reptiles, birds and mammals, we propose that the sauropsidian nucleus rotundus forms part of a visual tectofugal pathway that conveys mesencephalic visual information to the striatum and dorsal ventricular ridge, and is similar to the mammalian colliculo-posterior/intralaminar-striatoamygdaloid pathway, the function of which may be to participate in visually guided behaviour.
12192499	THALAMUS: The human thalamus is a nuclear complex located in the diencephalon and comprising of four parts (the hypothalamus, the epythalamus, the ventral thalamus, and the dorsal thalamus). The thalamus is a relay centre subserving both sensory and motor mechanisms. Thalamic nuclei (50-60 nuclei) project to one or a few well-defined cortical areas. Multiple cortical areas receive afferents from a single thalamic nucleus and send back information to different thalamic nuclei. The corticofugal projection provides positive feedback to the "correct" input, while at the same time suppressing irrelevant information. Topographical organisation of the thalamic afferents and efferents is contralateral, and the lateralisation of the thalamic functions affects both sensory and motoric aspects. Symptoms of lesions located in the thalamus are closely related to the function of the areas involved. An infarction or haemorrhage thalamic lesion can develop somatosensory disturbances and/or central pain in the opposite hemibody, analgesic or purely algesic thalamic syndrome characterised by contralateral anaesthesia (or hypaesthesia), contralateral weakness, ataxia and, often, persistent spontaneous pain. BASAL GANGLIA: Basal ganglia form a major centre in the complex extrapyramidal motor system, as opposed to the pyramidal motor system (corticobulbar and corticospinal pathways). Basal ganglia are involved in many neuronal pathways having emotional, motivational, associative and cognitive functions as well. The striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens) receive inputs from all cortical areas and, throughout the thalamus, project principally to frontal lobe areas (prefrontal, premotor and supplementary motor areas) which are concerned with motor planning. These circuits: (i) have an important regulatory influence on cortex, providing information for both automatic and voluntary motor responses to the pyramidal system; (ii) play a role in predicting future events, reinforcing wanted behaviour and suppressing unwanted behaviour, and (iii) are involved in shifting attentional sets and in both high-order processes of movement initiation and spatial working memory. Basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits maintain somatotopic organisation of movement-related neurons throughout the circuit. These circuits reveal functional subdivisions of the oculomotor, prefrontal and cingulate circuits, which play an important role in attention, learning and potentiating behaviour-guiding rules. Involvement of the basal ganglia is related to involuntary and stereotyped movements or paucity of movements without involvement of voluntary motor functions, as in Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or Huntington's disease. The symptoms differ with the location of the lesion. The commonest disturbances in basal ganglia lesions are abulia (apathy with loss of initiative and of spontaneous thought and emotional responses) and dystonia, which become manifest as behavioural and motor disturbances, respectively.
12209852	The present study used injections of neuroanatomical tracers to determine the subcortical connections of the caudal and rostral subdivisions of the dorsolateral area (DL) and the middle temporal crescent area (MT(C)) in owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), and macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis and M. radiata). Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MT(C) were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIp; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MT(C) to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MT(C) had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MT(C) to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups.
12213296	The efferent cortico-cortical projections of the motorcortical larynx area were studied in three rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), using biotin dextranamine as anterograde tracer. Identification of the larynx area was made with the help of electrical brain stimulation and indirect laryngoscopy. Heavy projections were found into the surrounding ventral and dorsal premotor cortex (areas 6V and D), primary motor cortex (area 4), the homolog of Broca's area (mainly area 44), fronto- and parieto-opercular cortex (including secondary somatosensory cortex), agranular, dysgranular and granular insula, rostral-most primary somatosensory cortex (area 3a), supplementary motor area (area 6M), anterior cingulate gyrus (area 24c) and dorsal postarcuate cortex (area 8A). Medium projections could be traced to the ventrolateral prefrontal and lateral orbital cortex (areas 47L and O), the primary somatosensory areas 3b and 2, the agranular and dysgranular insula, and the posteroinferior parietal cortex (area 7; PFG, PG). Minor projections ended in the lateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 46V and 8B), primary somatosensory area 1 and cortex within the intraparietal sulcus (PEa) and posterior sulcus temporalis superior (TPO). Due to its close spatial relationship to the insula on the one hand and the premotor cortex on the other, the larynx area shows projections which, in some respects, are not typical for classical primary motor cortex.
12239632	WNT signals are transduced through seven-transmembrane-type WNT receptors encoded by Frizzled (FZD) genes to the beta-catenin - TCF pathway, the JNK pathway or the Ca2+-releasing pathway. WNT signaling molecules are potent targets for diagnosis of cancer (susceptibility, metastasis, and prognosis), for prevention and treatment of cancer, and for regenerative medicine or tissue engineering. We have so far cloned and characterized human WNT signaling molecules WNT2B/WNT13, WNT3, WNT3A, WNT5B, WNT6, WNT7B, WNT8A, WNT8B, WNT10A, WNT10B, WNT11, WNT14, WNT14B/WNT15, FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD5, FZD6, FZD7, FZD8, FZD10, FRAT1, FRAT2, NKD1, NKD2, VANGL1/STB2, ARHU/WRCH1, ARHV/WRCH2, GIPC2, GIPC3, betaTRCP2/FBXW1B, SOX17, and TCF-3 using bioinformatics, cDNA-library screening, and cDNA-PCR. Here, expression of WNT7A in human normal tissues and cancer, and regulation of WNT7A and WNT7B in human cancer were investigated. WNT7A was highly expressed in fetal lung, adult testis, lymph node, and peripheral blood leukocytes. WNT7A was relatively highly expressed in temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, paracentral gyrus of cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, medulla oblongata and putamen within adult brain. WNT7A was highly expressed in SW480 (colorectal cancer), BxPC-3 and Hs766T (pancreatic cancer), and was also expressed in MKN7 and MKN45 (gastric cancer). WNT7B rather than WNT7A was expressed in MCF-7 (breast cancer) and NT2 (embryonal tumor). beta-estradiol did not affect expression levels of WNT7A and WNT7B in MCF-7 cells. WNT7B, but not WNT7A, was slightly up-regulated by all-trans retinoic acid in NT2 cells.
12296381	The subventricular zone (SVZ), lining the lateral ventricle in forebrain, retains a population of neuronal precursors with the ability of proliferation in adult mammals. To test the potential of neuronal precursors in adult mice, we transplanted adult SVZ cells labeled with fluorescent dye PKH26 into the lateral ventricle of the mouse brain in different development stages. The preliminary results indicated that the grafted cells were able to survive and migrate into multiple regions of the recipient brain, including SVZ, the third ventricle, thalamus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, cerebellum and olfactory bulb etc; and the amount of survival cells in different brain regions was correlated with the development stage of the recipient brain. Immunohistochemical studies showed that most of the grafted cells migrating into the specific target could express neuronal or astrocytic marker. Our results revealed that the neuronal precursors in adult SVZ still retained immortality and ability of proliferation, which is likely to be induced by some environmental factors.
12350300	Among 27,000 infants studied prospectively to characterize their sleep-wake behavior, 38 infants died suddenly and unexpectedly under 6 months of age. Of these, 26 died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), 5 from congenital cardiac abnormalities, 2 from infected pulmonary dysplasia, 2 from septic shock with multi-organ failure, 1 from a prolonged seizure, 1 from prolonged neonatal hypoxemia, and 1 from meningitis and brain infarction. The frequency and duration of apneas recorded some 3-12 weeks prior to the infants' death were analyzed. The brainstem materials were collected and studied in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between sleep apnea, and prone sleep position and gliosis in some nuclei associated with cardiorespiratory characteristics, such as nucleus ambiguus in the medulla oblongata and the solitary nucleus, as well as structures associated with arousal phenomenon, such as the reticular formation, the superior central nucleus and the nucleus raphe magnus in the pons, the dorsal raphe nuclei in the midbrain and medulla oblongata, periaqueductal gray matter in midbrain, and locus ceruleus. Gliosis was estimated as the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes. Variant-covariant analyses were carried out using the characteristics of apnea as an independent variable and sleep position and gliosis as dependent variables. A significant association was found only in the frequency of obstructive apnea and prone position (P<0.001) and gliosis in the raphe nuclei in the midbrain (P<0.001). Although prone position is a well-known risk factor for SIDS, the frequency of obstructive apnea has not been associated with the prone sleep position. The observed relation between prone sleep and the density of gliosis does not relate to epidemiological findings. Further studies are needed to investigate the unexpected statistical association.
12350301	Developmental studies on neurotransmitters and their receptors in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) infants and controls are reviewed, including comparison between the prone and supine positions at death. In SIDS infants, there are an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the brainstem, an increase of substance P (SP) in the medulla and pons, a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM), and vagal nuclei in the medulla oblongata and basal ganglia, a decrease of tryptophan hydroxylase (TrH)-positive serotonergic neurons in the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), and decreases of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) and 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivities in the VLM and vagal nuclei in the medulla oblongata. These findings may be the result of chronic or repeated hypoxia and at the same time suggest hypofunction or immaturity of cardiorespiratory regulation. In contrast, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivities are increased in the PAG of SIDS infants. These increased immunoreactivities may reflect delayed neuronal maturation or a developmental abnormality of the nocicetive reaction of cardiorespiratory and arousal control in SIDS. Also, there are no differences of brainstem gliosis and catecholaminergic neuron changes between the prone and supine positions. Therefore, these changes may be predisposing factors for SIDS.
12373061	In the New World monkey Saguinus fuscicollis, the anterograde projections of the motorcortical tongue area were studied. Three animals were analyzed. In two, biotin dextran amine was used as tracer; in the third, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used. Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Intracortical projections were found into the neighboring primary motor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, frontoopercular cortex, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. Projections also ended in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex and agranular as well as granular insula. In addition, weaker labeling was found in the inferior and dorsal parietal cortex, and perirhinal and inferotemporal cortex. Subcortically, there was a heavy projection into the ventral putamen, a moderate projection into the caudate nucleus and claustrum, and a weak projection into the anterior, central and lateral amygdala. In the thalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis lateralis, reticularis, centralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, pulvinaris oralis, centrum medianum, reuniens and suprageniculatus in an order of intensity. Subthalamically, weak projections could be traced into the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the colliculus superior, area praetectalis, dorsal reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal gray. In the lower brainstem, fibers ended in the griseum pontis, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation, paramedian and dorsal reticular nuclei, solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus itself; there were, however, terminals in the immediately bordering reticular formation.
12388587	Retrograde transneuronal tracing with rabies virus from the right orbicularis oculi muscle was used to identify neural networks underlying spontaneous, reflex, and learned blinks. The kinetics of viral transfer was studied at sequential 12 hr intervals between 3 and 5 d after inoculation. Rabies virus immunolabeling was combined with the immunohistochemical detection of choline acetyltransferase expression in brainstem motoneurons or Fluoro-Ruby injections in the rubrospinal tract. Virus uptake involved exclusively orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the dorsolateral division of the facial nucleus. At 3-3.5 d, transneuronal transfer involved premotor interneurons of trigeminal, auditory, and vestibular reflex pathways (in medullary and pontine reticular formation, trigeminal nuclei, periolivary and ventral cochlear nuclei, and medial vestibular nuclei), motor pathways (dorsolateral quadrant of contralateral red nucleus and pararubral area), deep cerebellar nuclei (lateral portion of interpositus nucleus and dorsolateral hump ipsilaterally), limbic relays (parabrachial and Kölliker-Fuse nuclei), and oculomotor structures involved in eye-eyelid coordination (oculomotor nucleus, supraoculomotor area, and interstitial nucleus of Cajal). At 4 d, higher order neurons were revealed in trigeminal, auditory, vestibular, and deep cerebellar nuclei (medial, interpositus, and lateral), oculomotor and visual-related structures (Darkschewitsch, nucleus of the posterior commissure, deep layers of superior colliculus, and pretectal area), lateral hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex (particularly in parietal areas). At 4.5 and 5 d the labeling of higher order neurons occurred in hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and blink-related areas of cerebellar cortex. These results provide a comprehensive picture of the premotor networks mediating reflex, voluntary, and limbic-related eyelid responses and highlight potential sites of motor learning in eyelid classical conditioning.
12389210	In the present study the localization of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)-expressing cell bodies and PACAP projections were mapped in the adult rat brain and spinal cord by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry. A widespread occurrence of PACAP-containing cell bodies was found, with the greatest accumulation in several hypothalamic nuclei and in several brainstem nuclei, especially the habenular nuclei, the pontine nucleus, the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), and the vagal complex. PACAP was also present in cell bodies in the olfactory areas, in neocortical areas, in the hippocampus, in the vestibulo- and cochlear nuclei, in cell bodies of the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, in the subfornical organ, and in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. An intense accumulation of PACAP-immunoreactive (-IR) nerve fibers was observed throughout the hypothalamus, in the amydaloid and extended amygdaloid complex, in the anterior and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, in the intergeniculate leaflet, in the pretectum, and in several brainstem nuclei, such as the parabrachial nucleus, the sensory trigeminal nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. PACAP-IR nerve fibers were also found in the area postrema, the posterior pituitary and the choroid plexus, and the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord. The widespread distribution of PACAP in the brain and spinal cord suggests that PACAP is involved in the control of many autonomic and sensory functions as well as higher cortical processes.
12419702	Aluminium exposure, apart from producing cholinotoxicity, can include changes in other neurotransmitter levels since neurotransmitter levels are closely interrelated. Reports of aluminium (Al) effects on brain neurotransmitters are limited. To investigate the effect of Al on the rat brain serotonergic system, the present study was conducted to explore brain region-specific changes and duration-specific changes. Male Wistar albino rats were exposed orally to Al chloride (AlCl(3).6H(2)O; 320 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to 60 days and changes in the 5-hydroxytrytamine (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were observed after 4, 14 and 60 days of exposure in olfactory lobe (OLB), cerebellum (CBL), pons (PON), medulla oblongata (MOB), spinal cord (SPI), hypothalamus (HYP), hippocampus (HIP), striatum (STR), midbrain (MBR) and cortex (COR) brain regions. Significantly increased 5-HT levels observed in brain regions OLB (60 days), HIP (4,14 days), STR (14 days), HYP (14, 60 days), MBR (4 and 14 days), PON (4 days), MOB (4 days) and SPI (4, 14 and 60 days) following Al exposure may be due to Al deactivating 5-HT system by decreased release and subsequent breakdown of 5-HT. Decreased 5-HT levels observed in cerebral COR, HIP (60 days) and in CBL after 4 and 60 days of exposure suggest an inhibitory effect of Al on the 5-HT system due to withdrawal of cholinergic input in these brain regions. 5-HIAA level changes correlate with 5-HT level changes in many brain regions studied. The results reveal that the neurochemical changes due to Al were dependent on the duration of exposure and are brain-region-specific. The observed changes may be related to the cholinergic toxicity of Al.
12421658	Abnormalities in the P300 ERP, elicited by the oddball task and measured using EEG, have been found in a number of central nervous system disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and alcohol dependence. While electrophysiological studies provide high temporal resolution, localizing the P300 deficit has been particularly difficult because the measurements are collected from the scalp. Knowing which brain regions are involved in this process would elucidate the behavioral correlates of P300. The aim of this study was to determine the brain regions involved in a visual oddball task using fMRI. In this study, functional and high-resolution anatomical MR images were collected from seven normal volunteers. The data were analyzed using a randomization-based statistical method that accounts for multiple comparisons, requires no assumptions about the noise structure of the data, and does not require spatial or temporal smoothing. Activations were detected (P<0.01) bilaterally in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG; BA 40), superior parietal lobule (BA 7), the posterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, inferior occipitotemporal cortex (BA 19/37), insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), premotor area, and cuneus (BA 17). Our results are consistent with previous studies that have observed activation in ACC and SMG. Activation of thalamus, insula, and the occipitotemporal cortex has been reported less consistently. The present study lends further support to the involvement of these structures in visual target detection.
12424960	We investigated cerebral atrophy in multiple system atrophy (MSA) by quantitative analysis of MRI. The subjects were 28 patients with MSA (14 striato-nigral degeneration; SND, 14 olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy; OPCA. 106 MRI examinations were performed totally) and 85 normal persons for control. The ratios of the ventral pons to the infratentorial space in the sagittal section, the putamen, cerebrum, frontal lobe and parietal & occipital lobes to the intracranial space in the horizontal section, and the temporal lobe to the intracranial space in the coronal section were measured. In the early stage of the disease, OPCA showed significant atrophy of the ventral pons compared with SND, and conversely, SND demonstrated significantly smaller putamen than that in OPCA. According to the progression of the disease, the atrophy of these neural tissues progressed, which resulted in no significant differences between SND and OPCA. The cerebral atrophy was observed in 17 MSA patients. The atrophy of the frontal lobe was much frequent and prominent to that in the temporal lobe and parietal & occipital lobes. SND showed higher incidence of the cerebral atrophy than OPCA in the early stage of the disease. In long period follow-up cases, one case showed cerebral atrophy in earlier stage, and another case in late stage. We indicated the involvement of the cerebral hemispheres in MSA, especially the frontal lobe.
12429422	In the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), the cerebral 2-deoxyglucose uptake was compared between animals made to vocalize by electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey and animals stimulated in the same structure, but sub-threshold for vocalization. A significantly higher 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the vocalizers than the non-vocalizers was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary and pre-supplementary motor area, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, primary motor cortex, claustrum, centrum medianum, perifornical hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, intercollicular region, dorsal mesencephalic reticular formation, peripeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, nucl. ruber, paralemniscal area, trigeminal motor, principal and spinal nuclei, solitary tract nucleus, nucl. ambiguus, nucl. retroambiguus, nucl. hypoglossus, ventral raphe and large parts of the medullary reticular formation. The study makes clear that vocalization, even in the case of genetically pre-programmed patterns, depends upon an extensive network, beyond the well-known periaqueductal grey, nucl. retroambiguus and cranial motor nuclei pathway.
12430986	The effect of ovariectomy and estrogen treatment on the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cognition in rats was investigated in this study. Ovariectomized and nonovariectomized rats were treated subcutaneously with estradiol dipropionate for 8 d. In the single-trial, passive-avoidance test all the groups showed significant learning and retention of memory as evident by the increase in transfer latency time in trial 2 as compared with trial 1. No-transfer response was significantly increased in the estradiol-dipropionate-treated ovariectomized (80%) and nonovariectomized (60%) group as compared with the ovariectomized (30%) group. Specific activity of acetylcholinesterase was assayed spectrophotometrically in salt-soluble and detergent-soluble fractions of various brain areas: frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus, thalamus, pons, medulla, and cerebellum. The effect of ovariectomy and estradiol dipropionate was varied in both fractions of these brain areas. Estradiol dipropionate treatment could restore the acetylcholinesterase activity to the control level only in the detergent-soluble fraction of hypothalamus and salt-soluble fraction of hypothalamus, thalamus, and medulla in ovariectomized rats. The results indicate that ovariectomy alters acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain areas but not in a uniform manner and affects only qualitative aspects of cognitive function, which could be improved by estrogen supplementation.
12466462	The Valsalva maneuver, a test frequently used to evaluate autonomic function, recruits discrete neural sites. The time courses of neural recruitment relative to accompanying cardiovascular and breathing patterns are unknown. We examined functional magnetic resonance imaging signal changes within the brain to repeated Valsalva maneuvers and correlated these changes with physiological trends. In 12 healthy subjects (age, 30-58 yr), a series of 25 volumes (20 gradient echo echo-planar image slices per volume) was collected using a 1.5-Tesla scanner during a 60-s baseline and 90-s challenge period consisting of three Valsalva maneuvers. Regions of interest were examined for signal intensity changes over baseline and challenge conditions in cardiorespiratory-related regions. In addition, whole brain correlations between signal intensity and heart rate and airway load pressure were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Significant signal changes, correlated with the time course of load pressure and heart rate, emerged within multiple areas, including the amygdala and hippocampus, insular and lateral frontal cortices, dorsal pons, dorsal medulla, lentiform nucleus, and fastigial and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Signal intensities peaked early in the Valsalva maneuver within the hippocampus and amygdala, later within the dorsal medulla, pons and midbrain, and deep cerebellar nuclei, and last within the lentiform nuclei and the lateral prefrontal cortex. The ventral pontine signals increased during the challenge, but not in a fashion correlated to load pressure or heart rate. Sites showing little or no correlation included the vermis and medial prefrontal cortex. These data suggest an initiating component arising in rostral brain areas, a later contribution from cerebellar nuclei, basal ganglia, and lateral prefrontal cortex, and a role for the ventral pons in mediating longer term processes.
12467022	This review summarizes our recent studies using the viral transneuronal tracing technique to identify sites in the central nervous system (CNS) that are connected with the ovary. A neurotropic virus (pseudorabies virus) was injected into the ovary and various times after the inoculation the spinal cord and brain were examined for virus-infected neurons identified by immunocytochemistry. Such neurons could be detected in well-defined cell groups of the spinal cord (intermediolateral cell column), brain stem (vagal nuclei, area postrema, parapyramidal nucleus, caudal raphe nuclei, A1, A5, A7 noradrenergic cell groups, locus coeruleus, Barrington's nucleus, periaqueductal gray), hypothalamus (paraventricular nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, zona incerta), and, at longer survival time, in some telencephalic structures (amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). These findings provided the first neuromorphological evidence for the existence of a multisynaptic neuronal pathway between the brain and the ovary presumably involved in the neuronal control of the organ. The observations indicate that there is a significant overlap of CNS structures connected with the ovary, the testis, other organs and organ systems, suggesting similar neuronal circuitries of the autonomic nervous system innervating the different organs. The known descending neuronal connections between the CNS structures labeled from the ovary by the viral transneuronal tracing technique and the findings suggesting a pituitary independent interplay between certain cerebral structures such as the hypothalamus, the amygdala, and the ovary are also summarized in this review.
12505650	A wealth of animal data implicates the amygdala in aspects of emotional processing. In recent years, functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have begun to refine our understanding of the functions of the amygdala in humans. This literature offers insights into the types of stimuli that engage the amygdala and the functional consequences that result from this engagement. Specific conclusions and hypotheses include: (1) the amygdala activates during exposure to aversive stimuli from multiple sensory modalities; (2) the amygdala responds to positively valenced stimuli, but these responses are less consistent than those induced by aversive stimuli; (3) amygdala responses are modulated by the arousal level, hedonic strength or current motivational value of stimuli; (4) amygdala responses are subject to rapid habituation; (5) the temporal characteristics of amygdala responses vary across stimulus categories and subject populations; (6) emotionally valenced stimuli need not reach conscious awareness to engage amygdala processing; (7) conscious hedonic appraisals do not require amygdala activation; (8) activation of the amygdala is associated with modulation of motor readiness, autonomic functions, and cognitive processes including attention and memory; (9) amygdala activations do not conform to traditional models of the lateralization of emotion; and (10) the extent and laterality of amygdala activations are related to factors including psychiatric status, gender and personality. The strengths and weakness of these hypotheses and conclusions are discussed with reference to the animal literature.
12505668	Expression of the inducible transcription factor c-Fos was mapped in mouse brain to identify neural circuits selectively involved in response to cold and hot external temperatures. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed acutely or repeatedly (seven sessions) to 10 or 34 degrees C in sound-attenuated chambers. Control mice were acclimated to exposure to the experimental room at 20 degrees C. All animals were sacrificed at 90 min for immunohistochemical analysis. A statistically significant induction of c-Fos was observed in the shell of nucleus accumbens and posterior medial cortical amygdala only following the acute thermal exposure, showing a significant habituation of the response to repeated treatments, a finding arguing against specificity of responses in these nuclei to thermal exposures. In contrast, expression of c-Fos was significantly increased following both acute and repeated thermal exposures in subregions of hypothalamus (the median and medial preoptic nuclei, the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and the posterior hypothalamic area), septum (the ventral and dorsal portions of the lateral septum), midbrain (the periaqueductal gray and the intermediate layers of superior colliculus), as well as in the dentate gyrus and the paraventricular nucleus of thalamus, suggesting specificity of their responses to external temperatures. Expression of c-Fos was also significantly increased in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus following acute thermal exposures versus control mice, but not versus mice repeatedly exposed to cold and hot temperatures, providing modest support for thermal specificity of c-Fos response in this nucleus. While thermal sensitivity of hypothalamic structures has been previously confirmed by many authors, the present study identifies a number of structures previously not found to be responsive to changes in external temperature, and lays ground for future work important for identification of neural circuits involved in thermoregulation.
12506045	In adult rats, when plasma osmolality increases, water flows across the blood-brain barrier down its concentration gradient from brain to plasma, and brain volume deceases. The brain responds to this stress by gaining osmotically active solutes, which limit water loss. This phenomenon is termed brain volume (water) regulation. We tested the hypothesis that brain volume regulation is more effective in young lambs and adult sheep than in fetuses, premature lambs, and newborn lambs. Brain water responses to acute hyperosmolality were measured in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and medulla of fetuses at 60 and 90% of gestation, premature ventilated lambs at 90% of gestation, newborn lambs, young lambs at 20-30 days of age, and adult sheep. After exposure of the sheep to increases in systemic osmolality with mannitol plus NaCl, brain water content and electrolytes were quantified. The ideal osmometer is a system in which impermeable solutes do not enter or leave in response to an osmotic stress. There were significant differences from an ideal osmometer in the cerebral cortex of fetuses at 90% of gestation, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum of newborn lambs, and cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and medulla of young lambs and adult sheep; however, there were no differences in the brain regions of fetuses at 60% of gestation and premature lambs, cerebellum and medulla of fetuses at 90% of gestation, and medulla of newborn lambs. We conclude that 1) brain water loss is maximal and brain volume regulation impaired in most brain regions of fetuses at 60 and 90% of gestation and premature lambs; 2) brain volume regulation develops first in the cerebral cortex of the fetuses at 90% of gestation and in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of newborn lambs, and then it develops in the medulla of the lambs at 20-30 days of age; 3) brain water loss is limited and volume regulation present in the brain regions of young lambs and adult sheep; and 4) the ability of the brain to exhibit volume regulation develops in a region- and age-related fashion.
12531492	The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a nuclear transcriptional coactivator that is expressed in brown adipose tissue, brain, heart and kidney as well as cold-exposed skeletal muscle. In liver, white and brown adipose tissue, PGC-1alpha expression is regulated in a manner suggesting a role in energy homeostasis. To characterize PGC-1alpha expression in the rodent brain and to determine brain PGC-1alpha regulation, we used in situ hybridization histochemistry in C57Bl/6J mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that PGC-1alpha is widely expressed in brain areas, including in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, the diagonal band of Broca, the medial septal nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus, the striatum and globus pallidus, the hippocampus, the substantia nigra, the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the cochlear nucleus and the superior olivary complex. In contrast, PGC-1alpha expression was absent in the hypothalamus. To evaluate PGC-1alpha expression under different physiologic states in these various brain areas, we examined expression with fasting, leptin treatment and cold exposure (4 h at 4 degrees C) and found no change, nor was expression changed in the brain of the leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and the hyperleptinemic UCP-DTA mice. Hence, PGC-1alpha is widely expressed in the rodent brain, but is not regulated by states of caloric deficiency, leptin, obesity or cold exposure. Its functional role in the brain requires further study.
12564774	The distribution of basal ganglia lesions, including the amygdala, striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen), pallidum, and substantia nigra, were reinvestigated in 19 Japanese autopsy cases of 'Pick complex', consisting of five patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), 10 patients with Pick's disease with Pick bodies (PDPB), and four patients with generalized variant of Pick's disease (gvPD). The lesions in the amygdala, striatum, and pallidum were classified into three categories (severe, moderate, and slight). The lesions in the substantia nigra were qualitatively judged, compared with normal controls. In CBD, basal ganglia lesions in all five cases were uniform: the pallidum showed severe lesions, the striatum moderate lesions, the amygdala slight lesions, and obvious neuronal loss of the substantia nigra was verified in all five cases. Basal ganglia lesions in 10 cases of PDPB were also uniform: the amygdala disclosed severe to moderate lesions, the striatum moderate to slight lesions, the pallidum slight lesions, while obvious neuronal loss of the substantia nigra was found in only two of nine cases in which this structure was examined. Furthermore, basal ganglia lesions in all four cases of gvPD were uniform: the caudate nucleus showed severe lesions, the putamen and amygdala severe to moderate lesions, the pallidum moderate to slight lesions, and obvious neuronal loss of the substantia nigra was confirmed in all four cases. This study, using conventional staining such as hematoxylin-eosin and Holzer, clarified that there were prominent lesions in the pallidum in CBD, in the amygdala in PDPB, and in the caudate nucleus in gvPD, respectively. In addition, nigral involvement was usually found in CBD and gvPD, but was rarely seen in PDPB. These neuropathological findings may help to elucidate the pathological heterogeneity of basal ganglia lesions in 'Pick complex'.
12568278	Levels of monoamines and metabolites, excitatory amino acids, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were investigated in discrete brain areas of chronic Jiawey Siwu (JS)-treated rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed orally for 3 months with normal saline or JS at 0.21, 1.05 or 4.2 g/kg/day. Body weights of these four groups were similar over 3 months. Most effects of JS revealed a dose dependency with levels of neurotransmitters. Levels of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) in cerebral cortex; EPI, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in medulla oblongata; DA in midbrain; NE and 5-HT in amygdala; and 5-HT in hypothalamus had decreased in JS-treated rats. 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT) in cerebral cortex; 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) in medulla oblongata; NE, 3-MT and homovanillic acid (HVA) in pons; EPI and 3-MT in midbrain; 3-MT and HVA in amygdala; 3-MT, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), HVA and 5-HIAA in cerebellum; HVA in hypothalamus; and DOPAC and HVA in hippocampus had all increased in JS-treated rats. In pons, 5-HT increased with low and decreased with high JS doses. Ratios of DA/3-MT in pons and midbrain; DA/HVA in pons and cerebellum; and 5-HT/5-HIAA in medulla oblongata, cerebellum and hypothalamus had decreased. Furthermore, aspartate (ASP) and glutamate (GLU) levels had decreased in cerebral cortex, midbrain, hypothalamus and hippocampus or amygdala, and increased in pons. GABA levels were reduced in cerebral cortex, and higher in medulla oblongata, pons, amygdala, cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum of JS-treated rats. These results indicate that the synthesis and (or) metabolism of NE, DA, EPI and 5-HT, and the levels of ASP, GLU and GABA in rat brains were differentially regionally altered by JS, which may contribute to the central manifestations of JS treatment.
12574946	This report concerns a Japanese family with neuropathological findings consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) in the Island of Guam. The proband was a 68-year-old woman with an 8-year history of parkinsonism which was followed by psychiatric symptoms and neurogenic amyotrophy 5 years after the onset. She had a family history of parkinsonism associated with dementia in all of her three siblings. They grew up in the Hobara village, a focus of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Kii Peninsula of Japan in their childhood. Their parents were not consanguineous nor natives of the Kii Peninsula. The brain weight was 1040 g and there were mild frontal lobe atrophy, moderate atrophy of pes hippocampi, decoloration of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, and atrophy of the anterior root of the spinal cord. The microscopic examinations revealed degeneration of CA1 portion of the hippocampus to the parahippocampus gyrus, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and spinal anterior horn with Bunina bodies. The spinal pyramidal tracts also mildly degenerated. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were observed in the cerebral cortex, especially in the cortices from hippocampus to lateral occipitotemporal gyri, basal nucleus of Mynert, basal ganglia, thalamus, substantia nigra and widespread regions of the central nervous system through the brainstem to spinal cord including the nucleus of Onufrowitcz. In spite of a small amount of the senile plaques in the cerebral cortex and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, abundant NFT were distributed mainly in the third layer of the cerebral cortex, which is the characteristic feature of ALS/PDC. Thus, this was likely to be an ALS/PDC case outside the Guam Island. A tau mutation was not found on DNA analysis.
12584720	The structures associated with learning and memory have been widely studied for over 100 years. The idea of the famous neuropsychologist K.S. Lashley, that learning and memory are stored diffusely in the brain, dominated neuroscience in the early half of Twentieth Century. Since Scoville reported in 1957 a persistent impairment of recent memory caused by bilateral medial temporal lobe resection in a patient, the concept that different brain structures play different roles in learning and memory has been established, but the structures were thought to work separately. The connections and functional influences between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, thalamus and hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus, basal nucleus of Meynert and medial temporal lobe system, and amygdala and thalamus were successively reported. The marginal division (MrD) is a pan-shaped structure consisting of spindle-shaped neurons at the caudal margin of the neostriatum in the mammalian brain. The MrD has been shown to contribute to associative learning and declarative memory by behavioral study in rats and by functional magnetic resonance image study in humans. Lesions in the MrD influenced the learning and memory function of the basal nucleus of Meynert and attenuated hippocampal long-term potentiation. The MrD is likely, based on its position, advanced development in higher mammalian brains, abundant and swift blood supply, and complex connections, to be an important subcortical memory center in the brain. The above-mentioned studies demonstrated that memory-related centers could influence each other and play different roles. Therefore, we propose that there are very possibly hierachical memory centers in the brain.
12592588	Abuse of amphetamine derivatives such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is an important issue in current forensic practice and fatalities are not infrequent. Therefore, we investigated an immunohistochemical method to detect the amphetamine analogues MDMA and MDA in human tissues. For the staining procedure, the Catalysed Signal Amplification (CSA) method using peroxidase (HRP) provided by Dako and specific monoclonal antibodies were used. Appropriate controls for validation of the technique were included. The distribution of these designer drugs was studied in various brain regions including the four lobes, the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellar vermis and, additionally, in the pituitary gland. A distinct positive reaction was observed in all cortical brain regions and the neurons of the basal ganglia, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus and the cerebellar vermis but in the brainstem, relatively weak staining of neurons was seen. The reaction presented as a mainly diffuse cytoplasmic staining of the perikaryon of the neurons, and often axons and dendrites were also visualised. In addition, the immunoreactivity was present in the white matter. In the pituitary gland, however, distinct immunopositive cells were observed, with a prominent heterogeneity. The immunohistochemical findings were supported by the toxicological data. This immunostaining technique can be used as evidence of intake or even poisoning with MDMA and/or MDA and can be an interesting tool in forensic practice when the usual samples for toxicological analysis are not available. Furthermore, this method can be used to investigate the distribution of these substances in the human body.
12596253	The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptor is single transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and the internalization of circulating IGF-II. At present, there is little information regarding the cellular distribution of the IGF-II/M6P receptor within the adult rat brain. With the use of immunoblotting and immunocytochemical methods, we found that the IGF-II/M6P receptor is widely but selectively expressed in all major brain areas, including the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Intense IGF-II/M6P receptor immunoreactivity was apparent on neuronal cell bodies within the striatum, deeper layers (layers IV and V) of the cortex, pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampal formation, selected thalamic nuclei, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, pontine nucleus and motoneurons of the brainstem as well as in the spinal cord. Moderate neuronal labeling was evident in the olfactory bulb, basal forebrain areas, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, midbrain areas, granule cells of the cerebellum and in the intermediate regions of the spinal gray matter. We also observed dense neuropil labeling in many regions, suggesting that this receptor is localized in dendrites and/or axon terminals. Double-labeling studies further indicated that a subset of IGF-II/M6P receptor colocalizes with cholinergic cell bodies and fibers in the septum, striatum, diagonal band complex, nucleus basalis, cortex, hippocampus, and motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. The observed widespread distribution and colocalization of IGF-II/M6P receptor in the adult rat brain provide an anatomic basis to suggest a multifunctional role for the receptor in a wide-spectrum of central nervous system neurons, including those expressing a cholinergic phenotype.
12606458	The retrograde tracer, FluoroGold, was used to trace the neuronal inputs from the septum, hypothalamus, and brain stem to the region of the GnRH neurons in the rostral preoptic area of the ram and to compare these imputs with those in the ewe. Sex differences were found in the number of retrogradely labeled cells in the dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells were also observed in the lateral septum, preoptic area, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, stria terminalis, subfornical organ, periventricular nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, lateral hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, and posterior hypothalamus. These sex differences may partially explain sex differences in how GnRH secretion is regulated. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was used to determine the neurochemical identity of some of these cells in the ram. Very few tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons in the A14 group (<1%), ACTH-containing neurons (<1%), and neuropeptide Y-containing neurons (1-5%) in the arcuate nucleus contained FluoroGold. The ventrolateral medulla and parabrachial nucleus contained the main populations of FluoroGold-containing neurons in the brain stem. Retrogradely labeled neurons were also observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal gray matter. Virtually all FluoroGold-containing cells in the ventrolateral medulla and about half of these cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract also stained for dopamine beta-hydroxylase. No other retrogradely labeled cells in the brain stem were noradrenergic. Although dopamine, beta-endorphin, and neuropeptide Y have been implicated in the regulation of GnRH secretion in males, it is unlikely that these neurotransmitters regulate GnRH secretion via direct inputs to GnRH neurons.
12611981	A number of sensory modalities most likely converge in the rat perirhinal cortex. The perirhinal cortex also interconnects with the amygdala, which plays an important role in various motivational and emotional behaviors. The neural pathway from the perirhinal cortex to the entorhinal cortex is considered one of the main paths into the entorhinal-hippocampal network, which has a crucial role in memory processes. To investigate the potential associative function of the perirhinal cortex with respect to sensory and motivational stimuli and the influence of the association on the perirhinal-entorhinal-hippocampal neurocircuit, we prepared rat brain slices including the perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala. We used an optical imaging technique with a voltage-sensitive dye to analyze 1) the spatial and functional distribution of inputs from the lateral nucleus of the amygdala to the perirhinal cortex; 2) the spread of neural activity in the perirhinal cortex after layers II/III stimulation, which mimics sensory input to the perirhinal cortex; and 3) the effect of associative inputs to the perirhinal cortex from both the lateral amygdaloid nucleus and layers II/III of the perirhinal cortex on the perirhinal-entorhinal-hippocampal neurocircuit. Following stimulation in the superficial layers of the perirhinal cortex, electrical activity only propagated into the entorhinal cortex when sufficient activation occurred in the deep layers of perirhinal area 35. We observed that single stimulation of either the perirhinal cortex or amygdala did not result in sufficient neural activation of the deep layers of areas 35 to provoke activity propagation into the entorhinal cortex. However, the deep layers of area 35 were depolarized much more strongly when the two stimuli were applied simultaneously, resulting in spreading activation in the entorhinal cortex. Our observations suggest that a functional neural basis for the association of higher-order sensory inputs and emotion-related inputs exists in the perirhinal cortex and that transfer of sensory information to the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry might be affected by the association of that information with incoming information from the amygdala.
12638125	Hypothalamic sites wherein P4, through progestin receptor, (Pgr; commonly abbreviated PR), maximizes the expression of female sexual behaviors and gonadotropin surge release have been studied intensively. However, little is known regarding PR expression in brainstem regions likely to regulate changes in autonomic functions observed when P4 levels are elevated (i.e. pregnancy). Using in situ hybridization, we found PR mRNA-containing cells widely distributed throughout the brainstem of ovariectomized, estradiol-treated Sprague-Dawley rats, with high expression in regions including the medial vestibular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, substantia nigra (compact part), ventral tegmental area, hypoglossal nucleus, locus coeruleus, Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and inferior olivary complex. We also detected moderate to high levels of PR gene expression in several regions, such as the trapezoid nucleus, facial nucleus, periaqueductal gray regions, and rostral ventrolateral medulla. These results demonstrate that PR expression is widespread in the brainstem and identify nuclei wherein P4 may act to influence a number of physiological functions during pregnancy.
12657371	Divergent ethanol-drinking behavior in rats selectively bred for high- or low-ethanol-drinking behavior could be related to differences in the sensitivity of the CNS to ethanol. In the current study, we examined the effects of acute (i.e., single injection) ethanol administration on local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) within selected brain regions of high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) rats. Adult, male, HAD and LAD rats from replicate line 2 were injected intraperitoneally with saline, or ethanol, at doses of 0.25 g/kg or 1.0 g/kg, during their dark cycle; 10 min later, [14C]-2-deoxyglucose ([14C]-2-DG; 125 microCi/kg) was injected into the femoral vein. Timed arterial blood samples were collected over 45 min and assayed for plasma glucose, ethanol, and [14C]-2-DG levels. Rats were then decapitated, and their brains were quickly extracted and frozen in isopentane at -50 degrees C. Coronal brain sections were prepared and apposed to x-ray film for 2 days, and image densities were determined by using quantitative autoradiography. Data were collected from several key limbic (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, olfactory tubercle, amygdala, hippocampus, ventral pallidum, and septum), basal ganglia, cortical (medial prefrontal, frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, entorhinal, piriform, and cingulate), and subcortical (thalamus, habenula, and superior colliculus) structures. After administration of both low (0.25 g/kg) and moderate (1.0 g/kg) doses of ethanol, LCGU values were lower, relative to those for saline controls, in several CNS regions (lateral septum; posterior cingulate, frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices; dorsomedial striatum; and dorsomedial thalamus) of LAD but not HAD rats. These findings may indicate that certain CNS regions of LAD-2 rats are more sensitive than regions of HAD-2 rats to the effects of low-to-intermediate doses of ethanol.
12673832	Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS) is a PGD(2)-synthesizing enzyme and is expressed in antigen-presenting cells, mast cells, and other immunocompetent cells. We here report the HPGDS expression in microglia and the migration pathway of microglia in the developing mouse brain as detected by HPGDS immunohistochemistry. Expression of HPGDS mRNA peaked at postnatal day (PND) 10, decreased gradually thereafter, and reached a plateau at PND 20. The mRNAs for target molecules of PGD(2), i.e., DP receptor (DPR) and CRTH2 receptor, showed developmental profiles overlapped to that of HPGDS. Most of the HPGDS(+) cells at PND 10 had morphological characteristics of ameboid microglia and gave positive immunostaining with microglia-specific markers such as RCA-1, F4/80, or ER-MP12. These specific markers became less detectable later on, but HPGDS was still expressed even in resting microglia. Thus, HPGDS is a useful marker for investigation of microglial development. Spaciotemporal evaluation of microglial development and migration with HPGDS immunostaining revealed the following three major possible migration pathways of microglia in the postnatal brain: from the lateral ventricle via subventricular zones to brain parenchyma; from the leptomeninges around the cerebellopontine angle to the cerebellar white matter; and from the overlying leptomeninges to the hippocampus, basal forebrain, and brainstem.
12690057	High-functioning autistic and normal school-age boys were compared using a whole-brain morphometric profile that includes both total brain volume and volumes of all major brain regions. We performed MRI-based morphometric analysis on the brains of 17 autistic and 15 control subjects, all male with normal intelligence, aged 7-11 years. Clinical neuroradiologists judged the brains of all subjects to be clinically normal. The entire brain was segmented into cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem and ventricles. The cerebrum was subdivided into cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter, hippocampus-amygdala, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus plus putamen, and diencephalon (thalamus plus ventral diencephalon). Volumes were derived for each region and compared between groups both before and after adjustment for variation in total brain volume. Factor analysis was then used to group brain regions based on their intercorrelations. Volumes were significantly different between groups overall; and diencephalon, cerebral white matter, cerebellum and globus pallidus-putamen were significantly larger in the autistic group. Brain volumes were not significantly different overall after adjustment for total brain size, but this analysis approached significance and effect sizes and univariate comparisons remained notable for three regions, although not all in the same direction: cerebral white matter showed a trend towards being disproportionately larger in autistic boys, while cerebral cortex and hippocampus-amygdala showed trends toward being disproportionately smaller. Factor analysis of all brain region volumes yielded three factors, with central white matter grouping alone, and with cerebral cortex and hippocampus-amygdala grouping separately from other grey matter regions. This morphometric profile of the autistic brain suggests that there is an overall increase in brain volumes compared with controls. Additionally, results suggest that there may be differential effects driving white matter to be larger and cerebral cortex and hippocampus-amygdala to be relatively smaller in the autistic than in the typically developing brain. The cause of this apparent dissociation of cerebral cortical regions from subcortical regions and of cortical white from grey matter is unknown, and merits further investigation.
12694946	Inositolphosphates and phosphatidylinositides are important second messengers. Previously p42(IP4), a protein with high affinity for both Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) has been characterized in our laboratory. In the present study mRNA levels of p42(IP4) were quantified during development (ages: 7, 14, 21 days and adult) by means of ribonuclease protection assay in various rat brain regions (cerebellum, cortex, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and tectum (superior and inferior colliculus)). A high level of p42(IP4) mRNA was detected in the cortex (ca. 1 pg specific RNA per microg of total RNA) which stayed highly independent of the age of the animals. In hippocampus and in the thalamus, p42(IP4) mRNA levels were comparable to those in the cortex in the first and second week postnatally, but decreased to lower levels in the adult brain. In striatum, the mRNA increased, albeit less intensely than in hippocampus and thalamus, until day 21 postnatally, and then decreased in the adult rat brain. Cerebellar p42(IP4) mRNA showed a slow increase within the first 3 weeks postnatally, and remained rather high in the adult brain. The protein expression of p42(IP4), tested within the same samples by Western blot staining, was consistent with mRNA values. For comparison, glutamic acid decarboxylase (isoforms GAD65/GAD67), an enzyme, for which some regional brain specific distribution is already known, was also examined. The mRNA levels of GAD and its developmental regulation clearly differed from that of p42(IP4). In summary, p42(IP4) expressed in several neuronal cell types, did not seem to be restricted to specific developmental stages, but the high absolute expression levels at all developmental stages indicated that p42(IP4) is a protein fundamental for neuronal functioning.
12697714	Estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and ER beta are members of the steroid nuclear receptor family that modulate gene transcription in an estrogen-dependent manner. ER mRNA and protein have been detected both peripherally and in the central nervous system, with most data having come from the rat. Here we report the development of an ER beta-selective antibody that cross-reacts with mouse, rat, and human ER beta protein and its use to determine the distribution of ER beta in the murine brain. Further, a previously characterized polyclonal antibody to ER alpha was used to compare the distribution of the two receptors in the first comprehensive description of ER distribution specifically in the mouse brain. ER beta immunoreactivity (ir) was primarily localized to cell nuclei within select regions of the brain, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, septum, preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, and cerebellum. Extranuclear-ir was detected in several areas, including fibers of the olfactory bulb, CA3 stratum lucidum, and CA1 stratum radiatum of the hippocampus and cerebellum. Although both receptors were generally expressed in a similar distribution through the brain, nuclear ER alpha-ir was the predominant subtype in the hippocampus, preoptic area, and most of the hypothalamus, whereas it was sparse or absent from the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the region-selective expression of ER beta and ER alpha in the adult ovariectomized mouse brain. These data provide an anatomical framework for understanding the mechanisms by which estrogen regulates specific neural systems in the mouse.
12698364	The distribution of methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibres was studied in the brainstem of the cat using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. In the mesencephalon, immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the periaqueductal grey, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the central and pericentral nuclei of the inferior colliculus and the pericentral division of the dorsal tegmental nucleus. In the pons, immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the dorsolateral division of the pontine nucleus; below the central division of the dorsal tegmental nucleus; above the dorsolateral division of the pontine nucleus, and close to the superior cerebellar peduncle. In the medulla oblongata, immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus and in the lateral tegmental field; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus; the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus; the medial nucleus of the solitary tract; the rostral division of the cuneate nucleus, and close to the parvocellular division of the alaminar spinal trigeminal nucleus. The highest (moderate) density of immunoreactive fibres was observed in the periaqueductal grey; the parvocellular and magnocellular divisions of the alaminar spinal trigeminal nucleus; the laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus; the rostral division of the cuneate nucleus; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus; the lateral nucleus of the solitary tract, and in the midline between the central divisions of the reticulotegmental pontine nucleus. The widespread distribution of methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 in the cat brainstem indicates that the peptide might be involved in several physiological functions.
12699766	Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders that include attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and drug abuse. Recently, we have been working with a mouse in which the gene for the DA transporter (DAT) has been disrupted. This mouse is hyperactive in the open field, displays an inability to inhibit ongoing behaviors, and is deficient on learning and memory tasks. Psychostimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate attenuate the hyperlocomotion of the mutants, but stimulate activity of the wild type (WT) controls. The objective of the present study is to examine the neural basis for the differential responses to psychostimulants in these mice. WT and DAT knockout (KO) animals were given vehicle or methylphenidate, amphetamine, or cocaine and brain sections were immunostained for Fos. In WT mice, methylphenidate induced Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in the mesostriatal and mesolimbocortical DA pathways that included the anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal association cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, claustrum, lateral septum, nucleus accumbens, basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and dorsal raphe. Additional areas of activation included the granular dentate gyrus, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. While the mutants showed little response in most of these same areas, the anterior olfactory nucleus, caudal caudate-putamen, lateral septum, basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala, and bed nucleus of stria terminalis were activated. Amphetamine and cocaine produced similar changes to that for methylphenidate, except these psychostimulants also induced Fos-LI in the nucleus accumbens of the KO animals. Since the DAT gene is disrupted in the KO mouse, these findings suggest that dopaminergic mechanisms may mediate the WT responses, whereas non-dopaminergic systems predominate in the mutant. In the mutants, it appears that limbic areas and non-dopaminergic transmitter systems within these brain regions may mediate responses to psychostimulants. Inasmuch as the KO mouse may represent a useful animal model for ADHD and because psychostimulants such as cocaine are reinforcing to these animals, our results may provide some useful insights into the neural mechanisms-other than DA-that may contribute to the symptoms of ADHD and/or drug abuse in human patients.
12711351	We examined the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine(7) (5-HT(7)) receptor protein in developing and adult rats with immunohistochemical technique. In adult male rats, 5-HT(7) receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the septum, striatum, indusium griseum, tenia tecta, thalamus, hippocampus and hypothalamus in the forebrain as well as the pons and cerebellum. In brains of 1, 7, 15 and 21 days old male rats but not of adult ones, 5-HT(7) receptor immunoreactivity-positive dot-like structures were detected. The dot-like structures were visualized in hypothalamus, hippocampus, frontal cortex, brainstem and cerebellum at 1 day old male rats. In 7 days old male rats, the dot-like structures were found in the hypothalamus, medial preoptic area (MPA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), amygdaloid nucleus and brainstem reticular formation. In 15 and 21 days old male and female rats, 5-HT(7) receptor immunoreactive dots were most clearly detected in MPA, hypothalamus, raphe pallidus, raphe magnus and brainstem reticular formation. The 5-HT(7) receptor immunoreactivity-positive dot-like structures were shown in the cytoplasm and they were less than 1 microm in diameter in 1 and 7 days old rats and became larger to 1-3 microm in 15 and 21 days old rats. From the distribution and morphologic features, the 5-HT(7) receptor immunoreactivity-positive dot-like structure found in developing rat brains is considered to be identical to a cytoplasmic inclusion named 'stigmoid body'.
12711639	1. Ethanol and nicotine are commonly coabused drugs. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) metabolizes ethanol and bioactivates tobacco-derived procarcinogens. Ethanol and nicotine can induce hepatic CYP2E1 and we hypothesized that both centrally active drugs could also induce CYP2E1 within the brain. 2. Male rats were treated with saline, ethanol (3.0 g kg(-1) by gavage) or nicotine (1.0 mg kg(-1) s.c.) for 7 days. Ethanol treatment significantly increased CYP2E1 in olfactory bulbs (1.7-fold), frontal cortex (2.0-fold), hippocampus (1.9-fold) and cerebellum (1.8-fold), while nicotine induced CYP2E1 in olfactory bulbs (2.3-fold), frontal cortex (3.0-fold), olfactory tubercle (3.1-fold), cerebellum (2.5-fold) and brainstem (2.0-fold). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the induction was cell-type specific. 3. Consistent with the increased CYP2E1 found in rat brain following drug treatments, brains from alcoholics and alcoholic smokers showed greater staining of granular cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cells of CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions as well as of cerebellar Purkinje cells compared to nonalcoholic nonsmokers. Moreover, greater CYP2E1 immunoreactivity was observed in the frontal cortices in the alcoholic smokers in comparison to nonalcoholic nonsmokers and alcoholic nonsmokers. 4 To investigate if nicotine could contribute to the increased CYP2E1 observed in alcoholic smokers, we treated human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells in culture and found significantly higher CYP2E1 immunostaining in nicotine-treated cells (0.1-10 nM). 5. CYP2E1 induction in the brain, by ethanol or nicotine, may influence the central effects of ethanol and the development of nervous tissue pathologies observed in alcoholics and smokers.
12713642	Modulation of nociceptive transmission at the brainstem involves several neurochemical systems. The precise location and specific characteristics of nociceptive neurons activated in each system was never reported. In this study, the presence of GABA(B), mu-opioid, and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors in brainstem nociceptive neurons was investigated by double-immunocytochemical detection of each receptor and noxious-evoked induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene. Noxious cutaneous mechanical stimulation significantly increased the proportions of neurons double-labelled for Fos and GABA(B) receptors in several brainstem regions, namely, the reticular formation of the caudal ventrolateral medulla (VLMlat and VLMrf), lateral reticular nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, pars caudalis (Sp5C), nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal reticular nucleus, ventral reticular nucleus, raphe obscurus nucleus and dorsal parabrachial nucleus (DPB). For mu-opioid receptors, the proportions of double-labelled neurons in noxious-stimulated animals were higher than in controls only in the VLMlat, VLMrf, Sp5C, DPB and A5 noradrenergic cell group. As for the NK-1 receptor, no significant differences were found between control and stimulated animals. According to these results, neurons expressing GABA(B), mu-opioid and NK-1 receptors at several pain control centres of the brainstem are differentially involved in processing nociceptive mechanical input. The data provide the definition of new supraspinal targets for selective modulation of nociceptive neurons in order to define better strategies of pain control.
12718448	The immature brain is more resistant to hypoxia/ischemia than the mature brain. Although chronic hypoxia can induce adaptive-changes on the developing brain, the mechanisms underlying such adaptive changes are poorly understood. To further elucidate some of the adaptive changes during postnatal hypoxia, we determined the activities of four enzymes of glucose oxidative metabolism in eight brain regions of hypoxic and normoxic rats. Litters of Sprague-Dawley rats were put into the hypoxic chamber (oxygen level maintained at 9.5%) with their dams starting on day 3 postnatal (P3). Age-matched normoxic rats were use as control animals. In P10 hypoxic rats, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in cerebral cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons and medulla, and cerebellum was significantly increased (by 100%-370%) compared to those in P10 normoxic rats. In P10 hypoxic rats, hexokinase (HK) activity in hypothalamus, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, midbrain, and cerebral cortex was significantly decreased (by 15%-30%). Neither alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC, which is believed to have an important role in the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle flux) nor citrate synthase (CS) activity was significantly decreased in the eight regions of P10 hypoxic rats compared to those in P10 normoxic rats. In P30 hypoxic rats, LDH activity was only increased in striatum (by 19%), whereas HK activity was only significantly decreased (by 30%) in this region. However, KGDHC activity was significantly decreased in olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum (by 20%-40%) in P30 hypoxic rats compared to those in P30 normoxic rats. Similarly, CS activity was decreased, but only in olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, and midbrain (by 9%-21%) in P30 hypoxic rats. Our results suggest that at least some of the mechanisms underlying the hypoxia-induced changes in activities of glycolytic enzymes implicate the upregulation of HIF-1. Moreover, our observation that chronic postnatal hypoxia induces differential effects on brain glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes may have pathophysiological implications (e.g., decreased in energy metabolism) in childhood diseases (e.g., sudden infant death syndrome) in which hypoxia plays a role.
12722103	In the central nervous system (CNS), the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger plays a fundamental role in controlling the changes in the intracellular concentrations of Na(+) and Ca(2+) ions. These cations are known to regulate neurotransmitter release, cell migration and differentiation, gene expression, and neurodegenerative processes. In the present study, nonradioactive in situ hybridization and light immunohistochemistry were carried out to map the regional and cellular distribution for both transcripts and proteins encoded by the three known Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger genes NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3. NCX1 transcripts were particularly expressed in layers III-V of the motor cortex, in the thalamus, in CA3 and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, in several hypothalamic nuclei, and in the cerebellum. NCX2 transcripts were strongly expressed in all hippocampal subregions, in the striatum, and in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus. NCX3 mRNAs were mainly detected in the hippocampus, in the thalamus, in the amygdala, and in the cerebellum. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that NCX1 protein was mainly expressed in the supragranular layers of the cerebral cortex, in the hippocampus, in the hypothalamus, in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and in the granular layer of the cerebellum. The NCX2 protein was predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, in the striatum, in the thalamus, and in the hypothalamus. The NCX3 protein was particularly found in the CA3 subregion, and in the oriens, radiatum, and lacunoso-moleculare layers of the hippocampus, in the ventral striatum, and in the cerebellar molecular layer. Collectively, these results suggest that the different Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger isoforms appear to be selectively expressed in several CNS regions where they might underlie different functional roles.
12722107	Intracellular recording and biocytin labeling were carried out in the fire-bellied toad Bombina orientalis to study the morphology and axonal projections of thalamic (TH) neurons and their responses to electrical optic nerve stimulation. Labeled neurons (n = 142) were divided into the following groups: TH1 neurons projecting to the dorsal striatum; TH2 neurons projecting to the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and septal nuclei; TH3 neurons projecting to the medial or dorsal pallium; TH4 neurons with projections ascending to the dorsal striatum or ventral striatum/amygdala and descending to the optic tectum, tegmentum, and rostral medulla oblongata; TH5 neurons with projections to the tegmentum, rostral medulla oblongata, prectectum, or tectum; and TH6 neurons projecting to the hypothalamus. TH1 neurons are found in the central, TH2 neurons in the anterior and central, TH3 neurons in the anterior dorsal nucleus, and TH4 and TH5 neurons in the posterior dorsal or ventral nucleus. Neurons with descending projections arborize in restricted parts of retinal afferents; neurons with ascending projections do not substantially arborize within retinal afferents. At electrical optic nerve stimulation, neurons in the ventral thalamus respond with excitation at latencies of 10.8 msec; one-third of them follow repetitive stimulation and possibly are monosynaptically driven. Neurons in the dorsal thalamus respond mostly with inhibition at latencies of 42.3 msec and are polysynaptically driven. This corroborates the view that neurons in the dorsal thalamus projecting to the telencephalon receive no substantial direct retinal input and that the thalamopallial pathway of amphibians is not homologous to the mammalian retinogeniculocortical pathway.
12724159	The basal forebrain is a confluence of systems that are crucial to understanding some of the most important functions of the brain, including reward and punishment, learning and cognition, and feeding and reproduction. Basic to understanding this broad spectrum of behavior is untangling the interwoven functional systems in basal forebrain. This has been grounded by the appreciation that the major nearby structures, that is, amygdala and basal ganglia, provide a context for interpreting basal forebrain areas that are best viewed as extensions of either of these larger regions. The components of basal forebrain, the ventral striatopallidal system and the medial and central divisions of extended amygdala, are subcortical relays for information garnered from brain stem, thalamus, and cortical areas. With respect to the classically defined amygdala of the temporal lobe, the lateral-basolateral complex, and the superficial amygdaloid nuclei may tentatively be viewed as specialized cortical regions. Their output targets both the striatopallidal complex and the extended amygdala, with some of the most massive basal forebrain efferents originating in the basolateral amygdaloid complex. The subcortical projections of the basolateral nucleus, at least in the rat, appear to be dichotomous, with anterior (or magnocellular) portions of the nucleus preferentially targeting striatum and ventral striatum (including the core of the nucleus accumbens), while the posterior (small-celled) portions of the basolateral nucleus target the extended amygdala as well as the shell of the nucleus accumbens. This divergence represents a particular opportunity for behavioral neuroscientists analyzing basal forebrain functions. Studies exploiting the dual subcortical projection of basolateral amygdala indicate distinct functional roles for striatum versus extended amygdala. These reinforce the identification of extended amygdala as a functional-anatomical entity distinct from the striatopallidal system.
12732258	Cytochrome oxidase activity was examined in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with overexpression of the 751 amino acid isoform of beta-amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish mutation under control of the murine thy-1 promoter. The neuritic plaques, abundantly localized in the hippocampus and anterior neocortical areas, showed a core devoid of enzymatic activity surrounded by higher cytochrome oxidase activity at the sites of the dystrophic neurites and activated glial cells. Quantitative measures, taken only in the healthy-appearing regional areas without neuritic plaques, were higher in numerous limbic and non-limbic regions of transgenic mice in comparison with controls. Enzymatic activity was higher in the dentate gyrus and CA2-CA3 region of the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate and primary visual cortex, two olfactory structures, the ventral part of the neostriatum, the parafascicularis nucleus of the thalamus, and the subthalamic nucleus. Brainstem regions anatomically related with altered forebrain regions were more heavily labeled as well, including the substantia nigra, the periaqueductal gray, the superior colliculus, the medial raphe, the locus coeruleus and the adjacent parabrachial nucleus, as well as the pontine nuclei, red nucleus, and trigeminal motor nucleus. Functional brain organization is discussed in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Although hypometabolism is generally observed in this pathology, the increased cytochrome oxidase activity obtained in these transgenic mice can be the result of a functional compensation on the surviving neurons, or of an early mitochondrial alteration related to increased oxidative damage.
12732936	Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have some clinical and pathological features in common. Each, however, has been shown to have specific astrocytic inclusions. CBD is characterized by astrocytic plaques, and PSP is characterized by tuft-shaped astrocytes. To clarify differences between these inclusions, we investigated intracerebral distribution of astrocytic plaques and tuft-shaped astrocytes in autopsied brains of patients with either CBD or PSP. Specimens from ten patients with CBD and five patients with PSP were stained by the Gallyas-Braak method. Densities of the astrocytic plaques and tuft-shaped astrocytes were determined for 11 cerebral cortical regions, 6 subcortical nuclei, 5 brain stem regions, the cerebellar cortex and the dentate nucleus. Astrocytic plaques were most abundant in the prefrontal and premotor areas in the cerebral cortex of CBD brains, whereas tuft-shaped astrocytes were most prominent in the precentral gyrus and premotor area of PSP brains. Many astrocytic plaques were observed in the caudate nucleus of CBD brains, whereas tuft-shaped astrocytes were abundant in both the caudate and putamen and moderate in number in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus in PSP brains. Very slight accumulation of astrocytic plaques was seen in the brain stem of CBD brains, whereas numerous tuft-shaped astrocytes were found in the red nucleus and superior colliculus of PSP brains. Distribution of the astrocytic plaques and tuft-shaped astrocytes differed greatly. Thus, CBD and PSP can be considered different entities.
12742623	In order to better understand the descending voluntary vocal control pathway, the efferent subcortical projections of the laryngeal motorcortex were studied in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). For this purpose, the left motorcortex was exposed in three animals under narcosis. By electrical brain stimulation, sites were identified yielding vocal fold adduction. Effective sites were injected with the anterograde tracer biotin dextran amine. Subcortical projections could be traced within the forebrain to the putamen, caudate nucleus, claustrum, zona incerta, field H of Forel and a number of thalamic nuclei, with the heaviest projections to the nuclei ventralis lateralis, ventralis posteromedialis, including its parvocellular part, medialis dorsalis, centralis medialis, centrum medianum and reuniens. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep mesencephalic nucleus. In the lower brainstem, fibers terminated in the pontine and medullary reticular formation, locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract nucleus and facial nucleus. No projections were found to the nucl. ambiguus. The fact that monkeys, in contrast to humans, lack a direct connection of the motorcortex with the laryngeal motoneurons suggests that this connection has evolved in the last few million years and might represent one of the factors that made speech evolution possible.
12759718	Five somatostatin receptors (sst) have been cloned and mRNAs for the first four (sst1-4) are expressed in many brain regions. In the present work, we compared the distribution of the non-selective ligand [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 by autoradiography in 24 brain regions and pituitary in wild type, sst1- to sst4- or SRIF-gene invalidated (KO) mice. [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding was not significantly modified in sst1 KO mouse brain with the noticeable exception of the substantia nigra and only moderately decreased in pituitary. For sst2 KO mice, a general decrease (>75%) was observed in most regions, with the noticeable exception of the olfactory bulb and CA1 field of the hippocampus. SST3 KO brain displayed a decrease in binding in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb only (-54%). For sst4 KO mice, [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding levels in the external plexiform (-35%) and glomerular (-39%) layers of the olfactory bulb as well as the hippocampus CA1 field (-68%) were significantly decreased. In SRIF KO mice, a significant increase in binding levels was observed in olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal cortex upper layers, lateral septum, CA1 field, zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal grey and parabrachial nucleus. Competition with selective ligands (CH275, octreotide or L-779,976, L-796,778, L-803,087, and octreotide or L-817,778, for sst1-5 receptors, respectively) was in accordance with these findings. Moreover, octreotide was still able to compete on residual [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding sites in sst2 KO pituitary. It is concluded that most [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding sites in mouse brain and pituitary belong to the sst2 subtype but for the olfactory bulb (sst3 and sst4 receptors), the CA1 of the hippocampus (sst4 receptors) and the pituitary (sst5 and sst1 receptors) in which other subtypes are also expressed. The overall increase in [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding in SRIF KO mice indicates that SRIF receptors, mostly from the sst2 subtype, are regulated by the endogenous ligand(s).
12763039	Sulphite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is a molybdopterin-containing enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of sulphite to sulphate. Lack of active enzyme produces severe neurodegeneration and early death in humans, showing its essential role. Despite this, the expression of the sulphite oxidase gene in human and rat tissues (especially the brain) has not been elucidated. We therefore examined these tissues and found that the human liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, and brain showed substantial expression while thymus, spleen, peripheral blood leucocytes, colon, small intestine, and lung showed little expression in humans. In rat, the liver, kidney, heart, brain, and lung (but not skeletal muscle) revealed a hybridization signal with the strongest signal in the liver. The spleen and testis also showed little expression. The differential expression of sulphite oxidase gene in various human brain regions was studied. Expression was seen in all brain regions examined (cerebellum, cerebral cortex, medulla, spinal cord, occipital pole, frontal lobe, amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus, temporal lobe, and putamen). The cerebral cortex showed the highest level of expression.
12774318	Autoradiographic characterization of binding for brain kappa(1) ([(3)H]CI-977) and kappa(2) ([(3)H]bremazocine) in the presence of DAMGO ([D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin), DPDPE ([D-Pen(2), D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin), and U-69,593 opioid receptors, in the presence of different concentrations of a selective unlabeled kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), was performed in rats in which dependence on or withdrawal from butorphanol had been established. Dependence was induced by a 72 hr intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with butorphanol (26 nmol/microl/hr; butorphanol dependent). Butorphanol withdrawal was produced by terminating the infusion of butorphanol in dependent animals. Responses were studied 7 hr following termination (butorphanol withdrawal). IC(50) values from competition studies were estimated by fitting inhibition curves for both kappa(1)- and kappa(2)-opioid receptor assays. In both dependent and withdrawal groups, the IC(50) values obtained against [(3)H]CI-977 or [(3)H]bremazocine with nor-BNI were decreased (ratios of approximately 0.03-0.21 and approximately 0.05-0.42 vs. control, respectively) in brain regions, including frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, claustrum, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, caudate putamen, parietal cortex, posterior basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, hippocampus, posterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus, periaqueductal gray, substantia nigra, superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus, ventral tegmental area, and locus coeruleus, compared with control. These results indicate that, in butorphanol-dependent and butorphanol-withdrawal rats, the brain kappa(1)- and kappa(2)-opioid receptors developed a supersensitivity to antagonist binding.
12781731	Adult native Japanese speakers have difficulty perceiving the English /r-l/ phonetic contrast even after years of exposure. However, after extensive perceptual identification training, long-lasting improvement in identification performance can be attained. This fMRI study investigates localized changes in brain activity associated with 1 month of extensive feedback-based perceptual identification training by native Japanese speakers learning the English /r-l/ phonetic contrast. Before and after training, separate functional brain imaging sessions were conducted for identification of the English /r-l/ contrast (difficult for Japanese speakers), /b-g/ contrast (easy), and /b-v/ contrast (difficult), in which signal-correlated noise served as the reference control condition. Neural plasticity, denoted by exclusive enhancement in brain activity for the /r-l/ contrast, does not involve only reorganization in brain regions concerned with acoustic-phonetic processing (superior and medial temporal areas) but also the recruitment of additional bilateral cortical (supramarginal gyrus, planum temporale, Broca's area, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area) and subcortical regions (cerebellum, basal ganglia, substantia nigra) involved with auditory-articulatory (perceptual-motor) mappings related to verbal speech processing and learning. Contrary to what one may expect, brain activity for perception of a difficult contrast does not come to resemble that of an easy contrast as learning proceeds. Rather, the results support the hypothesis that improved identification performance may be due to the acquisition of auditory-articulatory mappings allowing for perception to be made in reference to potential action.
12798209	The nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) is a major site of brainstem control of vital functions (e.g., cardiovascular reflexes and respiration). We examined anatomic relationships of the human nucleus of the solitary tract, using a bidirectional lipophilic fluorescent tracer 1-1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) in 10 postmortem human fetal midgestational medullae oblongatae. Labeling by diffusion of DiI from the nucleus of the solitary tract included: (1) neuropil of all future subdivisions of the nucleus of the solitary tract ipsilateral to the DiI crystal; (2) stellate cells in the caudal raphe at the junction of the nucleus raphe pallidus and the arcuate nucleus at the ventral medullary surface, as well as single fibers along the caudal raphe and the arcuate nucleus; (3) cells and fibers in other medullary areas related to autonomic and respiratory control, including the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus ambiguus complex/ventral respiratory group, rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), and medullary reticular formation. The pattern of connections of the nucleus of the solitary tract already established by midgestation in the human fetus is consistent with the pattern previously demonstrated in adult experimental animals. A major finding of the study is that of the stellate cells at the junction of nucleus raphe pallidus and the arcuate nucleus at the ventral medullary surface, which project to the nucleus of the solitary tract, and could be homologous to chemosensitive serotonergic neurons at the midline ventral medullary surface of experimental animals. This connection between the ventral caudal raphe and the nucleus of the solitary tract may participate in chemoreception and central regulation of cardiorespiratory reflexes during human perinatal development; it is, therefore, relevant to the study of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
12805122	To elucidate cortical correlates of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) modulation, we observed cortical activation during fixation suppression and habituation of caloric vestibular nystagmus in 12 normal subjects, using PET. Significant positive correlation between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and slow phase eye velocity of caloric nystagmus was observed in the middle and posterior insula, inferior parietal lobule, temporal pole, right fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, and cerebellar vermis and hemisphere. The rCBF increase in the insular region and the inferior parietal lobule was lateralized depending on the direction of the nystagmus. Caloric nystagmus was suppressed as a result of visual fixation, during which time the area around the right frontal eye field, temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus, a broad area in the visual cortex, including fusiform and lingual gyrus, cerebellar uvula/nodulus and flocculus, exhibited positive correlation with fixation suppression of caloric nystagmus, while vestibular cortices exhibited negative correlation. The caloric nystagmus habituated with repetition of stimulation. With habituation, we observed activation in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, left superior parietal lobule and right cuneus, and deactivation in the anterior insula, cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and occipito-temporal visual cortex. The region that showed significant co-activation with fixation suppression and habituation of caloric nystagmus was the right cuneus, and significant co-deactivation was observed in the anterior insula, cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and middle temporal visual cortex. The present results support previous observations that the parieto-insular cortex and inferior parietal lobule are involved in processing of vestibular information, and, in addition, suggest that activation may depend on the direction of nystagmus. Deactivation of vestibular cortices during visual fixation supports the concept of inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction in the cortex. Significant activation of the cingulate, superior parietal and visual cortices, and cerebellar vermis accompanying reduction of caloric response with repeated stimuli suggests possible involvement of these regions in vestibular habituation. Common activation of the cuneus in visual cortex and deactivation of vestibular and visuo-spatial association cortices by both visual suppression and habituation of VOR suggests that these two mechanisms are not completely independent but may share some cortical and subcortical regions.
12823099	In this study, the myelinated axons of the rostrum, genu, truncus and splenium parts of the corpus callosum and of the anterior, posterior and habenular commissures were counted in the rat brain by using a camera lucida. The numerical densities of these axons were compared with each other by means of quantitative analytical statistical methods. In parts of the corpus callosum, a statistically significant difference was found between the rostrum and genu, rostrum and truncus, rostrum and the splenium, genu and truncus, and the genu and splenium. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the truncus and splenium. When comparing the number of myelinated axons of the anterior, posterior and habenular commissures, statistically significant differences were found between the anterior and posterior commissures, and between the anterior and habenular commissures. No statistically significant difference was found between the posterior and habenular commissures. Small sized myelinated axons were present in all parts of the corpus callosum and in the anterior commissure. However, a heterogeneous distribution of myelinated axons was present in the posterior and habenular commissures.
12828421	Estrogen receptor (ER)-beta is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and mediates various estrogenic actions. Changes in ER-alpha mRNA expression induced by estrogen have been well documented, whereas those with regard to ER-beta have only been reported for a part of the hypothalamus. In the present study, we examined the effect of estrogen on ER-beta mRNA expression in the female rat brain. Detection of ER-beta mRNA using the in situ hybridization method with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe was performed in two groups of female rats: ovariectomized (OVX) and estrogen (E2)-treated. A wide distribution of ER-beta mRNA-containing cells was demonstrated in both groups. In the E2-treated group compared with the OVX group, the number of ER-beta mRNA-containing cells was significantly reduced in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex, intermediate part of the lateral septal nucleus, nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, amygdala (lateral, medial and basolateral part), thalamus (anteroventral, laterodorsal and lateral posterior part), medial geniculate nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. These results reveal that ER-beta mRNA-containing cells were decreased by estrogen in several brain regions in the female rat brain, suggesting that ER-beta mRNA is downregulated by the physiological level of estrogen in a region-specific manner.
12836178	The basic organization of an exceptionally complex pattern of axonal projections from one distinct cell group of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, the rhomboid nucleus (BSTrh), was analyzed with the PHAL anterograde tract-tracing method in rats. Brain areas that receive a strong to moderate input from the BSTrh fall into nine general categories: central autonomic control network (central amygdalar nucleus, descending hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, parasubthalamic nucleus and dorsal lateral hypothalamic area, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus and caudal nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and salivatory nuclei), gustatory system (rostral nucleus of the solitary tract and medial parabrachial nucleus), neuroendocrine system (periventricular and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, hypothalamic visceromotor pattern generator network), orofaciopharyngeal motor control (rostral tip of the dorsal nucleus ambiguus, parvicellular reticular nucleus, retrorubral area, and lateral mesencephalic reticular nucleus), respiratory control (lateral nucleus of the solitary tract), locomotor or exploratory behavior control and reward prediction (nucleus accumbens, substantia innominata, and ventral tegmental area), ingestive behavior control (descending paraventricular nucleus and dorsal lateral hypothalamic area), thalamocortical feedback loops (medial-midline-intralaminar thalamus), and behavioral state control (dorsal raphé and locus coeruleus). Its pattern of axonal projections and its position in the basal telencephalon suggest that the BSTrh is part of a striatopallidal differentiation involved in modulating the expression of ingestive behaviors, although it may have other functions as well.
12849963	The present study describes the differential distributions in the brain of the two goldfish gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors, using both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization approaches. The goldfish GnRH GfA and GfB receptors are variant forms of the same receptor subtype, although with distinct differences in ligand binding characteristics, and differential distributions in the pituitary and body tissues [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 (1999) 2526]. The goldfish GnRH GfA receptor was found to be widespread throughout the brain, with neurons showing immunoreactivity in the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, preoptic region, ventro-basal hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, motor neurons of the fifth, seventh, and tenth cranial nerves, reticular formation, cerebellum, and motor zone of the vagal lobes. The tracts in the posterior commissure, optic tectum, and motor zone of the vagal lobes also demonstrated immunoreactivity. While the brain was not systematically surveyed for in situ hybridization, hybridization was found in similar locations in the telencephalon, preoptic region, ventro-basal hypothalamus, cerebellum, and optic tectum. Hybridization was additionally found in the medial hypothalamus. The goldfish GnRH GfB receptor was found to have a more restricted distribution in the brain, with neurons showing immunoreactivity in the telencephalon, preoptic region, and ventro-basal hypothalamus. In situ hybridization demonstrated a somewhat wider distribution of expression of the receptor, with hybridization occurring in the preoptic region, ventro-basal and medial hypothalamus, as well as in the thalamus, epithalamus, and optic tectum. The widespread distribution of GnRH GfA receptor, and in particular its localization in the midbrain tegmentum in the region of the GnRH-II neurons, suggests that this receptor may be involved in the behavioral actions of GnRH peptides in the goldfish.
12866129	The nucleus incertus is located caudal to the dorsal raphe and medial to the dorsal tegmentum. It is composed of a pars compacta and a pars dissipata and contains acetylcholinesterase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and cholecystokinin-positive somata. In the present study, anterograde tracer injections in the nucleus incertus resulted in terminal-like labeling in the perirhinal cortex and the dorsal endopyriform nucleus, the hippocampus, the medial septum diagonal band complex, lateral and triangular septum medial amygdala, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and the lateral habenula. The hypothalamus contained dense plexuses of fibers in the medial forebrain bundle that spread in nearly all nuclei. Labeling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus filled specifically the ventral half. In the midbrain, labeled fibers were observed in the interpeduncular nuclei, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, superior colliculus, pericentral inferior colliculus, pretectal area, the raphe nuclei, and the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis. Retrograde tracer injections were made in areas reached by anterogradely labeled fibers including the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, habenula, nucleus reuniens, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, and interpeduncular nuclei. All these injections gave rise to retrograde labeling in the nucleus incertus but not in the dorsal tegmental nucleus. These data led us to conclude that there is a system of ascending projections arising from the nucleus incertus to the median raphe, mammillary complex, hypothalamus, lateral habenula, nucleus reuniens, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, medial septum, and hippocampus. Many of the targets of the nucleus incertus were involved in arousal mechanisms including the synchronization and desynchronization of the theta rhythm.
12867599	There is only limited morphologic information on long-term alterations and neurotransmitter changes after perinatal asphyxia, and no long-term study showing neurodegeneration has been reported so far. We used an animal model for perinatal asphyxia well documented in the rat to investigate the guinea pig as a species highly mature at birth. Cesarean section was performed on full-term pregnant guinea pigs, and pups, still in membranes, were placed into a water bath at 37 degrees C for asphyxia periods from 2 to 4 min. Thereafter pups were given to surrogate mothers and examined at 3 mo of age. We studied brain areas reported to be hypoxia-sensitive. Neurodegeneration was evaluated by fluoro-jade, neuronal loss by Nissl, reactive gliosis by glial fibrillary acidic protein staining, and differentiation by neuroendocrine-specific protein C immunoreactivity. We tested tyrosine hydroxylase, the vesicular monoamine transporter, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase, representing the monoaminergic system; the vesicular acetylcholine transporter; and the excitatory amino acid carrier 1. Neurodegeneration was evident in cerebellum, hippocampal area CA1, and hypothalamus, and neuronal loss could be observed in cerebellum and hypothalamus; gliosis was observed in cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and parietal cortex; dedifferentiation was found in hypothalamus and striatum; and monoaminergic, cholinergic, and amino acidergic deficits were shown in several brain regions. The major finding of the present study was that neurodegeneration and dedifferentiation evolved in the guinea pig, a species highly mature at birth. The relevance of this contribution is that a simple animal model of perinatal asphyxia resembling the clinical situation of intrauterine hypoxia-ischemia and presenting with neurodegeneration was characterized.
12895509	Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. Its highly diverse biological activities are mediated via the G protein-coupled receptor that uniquely requires two accessory proteins for optimal function. CGRP receptor component protein (RCP) is a coupling protein necessary for CGRP-receptor signaling. In this study, we established the anatomical distribution of RCP in the rat central and peripheral nervous system and its relationship to CGRP immunoreactivity. RCP-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya are widely and selectively distributed in the cerebral cortex, septal nuclei, hippocampus, various hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, nucleus colliculus, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, cochlear nuclei, dorsal raphe nuclei, the solitary tractus nucleus and gracile nucleus, cerebellar cortex, various brainstem motor nuclei, the spinal dorsal and ventral horns. A sub-population of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia were strongly RCP-IR. Overall, the localization of RCP-IR closely matched with that of CGRP-IR. We also determined whether RCP in DRG and dorsal horn neurons can be modulated by CGRP receptor blockade and pain-related pathological stimuli. The intrathecal injection of the antagonist CGRP(8-37) markedly increased RCP expression in the lumbar DRG and spinal dorsal horn. Carrageenan-induced plantar inflammation produced a dramatic bilateral increase in RCP expression in the dorsal horn while a partial sciatic nerve ligation reduced RCP expression in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn. Our data suggest that the distribution of RCP immunoreactivity is closely matched with CGRP immunoreactivity in most of central and peripheral nervous systems. The co-localization of RCP and CGRP in motoneurons and primary sensory neurons suggests that CGRP has an autocrine or paracrine effect on these neurons. Moreover, our data also suggest that RCP expression in DRG and spinal cord can be modulated during CGRP receptor blockade, inflammation or neuropathic pain and this CGRP receptor-associated protein is dynamically regulated.
12915251	RFamide related peptides (RFRP)-1 and RFRP-3 are neuropeptides derived from the same preproprotein. We have examined the distribution of RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 immunoreactivities (irs) in the rat central nervous system using specific antibodies. Neuronal cell bodies containing both RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 were detected within the caudal portion of the hypothalamus, the periventricular nucleus (PerVN), and the portion around or above the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Both immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses showed that neurons containing RFRP immunoreactivity and mRNA were distinct from those of neuropeptide FF, which contains the same structure at the C-terminus, Pro-Glu-Arg-Phe-NH2, as RFRP-3. Fibers containing both RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 were widely distributed in the brain: the lateral septal nucleus in the telencephalon, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, various hypothalamic nuclei, the periaqueductal gray in the midbrain, the parabrachial nucleus in the pons, and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla oblongata. Only RFRP-1-ir was detected within the posterior gray horn in the spinal cord. Only RFRP-3-ir was detected in several thalamic nuclei and the spinal cord, especially at the posterior intermediate sulcus and within the anterior gray horn. Intracerebroventricular administration of RFRPs induced c-Fos expression in the anterior portion of the NTS, locus coeruleus, the nucleus of incertus, supraoptic nucleus, PerVN and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These results show that RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 are widely distributed in the rat central nervous system and might be involved in various functions such as the neuroendocrine system or pain modulation.
12949786	The development of galanin-like immunoreactive (GAL-ir) cells and fibers was investigated in the brain of brown trout embryos, alevins, juveniles, and adults (some spontaneously releasing their gametes). The earliest GAL-ir neurons appeared in the preoptic region and the primordial hypothalamic lobe of 12-mm embryos. After hatching, new GAL-ir neurons appeared in the lateral, anterior, and posterior tuberal nuclei, and in late alevins, GAL-ir neurons appeared in the area postrema. In juveniles, further GAL-ir populations appeared in the nucleus subglomerulosus and magnocellular preoptic nucleus. The GAL-ir neuronal groups present in juveniles were also observed in sexually mature adults, although the area postrema of males lacked immunoreactive neurons. Moreover, spawning males exhibited GAL-ir somata in the olfactory bulb and habenula, which were never observed in adult females or in developing stages. In adults, numerous GAL-ir fibers were observed in the ventral telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, neurohypophysis, mesencephalic tegmentum, ventral rhombencephalon, and area postrema. Moderate to low GAL-ir innervation was seen in the olfactory bulbs, dorsomedial telencephalon, epithalamus, medial thalamus, optic tectum, cerebellum, and rhombencephalic alar plate. There were large differences among regions in the GAL-ir innervation establishment time. In embryos, GAL-ir fibers appeared in the preoptic area and hypothalamus, indicating early expression of galanin in hypophysiotrophic centers. The presence of galanin immunoreactivity in the olfactory, reproductive, visual, and sensory-motor centers of the brain suggest that galanin is involved in many other brain functions. Furthermore, the distribution of GAL-ir elements observed throughout trout development indicates that galaninergic system maturation continues until sexual maturity.
14381438	For the purpose of studying the hematoencephalic barrier as it is concerned with silver circulating in the blood stream, silver nitrate was vitally administered to rats in their drinking water over periods of 6 to 8 months. The cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla, area postrema, and choroid plexus were prepared for light and electron microscopy. Silver deposition was found in the perivascular spaces in the choroid plexus, area postrema, in the medulla surrounding the area postrema, and in minute quantities in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and most of the medulla. Two levels of the hematoencephalic barrier were apparently demonstrated in our investigations. The endothelial linings of the vessels in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla constitute the first threshold of the hematoencephalic barrier (specifically here, blood-brain barrier). The cell membranes adjacent to the perivascular spaces form the second threshold, as follows:-the neuroglial cell membranes in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla (blood-brain barrier); the membranes of the neuroglial cells in the area postrema (blood-brain barrier); and the membranes of the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier). This study deals with silver deposition and does not infer that the penetration of ionic silver, if present in the blood stream, would necessarily be limited to the regions described. Bleb-like structures were observed to cover the epithelial cell surfaces in the choroid plexus. They may be cellular projections increasing the cell surface area or they may be secretory droplets.
14514034	1. The aim of this study was to determine whether central networks are involved in the presumptive behavioral and autonomic regulatory actions of secretin, a gut hormone that has been reported to have ameliorative effects in autistic children. 2. Central neural responses monitored by regional c-fos gene expression were examined in response to intracerebroventricular secretin injection in awake, freely-moving Sprague-Dawley rats. Tissue sections were incubated in an antibody to the c-fos gene product, Fos, and processed immunohistochemically. 3. Qualitative differences in Fos immunoreactivity in stress adaptation and visceral representation areas of the brain were observed between secretin- and vehicle-infused age-matched pairs (n = 4 pairs). Secretin-activated regions include the area postrema, dorsal motor nucleus, medial region of the nucleus of the solitary tract and its relay station in the lateral tegmentum, locus ceruleus, ventral periaqueductal gray, periventricular thalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamus magnocellularis, medial and central amygdala, lateral septal complex as well as ependymal and subependymal nuclei lining the third ventricle. Specific areas of the cerebral cortex were heavily labeled in secretin-treated rats, as compared to controls: the medial bank of the anterior prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, the piriform cortex. and the anterior olfactory nucleus. Secretin attenuated Fos immunoreactivity in the dorsal periaqueductal gray, intralaminar thalamus, medial parvicellular compartment of the hypothalamus, supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, lateral amygdala, motor cortex, and the somatosensory and association areas of the parietal cortex. 4. Secretin alters the activity of structures involved in behavioral conditioning of stress adaptation and visceral reflex reactions. This study predicts a possible cellular mechanism, activation of third ventricular ependymal and subependymal cells, as well as central regulatory actions of secretin. The physiological effects of secretin on behavioral, endocrine, autonomic and sensory neuronal activation patterns, together, contribute to central c-fos activation. Secretin alters the activity of structures involved in behavioral conditioning of stress adaptation and visceral reflex reactions. This study predicts a possible cellular mechanism, activation of third ventricular ependymal and subependymal cells, and central regulatory actions of secretin. The physiological effects of secretin on behavioral, endocrine, autonomic and sensory neuronal activation patterns, together, contribute to central c-fos activation. These findings mandate further investigation of secretin as a brain/gut stress regulatory hormone.
14523628	An anxiogenic or a pharmacological stressor, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally injected) induced a dense nuclear c-Fos-like immunoreactivity in the pyriform cortex, cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, layers II-VI of the neocortex, lateral habenula, lateral septum, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, striatum, central and medial nucleus of the amygdala, but a sparse c-Fos immunostaining in the hippocampus and layer I of the neocortex in the forebrain of 56-day-old rats. Among these regions, the 8-day-old rats expressed much fewer c-Fos-positive cells in the neocortex, lateral habenula, lateral septum and medial nucleus of the amygdala than the young adult rats following the FG-7142 injection. These differences in the regional distribution of a neuronal activity marker, c-Fos, could reflect the postnatal development of neuronal populations or neuron circuits involved in stress and/or emotional response in the forebrain.
14578860	Changes are shown in the spin-lattice (T1) relaxation time caused by the putative deposition of manganese in various brain regions of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) patients using a novel and fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for quantitative relaxation time mapping. A new method, T1 mapping with partial inversion recovery (TAPIR), was used to obtain a series of T1-weighted images to produce T1 maps. Imaging of 15 control subjects and 11 patients was performed on a 1.5T MRI scanner. The measurement time per patient with this technique, including adjustments, was approximately 5 minutes. Regions of interest in the globus pallidus, the caudate nucleus, the posterior and anterior limbs of the internal capsule, the putamen, the frontal and occipital white matter, the white matter of the corona radiata, the occipital visual and frontal cortices, and the thalamus were interactively defined in the left hemisphere and analyzed with respect to their T1 values. T1 changes in the brains of HE patients can be determined quantitatively with TAPIR in short, clinically relevant measurement times. Significant correlations between the change in T1 and HE severity have been shown in the globus pallidus, the caudate nucleus, and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. No significant correlation of T1 with grade of HE was found in the putamen, frontal white matter, white matter of the corona radiata, white matter in the occipital lobe, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, visual cortex, thalamus, or frontal cortex. In conclusion, these measurements show that T1 mapping is feasible in short, clinically relevant acquisition times.
14579424	The medial prefrontal cortex has been associated with diverse functions including attentional processes, visceromotor activity, decision-making, goal-directed behavior, and working memory. The present report compares and contrasts projections from the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. With the exception of common projections to parts of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, olfactory forebrain, and midline thalamus, PL and IL distribute very differently throughout the brain. Main projection sites of IL are: 1) the lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial and lateral preoptic nuclei, substantia innominata, and endopiriform nuclei of the basal forebrain; 2) the medial, basomedial, central, and cortical nuclei of amygdala; 3) the dorsomedial, lateral, perifornical, posterior, and supramammillary nuclei of hypothalamus; and 4) the parabrachial and solitary nuclei of the brainstem. By contrast, PL projects at best sparingly to each of these structures. Main projection sites of PL are: the agranular insular cortex, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, the paraventricular, mediodorsal, and reuniens nuclei of thalamus, the capsular part of the central nucleus and the basolateral nucleus of amygdala, and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the brainstem. As discussed herein, the pattern of IL projections is consistent with a role for IL in the control of visceral/autonomic activity homologous to the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex of primates, whereas those of PL are consistent with a role for PL in limbic-cognitive functions homologous to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of primates.
14580956	Changes in kappa-opioid receptor levels have been implicated in the development of physical dependence upon and withdrawal from the mixed agonist-antagonist opioid, butorphanol. Immunoblotting analysis was performed to determine the levels of kappa- and mu-opioid receptors in brain regions of rats in withdrawal from dependence upon butorphanol or morphine. Physical dependence was induced by a 72 h i.c.v. infusion with either butorphanol or morphine (26 nmol/microl/h). Withdrawal was subsequently precipitated by i.c.v. challenge with naloxone (48 nmol/5 microl/rat), administered 2 h following cessation of butorphanol or morphine infusion. Immunoblotting analysis of kappa-opioid receptors from butorphanol-withdrawal rats showed significant increases in 11 of 21 brain regions examined, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, dorsomedial hypothalamus, hypothalamus, paraventricular thalamus, thalamus, presubiculum, and locus coeruleus, when compared with saline treated, non-dependent controls. In addition, significant reductions were found in the hippocampus and in cortical brain regions, including the parietal cortex and temporal cortex from butorphanol-withdrawal rats. These findings contrasted with those from morphine-withdrawal rats, in which the only changes noted were increases in the thalamus and paraventricular thalamus. Changes in the levels of the mu-opioid receptor protein were observed in 11 of 21 brain regions examined in morphine-withdrawal rats, but only in three of 21 in butorphanol-withdrawal rats. These results implicate a substantive and largely unique role for kappa-opioid receptors in mediation of the development of physical dependence upon, and the expression of withdrawal from, butorphanol, as opposed to the prototypical opioid analgesic, morphine.
14600155	The new member of the mammalian amino acid/auxin permease family, PAT2, has been cloned recently and represents an electrogenic proton/amino acid symporter. PAT2 and its paralog, PAT1/LYAAT-1, are transporters for small amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and proline. Our immunodetection studies revealed that the PAT2 protein is expressed in spinal cord and brain. It is found in neuronal cell bodies in the anterior horn in spinal cord and in brain stem, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, rhinencephalon, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb in the brain. PAT2 is expressed in neurons positive for the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype glutamate receptor subunit NR1. PAT2 is not found in lysosomes, unlike its paralog PAT1, but is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and recycling endosomes in neurons. PAT2 has a high external proton affinity causing half-maximal transport activation already at a pH of 8.3, suggesting that its activity is most likely not altered by physiological pH changes. Transport of amino acids by PAT2 activity is dependent on membrane potential and can occur bidirectionally; membrane depolarization causes net glycine outward currents. Our data suggest that PAT2 contributes to neuronal transport and sequestration of amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and/or proline, whereby the transport direction is dependent on the sum of the driving forces such as substrate concentration, pH gradient, and membrane potential.
14611726	Hyperglycemia and acidosis are the hallmark of diabetes. Since these factors play an important role in the diabetic complications, we have studied the brain catecholamine levels in hyperglycemic and acidotic conditions per se. Experimentally induced hyperglycemia and acidosis are accompanied by significant alterations in the catecholamine levels in discrete areas of the brain. We and others have shown that chronic or acute diabetes in animals as well as in human results in altered neurotransmitter levels. In the present study, hyperglycemia maintained by daily external administration of glucose for thirty days showed increased level of dopamine in striatum and hippocampus, elevation of norepinephrine in hippocampus, and increased level of epinephrine in hypothalamus, midbrain and pons medulla. The ammonium chloride induced acidosis demonstrated significant elevation of dopamine in midbrain and significant increase of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and midbrain, and increased level of epinephrine in hypothalamus, pons medulla and cerebral cortex. On the other hand, sodium acetoacetate induced acidosis did not show any significant change in the level of catecholamines in any of the areas studied. In conclusion, the changes in catecholamine levels observed in experimentally induced hyperglycemic as well as in acidotic conditions are closely related to the changes observed in spontaneous or alloxan or streptozotocin diabetic animals, thereby suggesting that these conditions may be responsible for the changes observed in diabetic animals.
14622183	A polyclonal antibody against the Na+-independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (asc-1) was raised and the specificity of the antibody verified by Western blots performed on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the cloned murine asc-1. The antibody was then used to localize the transporter in the brain of two rodent species by using immunohistochemistry at the light and electron microscopical level. asc-1-immunoreactivity (asc-1-ir) was widely distributed throughout the mouse and rat brain. Areas with high levels of asc-1-ir included hypothalamus, the medial septal area, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Moderate asc-1-ir was observed in several areas including layers III and V of the neocortex, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, all amygdaloid nuclei, hippocampus (CA1-CA3 and hilus of the dentate gyrus), as well as several brainstem nuclei. asc-1-ir was observed as punctuate staining consistent with varicosities matching neuronal cell bodies and dendritic fields. At the ultrastructural level, asc-1-ir was mainly confined to presynaptic terminals. Immunostaining in either glial cell bodies or perivascular sites was not observed and white matter was completely devoid of asc-1-ir. Furthermore, the pharmacology of the Na+-independent uptake site for [3H]d-serine in rat brain synaptosomal P2 fractions was compared with the substrate specificity of the cloned human asc-1 transporter and a high degree of correlation was demonstrated. We conclude that asc-1-ir is widespread in the brain and limited to neuronal structures and that asc-1 may contribute to synaptic clearance of d-serine in brain.
14625376	Immunoreactive renin has been reported in the hypothalamus and cerebellar cortex in the rodent brain and in neurons in all areas of the human brain. Despite these observations and the clear documentation of the expression of the other renin-angiotensin system genes in the brain, the notion that renin is endogenously expressed in the brain remains very controversial and undefined. This controversy no doubt arises because the level of renin expression in the brain is below the detection threshold of most standard assays. A transgenic mouse expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) under the control of the mouse renin promoter was recently reported. This model expresses eGFP in the kidney, which responds appropriately to both developmental and physiological stimuli. We therefore used eGFP as a sensitive marker to identify renin-expressing cells in the brain. We identified eGFP-containing cells in specific areas of the brain, including cerebellum, hippocampus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, inferior olivary nucleus, reticular formation, rostral ventrolateral medulla, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral parabrachial nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and subfornical organ. By colabeling with neuron- or glia (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes)-specific antisera, we have determined the eGFP-positive cells to be mainly neuronal. These findings therefore strongly support the primary expression of renin mRNA in the brain in regions controlling cardiovascular function.
14643775	Accumulating evidence suggests that tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) may be the endogenous ligand of the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor. The vast majority of TIP39-containing neurons are localized in two regions, the subparafascicular area at the thalamic-midbrain junction, and the medial paralemniscal nucleus in the rostral pons. In contrast to the restricted localization of TIP39-containing cell bodies, TIP39-containing fibers have a widespread distribution. TIP39 neurons were lesioned electrolytically to determine the origin of TIP39-containing fibers within different parts of the rat CNS. Following bilateral lesions of the medial subparafascicular area including the subparafascicular nucleus, TIP39-immunoreactive fibers almost completely disappeared from forebrain regions including the anterior limbic cortical areas, the shell and cone portions of the nucleus accumbens, the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the amygdaloid nuclei, the fundus striati, the subiculum, the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, and the hypothalamic paraventricular, dorsomedial and arcuate nuclei. Unilateral lesions of the medial and the lateral subparafascicular area demonstrated that the projections are ipsilateral and that medial lesions produce higher reductions in the density of TIP39 fibers except in the amygdala and the hypothalamus. Following lesions of the medial paralemniscal nucleus, TIP39-immunoreactive fibers disappeared from the medial geniculate body, the periaqueductal gray, the deep layers of the superior colliculus, the external cortex of the inferior colliculus, the cuneiform nucleus, the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the locus coeruleus, the subcoeruleus area, the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, the periolivary nuclei, and the spinal cord, suggesting that these regions receive TIP39-containing fibers from the medial paralemniscal nucleus, and unilateral lesions demonstrated that the projections are ipsilateral. The projections of the TIP39-containing cells in the subparafascicular area suggest their involvement in limbic and endocrine functions, while the projections of the TIP39-containing cells in the medial paralemniscal nucleus suggest their involvement in auditory and nociceptive functions.
14644322	Neurodegenerative diseases of the human brain comprise a variety of disorders that affect an increasing percentage of the population. Some of these are age dependent (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) and some are infection dependent, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS). The vulnerable brain regions in HIV/AIDS individuals include the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, the red nucleus, substantia nigra (SN) in the mid-brain, the subthalamic nucleus, thalamic fasciculus in the diencephalons, the globus pallidus and striatum (or neostriatum, which consists of caudate and putamen) in the forebrain. Lesion in these regions may lead to progressive dementia, which is similar to what is observed in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The entry of calcium into the cytoplasm of cells at concentrations that can activate oxidative enzymes such as phospholipase A(2) and xanthine oxidase, deplete cells of cysteine and glutathione, cause mitochondrial release of free radicals and cell death. Glutamate and its receptors are key molecular elements at the interface between neurons and glia. Dietary factors can modulate physiological functions (including brain function) thereby increasing the economic productivity of a population as a function of health. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection, oxidative stress and immune function will facilitate definition of the prophylactic potentials of diet, nutritional/food supplements, medicinal plants and herbal extracts.
14648685	The anterolateral group of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BSTalg) contains four distinct cell groups embedded within an undifferentiated anterolateral area (BSTal) that architectonically resembles a subjacent subcommissural zone (BSTsc). The overall distributions of axonal projections from various regions of the BSTal and from the BSTsc were determined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHAL) anterograde tracer method and found to be identical. The BSTal and BSTsc share dense bidirectional connections, and also project heavily within the BST to the rhomboid and fusiform nuclei and the anteroventral and anterodorsal areas. They project less densely to the juxtacapsular, oval, magnocellular, ventral, and interfascicular BST nuclei. Outside the BST, brain areas receiving strong to moderate inputs from the BSTal and BSTsc fall into several functional groups: somatomotor system (nucleus accumbens, substantia innominata, ventral tegmental area, and retrorubral area and adjacent midbrain reticular nucleus), central autonomic control system (central amygdalar nucleus, dorsal lateral hypothalamic area, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract), neuroendocrine system (paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, hypothalamic visceromotor pattern generator network), and thalamocortical feedback loops (midline, medial, and intralaminar nuclei). The results indicate that the BSTal and BSTsc are parts of the same cell group (dorsal and ventral to the anterior commissure), which plays a role in coordinating visceral and somatic motor responses (during ingestive behaviors, for example), especially in response to noxious stimuli (learned anorexia associated with noxious stimuli). BSTal projections are distinct from those of the adjacent juxtacapsular, oval, fusiform, and rhomboid nuclei.
14729135	The raphe nuclei are distributed near the midline of the brainstem along its entire rostro-caudal extension. The serotonergic neurons are their main neuronal components, although a proportion of them lie in subdivisions of the lateral reticular formation. They develop from mesopontine and medullary primordia, and the resulting grouping into rostral and caudal clusters is maintained into adulthood, and is reflected in the connectivity. Thus, the mesencephalon and rostral pons, neurons within the rostral raphe complex (caudal linear, dorsal raphe, and median raphe nuclei) project primarily to the forebrain. By contrast, in the caudal pons and medulla oblongata, neurons within the caudal raphe complex (raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus nuclei and parts of the adjacent lateral reticular formation) project to the brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord. The median raphe and dorsal raphe nuclei provide parallel and overlapping projections to many forebrain structures with axon fibers exhibiting distinct structural and functional characteristics. The caudal group of the serotonergic system projects to the brainstem, and, by three parallel projections, to the dorsal, intermediate and ventral columns in the spinal cord. The serotonergic axons arborize over large areas comprising functionally diverse targets. Some projections form classical chemical synapses while many do not, thus contributing to the so-called paracrine or volume transmission. The serotonergic projections participate in the regulation of different functional (motor, somatosensory, limbic) systems; and have been associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Finally, recent experimental data support the role of serotonin in modulating brain development, such that a dysfunction in serotonergic transmission during early life could lead to long lasting structural and functional alterations.
14730592	Small iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were placed in different subregions of the septum of domestic chicks. The main targets of septal projections comprised the ipsi- and contralateral septal nuclei, including the nucleus of the diagonal band, basal ganglia, including the ventral paleostriatum, lobus parolfactorius, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle, archistriatum, piriform cortex, and anterior neostriatum. Further diencephalic and mesencephalic septal projections were observed in the ipsilateral preoptic region, hypothalamus (the main regions of afferentation comprising the lateral hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial, paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, and the mammillary region), dorsal thalamus, medial habenular and subhabenular nuclei, midbrain central gray, and ventral tegmental area. Contralateral projections were also encountered in the septal nuclei, ventral paleostriatum, periventricular and anteromedial hypothalamic nuclei, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the lateral hypothalamic area. Avian septal efferents are largely similar to those of mammals, the main differences being a relatively modest hippocampal projection arising mainly from the nucleus of the diagonal band (as confirmed by a specific experiment with the retrograde pathway tracer True blue), the lack of interpeduncular projection, and a greater contingent of amygdalar efferents arising from the lateral septum rather than the nucleus of the diagonal band. This pattern of connectivity is likely to reflect an important role of the avian septal nuclei in the coordination of limbic circuits and the integration of a wide variety of information sources modulating the appropriate behavioral responses: attention and arousal level, memory formation, hormonally mediated behaviors, and their affective components (such as ingestive, reproductive, and parental behaviors), social interaction, locomotor modulation, and circadian rhythm.
14764919	Umbilical cord occlusion (UCO), a known risk factor for perinatal brain damage, causes severe fetal asphyxia leading to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. We have determined the effects of two 10-min UCO on the distribution of the lipid peroxidation marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and the activated form of the apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the brains of late-gestation fetal sheep. UCO caused asphyxia, hypertension, and bradycardia, but these parameters normalized 2 h after the occlusion. At postmortem, 48 h after the second UCO there were significantly higher numbers of 4-HNE-positive cells in all layers of the hippocampus and cerebellum, the parietal cortex, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus compared with control brains. 4-HNE immunoreactivity was also found in white matter tracts of the subcallosal bundle, external medullary lamina, reticular thalamic nucleus, and cerebellar fiber tracts only in UCO brains. Double-labeling identified these cells as predominantly neurons and astrocytes, with oligodendrocytes showing lower levels of 4-HNE immunoreactivity. After UCO, the number of caspase-3-immunopositive cells was increased significantly in the hippocampal CA1, molecular layer and dentate gyrus, ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, putamen, and cerebellar granular and molecular layers compared with controls. Double-labeling revealed caspase-3 immunoreactivity was mainly in neurons, and to lesser extent in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Pyknotic cell numbers were significantly increased in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, parietal cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and cerebellar Purkinje cells after UCO. These data indicate that brief asphyxia induces widespread lipid peroxidation involving all cell types of the fetal brain and apoptosis in both neurons and glia.
14960334	DISC1 (Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1) has been associated with schizophrenia in multiple genetic studies. Studies from our laboratory have shown that Disc1, the mouse ortholog of DISC1, is highly expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the adult mouse brain. Because developmental dysfunction of the hippocampus is thought to play a major role in schizophrenia pathogenesis, and the dentate gyrus is a major locus for adult neurogenesis in the mouse, we investigated Disc1 expression during mouse brain development. Strikingly, Disc1 is strongly expressed in the hippocampus during all stages of hippocampal development, from embryonic day 14 through adulthood. Disc1 mRNA was detected in the dentate gyrus at all stages in which this structure was identifiable, as well as in the cornu ammonis (CA) fields of the hippocampus, the subiculum and adjacent entorhinal cortex, and the developing cerebral neocortex, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulbs, all of which also express Disc1 in the adult mouse brain. In addition, Disc1 mRNA was seen in regions of the developing mouse brain which do not express Disc1 during adulthood, regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, reticular thalamic nucleus and reuniens thalamic nucleus. These results demonstrate that Disc1 marks the hippocampus from its earliest stages, and suggest that developmental Disc1 dysfunction may lead to defects in hippocampal function that are associated with schizophrenia.
14960499	Pain catastrophizing, or characterizations of pain as awful, horrible and unbearable, is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the experience of pain. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between catastrophizing, as measured by the Coping Strategies Questionnaire Catastrophizing Subscale, and brain responses to blunt pressure assessed by functional MRI among 29 subjects with fibromyalgia. Since catastrophizing has been suggested to augment pain perception through enhanced attention to painful stimuli, and heightened emotional responses to pain, we hypothesized that catastrophizing would be positively associated with activation in structures believed to be involved in these aspects of pain processing. As catastrophizing is also strongly associated with depression, the influence of depressive symptomatology was statistically removed. Residual scores of catastrophizing controlling for depressive symptomatology were significantly associated with increased activity in the ipsilateral claustrum (r = 0.51, P < 0.05), cerebellum (r = 0.43, P < 0.05), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r = 0.47, P < 0.05), and parietal cortex (r = 0.41, P < 0.05), and in the contralateral dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC; r = 0.43, P < 0.05), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r = 0.41, P < 0.05), medial frontal cortex (r = 0.40, P < 0.05) and lentiform nuclei (r = 0.40, P < 0.05). Analysis of subjects classified as high or low catastrophizers, based on a median split of residual catastrophizing scores, showed that both groups displayed significant increases in ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), although the magnitude of activation was twice as large among high catastrophizers. Both groups also had significant activations in contralateral insula, SII, primary somatosensory cortex (SI), inferior parietal lobule and thalamus. High catastrophizers displayed unique activation in the contralateral anterior ACC, and the contralateral and ipsilateral lentiform. Both groups also displayed significant ipsilateral activation in SI, anterior and posterior cerebellum, posterior cingulate gyrus, and superior and inferior frontal gyrus. These findings suggest that pain catastrophizing, independent of the influence of depression, is significantly associated with increased activity in brain areas related to anticipation of pain (medial frontal cortex, cerebellum), attention to pain (dorsal ACC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), emotional aspects of pain (claustrum, closely connected to amygdala) and motor control. These results support the hypothesis that catastrophizing influences pain perception through altering attention and anticipation, and heightening emotional responses to pain. Activation associated with catastrophizing in motor areas of the brain may reflect expressive responses to pain that are associated with greater pain catastrophizing.
14985261	Ageing in Down's syndrome is accompanied by amyloid and neurofibrillary pathology the distribution of which replicates pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. With advancing age, an increasing proportion of Down's syndrome subjects >40 years old develop progressive cognitive impairment, resembling the cognitive profile of Alzheimer's disease. Based on these findings, Down's syndrome has been proposed as a model to study the predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Using an interactive anatomical segmentation technique and volume-of-interest measurements of MRI, we showed recently that non-demented Down's syndrome adults had significantly reduced hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and corpus callosum sizes with increasing age. In this study, we applied the automated and objective technique of voxel-based morphometry, implemented in SPM99, to the analysis of structural MRI from 27 non-demented Down's syndrome adults (mean age 41.1 years, 15 female). Regional grey matter volume was decreased with advancing age in bilateral parietal cortex (mainly the precuneus and inferior parietal lobule), bilateral frontal cortex with left side predominance (mainly middle frontal gyrus), left occipital cortex (mainly lingual cortex), right precentral and left postcentral gyrus, left transverse temporal gyrus, and right parahippocampal gyrus. The reductions were unrelated to gender, intracranial volume or general cognitive function. Grey matter volume was relatively preserved in subcortical nuclei, periventricular regions, the basal surface of the brain (bilateral orbitofrontal and anterior temporal) and the anterior cingulate gyrus. Our findings suggest grey matter reductions in allocortex and association neocortex in the predementia stage of Down's syndrome. The most likely substrate of these changes is alterations or loss of allocortical and neocortical neurons due to Alzheimer's disease-type pathology.
15028771	Previous studies demonstrated that strain H129 of herpes simplex virus-1 undergoes anterograde transneuronal transport in mice and primates after peripheral or central injection. In this study, H129 was used in rats to identify CNS regions that receive relayed viscero-sensory inputs from the stomach wall. We also examined whether transneuronal viral transport in this model is exclusively anterograde. H129 or an established retrograde transneuronal viral tracer, pseudorabies virus (PRV), was injected into the ventral stomach wall in intact rats or in rats with previous subdiaphragmatic vagal sensory deafferentation. Rats were perfused with fixative 3-5 d later, and tissues were processed for immunocytochemical detection of transported virus. In intact rats, H129 was transported transneuronally via vagal and spinal viscerosensory neurons to postsynaptic target cells in the medullary dorsal vagal complex and thoracic dorsal horn, respectively, with subsequent transport to discrete regions of the medullary and pontine reticular formation, cerebellum, parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and other central sites. Comparison of labeling patterns in intact and vagal deafferented rats indicated that H129 also produced first-order retrograde infection of autonomic neurons that project directly to virus injection sites, similar to PRV. Unlike PRV, however, H129 was not transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction from infected neurons to central sources of presynaptic input. We conclude that transneuronal transport of H129 occurs exclusively in the anterograde direction to reveal CNS regions that receive direct and relayed viscerosensory signals.
15068010	The consumption by women of cannabis derivatives during pregnancy and/or lactation affects the development of their offspring because like other psychoactive drugs, cannabinoids, the psychoactive ingredients of marijuana, can cross the placental barrier and be secreted into the maternal milk. Through this way, cannabinoids are able to affect the expression of key genes for neural developmental leading to neurotransmitter and behavioral disturbances. In this present study, we wanted to explore the influence of prenatal cannabinoid exposure on the gene expression of a key protein for brain development, the neural adhesion molecule L1, which plays an important role in processes of cell proliferation and migration, neuritic elongation and guidance, and synaptogenesis. To this end, pregnant rats were daily treated with delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) since the 5th day of gestation up to the day before birth (GD21), day at which rats were killed and their pups removed for analysis of L1-mRNA levels in different brain structures. Our results confirmed that the levels of L1 transcripts were significantly increased after prenatal delta9-THC exposure in several regions such as the fimbria, stria terminalis, stria medullaris and corpus callosum, which share the properties of being white matter regions and containing, exclusively during development, an abundant population of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, the major targets for the action of plant-derived cannabinoids. L1-mRNA levels were also increased in grey matter structures such as the septum nuclei and the habenula, but remained unchanged in most of the grey matter structures analyzed (cerebral cortex, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampus, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, basal ganglia and subventricular zones) and also in a few white matter structures (fornix and fasciculus retroflexus). An important aspect of these observations is that the increase in L1-mRNA levels reached statistical significance only in the case of delta9-THC-exposed males but not in the case of delta9-THC-exposed females where only trends or no effects were detected, this supporting previous evidence on a sexual dimorphism, with greater effects in male fetuses, for the action of cannabinoids in the developing brain. In summary, cannabinoids seem to influence the expression of L1 in specific brain structures during the prenatal period, which, considering the role played by this protein in different events related to neural development, might explain the neurotransmitter and behavioral disturbances reported after prenatal consumption of marijuana.
15068172	The present report concerns an autopsy case of CJD showing typical clinical features of CJD. The patient was a Japanese woman without hereditary burden or dementing disorder anamnesis who was 70-years-old at the time of death. She developed gait disturbance at age 68, followed by memory impairment, visual disturbance, and myoclonus. A neurological examination approximately 2 months after the disease onset revealed akinetic mutism, in addition to periodic synchronous discharges on electroencephalogram. Serial neuroradiological examinations disclosed progressive atrophy of the brain. She died of bronchopneumonia 25 months after the disease onset. The brain weighed 560 g (cerebrum 490 g, brainstem with cerebellum 70 g). Macroscopically, neuropathological examination showed prominent atrophy of the cerebrum, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum, in addition to necrosis of the cerebral white matter, compatible with panencephalopathic CJD. Histologically, there was neuronal loss with or without spongiform change in the cerebral cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, striatum, pallidum, thalamus, pontine nucleus, and cerebellar granule cells, in addition to diffuse synaptic-type prion staining in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Furthermore, senile plaques, compatible with definite Consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease rank Alzheimer's disease, and neurofibrillary changes of the limbic system, consistent with stage IV of Braak's classification, were found. Based on these clinicopathological findings and a review of the published literature, it is concluded that there were two forms of coexistence of CJD and Alzheimer's disease in the same patient.
15106833	Patients with chronic pain suffer from much more affective emotional disturbance than pain sensation. The present study examined Fos expression associated with pain-related aversion in rats, using formalin-induced conditioned place avoidance (F-CPA) test, which could distinguish pain emotion from pain sensation. When pain experience was retrieved, the rats with F-CPA produced rigorous emotion-like behaviors. As a result, more Fos-LI neurons were observed in anterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, insular cortex, parietal cortex area 2, frontal cortex area 1-3, claustrum, lateral septal area, amygdala, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, central medial nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus and periaqueductal gray. The results for the first time mapped the brain regions associated with processing of pain affect and emotion in rats.
15107185	Several studies have demonstrated reciprocal, as well as synergistic interactions between cannabinoid and opioid systems. The aim of this study was to explore the time-related effects of repeated administration of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol on mu-opioid receptor autoradiography in various brain regions of the rat. To this aim, the effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC, 5 mg/kg/day; i.p.) were examined after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of repeated administration on regions containing mu-opioid receptors: (i) forebrain [caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens (core and shell) and piriform cortex]; (ii) amygdala (medial pars and cortical posteromedial pars), hypothalamus (ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei, zona incerta), hippocampal regions (CA1, CA2, CA3, dentate girus), hindbrain (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area); and (iii) thalamus, including 12 thalamic nuclei. In most of these regions, repeated cannabinoid administration increases mu-opioid receptor density; however, the onset, degree of magnitude reached and time-related effects produced by administration with Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol are dependent upon the brain region examined. It appears that the major increase in mu-opioid receptor density occurs 1 and 3 days after Delta9-THC administration. In some regions, this increase is maintained and, for most of the brain areas examined, this effect is no longer significant by 14 days of administration, suggesting tolerance to cannabinoid treatment. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that cannabinoids produce a time-related differential responsiveness in mu-opioid receptor density in several brain areas that may be relevant to an understanding of the alterations associated with cannabinoid exposure.
15116397	The standard nomenclature that has been used for many telencephalic and related brainstem structures in birds is based on flawed assumptions of homology to mammals. In particular, the outdated terminology implies that most of the avian telencephalon is a hypertrophied basal ganglia, when it is now clear that most of the avian telencephalon is neurochemically, hodologically, and functionally comparable to the mammalian neocortex, claustrum, and pallial amygdala (all of which derive from the pallial sector of the developing telencephalon). Recognizing that this promotes misunderstanding of the functional organization of avian brains and their evolutionary relationship to mammalian brains, avian brain specialists began discussions to rectify this problem, culminating in the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum held at Duke University in July 2002, which approved a new terminology for avian telencephalon and some allied brainstem cell groups. Details of this new terminology are presented here, as is a rationale for each name change and evidence for any homologies implied by the new names. Revisions for the brainstem focused on vocal control, catecholaminergic, cholinergic, and basal ganglia-related nuclei. For example, the Forum recognized that the hypoglossal nucleus had been incorrectly identified as the nucleus intermedius in the Karten and Hodos (1967) pigeon brain atlas, and what was identified as the hypoglossal nucleus in that atlas should instead be called the supraspinal nucleus. The locus ceruleus of this and other avian atlases was noted to consist of a caudal noradrenergic part homologous to the mammalian locus coeruleus and a rostral region corresponding to the mammalian A8 dopaminergic cell group. The midbrain dopaminergic cell group in birds known as the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta was recognized as homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars compacta and was renamed accordingly; a group of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons at the lateral edge of this region was identified as homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars reticulata and was also renamed accordingly. A field of cholinergic neurons in the rostral avian hindbrain was named the nucleus pedunculopontinus tegmenti, whereas the anterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis in the avian diencephalon was renamed the subthalamic nucleus, both for their evident mammalian homologues. For the basal (i.e., subpallial) telencephalon, the actual parts of the basal ganglia were given names reflecting their now evident homologues. For example, the lobus parolfactorius and paleostriatum augmentatum were acknowledged to make up the dorsal subdivision of the striatal part of the basal ganglia and were renamed as the medial and lateral striatum. The paleostriatum primitivum was recognized as homologous to the mammalian globus pallidus and renamed as such. Additionally, the rostroventral part of what was called the lobus parolfactorius was acknowledged as comparable to the mammalian nucleus accumbens, which, together with the olfactory tubercle, was noted to be part of the ventral striatum in birds. A ventral pallidum, a basal cholinergic cell group, and medial and lateral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis were also recognized. The dorsal (i.e., pallial) telencephalic regions that had been erroneously named to reflect presumed homology to striatal parts of mammalian basal ganglia were renamed as part of the pallium, using prefixes that retain most established abbreviations, to maintain continuity with the outdated nomenclature. We concluded, however, that one-to-one (i.e., discrete) homologies with mammals are still uncertain for most of the telencephalic pallium in birds and thus the new pallial terminology is largely devoid of assumptions of one-to-one homologies with mammals. The sectors of the hyperstriatum composing the Wulst (i.e., the hyperstriatum accessorium intermedium, and dorsale), the hyperstriatum ventrale, the neostriatum, and the archistriatum have been renamed (respectively) the hyperpallium (hypertrophied pallium), the mesopallium (middle pallium), the nidopallium (nest pallium), and the arcopallium (arched pallium). The posterior part of the archistriatum has been renamed the posterior pallial amygdala, the nucleus taeniae recognized as part of the avian amygdala, and a region inferior to the posterior paleostriatum primitivum included as a subpallial part of the avian amygdala. The names of some of the laminae and fiber tracts were also changed to reflect current understanding of the location of pallial and subpallial sectors of the avian telencephalon. Notably, the lamina medularis dorsalis has been renamed the pallial-subpallial lamina. We urge all to use this new terminology, because we believe it will promote better communication among neuroscientists. Further information is available at http://avianbrain.org
15116692	The efferent, afferent and intrinsic connections of the septal region have been analyzed in the rat with the autoradiographic method. The lateral septal nucleus, which can be divided into dorsal, intermediate and ventral parts, receives its major input from the hippocampal formation and projects to the medial septal-diagonal band complex. The ventral part of the nucleus also sends fibers through the medial forebrain bundle to the medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas, to the lateral hypothalamic area and the dorsomedial nucleus, to the mammillary body (including the supramammillary region), and to the ventral tegmental area. The medial septal nucleus/diagonal band complex projects back to the hippocampal formation by way of the dorsal fornix, fimbria, and possibly the cingulum. Both nuclei also project through the medial forebrain bundle to the medial and lateral preoptic areas, to the lateral hypothalamic area, and to the mammillary complex. The medial septal nucleus also sends fibers to the midbrain (the ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei) and to the parataenial nucleus of the thalamus, while the nucleus of the diagonal band has an additional projection to the anterior limbic area. Ascending inputs to the medial septal nucleus/diagonal band complex arise in several hypothalamic nuclei and in the brainstem aminergic cell groups. The posterior septal nuclei (the septofimbrial and triangular nuclei) receive their major input from the hippocampal formation, and project in a topographically ordered manner upon the habenular nuclei and the interpeduncular nuclear complex. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis receives its major input from the amygdala (Krettek and Price, '78); but other afferents arise from the ventral subiculum, the ventromedial nucleus, and the brainstem aminergic cell groups. The principal output of the bed nucleus is through the medial forebrain bundle to the substantia innominata, the nucleus accumbens, most parts of the hypothalamus and the preoptic area, the central tegmental fields of the midbrain, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal and median nuclei of the raphe, and the locus coeruleus. The bed nucleus also projects to the anterior nuclei of the thalamus, the parataenial and paraventricular nuclei, and the medial habenular nucleus, and through the stria terminalis to the medial and central nuclei of the amygdala, and to the amygdalo-hippocampal transition area.
15158027	The present report describes the first visualization of folic acid-immunoreactive fibers in the mammalian central nervous system using a highly specific antiserum directed against this vitamin. The distribution of folic acid-immunoreactive structures was studied in the brainstem and thalamus of the monkey using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. We observed fibers containing folic acid, but no folic acid-immunoreactive cell bodies were found. In the brainstem, no immunoreactive structures were visualized in the medulla oblongata, pons, or in the medial-caudal mesencephalon, since at this location immunoreactive fibers containing folic acid were only found at the rostral level in the dorsolateral mesencephalon (in the mesencephalic-diencephalic junction). In the thalamus, the distribution of folic acid-immunoreactive structures was more widespread. Thus, we found immunoreactive fibers in the midline, in nuclei close to the midline (dorsomedial nucleus, centrum medianum/parafascicular complex), in the ventral region of the thalamus (ventral posteroinferior nucleus, ventral posteromedial nucleus), in the ventrolateral thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus, lateral geniculate nucleus, inferior pulvinar nucleus) and in the dorsolateral thalamus (lateral posterior nucleus, pulvinar nucleus). The highest density of fibers containing folic acid was observed in the dorsolateral mesencephalon and in the pulvinar nucleus. The distribution of folic acid-immunoreactive structures in the monkey brain suggests that this vitamin could be involved in several mechanisms, such as visual, auditory, motor and somatosensorial functions.
15183303	Neuropilin (Nrp), a cell surface receptor for class 3 semaphorins and for certain heparin forms of vascular endothelial growth factors, functions in many biological processes including axon guidance, neural cell migration and angiogenesis in the development of the nervous system and the cardiovascular system. To understand the role of neuropilins in zebrafish embryogenesis, we have cloned three zebrafish neuropilin homologues, nrp1b, nrp2a and nrp2b. Based on synteny, zebrafish nrp1b and the previously cloned nrp1a are orthologous to human nrp1, and zebrafish nrp2a and 2b orthologous to human nrp2. We have characterized the expression patterns of these four zebrafish neuropilin genes in wild type embryos from the beginning of somitogenesis to 48 h post-fertilization. Zebrafish nrp1a is expressed in the neural tube including telencephalon, epithalamus, cells along the axonal trajectory of the posterior commissure and the medial longitudinal fascicle, hindbrain neurons, vagus motor neurons and spinal motoneurons. Zebrafish nrp1b is expressed in the nose, the cranial neural crest cell (NCC) derived tissue underlying the hypothalamus, endothelial precursors and the trunk and tail vasculature. Zebrafish nrp2a is expressed in telencephalon, anterior pituitary, oculomotor and trochlear motor neurons, cells along the supra-optic and posterior commissures, hindbrain rhombomere 1, hindbrain neurons, cranial NCCs and sclerotome. Zebrafish nrp2b is expressed in telencephalon, thalamus, hypothalamus, epiphysis, cells along the anterior and posterior commissures, post-optic and supra-optic commissures and the olfactory axonal trajectory, hindbrain neurons, cranial NCCs, somites and spinal cord neurons.
15186922	Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information about tissue water diffusion. Diffusion anisotropy, which can be measured with diffusion tensor MRI, is a quantitative measure of the directional dependence of the diffusion restriction that is introduced by biological structures such as nerve fibers. Diffusion tensor MRI data was obtained in the brain, brain stem, and cervical spinal cord. For each region, scans were performed in four normal volunteers. Fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of diffusion anisotropy, was measured within regions of interest located in the corpus callosum, capsula interna, thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, brain cortex, pyramidal tract of the medulla, accessory olivary nucleus, dorsal olivary nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, spinal white and gray matter. The highest FA value was measured in the corpus callosum (81 +/- 3%). The values of the other areas decreased in the following order: pyramidal tract in the medulla (72 +/- 1%), spinal white matter (65 +/- 4%), capsula interna (62 +/- 3%), accessory olivary nucleus (36 +/- 2%), spinal gray matter (35 +/- 5%), dorsal olivary nucleus in the medulla (29 +/- 2%), thalamus (28 +/- 2%), inferior olivary nucleus (15 +/- 2%), putamen (13 +/- 2%), caudate nucleus (13 +/- 2%), and brain cortex (9 +/- 1%). Our results indicate that the underlying fiber architecture, fiber density, and uniformity of nerve fiber direction affect anisotropy values of the various structures. Characterization of various central nervous system structures with diffusion anisotropy is possible and may be useful to monitor degenerative diseases in the central nervous system.
15193427	The FXYD family is a small single-span membrane protein family; recently, we have identified a novel member of this family from the cDNA library of the rat hippocampus and named phosphohippolin (Php) (Mol. Br. Res. vol. 86, 2001). The deduced amino acid sequence of this novel Php comprises 93 residues with a core motif of FXYD and a single transmembrane domain. This indicates that Php belongs to FXYD6 subfamily of the seven FXYD subfamilies (FXYD1-7). Php shows a 48.1% homology with rat phospholemman (FXYD1), a transmembrane family protein. In this study, polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of rat Php were raised and purified. The spatial expression of the Php protein was in the neuronal fibers of the medial part of lateral habenula nucleus, thalamus, hypothalamus, stria terminalis, zona incerta, amygdaloid body and cingulum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. A unique Php distribution was identified in the cerebellum, with a predominant expression pattern in the granule layer of lobules VI-IX of the posterior lobe. Developmental studies demonstrated that the highest level of Php expression was seen in the postnatal (PN) 3-week-old rat brain, and a significant amount of Php still existed in the adult brain. These findings suggest that Php may play an important role in the excitability of neurons in the central nervous system during postnatal development, as well as those in the adult brain.
15196964	Detailed distribution of mRNAs encoding alpha and beta subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was examined in the brain of rainbow trout by in situ hybridization. In addition, distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was mapped in adjacent parallel sections by neuronal NOS (nNOS) immunocytochemistry and NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd) histochemistry. Following application of digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for sGC alpha and beta subunit mRNAs, we found comparatively intense hybridization signals in the telencephalon, preoptic area, thalamus, hypothalamus, pretectum and tegmentum. Both nNOS immunocytochemistry and NADPHd histochemistry showed extensive distribution of nitroxergic neurons in various brain areas, although various degrees of dissociation of nNOS immunoreactivity (ir) and NADPHd staining were detected. In comparison with sGC subunit mRNAs, nNOS signals were more widely distributed in many neurons, including parvocellular neurons in the preoptic area, nucleus anterior tuberis in the hypothalamus, periventricular neurons in the optic tectum, most of the rhombencephalic neurons and pituitary cells. However, wide overlaps of sGC mRNA-containing neurons and nNOS-positive neurons were observed in the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, thalamus, hypothalamus, pretectum, optic tectum, tegmentum and cerebellum. The widespread overlapping in sGC subunit mRNAs and nNOS distribution suggests a role for sGC in various neuronal functions, such as processing of olfactory and visual signals and neuroendocrine function, possibly via NO/cGMP signaling in the brain of rainbow trout.
15224145	To define the action sites of adrenomedullin (ADM) in the rat brain, and to examine whether neuronal NO may participate in the actions of ADM, the present study was undertaken to examine the effects of i.c.v. administration of ADM on the induction of Fos protein and on nitric oxide-producing neurons in rat brain nuclei involved in cardiovascular regulation, using double immunohistochemical method for Fos and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Following i.c.v. administration of ADM (1 nmol/kg, 3 nmol/kg), Fos-like immunoreactivity neurons were markedly increased in several brain areas of the rat, including the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the area postrema, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial nucleus and the nucleus paragigantocelluaris laterialis (PGL) in the brainstem, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus in the hypothalamus, as well as the central amygdaloid nucleus and the lateral habenular nucleus in the forebrain. Following i.c.v. injection of ADM (1 nmol/kg, 3 nmol/kg), the number of double-labeled neurons for Fos and nNOS was increased in the PVN and SON. Small numbers of double-labeled neurons were also found in the NTS and PGL following i.c.v. injection of ADM (3 nmol/kg), while i.c.v. injection of ADM (1 nmol/kg) did not change the number of double-labeled neurons in the NTS and PGL. Pretreatment with calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist CGRP(8-37) (30 nmol/kg) significantly reduced the action of ADM (3 nmol/kg) in the brain. These results suggest that centrally administered ADM may increase the expression of c-fos in the forebrain, the hypothalamus and the brainstem and activate nitric oxide-producing neurons in the PVN, SON, NTS and PGL. These effects may be partly mediated by CGRP receptors.
15269967	We examined the morphogenesis and regionalization of the embryonic brain of an acanthopterygian teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes), by in situ hybridization using 14 gene probes. We compared our results with previous studies in other vertebrates, particularly zebrafish, an ostariophysan teleost. During the early development of the medaka neural rod, three initial brain vesicles arose: the anterior brain vesicle, which later developed into the telencephalon and rostral diencephalon; the intermediate brain vesicle, which later developed into the caudal diencephalon, mesencephalon, and metencephalon; and the posterior brain vesicle, which later developed into the myelencephalon. In the late neural rod, the rostral brain bent ventrally and the axis of the brain had a marked curvature at the diencephalon. In the final stage of the neural rod, ventricles began to develop, transforming the neural rod into the neural tube. In situ hybridization revealed that the brain can be divided into three longitudinal zones (dorsal, intermediate, and ventral) and many transverse subdivisions, on the basis of molecular expression patterns. The telencephalon was subdivided into two transverse domains. Our results support the basic concept of neuromeric models, including the prosomeric model, which suggests the existence of a conserved organization of all vertebrate neural tubes. Our results also show that brain development in medaka differs from that reported in other vertebrates, including zebrafish, in gene-expression patterns in the telencephalon, in brain vesicle formation, and in developmental speed. Developmental and genetic programs for brain development may be somewhat different even among teleosts.
15282712	To examine the distributions of VIP/PACAP receptors (VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 receptors) in the brain and to identify the cell types that express these receptors, we performed immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence in the rat brain with specific antibodies. The immunohistochemistry revealed that the receptors had distinctive, complementary, and overlapping distribution patterns. High levels of the VPAC1 receptor were expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, deep cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. The VPAC2 receptors were concentrated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdalar regions, cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei, hypothalamus, and brainstem. On the other hand, the PAC1 receptors had a more restricted distribution pattern in the brain, and high levels of the PAC1 receptors were confined to the cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei, epithalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, and white matter of many brain regions. Also, many fibers expressing the PAC1 receptors were observed in various areas, i.e., the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. The double immunofluorescence showed that the VIP/PACAP receptors were confined to the neuroglia as well as the neurons. All three types of the VIP/PACAP receptors were expressed in the astrocytes, and the PAC1 receptors were also expressed in the oligodendrocytes. These findings indicate that VIP and PACAP exert their functions through their receptors in specific locations in different combinations. We hope that this first demonstration of the distributions of the VIP/PACAP receptors provides data useful in the investigation of the mechanisms of the many functions of VIP and PACAP in the brain, which require further elucidation.
15305368	The distribution of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp)- like immunoreactivity was studied only in the rat central nervous system (CNS). In mammals, CART peptides occur among others in brain areas that control feeding behavior. We mapped CARTp-immunoreactive structures in the CNS of the frog Rana esculenta and assumed that differences may exist in the CARTp-containing neuronal populations between the frog, which does not feed in winter, and the rat. In the forebrain, immunoreactive cells and fibers were found in the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, medial pallium, septum, striatum, the preoptic nuclei, ventromedial nucleus, central thalamic nucleus, and the hypothalamus. The optic pathway was free of immunoreactivity. The neurohypophysis showed intense immunostaining. In the mesencephalon, many cells were stained in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and a few in the optic tectum, where fibers were stained in all plexiform layers. In the retina, some cells in the inner nuclear layer contained CARTp. In the rhombencephalon, cells were stained in the raphe nuclei, central gray, nucleus of the solitary tract, and the vicinity of motor nuclei. Neurons of the motor cranial nerves were densely innervated by CARTp-positive fibers originating from the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, preganglionic cells were stained, and motoneurons were surrounded by immunoreactive varicose axon terminals. Major differences were found between the frog and the rat brains in the distribution of CARTp in the visual system, olfactory bulb, preoptic area, and the motor nuclei. Some of these differences may be related to feeding behavior of these animals.
15312896	The significance of Galphai2 in neural signal transmission is well defined. However, the function of its alternative splice variant named sGi2 is unknown. Therefore here, we have studied the localization of sGi2 protein in rat and monkey brain at light and electron microscopy level. We found that this novel protein is widely expressed in rat and monkey brain regions, which are known to play crucial role in brain functions. Hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus, striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and dopaminergic cell groups of substantia nigra, hypothalamus and olfactory bulb showed strong labeling with anti-sGi2. At subcellular level, sGi2 protein was localized in intracellular compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, mitochondria and nucleus. This protein was also found localized extra-synaptically in both axons and spines, which were making excitatory as well as inhibitory synaptic contacts. Moreover, the frequent localization of sGi2 protein in neck of spines further suggests that this protein may not engage directly in neuronal signal transmission but could influence other participating proteins of this process.
15313516	While several studies have suggested a relationship between the hippocampus and psychosis in schizophrenia, fewer studies have specifically investigated the presence of psychosis in mood disorders from a neurobiological perspective. Moreover, a limitation of these earlier studies is that the majority of them were performed in chronic patients. The present proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) study assessed neuronal integrity (as assessed with N-acetylaspartate, NAA) in the hippocampus of patients with a first episode of mood disorders with psychotic symptoms. We studied 17 patients and 17 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Subjects underwent 1H-MRSI, and measures of NAA, choline-containing compounds (CHO), and creatine+phosphocreatine (CRE) in 11 brain regions were obtained, i.e. hippocampus (HIPPO), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, occipital cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, centrum semiovale, prefrontal white matter, thalamus and putamen. NAA/CRE ratios in HIPPO of patients were significantly lower than in controls. Sporadic and non-hypothesis-driven results were found in occipital cortex and prefrontal white matter as a main effect of diagnosis, and in superior temporal gyrus as a hemisphere by diagnosis interaction. These results would not survive a Bonferroni correction for the number of ROIs. No correlations were found with the available demographic and clinical data. Therefore, hippocampal neuronal abnormalities are present at the onset of mood disorders with psychotic symptoms. These data suggest that neuronal abnormalities in HIPPO may be associated with psychosis in mood disorders. Since these data were obtained in patients at first episode, they cannot be explained by chronicity of illness or pharmacological treatment.
15325368	Hemisphere asymmetry was explored in normal healthy subjects and in patients with schizophrenia using a novel voxel-based tensor analysis applied to fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusion tensor. Our voxel-based approach, which requires precise spatial normalization to remove the misalignment of fiber tracts, includes generating a symmetrical group average template of the diffusion tensor by applying nonlinear elastic warping of the demons algorithm. We then normalized all 32 diffusion tensor MRIs from healthy subjects and 23 from schizophrenic subjects to the symmetrical average template. For each brain, six channels of tensor component images and one T2-weighted image were used for registration to match tensor orientation and shape between images. A statistical evaluation of white matter asymmetry was then conducted on the normalized FA images and their flipped images. In controls, we found left-higher-than-right anisotropic asymmetry in the anterior part of the corpus callosum, cingulum bundle, the optic radiation, and the superior cerebellar peduncle, and right-higher-than-left anisotropic asymmetry in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the anterior limb's prefrontal regions, in the uncinate fasciculus, and in the superior longitudinal fasciculus. In patients, the asymmetry was lower, although still present, in the cingulum bundle and the anterior corpus callosum, and not found in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the uncinate fasciculus, and the superior cerebellar peduncle compared to healthy subjects. These findings of anisotropic asymmetry pattern differences between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia are likely related to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in schizophrenia.
15334648	The connectivity and cytoarchitecture of telencephalic centers except dorsal and medial pallium were studied in the fire-bellied toad Bombina orientalis by anterograde and retrograde biocytin labeling and intracellular biocytin injection (total of 148 intracellularly labeled neurons or neuron clusters). Our findings suggest the following telencephalic divisions: (1) a central amygdala-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in the caudal midventral telencephalon, connected to visceral-autonomic centers; (2) a vomeronasal amygdala in the caudolateral ventral telencephalon receiving input from the accessory olfactory bulb and projecting mainly to the preoptic region/hypothalamus; (3) an olfactory amygdala in the caudal pole of the telencephalon lateral to the vomeronasal amygdala receiving input from the main olfactory bulb and projecting to the hypothalamus; (4) a medial amygdala receiving input from the anterior dorsal thalamus and projecting to the medial pallium, septum, and hypothalamus; (5) a ventromedial column formed by a nucleus accumbens and a ventral pallidum projecting to the central amygdala, hypothalamus, and posterior tubercle; (6) a lateral column constituting the dorsal striatum proper rostrally and the dorsal pallidum caudally, and a ventrolateral column constituting the ventral striatum. We conclude that the caudal mediolateral complex consisting of the extended central, vomeronasal, and olfactory amygdala of anurans represents the ancestral condition of the amygdaloid complex. During the evolution of the mammalian telencephalon this complex was shifted medially and involuted. The mammalian basolateral amygdala apparently is an evolutionary new structure, but the medial portion of the amygdalar complex of anurans reveals similarities in input and output with this structure and may serve similar functions.
15334651	Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) was identified as an interactor of the gene product (Huntingtin) responsible for Huntington's disease and found to be a core component of the stigmoid body. Even though HAP1 is highly expressed in the brain, detailed information on HAP1 distribution has not been fully described. Focusing on the neuroanatomical analysis of HAP1-mRNA expression using in situ hybridization histochemistry, the present study clarified its detailed regional distribution in the entire mouse brain. Mouse HAP1 (Hap1)-mRNAs were abundantly expressed in the limbic-related forebrain regions and midline/periventricular brainstem regions including the olfactory bulb, limbic-associated cortices, hippocampus, septum, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptico-hypothalamic regions, central gray, raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, and area postrema. In contrast, little expression was detected in the striatum and thalamus, implying that Hap1 is associated with neurodegeneration-sparing regions rather than target lesions in Huntington's disease. The distribution pattern, resembling that of the stigmoid body, suggests that HAP1 and the stigmoid body are implicated in protection from neuronal death rather than induction of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease, and that they play an important role in integrating instinct behaviors and underlying autonomic, visceral, arousal, drive, memory, and neuroendocrinergic functions, particularly during extensive homeostatic or emotional processes. These data will provide an important morphological base for a future understanding of functions of HAP1 and the stigmoid body in the brain.
15339255	This paper reviews the lifetime contributions of the author to the field of sleep-wakefulness (S-W), reinterprets results of the early studies, and suggests new conclusions and perspectives. Long-term cats with mesencephalic transection show behavioral/polygraphic rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), including the typical oculo-pupillary behavior, even when the section is performed in kittens prior to S-W maturation. REMS can be induced as a reflex. Typical non-rapid eye movement S (NREMS) is absent and full W/arousal is present only after a precollicular section. The isolated forebrain (IF) rostral to the transection exhibits all features of W/arousal and NREMS [with electroencephalographic (EEG) spindles and delta waves], arousal to olfactory stimuli, and including the appropriate oculo-pupillary behaviors. These features also mature normally after neonatal transection. REMS is absent from the IF. After deprivation there is NREMS pressure and rebound in the IF, but the decerebrate cat only shows pressure for REMS. Most IF reactions to pharmacologic agents are within expectations, except for the tolerance/withdrawal effects of long-term morphine use which are absent. In contrast, these effects are supported by the brainstem (i.e. seen in the decerebrate cat). In cats with ablation of the telencephalon, or diencephalic cats, delta waves are absent in the thalamus. EEG thalamic spindle waves are seen triggering S for only 4-5 days after ablation. Therefore, true NREMS is absent in chronic diencephalic cats although pre- and postsomniac behaviors persist. These animals are hyperactive and show a pronounced, permanent insomnia; however, a low dose of barbiturate triggers a dramatic REMS/atypical NREMS rebound. Cats without the thalamus (athalamic cats), initially show a dissociation between behavioral hyperactivity/insomnia and the neocortical EEG, which for 15-20 days exhibits only delta and slower oscillations. Fast, low-voltage W rhythms appear later on, first during REMS, but spindle waves and S postures are absent from the start, such that these cats also display only atypical NREMS. Athalamic cats also show barbiturate-sensitive insomnia. Cats with ablation of the frontal cortices or the caudate nuclei remain permanently hyperactive. They also show a mild, but significant hyposomnia, which is permanent in afrontal cats, but lasts for about a month in acaudates. The polygraphic/behavioral features of their S-W states remain normal. We conclude and propose that: (a) the control of the S-W system is highly complex and distributed, but is organized hierarchically in a well-defined rostro-caudal manner; the rostral-most or highest level (telencephalon), is the most functionally complex/adaptative and regulates the lower levels; the diencephalic/basal forebrain, or middle level, has a pivotal role in inducing switching between S and W and in coordinating the lowest (brainstem) and highest levels; (b) W can occur independently in both the forebrain and brainstem, but true NREMS- and REMS-generating mechanisms exist exclusively in the forebrain and brainstem, respectively; (c) forebrain and brainstem S-W processes can operate independently from each other and are preprogrammed at birth; this helps understanding normal and abnormal polygraphic/behavioral dissociations in humans and normal dissociations/splitting in aquatic mammals; (d) NREMS homeostasis is present in the IF, but only REMS pressure after deprivation persists in the decerebrate cat; (e) the thalamus engages in both NREMS and W; (f) insomnia in diencephalic cats is the result of an imbalance between antagonistic W- and S-promoting cellular groups in the ventral brain (normally modulated by the telencephalon); (g) the EEG waves, which are signature for each S-W state, appear to truly drive the concomitant behaviors, e.g. a hypothetical human IF could alternate between behavioral NREMS and W/arousal/awareness; (h) a role for REMS is to keep the individual sleeping at the end of the self-limiting NREMS periods. The need for accelerating research on telencephaling NREMS periods. The need for accelerating research on telencephalic S-W processes and downstream control of the lower S-W system levels is emphasized.
15342440	Subjects (n = 40) performed a delayed item recognition task for visually presented letters with three set sizes (1, 3 or 6 letters). Accuracy was close to ceiling at all set sizes, so we took set size as a proxy for WM load (i.e. the amount of information being maintained in WM). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal associated with the delay period increased in a nearly linear fashion with WM load in the left inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (possibly Broca's area, BA 44/45), right anterior insula, bilateral caudate, bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 6), bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA 9/46), bilateral inferior parietal lobule (with foci in both BA 39 and 40), left superior parietal lobule (BA 7), medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (BA 8). These results lend support to the idea that at least some of the cortical mechanisms of WM maintenance, potentially rehearsal, exhibit a scaling with WM load. In contrast, the delay-related fMRI signal in hippocampus followed an inverted U-shape, being greatest during the intermediate level of WM load, with relatively lower values at the lowest and highest levels of WM load. This pattern of delay-related fMRI activity, orthogonal to WM load, is seemingly not consonant with a role for hippocampus in WM maintenance of phonologically codable stimuli. This finding could possibly be related more to the general familiarity of the letter stimuli than their phonological codability per se.
15464291	Using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, we studied the distribution of immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies containing methionine-enkephalin-Arg(6)-Gly(7)-Leu(8) in the adult human brainstem. Immunoreactive cell bodies were found in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata (in which we observed the highest density of immunoreactive cell bodies) and the pons, the solitary nucleus, the hypoglossal nucleus, the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, the lateral cuneate nucleus, the nucleus prepositus, the central gray of the pons and mesencephalon, the central and pericentral nuclei of the inferior colliculus, the superior colliculus, ventral to the superior olive and in the midline region of the pons and mesencephalon. The highest density of immunoreactive fibers containing methionine-enkephalin-Arg(6)-Gly(7)-Leu(8) was found in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, the central gray and the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata, pons and mesencephalon, the solitary nucleus, the spinal vestibular nucleus, the dorsal accessory olivary nucleus, the raphe obscurus, the substantia nigra and in the interpeduncular nucleus. The widespread distribution of immunoreactive structures containing methionine-enkephalin-Arg(6)-Gly(7)-Leu(8) in the human brainstem indicates that this neuropeptide might be involved in several physiological mechanisms, acting as a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator.
15514931	In this study and the accompanying article (Folgueira et al., 2004a), the fluorescent carbocyanine dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) was used in fixed tissue to comprehensively analyze the connections of the different regions of the telencephalic lobes and the preoptic region of the rainbow trout. Here, we analyze the connections of the dorsal area (D; pallium) of the telencephalon, and the preoptic region, as well as the telencephalic connections of several structures in the diencephalon and brainstem of juvenile trout. The dorsal plus dorsolateral pallial zone of D (Dd+Dl-d) receives afferents from contralateral Dd+Dl-d, the ventral area of the telencephalon, preoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, medial thalamus, preglomerular complex, anterior and lateral tuberal nuclei, posterior tuberal nucleus, posterior hypothalamic lobe, superior raphe nucleus, and the rhombencephalic central gray and reticular formation, and projects to the central zone of D (Dc), medial thalamus, and some caudomedial hypothalamic regions. The medial zone of D (Dm) maintains reciprocal connections with the preglomerular complex and also receives afferents from the preoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior tuberal nucleus, preglomerular tertiary gustatory nucleus, posterior tubercle, superior raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and the rhombencephalic central gray, and reticular formation. Dc receives fibers mainly from Dd+Dl-d, preoptic nucleus, preglomerular complex, and torus semicircularis and projects to several extratelencephalic centers, including the paracommissural nucleus, optic tectum, torus semicircularis, thalamus, preglomerular complex, posterior tubercle nuclei, and inferior hypothalamic lobes. The posterior zone of D (Dp) is mainly connected with the olfactory bulbs, the ventral and supracommissural nuclei of the ventral area (subpallium), the preoptic nucleus, and the preglomerular complex and projects to wide hypothalamic and posterior tubercular regions. The preoptic nucleus projects to the olfactory bulb, to most regions of the telencephalic lobes, and to several diencephalic and brainstem structures. These results reveal complex and specialized connectional patterns in the rainbow trout dorsal telencephalon and preoptic region. Most of these connections have not been described previously in salmonids. These connections indicate that the salmonid telencephalon is involved in multisensorial processing and modulation of brain activity.
15514932	The nucleus reuniens (RE) is the largest of the midline nuclei of the thalamus and the major source of thalamic afferents to the hippocampus and parahippocampal structures. Nucleus reuniens has recently been shown to exert powerful excitatory actions on CA1 of the hippocampus. Few reports on any species have examined afferent projections to nucleus reuniens. By using the retrograde anatomical tracer Fluorogold, we examined patterns of afferent projections to RE in the rat. We showed that RE receives a diverse and widely distributed set of afferents projections. The main sources of input to nucleus reuniens were from the orbitomedial, insular, ectorhinal, perirhinal, and retrosplenial cortices; CA1/subiculum of hippocampus; claustrum, tania tecta, lateral septum, substantia innominata, and medial and lateral preoptic nuclei of the basal forebrain; medial nucleus of amygdala; paraventricular and lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus; zona incerta; anterior, ventromedial, lateral, posterior, supramammillary, and dorsal premammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus; and ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, medial and posterior pretectal nuclei, superior colliculus, precommissural/commissural nuclei, nucleus of the posterior commissure, parabrachial nucleus, laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei, nucleus incertus, and dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the brainstem. The present findings of widespread projections to RE, mainly from limbic/limbic-associated structures, suggest that nucleus reuniens represents a critical relay in the transfer of limbic information (emotional/cognitive) from RE to its major targets, namely, to the hippocampus and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex. RE appears to be a major link in the two-way exchange of information between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex.
15514934	The fluorescent carbocyanine dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) was used in fixed tissue to comprehensively analyze the connections of the olfactory bulbs and the different regions of the ventral (V) area of the telencephalic lobes (subpallium) of the rainbow trout. With this goal, DiI was applied to the different telencephalic nuclei and zones, as well as to the olfactory nerve, the olfactory bulb, the retina, and to several structures in the diencephalon and brainstem of juvenile trout. The olfactory bulbs maintain reciprocal connections with several regions of the telencephalon [ventral nucleus of V (Vv), supracommissural nucleus (Vs), posterior zone of D (Dp), preoptic nucleus], and also project to the diencephalon (posterior tuberal nucleus, posterior hypothalamic lobe). Vv receives afferents from Vs, the dorsal nucleus of V (Vd), the preoptic nucleus, and from several nuclei in the diencephalon and brainstem (suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior and lateral tuberal nuclei, preglomerular complex, tertiary gustatory nucleus, posterior tubercle, inferior hypothalamic lobes, thalamus, torus semicircularis, secondary gustatory nucleus, locus coeruleus, superior raphe nucleus, central gray, and reticular formation), and projects to dorsal (pallial) regions and most of the nuclei afferent to Vv. The dorsal nucleus of V (Vd) and Vs mainly project to the dorsal area. In an accompanying article (Folgueira et al., 2004), we present the results of application of DiI to dorsal (pallial) telencephalic regions, as well as of several experiments of tracer application to extratelencephalic regions. The results presented here, together with those of the accompanying article, reveal a complex connectional pattern of the rainbow trout ventral telencephalon, most of these connections having not been described previously in salmonids.
15527863	The serotonin (5-HT)1B receptor is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of rodents and its homologous 5-HT1D beta receptor is expressed in human. These receptors are distributed in both serotonergic and non-serotonergic neurons, where they act as auto- or heteroreceptors, respectively. Studies from ours and other laboratories have shown that 5-HT1B receptors are densely expressed in the ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra and dorsal subiculum and moderately expressed in the cerebral cortex, the molecular layer of the hippocampus, the entopeduncular nucleus, the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus, the caudate putamen and the deep nuclei of the cerebellum. At the ultrastructural level, 5-HT1B receptors were found distributed in axons and axon terminals and these receptors are located on the plasma membrane of unmyelinated axon terminals and in the cytoplasm close to the plasmalemma. The terminal localization of the 5-HT1B receptors in CNS suggests that there is a signal responsible for the protein transport toward the nerve terminals. Studies from ours and other groups using lesion, radioligand binding sites, viral transfection and anterograde methods have shown that 5-HT1B receptors are located at the nerve terminals of different pathways. The 5-HT1B receptors act as terminal receptors and are involved in regulation of the release of various neurotransmitters, including 5-HT itself. The regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid release by 5-HT1B receptors has been found in projections: from caudate putamen to the globus pallidus or substantia nigra, from nucleus accumbens to the ventral tegmentum area, and from purkinje neurons to the deep nuclei of the cerebellum. The control of glutamate release by 5-HT1B receptors has been found in projections from hippocampus to the dorsal subiculum and of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate release from retinal ganglion cells to the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus. The control of 5-HT release by 5-HT1B receptors was shown in projections arising from the raphe nuclei to fore- and midbrain regions. Multiple evidences suggest that 5-HT1B receptors are implicated in several physiological functions, behavior and psychiatric diseases including migraine, locomotor activity, drug abuse reinforcement, migraine, aggressive behavior, depression and anxiety states.
15555772	A well-known issue in functional neuroimaging studies, regarding motor synchronization, is to design suitable control tasks able to discriminate between the brain structures involved in primary time-keeper functions and those related to other processes such as attentional effort. The aim of this work was to investigate how the predictability of stimulus onsets in the baseline condition modulates the activity in brain structures related to processes involved in time-keeper functions during the performance of a visually cued motor synchronization task (VM). The rational behind this choice derives from the notion that using different stimulus predictability can vary the subject's attention and the consequently neural activity. For this purpose, baseline levels of BOLD activity were obtained from 12 subjects during a conventional-baseline condition: maintained fixation of the visual rhythmic stimuli presented in the VM task, and a random-baseline condition: maintained fixation of visual stimuli occurring randomly. fMRI analysis demonstrated that while brain areas with a documented role in basic time processing are detected independent of the baseline condition (right cerebellum, bilateral putamen, left thalamus, left superior temporal gyrus, left sensorimotor cortex, left dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor area), the ventral premotor cortex, caudate nucleus, insula and inferior frontal gyrus exhibited a baseline-dependent activation. We conclude that maintained fixation of unpredictable visual stimuli can be employed in order to reduce or eliminate neural activity related to attentional components present in the synchronization task.
15561430	In three rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), the inferior motor cortex was explored by electrical stimulation for sites yielding vocal fold adduction. The retrograde tracer wheat germ-agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was injected into the effective sites. Within the forebrain, retrogradely labeled cells were found in the claustrum, basal nucleus of Meynert, substantia innominata, extended amygdala, lateral and posterior hypothalamic area, field H of Forel, and a number of thalamic nuclei with the strongest labeling in the nuclei ventralis lateralis, ventralis posteromedialis, including its parvocellular part, medialis dorsalis and centrum medianum, and weaker labeling in the nuclei ventralis anterior, ventralis posterolateralis, intermediodorsalis, paracentralis, parafascicularis and pulvinaris anterior. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep mesencephalic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra. In the lower brainstem, labeled cells were found in the pontine reticular formation, median and dorsal raphe nuclei, medial parabrachial nucleus, and locus coeruleus. The findings are discussed in terms of the possible role of these structures in voluntary vocal control.
15561431	The present study describes the cortical input into the motor cortical larynx area. The retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the electrophysiologically identified motor cortical larynx area in three rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Retrogradely labeled cells were found in the surrounding premotor cortex (areas 6V and 6D), primary motor cortex (area 4), primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3, 1 and 2), anterior and posterior secondary somatosensory cortex and the probable homologue of Broca's area (areas 44 and 45); furthermore, labeling was found in the supplementary motor area, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (areas 24 and 23), prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex (areas 8A, 46V, 47/12L, 47/12O, 13), agranular, dysgranular and granular insula as well as in the cortex within the upper bank of the middle third of the superior temporal sulcus (area TPO). The majority of these regions are reciprocally connected with the motor cortical larynx area [Brain Res 949 (2000) 23]. The laryngeal motor cortical input is discussed in relation to the connections of other motor cortical areas and its role in vocal control.
15567425	A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a functional interaction between opioid and cannabinoid systems. The present study further investigated this functional interaction by examining the combined effects of morphine and the cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716 on Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR), a marker for neural activation. Male albino Wistar rats were treated with SR 141716 (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), morphine HCl (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously), vehicle, or SR 141716 and morphine combined (n = 6 per group). Rats were injected with morphine or its vehicle 30-min after administration of SR 141716 or its vehicle and perfused 3 h later. Locomotor activity and body temperature were both increased in the morphine-treated group and SR 141716 significantly inhibited these effects. Morphine increased Fos-IR in several brain regions including the caudate-putamen (CPu), cortex (cingulate, insular and piriform), nucleus accumbens (NAS) shell, lateral septum (LS), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), hypothalamus (paraventricular, dorsomedial and ventromedial), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PV), amygdala (central and basolateral nuclei), dorsolateral periaqueductal gray, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and Edinger-Westphal nucleus. SR 141716 alone increased Fos-IR in the cortex (cingulate, insular and piriform), NAS (shell), LS, BNST, hypothalamus (paraventricular, dorsomedial and ventromedial), PV, amygdala (central, basolateral and medial nuclei), VTA, and Edinger-Westphal nucleus. SR 141716 attenuated morphine-induced Fos-IR in several regions including the CPu, cortex, NAS (shell), LS, MnPO, MPO, paraventricular and dorsomedial hypothalamus, PV, basolateral amygdala, VTA, and Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW). These results provide further support for functional interplay between the cannabinoid and opioid systems. Possible behavioural and physiological implications of the interactive effects of SR 141716 on morphine-induced Fos-IR are discussed.
15578731	The relationship of the heterogeneity of iron concentrations in the brain with the regulation of iron uptake into specific brain regions remains unresolved. We used hypotransferrinemic mice and an iron-deficient or control diet to explore whether plasma transferrin (Tf), transferrin saturation, and plasma iron levels influence the uptake of (59)Fe and whether there was brain region specificity. Weaning wild-type (+/+) and heterozygotic mice (+/hpx), were sorted randomly to either a iron-deficient diet or a control iron diet for 8 weeks, whereas homozygous mice (hpx/hpx) ate the control diet for 8 weeks before (59)Fe uptake studies. Iron-deficient heterozygous and wild-type mice both had significantly greater plasma Tf levels (37.5 and 42.5 microM) than control mice had (heterozygous and wild-type controls were 20 and 32.5 microM) and far more than homozygous mice (<0.2 microM) had, thus providing five distinct levels of plasma Tf concentrations. After intravenous injection of (59)Fe, brains of iron-deficient wild-type mice took up significantly more (59)Fe (0.15% dose) compared to control wild-type mice (0.056%) at 2 hr, a treatment effect that persisted through 24 hr. In contrast, diet had no effect in heterozygous mice. Importantly, homozygous mice had equivalent uptake to other groups (0.089% dose) by 24 hr. Early brain radioactivity varied by regions (hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex approximately 10-18% brain uptake > cerebellum, pons, thalamus, and striatum approximately 7-12% > cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra approximately 6-8%). This distribution of radioactivity changed over 24 hr in the hypothalamus of heterozygous mice, homozygous mice, and iron-deficient wild-type mice. Homozygous mice also showed higher uptake (13-15%) in some regions (hypothalamus and cerebellum) than in other regions. In wild-type and heterozygous mice, (59)Fe uptake was inversely related to brain Tf and was independent of regional brain iron concentrations and plasma Tf levels or saturation. These experimental data suggest that brain iron uptake may be constitutive and independent of plasma Tf, transferrin saturation, or regional brain iron concentration. The proteins and mechanisms responsible for additional iron uptake into specific regions, or perhaps the redistribution are unclear though the data are supportive of a non-transferrin-bound iron uptake pathway.
15584531	A tomographic head/brain model was developed from the Visible Human images and used to calculate S-values for brain imaging procedures. This model contains 15 segmented sub-regions including caudate nucleus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter, corpus callosum, eyes, lateral ventricles, lenses, lentiform nucleus, optic chiasma, optic nerve, pons and middle cerebellar peduncle, skull CSF, thalamus and thyroid. S-values for C-11, O-15, F-18, Tc-99m and I-123 have been calculated using this model and a Monte Carlo code, EGS4. Comparison of the calculated S-values with those calculated from the MIRD (1999) stylized head/brain model shows significant differences. In many cases, the stylized head/brain model resulted in smaller S-values (as much as 88%), suggesting that the doses to a specific patient similar to the Visible Man could have been underestimated using the existing clinical dosimetry.
15584929	In mammals, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and related peptides are known to play essential roles in the regulation of neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioural responses to physical and emotional stress. In nonmammalian species, CRH-like peptides are hypothesized to play similar neuroendocrine and neurocrine roles. However, there is relatively little detailed information on the distribution of CRH neurones in the central nervous system (CNS) of nonmammalian vertebrates, and there are currently no comparative data on stress-induced changes in CRH neuronal physiology. We used a specific, affinity-purified antibody raised against synthetic Xenopus laevis CRH to map the distribution of CRH in the CNS of juvenile South African clawed frogs. We then analysed stress-induced changes in CRH immunoreactivity (CRH-ir) throughout the CNS. We found that CRH-positive cell bodies and fibres are widely distributed throughout the brain and rostral spinal cord of juvenile X. laevis. Strong CRH-immunoreactivity (ir) was found in cell bodies and fibres in the anterior preoptic area (POA, an area homologous to the mammalian paraventricular nucleus) and the external zone of the median eminence. Specific CRH-ir cell bodies and fibres were also identified in the septum, pallium and striatum in the telencephalon; the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and various hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei in the diencephalon; the tectum, torus semicircularis and tegmental nuclei of the mesencephalon; the cerebellum and locus coeruleus in the rhombencephalon; and the ventral horn of the rostral spinal cord. To determine if exposure to an acute physical stressor alters CRH neuronal physiology, we exposed juvenile frogs to shaking/handling and conducted morphometric analysis. Plasma corticosterone was significantly elevated by 30 min after exposure to the stressor and continued to increase up to 6 h. Morphometric analysis of CRH-ir after 4 h of stress showed a significant increase in CRH-ir in parvocellular neurones of the anterior preoptic area, the medial amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, but not in other brain regions. The stress-induced increase in CRH-ir in the POA was associated with increased Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI), and confocal microscopy showed that CRH-ir colocalized with Fos-LI in a subset of Fos-LI-positive neurones. Our results support the view that the basic pattern of CNS CRH expression arose early in vertebrate evolution and lend further support to earlier studies suggesting that amphibians may be a transitional species for descending CRH-ergic pathways. Furthermore, CRH neurones in the frog brain exhibit changes in response to a physical stressor that parallel those seen in mammals, and thus are likely to play an active role in mediating neuroendocrine, behavioural and autonomic stress responses.
15591766	Fifty normal noninfarct patients and 12 cases with infarcts of the cerebrum were examined with routine magnetic resonance imaging and echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging. The diffusion-weighted three-dimensional images were reconstructed with volume-rendering processing on workstation. Precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, superior frontal gyrus, precentral sulcus, central sulcus, postcentral sulcus, intraparietal sulcus and superior frontal sulcus were best shown of all structures with an arbitrary score of 2.61-2.77. Supramarginal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and lateral sulcus were clearly shown in the majority of the cerebra with average scores of 2.0-2.49; angular gyrus, inferior frontal sulcus and superior temporal gyrus were not demonstrated satisfactorily and their average scores were 1.67-1.89. Middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior temporal sulcus and inferior temporal sulcus were difficult to identify, and thus had average scores of 0.87-1.26. Brain surface structures were better displayed in the older group of individuals than in the younger group. The structures in the 12 cases with acute or chronic cerebrum infarcts were also satisfactorily demonstrated with this new technique.
15593369	Metastin, the gene product of metastasis suppressor gene KiSS-1, is the endogenous ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR54 (or AXOR12, or OT7T175). The expression of KiSS-1 gene and peptide and the distribution of metastin were studied in the rat central nervous system by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical methods. KiSS-1 gene and peptide expression was higher in the hypothalamus than in the brainstem and spinal cord. In the brain, metastin-like immunoreactivity (irMT) was found mainly in three groups of cells: dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and caudal ventrolateral medulla. Immunoreactive fibers of varying density were noted in bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, diagonal band, amygdala, hypothalamus, zona incerta, thalamus, periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei, lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, spinal trigeminal tract, rostral ventrolateral medulla, and medullary reticular nucleus. Preabsorption of the antiserum with metastin peptide fragment (45-54)-NH2 (1 microg/ml) resulted in no staining in any of the sections. The biological activity of metastin was assessed by monitoring intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i in cultured hippocampal neurons, which are known to express GPR54. Metastin increased [Ca2+]i in a population of cultured hippocampal neurons. The results show that metastin is biologically active in rat central neurons, and its anatomical distribution suggests a possible role in nociception and autonomic and neuroendocrine functions.
15660248	The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of magnetization transfer ratios (MTRs) in detecting disease in normal-appearing brain regions of patients with neuro-Behçet (NB) disease. Thirty-two patients with NB disease were assessed. Fifteen healthy volunteers were examined as the control group. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the head was performed without and with magnetization transfer (MT) contrast. Signal intensity measurements were obtained from ten anatomical regions (centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, forceps major, forceps minor, thalamus, substantia nigra pars compacta, substantia nigra pars grisea, inferior pons and middle cerebellar peduncle) in both groups. Also measured in the NB group were parenchymal lesions in the brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebral deep white matter. MTR was calculated for each measurement. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U and independent t-tests with computer-based SPSS 11.0 for Windows software. A P value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean MTR of the parenchymal lesions in the NB group was lower than the mean MTR of the normal-appearing parenchyma in both the NB patients and the normal group. For the normal-appearing parenchyma the mean MTR in the NB group was higher than that for the controls for all regions except the corona radiata; however, the difference was statistically significant only for the thalamus. The MRI-visible parenchymal involvement of Behçet's disease causes a decrease in MTR. For the normal-appearing brain, although lacking statistical significance for the most regions studied, the tendency for higher MTR in NB patients compared with controls may offer an insight into the pathophysiology of Behçet's disease.
15669056	Previous immunohistochemical analysis revealed a wide distribution of L1cam-positive neural and nonneural structures in adult mouse brain. Although there were numerous punctate immunoreactive nerve terminals, only a few immunoreactive neuronal cell somata were present (Munakata et al. [2003] BMC Neurosci. 4:7). To explore the distribution of L1cam mRNA-containing cells, which are interpreted to be L1cam-producing cells, we performed in situ hybridization histochemistry with an antisense L1cam cRNA probe. L1cam mRNA was distributed widely from the olfactory bulb to the upper cervical cord with an uneven localization pattern in adult brain. All positive cell somata with silver grains after emulsion autoradiography were neuronal, and no grains were detected on nonneural cells in the present study. A high density of signals for neuronal L1cam mRNA was found in the thalamus, mammillary body, and hippocampus. In addition, strong hybridization signals were localized in various nuclei: main and accessory olfactory bulb, compact part of the substantia nigra, pontine gray matter, tegmental reticular nucleus, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, trigeminal motor nucleus, locus coeruleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, raphe nuclei, facial nucleus, ambiguus nucleus, dorsal motor vagal nucleus, and inferior olivary nucleus. Some long projection neurons such as the pyramidal, mitral, principal neurons of several cranial nuclei, and presumably monoaminergic cells containing noradrenalin, dopamine, and serotonin, expressed high levels of L1cam.
15707905	Performances of memorized piano compositions unfold via dynamic integrations of motor, perceptual, cognitive, and emotive operations. The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using (15)0-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test.
15708483	Widespread production of knockout and transgenic mice has led to an increased use of mice as animal models for studies of normal- and patho-physiology. Hence, the precise mapping of central transmitter/peptide systems in the mouse has become essential for the interpretation of functional studies and for the correct correlation with findings obtained in the rat, primates and/or human. In this regard, the current study reports the autoradiographic localization of [(125)I]-galanin (GAL) binding sites in brain of the common C57BL/6J and 129OlaHsd mouse strains, as well as in GAL and galanin receptor-1 (GalR1) knockout (KO) mice. In C57BL/6J and 129OlaHsd mice, [(125)I]-GAL binding sites were detected throughout the brain, including moderate-high relative densities in the basal ganglia (caudate putamen, nucleus [n.] accumbens, olfactory tubercle, substantia nigra), limbic regions (septum, bed n. stria terminalis, ventral hippocampus, amygdala), cingulate, retrosplenial, entorhinal cortex, centro-lateral/medial thalamic n., preoptic/lateral hypothalamus, midbrain (superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray), pons/medulla oblongata (parabrachial, pontine reticular and solitary tract n.) and cerebellar cortex. [(125)I]-GAL binding levels were low or absent in main olfactory bulb, neocortex, ventrolateral/geniculate thalamic n., dorsal hippocampus, inferior colliculus and cranial motor n. In simultaneous determinations, relative [(125)I]-GAL binding site densities in brain were generally lower in C57BL/6J than in 129OlaHsd mice, while the density and distribution of central binding in the GAL-KO mouse was essentially identical to that in its background-129OlaHsd strain. In contrast, no specific [(125)I]-GAL binding was detected in any region of GalR1-KO mouse brain, revealing that under the experimental conditions used, the peptide ligand binding is predominantly (exclusively) to the GalR1 subtype. This evaluation of GAL receptor site distribution in mouse brain has revealed similarities and some differences with the equivalent system in rat and provides a valuable reference for future comparative studies of central GAL transmission.
15713263	In order to determine the input of vocalization-controlling regions of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was injected in six squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) at PAG sites yielding vocalization when injected with the glutamate agonist homocysteic acid. Brains were scanned for retrogradely labeled areas common to all six animals. The results show that the vocalization-eliciting sites receive a widespread input, with the heaviest projections coming from the surrounding PAG, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus, medial preoptic region, substantia nigra pars diffusa, zona incerta and reticular formation of the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla. The heaviest cortical input reaches the PAG from the mediofrontal cortex. Moderate to weak projections come from the insula, lateral prefrontal, and premotor cortex as well as the superior and middle temporal cortex. Subcortical moderate to weak projections reach the PAG from the central and medial amygdala, nucleus of the stria terminalis, septum, nucleus accumbens, lateral preoptic region, lateral and posterior hypothalamus, globus pallidus, pretectal area, deep layers of the superior colliculus, the pericentral inferior colliculus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, locus coeruleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, dorsal and ventral raphe, vestibular nuclei, spinal trigeminal nucleus, solitary tract nucleus, and nucleus gracilis. The input of the periaqueductal vocalization-eliciting regions thus is dominated by limbic, motivation-controlling afferents; input, however, also comes from sensory, motor, arousal-controlling, and cognitive brain areas.
15713271	Previous research suggests that considerable species-specific variation exists in the neuroanatomical distributions of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MST), non-mammalian homologues of vasopressin and oxytocin. An earlier study in rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) indicated that the neuroanatomical distribution of cells labeled for AVT-immunoreactivity (ir) was greater in this urodele amphibian than in any other species. It was unknown whether the widespread distribution of AVT-ir is unique to T. granulosa or a feature common among salamanders. Using in situ hybridization (ISH) histochemistry and gene-specific riboprobes, the current study labeled AVT and MST mRNA in T. granulosa and the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani). In T. granulosa, AVT ISH-labeled cells were found to be widespread and localized in brain areas including the dorsal and medial pallium, lateral and medial septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, preoptic area, ventral hypothalamus, nucleus isthmus, tectum mesencephali, inferior colliculus, and hindbrain. In P. shermani, the distribution of AVT ISH-labeled neurons matched that of T. granulosa, except in the lateral septum, ventral hypothalamus, and inferior colliculus, but did however include labeled cell bodies in the lateral pallium. The distribution of MST ISH-labeled cells was more restricted than AVT ISH labeling and was limited to regions of the preoptic area and ventral thalamus, which is consistent with the limited distribution of MST/OXY in other vertebrates. These findings support the conclusion that urodele amphibians possess a well-developed vasotocin system, perhaps more extensive than other vertebrate taxa.
15763163	Most mammalian cells express two types of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptors (MPRs), which are involved in the sorting of lysosomal enzymes within the cells. They are referred to as cation-dependent (CD-) MPR and cation-independent (CI-) MPR/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR), based on their divalent cation requirements and the ability to bind IGF-II. The complementary actions of these two related but distinct MPRs in the sorting function suggest that they have different immunohistochemical distributions. To address this issue, we investigated the cellular distribution of CD-MPR immunoreactivity in the adult mouse central nervous system (CNS), and compared it with that of CI-MPR/IGF-IIR immunoreactivity, which we had previously investigated. These two immunoreactivities were localized in neurons of the CNS, with more intense labeling in the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the Broca's diagonal band, layers IV-VI of the cerebral neocortex, layers II-III of the entorhinal cortex, the habenular nucleus, the median eminence, several nuclei and structures of the brainstem, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Although intense immunoreactivities of both MPRs were observed in the same groups of neurons in the same regions, the spatial differences in immunoreactive intensity for CI-MPR/IGF-IIR were greater, particularly in the telencephalon such as the basal forebrain and cerebral cortex, than those for CD-MPR. These findings suggest that CD-MPR is ubiquitously necessary for the general function of neurons, whereas CI-MPR/IGF-IIR is selectively necessary for certain region- and neurotransmitter-specific functions of neurons.
15784304	Evolutionarily older brain systems, such as the limbic system, appear to serve fundamental aspects of emotional processing and provide relevant and motivational information for phylogenetically more recent brain systems to regulate complex behaviors. Overall, overt behavior is, in part, determined by the interactions of multiple learning and memory systems, some seemingly complementary and some actually competitive. An understanding of limbic system function in emotion and motivation requires that these subsystems be recognized and characterized as extended components of a distributed limbic network. Behavioral neuroscientists face the challenge of teasing apart the contributions of multiple overlapping neuronal systems in order to begin to elucidate the neural mechanisms of the limbic system and their contributions to behavior. One major consideration is to bring together conceptually the functions of individual components of the limbic forebrain and the related limbic midbrain systems. For example, in the rat the heterogeneous regions of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., prelimbic, anterior cingulate, subgenual cortices and orbito-frontal areas) make distinct contributions to emotional and motivational influences on behavior and each needs consideration in its own right. Major interacting structures of the limbic system include the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdaloid nuclear complex, limbic thalamus, hippocampal formation, nucleus accumbens (limbic striatum), anterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area and midbrain raphe nuclei; the latter comprising largely serotonergic components of the limbic midbrain system projecting to the forebrain. The posterior limbic midbrain complex comprising the stria medullaris, central gray and dorsal and ventral nuclei of Gudden are also key elements in the limbic midbrain. Some of these formations will be discussed in terms of the neurochemical connectivity between them. We put forward a systems approach in order to build a network model of the limbic forebrain/limbic midbrain system, and the interactions of its major components. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that the limbic system is both an anatomical entity as well as a physiological concept. We have considered this issue in detail in the introduction to this review. The components of these systems have usually been considered as functional units or 'centers' rather than being components of a larger, interacting, and distributed functional system. In that context, we are oriented toward considerations of distributed neural systems themselves as functional entities in the brain.
15820618	The NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors are heteromeric complexes comprised of multiple subunits encoded by at least seven different genes (NR1, NR2A-2D and NR3A-3B), and differential expression of these subunits alters the pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of NMDA receptors. NR3A is a recently identified unique modulatory subunit that decreases NMDA receptor current and calcium influx. In rodents, NR3A is developmentally expressed, displaying robust expression early in development that declines with age, reaching low levels in the adult brain. A distinct and highly selective pattern of expression is observed in the developing and mature rodent brain, suggesting that NR3A may play a very specific role in NMDA receptor-mediated processes. NR3A expression in other species, however, is unknown. Therefore, we examined the expression of NR3A mRNA and protein in the adult macaque brain. Our results indicate that NR3A mRNA is expressed throughout much of the adult primate brain, and at high levels in specific brain regions including the neocortex, substantia nigra par compacta and cerebellum, as well as select areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and hypothalamus. Western blot analysis reflects that this protein is translated and expressed in multiple brain regions. In contrast to the rat mRNA, our results suggest that NR3A transcript is widely expressed in the adult primate brain. Particular enrichment in some brain areas may reflect brain-region or circuit-specific functions for this NMDA receptor subunit.
15832060	We tested the feasibility of a fully automated brain MRI voxel count technique--automated labeling pathway (ALP)--in a sample of 15 demented and 13 cognitively normal women (age 75-85 years) participating to the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). We hypothesized that ALP would replicate well-established findings of the anatomical correlates of dementia. In particular, we hypothesized that ALP volumetric measures would: (1) significantly differ between cognitively normal and demented women in those brain areas that are established markers for diagnosis of dementia (temporal and medial temporal lobes, hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampus) but not in other brain areas (e.g., occipital lobe, visual cortex, motor cortex) and (2) correlate with visual ratings of brain disease which have been previously collected as part of the CHS. ALP required minimal operator intervention (input of brain images and verification of misalignments) and employed computer time of about 1 h per brain. ALP detected significant focal volumetric differences in the limbic system (p values between groups for hippocampus and parahippocampus: 0.002 and 0.005, respectively), temporal lobe (p < 0.0001) and caudate (p = 0.009), but not in other brain areas (e.g. occipital lobe, visual or motor cortex). Furthermore, ALP measures of medial temporal lobe atrophy strongly correlated with CHS visual ratings of ventricular enlargement (r(2) = 0.6, p = 0.002 for medial temporal lobe). In conclusion, ALP-detected focal brain atrophy was strongly associated with dementia. Because of its fully automated design, ALP technique is an ideal candidate to assess whether volumetric measures of specific areas can discriminate dementia better than currently available measures of global brain atrophy in large epidemiological studies.
15837002	Although toluene is a widely abused substance, the neuronal populations and pathways mediating its effects are not well understood. Using c-Fos protein as a marker for neuronal activation, the present study investigated the pattern of c-Fos induction at 1h after various doses (0, 300, 750, and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) of toluene injection in adult male rats. Quantitative analysis of Fos-immunoreactive neurons indicated toluene dose-related induced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the majority of structures examined. The structures included several cortex subareas (primary motor cortex, secondary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, frontal association cortex, cigulate cortex area 1, cigulate cortex area 2, prelimbic cortex, infralimbic cortex, retrosplenial agranular cortex, ventral orbital cortex, lateral orbital cortex, and piriform cortex), ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens shell, thalamic nuclei (mediodorsal, lateral posterior, and laterodorsal ventrolateral) and pontine nuclei. However, the substantia nigra, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens core, subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus and cerebellum were almost unaffected. The data demonstrate that toluene dose-related induced a unique pattern of c-Fos immunoreactivity. The widespread distribution of toluene-induced c-Fos expression seen in this study can be linked to the profound alterations in physiological function and behavior produced by this solvent.
15837133	We recently identified the protein kinase C-enhanced protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor KEPI based on its morphine-induced upregulation in striatum. Regulation of protein serine/threonine dephosphorylation by PP1 can modulate important brain signaling pathways. To improve understanding of KEPI's role in the brain, we have developed anti-KEPI sera in rabbits immunized with a hemocyanin conjugate of KEPI residues 66-80, characterized the specificity that this serum provides, mapped the distribution of immunoreactive KEPI (iKEPI) in mouse brain, rat dorsal root ganglia and striatal cultures and documented KEPI binding to PP1 in vitro. Staining is found in apparently neuronal processes and, often less intensely, in neuronal perikarya in primary cultures and in neurons and neuronal elements from a number of brain regions. iKEPI fiber/terminal patterns are relatively densely distributed in striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, paraventricular thalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, raphe nuclei, nucleus caudalis of the spinal tract of the trigeminal and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. iKEPI-positive cell bodies lie in the nucleus accumbens, striatum, lateral septal nucleus, granular layer of dentate gyrus, interpeduncular nucleus, dorsal root ganglia and cerebellar vermis. These expression patterns point to possible roles for KEPI in regulating protein dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP1 activities in a number of brain pathways likely to use several different neurotransmitters and to participate in a number of brain functions. Dense KEPI immunoreactivity in nucleus accumbens perikarya, combined with evidence for its regulation by opiates, supports possible roles for KEPI in molecular signal transduction pathways important for drug reward and addiction.
15872014	To investigate postoperative changes in the cerebral glucose metabolism of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed on pre- and postoperative (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) images. We included 28 patients with MTLE who had undergone surgery and had been seizure-free postoperatively (16 had left MTLE and 12 right MTLE). All patients showed hippocampal sclerosis by pathology or brain MRI. FDG-PET images of the 12 right temporal lobe epilepsy patients were reversed to lateralize the epileptogenic zone to the left side in all patients. Application of the paired t-test in SPM to pre- and postoperative FDG-PETs showed that postoperative glucose metabolism decreased in the caudate nucleus, the pulvinar of the thalamus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus and the posterior region of the insular cortex in the hemisphere ipsilateral to resection, whereas postoperative glucose metabolism increased in the anterior region of the insular cortex, temporal stem white matter, midbrain, inferior precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus and supramarginal gyrus in the hemisphere ipsilateral to resection. No significant postsurgical changes in cerebral glucose metabolism occurred in the contralateral hemisphere. Subtraction between pre- and postoperative FDG-PET images in individual patients produced similar findings to the SPM results, and additionally showed that postoperative glucose metabolism increased in the anterior thalamus in 12/28 patients (42.8%). SISCOM (subtraction ictal-interictal SPECT co-registered to MRI) performed in 17 patients showed ictal hyperperfusion in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, including the temporal stem white matter, midbrain, insular cortex and cingulate gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia and thalami, and multiple small regions in the frontoparietal lobes during seizures. This study suggests that brain regions showing a postoperative increase in glucose metabolism appear to represent the propagation pathways of ictal and interictal epileptic discharges in MTLE, whereas the postoperative decrease in glucose metabolism may be related to a permanent loss of afferents from resected anterior-mesial temporal structures.
15893562	The distribution of PrP(BSE) in the brain of nine confirmed BSE field cases was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and compared to the levels of PrP(BSE) determined by two rapid tests (Prionics-Check WESTERN and Prionics-Check LIA). Each brain was dissected into 16 areas: spinal cord, medulla oblongata, pons, mesencephalon, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellar vermis, cerebellar medulla, cerebellar hemispheres, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, frontal cortex, piriform lobe and olfactory bulbs. The highest levels of PrP(BSE) were detected in the medulla oblongata, spinal cord and pons, and correspondingly both rapid tests showed 100% correlation with the immunohistochemistry with regard to sensitivity and specificity. Some inconsistencies between the levels of PrP(BSE) determined either by immunohistochemistry or by the rapid tests were found in brain areas with medium to low levels of PrP(BSE). These brain areas included the cerebellar hemisphere, olfactory bulb, and the temporal and parietal cortices. A brain PrP(BSE) distribution curve (BPDC) was designed by plotting the PrP(BSE) signals obtained from the two rapid tests versus the anatomical region along the caudal-rostral axis of the brain. Comparison of the BPDC of the nine BSE cases showed that all cases had a similar PrP(BSE) distribution in the brain but with variable intensities, which could be explained by different stages in the progression of the disease. We propose that the BPDC could be used as a tool to differentiate classical cases of BSE from the recently identified atypical BSE cases.
15900511	LY334370 is a high affinity, selective agonist at the 5-HT(1F) receptor. On this basis, the tritiated compound was examined for its utility in autoradiography to localize the 5-HT(1F) receptor in rat and guinea pig brain regions. Specific 5-HT(1F) receptor binding in rat brain was found in layers 4-5 of all cortical regions examined, as well as olfactory bulb and tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, medial mammillary nucleus, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, and several amygdaloid nuclei. In guinea pig brain, the [(3)H]LY334370 binding sites were found at highest density in claustrum, but also in a layer of the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and medial mammillary nucleus. Some species differences in the distribution of the 5-HT(1F) receptor were noted. Side by side comparison of rat brain autoradiography with [(3)H]LY334370 and [(3)H]sumatriptan showed labeling in the same brain regions. Preliminary binding studies in rhesus monkey and human brain sections showed [(3)H]LY334370 binding in cortical layers 4-5, subiculum (in the monkey), and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. These findings suggest a discrete localization of the 5-HT(1F) receptor in the rat, guinea pig, monkey and human brain, and confirms the utility of [(3)H]LY334370 as a potential tool to explore further the localization and possible functions of the 5-HT(1F) receptor.
15910774	Neuropeptide B (NPB) is a recently identified endogenous ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptors GPR7 and GPR8. NPB mRNA is expressed in the human, rat, and mouse brain. With the use of an antiserum directed against the rat NPB, immunoreactivity to NPB (irNPB) was detected in several discrete areas of the hypothalamus and midbrain. In the hypothalamus, irNPB cells were present in the medial preoptic area and nucleus, ventromedial preoptic nucleus, retrochiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, accessory neurosecretory nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic retrochiasmatic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, posterior hypothalamic area, dorsal hypothalamic area, and zona incerta. A few irNPB perikarya were noted in the arcuate nucleus, whereas a dense network of nerve fibers was present in the median eminence. In the midbrain, irNPB somata were noted in the substantia nigra (compact, reticular, medial, and lateral parts), paranigral nucleus, ventral tegmental area, interfascicular nucleus, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Neurons in the Edinger-Westphal were strongly labeled. Labeled cells were not detected in the cortex, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord; few lightly labeled cells were occasionally seen in the hippocampus. Double labeling the hypothalamic sections with NPB antiserum and vasopressin or oxytocin antibody revealed that a population of vasopressin- but not oxytocin-immunoreactive cells was irNPB. Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the midbrain, presumably dopaminergic, were irNPB. The distribution of irNPB neurons in several areas of the hypothalamus and midbrain together with the colocalization with vasopressin or tyrosine hydroxylase suggests that the peptide may subserve neuroendocrine, autonomic, and motor functions.
15944025	The distribution of galanin mRNA-expressing cells and galanin-immunoreactive (IR) cell bodies and processes was studied in the brain of mice overexpressing galanin under the PDGF-B promoter (GalOE mice) and of wild type (WT) mice, both in colchicine-treated and non-treated animals. A widespread ectopic expression of galanin (both mRNA and peptide) was found, that is when neither transcript nor peptide could be seen in WT mice, not even after colchicine treatment. However, in some regions, such as claustrum, basolateral amygdala, thalamus, CA1 pyramidal cells, and Purkinje cells only galanin mRNA could be detected. The highest levels of galanin expression were observed in the forebrain structures (the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, throughout the cortex, granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus), in the mesencephalon (nucleus ruber), in the cerebellum (lateral cerebellar nucleus), in the pons (sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve), within the medulla oblongata (facial, prepositus and spinal trigeminal nuclei). High densities of galanin-IR fibers were found in the axonal terminals of the lateral olfactory tract, hippocampal and presumably cerebellar mossy fiber system, in several thalamic and hypothalamic regions and the lower brain stem.
15950311	We have recently identified a Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 interacting zinc-finger protein (MIZIP) from a human brain cDNA library. Here, we report the generation of a specific antibody against MIZIP and its distribution in rodent tissues using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical techniques. MIZIP was detected as a 27 kDa protein in brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, and to a lower extend, in lung, testis, and heart. Subcellular fractionation of adult mouse brain revealed the presence of MIZIP and MCHR1 in the cytoplasmic, membrane, and synaptosomal fraction, but not in a postsynaptic density preparation. In cultured rat, embryonic hippocampal neurons MIZIP is somatodendritically localized. In the adult rodent brain, MIZIP is widely distributed. High levels of expression were detected in brain regions involved in olfaction, feeding behavior, sensorimotor integration, and learning and memory, for example, the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the thalamus and hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus formation, and the cerebellum. Co-expression of MIZIP and MCHR1 was observed, for example, in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, in neurons of the olivary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, pontine, and mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. However, there are also differences in the expression patterns, for example, high expression of MCHR1 was detected in the lateral habenula, but no expression of MIZIP. These data support the notion that MIZIP might interact with MCHR1 in a cell type specific manner in vivo, suggesting a role in the regulation of MCH signalling in distinct regions of the mammalian brain.
15952170	In contrast to mammals, fish exhibit an enormous potential to produce new cells in the adult brain. By labeling mitotically dividing cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), we have characterized the development of these cells in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Proliferation zones were located in specific regions of the olfactory bulb, dorsal telencephalon (including a region presumably homologous to the mammalian hippocampus), preoptic area, dorsal zone of the periventricular hypothalamus, optic tectum, torus longitudinalis, vagal lobe, parenchyma near the rhombencephalic ventricle, and in a region of the medulla oblongata lateral to the vagal motor nucleus, as well as in all three subdivisions of the cerebellum, the valvula cerebelli, the corpus cerebelli, and the lobus caudalis cerebelli. In the valvula cerebelli and the corpus cerebelli, the young cells migrated from their site of origin in the molecular layers to the corresponding granule cell layers. By contrast, in the lobus caudalis cerebelli and optic tectum, no indication of a migration of the newly generated cells over wider distances could be obtained. BrdU-labeled cells remained present in the brain over at least 292 days post-BrdU administration, indicating a long-term survival of a significant portion of the newly generated cells. The combination of BrdU immunohistochemistry with immunolabeling against the neural marker protein Hu, or with retrograde tracing, suggested a neuronal differentiation in a large portion of the young cells.
15977170	The present study focuses on the topographical distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing cell bodies and fibers and their connections and pathways in the rat forebrain. We confirm previously reported CGRP projections from the perifornical area of the hypothalamus to the lateral septum, from the posterior thalamus to the caudate putamen and cerebral cortex, and from the parabrachial nuclei to the central extended amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and ventromedial thalamus. Despite previous descriptions of CGRP in the central nervous system, important neuroanatomical aspects of the forebrain CGRP system remained obscure, which we addressed by using brain lesion techniques combined with modern immunohistology. We first report CGRP terminal fields in the olfactory-anterior septal region and also CGRP projections from the parabrachial nuclei to the olfactory-anterior septal region, the medial prefrontal cortex, the interstitial nucleus of the anterior commissure, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the anterior amygdaloid area, the posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus, and the dorsolateral part of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus. In addition, we identified a CGRP cell group in the premamillary nuclei and showed that it projects to the medial CGRP layer of the lateral septum. CGRP fibers usually join other pathways rather than forming bundles. They run along the fornix from the hypothalamus, along the supraoptic decussations or the inferior thalamic peduncle-stria terminalis pathway from the posterior thalamus, and along the superior cerebellar peduncle, thalamic fasciculus, and ansa peduncularis from the parabrachial nuclei. This description of the forebrain CGRP system will facilitate investigation of its role in higher brain functions.
16005549	The effect of age was investigated in and compared across 16 automatically segmented brain measures: cortical gray matter, cerebral white matter, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, the accumbens area, caudate, putamen, pallidum, brainstem, cerebellar cortex, cerebellar white matter, the lateral ventricle, the inferior lateral ventricle, and the 3rd and 4th ventricle. Significant age effects were found for all volumes except pallidum and the 4th ventricle. Heterogeneous age responses were seen in that age relationships for cortex, amygdala, thalamus, the accumbens area, and caudate were linear, while cerebral white matter, hippocampus, brainstem, cerebellar white, and gray matter, as well as volume of the lateral, inferior lateral, and 3rd ventricles showed curvilinear relationships with age. In general, the findings point to global and large effects of age across brain volumes.
16024703	To identify regions of the caprine diencephalone and pituitary gland related to transportation stress, the expression of c-fos protein was examined immunohistochemically as an indicator of neural activation. Ten castrated Shiba goats (Capra hircus), five transported and five controls, were used. Transported goats were trucked for 1 h and killed by transcardiac perfusion 1 h after the end of transportation. Control goats were housed in single pens killed in the same manner and at the same time as the transported goats. The diencephalon and the pituitary gland were removed after perfusion and used for immunostaining. Plasma cortisol concentrations during and after transportation also were investigated. During transportation, plasma cortisol concentrations increased (P < 0.05) compared with those in the controls. In the diencephalon, c-fos immunoreactive cells were detected in the subcallosa, the lateral septal area, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), the preoptic hypothalamic area (POA), the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the supraoptic nucleus, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus parvocellular (PVNp), the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus magnocellular (PVNm), the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, and the stria medullaris in both control and transported goats. The numbers of c-fos immunoreactive cells were increased (P < 0.05) by transportation in the PVNm, the PVNp, the BNST, the POA, the ARC, and the SCN (P < 0.10). In the anterior pituitary gland, the number of c-fos immunoreactive cells in transported goats was 4 to 30 times as much as in control goats; however, there were no differences in the intermediate and posterior lobes between control and transported goats. This study has identified regions in the caprine diencephalon and pituitary gland that show transport-induced increases in c-fos immunoreactive cells. In conclusion, the PVNm, the PVNp, the BNST, the POA, the SCN in the diencephalons, and the anterior lobe of pituitary gland may be involved in the stress responses of goats to transportation.
16059845	Serotonin is widely believed to exert inhibitory control over aggressive behavior and intent. In addition, a number of studies of fish, reptiles, and mammals, including the lizard Anolis carolinensis, have demonstrated that serotonergic activity is stimulated by aggressive social interaction in both dominant and subordinate males. As serotonergic activity does not appear to inhibit agonistic behavior during combative social interaction, we investigated the possibility that the negative correlation between serotonergic activity and aggression exists before aggressive behavior begins. To do this, putatively dominant and more aggressive males were determined by their speed overcoming stress (latency to feeding after capture) and their celerity to court females. Serotonergic activities before aggression are differentiated by social rank in a region-specific manner. Among aggressive males baseline serotonergic activity is lower in the septum, nucleus accumbens, striatum, medial amygdala, anterior hypothalamus, raphe, and locus ceruleus but not in the hippocampus, lateral amygdala, preoptic area, substantia nigra, or ventral tegmental area. However, in regions such as the nucleus accumbens, where low serotonergic activity may help promote aggression, agonistic behavior also stimulates the greatest rise in serotonergic activity among the most aggressive males, most likely as a result of the stress associated with social interaction.
16084647	The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is a key part of a ring of cells extending between the centromedial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis referred to as the extended amygdala. The present study describes the architecture of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the connections of subnuclei in posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The hamster bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is readily allotted to anterior and posterior divisions separated by the fibers of the body of the anterior commissure. The anterior division has four subnuclei: anteromedial, anterointermediate, anterolateral, and anteroventral. Within the posterior division, there are three distinct regions: posteromedial, posterointermediate, and posterolateral. In hamsters, the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis contributes to male sexual behavior, particularly chemoinvestigation. Moreover, the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is part of a neural circuit essential for mating, including the medial amygdaloid nucleus and medial preoptic area. The connections of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posteromedial part, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterointermediate part and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterolateral part were visualized by co-injection of anterograde (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin) and retrograde (cholera toxin B) tract tracers. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterointermediate part and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posteromedial part have dense bidirectional connections with medial amygdaloid nucleus and cortical amygdala via the stria terminalis and ventral amygdalofugal pathway. These subnuclei also maintain bidirectional connections with steroid-concentrating areas including lateral septum, medial preoptic area, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterointermediate part and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posteromedial part receive projections from the subiculum and send projections to deep mesencephalic nuclei. By contrast, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterolateral part is connected with the central amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, subthalamic nucleus, nucleus accumbens, substantia innominata, substantia nigra and thalamus. Thus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterointermediate part and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posteromedial part have similar connections with areas involved in social behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterolateral part maintains connections with areas involved in motivational circuits. This supports the concept of distinct circuits within the extended amygdala which differentially link the centromedial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.
16123206	Neuronal activity has been shown to be attenuated in cardiorespiratory and locomotor centers of the brain in response to a single bout of exercise in trained (TR) vs. untrained (UN) animals, but the mechanisms remain obscure. Based on this finding, dendritic branching patterns of seven brain areas associated with cardiorespiratory and locomotor activity were examined in TR and UN animals. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were kept in individual cages and divided into TR and UN. TR were provided with a running wheel and exercised spontaneously. After 85 or 120 days, exercise training indexes were obtained, including maximal oxygen consumption, percent body fat, resting heart rate, and heart weight-to-body weight ratios. The brain was removed and processed according to a modified Golgi-Cox procedure. Impregnated neurons from seven brain areas were examined in coronal sections: the periaqueductal gray, posterior hypothalamic area, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, rostral ventrolateral medulla, cuneiform nucleus, nucleus cuneatus, and cerebral cortex. Neurons were traced using a camera lucida technique and analyzed using the Sholl analysis of dendritic branching. t-tests were conducted to compare the mean number of intersections per neuron by grouping inner rings and outer rings and also comparing the total number of intersections per animal. There were significant differences between groups in the posterior hypothalamic area, periaqueductal gray, cuneiform nucleus, and nucleus of the tractus solitarius in the inner rings, outer rings, and the total number of intersections per animal. Our results show that dendritic fields of neurons in important cardiorespiratory and locomotor centers of the brain are attenuated in TR animals.
16133591	We studied the distribution of neurokinin B-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the cat brainstem using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The highest density of immunoreactive fibers was found in the motor trigeminal nucleus, the laminar and alaminar spinal trigeminal nuclei, the facial nucleus, the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, the locus coeruleus, the cuneiform nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, the lateral tegmental field, the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, the inferior central nucleus, the periaqueductal gray, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and in the inferior vestibular nucleus. Immunoreactive cell bodies containing neurokinin B were observed, for example, in the locus coeruleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the median division of the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, the lateral tegmental field, the pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus, the internal division of the lateral reticular nucleus, the inferior central nucleus, the periaqueductal gray, the postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, and in the medial nucleus of the solitary tract. This widespread distribution of neurokinin B in the cat brainstem suggests that the neuropeptide could be involved in many different physiological functions. In comparison with previous studies carried out in the rat brainstem on the distribution of neurokinin B, our results point to a more widespread distribution of this neuropeptide in the cat brainstem.
16142372	A wealth of knowledge exists regarding calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE1) in normal mammalian tissues. However, much remains to be known about the enzyme in human brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM). PDE1 has not been investigated in GBM relative to normal brain and remains an important area of investigation. In this review, we have summarized the works that have been carried out in our laboratory on the potential role of PDE1 in GBM. In the normal brain, PDE1 is localized in all four principal parts of the brain: cerebrum, diencephalon, brainstem and cerebellum. Specifically, PDE1 is concentrated in anatomically distinct regions of the brain including the striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, subiculum, Purkinjie cells, the external layer of the developing cerebellum and the cerebral cortex. In contrast, PDE1 is found to be very low in the GBM tissue compared to normal cerebral cortex tissue. However, the discovery of an inhibitor in the tumor tissue is interesting and definitely warrants further investigation, particularly, in relation to its possible interaction with PDE1.
16143859	The projections from the perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, parasubiculum, and presubiculum to the thalamus were examined using both anterograde and retrograde tracers. Attention focused on the routes taken by these projections, which were delineated by combining surgical tract section with the placement of a tracer. Projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei almost exclusively used the fornix. These relatively light projections, which arose from all areas of the entorhinal cortex, from the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and area 35 of the perirhinal cortex, terminated mainly in the anterior ventral nucleus. In contrast, the projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus from the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum and parasubiculum were denser than those to the anterior thalamic nuclei. The projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus used two routes. While nearly all of the projections from the subicular complex used the fornix, many of the entorhinal cortex projections passed caudally in the temporopulvinar bundle to reach the lateral dorsal nucleus. The perirhinal cortex, as well as the entorhinal cortex, also projects to nucleus medialis dorsalis. These projections exclusively used the external capsule and thence the inferior thalamic peduncle. Other temporal-thalamic projections included those to the medial pulvinar, via the temporopulvinar bundle, from the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, and those to the paraventricular nucleus from the entorhinal cortex. By identifying these routes, it is possible to appreciate how different lesions might disconnect temporal-diencephalic pathways and so contribute to memory disorders.
16144601	In the fire-bellied toad Bombina orientalis, the connectivity and cytoarchitecture of telencephalic structures were studied by intracellular, anterograde and retrograde biocytin labelling in order to elucidate the neuronal basis of fear conditioning and context learning in amphibians. Our findings suggest the existence of a central amygdala-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex in the caudal mid-ventral telencephalon, a vomeronasal amygdala in the caudolateral ventral telencephalon, an olfactory amygdala in the caudal pole of the telencephalon lateral of the vomeronasal amygdala, and a ventromedially situated "medial" amygdala, which is assumed to be functionally equivalent to the basolateral amygdala of mammals. A ventromedial cellular column forms a nucleus accumbens rostrally and continues caudally into a shell-like ventral pallidum. A lateral column constitutes a dorsal striatum proper rostrally, a dorsal pallidum caudally, and a mixed striato-pallidum at intermediate levels. We conclude that the caudal mediolateral complex consisting of an extended central, vomeronasal and olfactory amygdala of anurans represents the ancestral equivalent of the amygdaloid complex of tetrapods. During the evolution of the mammalian telencephalon, this complex apparently was shifted medially and involuted.
16154279	Nitric oxide (NO) modulates a variety of processes in the mammalian brain, but the mechanisms of neuronal NO signaling are poorly understood. In the periphery, many effects of NO are mediated via the generation of the second messenger cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI). However, previous studies suggested that the expression of cGKI in the nervous system is rather restricted, thus, questioning the functional significance of the cGMP/cGKI pathway as a mediator of NO signaling in the brain. Here we have performed a detailed immunohistochemical study to elucidate the distribution of cGKI in the CNS and eye of the mouse. Expression of cGKI protein was detected not only in the previously described areas (cerebellum, hippocampus, dorsomedial hypothalamus) but also in a number of additional regions, such as medulla, subcommissural organ, cerebral cortex, amygdala, habenulae, various hypothalamic regions, olfactory bulb, pituitary gland, and retina. Immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies indicated that the cGKIalpha isoform is prominent in the cerebellum and medulla, whereas the cGKIbeta isoform is predominant in the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb. Similar levels of the isoforms were detected in the pituitary gland and eye. Thus, it appears that distinct brain regions express distinct cGKI isoforms that signal via distinct pathways. Together, these results improve our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of NO/cGMP/cGKI signaling and indicate that the distribution and functional relevance of this pathway in the mammalian brain is broader than previously thought.
16165303	A comprehensive three-dimensional digital atlas database of the C57BL/6J mouse brain was developed based on magnetic resonance microscopy images acquired on a 17.6-T superconducting magnet. By using both manual tracing and an atlas-based semi-automatic segmentation approach, T2-weighted magnetic resonance microscopy images of 10 adult male formalin-fixed, excised C57BL/6J mouse brains were segmented into 20 anatomical structures. These structures included the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulbs, basal forebrain and septum, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray, superior colliculi, inferior colliculi, the rest of midbrain, cerebellum, brainstem, corpus callosum/external capsule, internal capsule, anterior commissure, fimbria, and ventricles. The segmentation data were formatted and stored into a database containing three different atlas types: 10 single-specimen brain atlases, an average brain atlas and a probabilistic atlas. Additionally, quantitative group information, such as variations in structural volume, surface area, magnetic resonance microscopy image intensity and local geometry, were computed and stored as an integral part of the database. The database augments ongoing efforts with other high priority strains as defined by the Mouse Phenome Database focused on providing a quantitative framework for accurate mapping of functional, genetic and protein expression patterns acquired by a myriad of technologies and imaging modalities.
16196030	This paper describes the quantitative areal and laminar distribution of identified neuron populations projecting from areas of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to subcortical autonomic, motor, and limbic sites in the rat. Injections of the retrograde pathway tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were made into dorsal/ventral striatum (DS/VS), basolateral amygdala (BLA), mediodorsal thalamus (MD), lateral hypothalamus (LH), mediolateral septum, dorsolateral periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus tractus solitarius, rostral/caudal ventrolateral medulla, or thoracic spinal cord (SC). High-resolution flat-map density distributions of retrogradely labelled neurons indicated that specific PFC regions were differentially involved in the projections studied, with medial (m)PFC divided into dorsal and ventral sectors. The percentages that WGA-HRP retrogradely labelled neurons composed of the projection neurons in individual layers of infralimbic (IL; area 25) prelimbic (PL; area 32), and dorsal anterior cingulate (ACd; area 24b) cortices were calculated. Among layer 5 pyramidal cells, approximately 27.4% in IL/PL/ACd cortices projected to LH, 22.9% in IL/ventral PL to VS, 18.3% in ACd/dorsal PL to DS, and 8.1% in areas IL/PL to BLA; and 37% of layer 6 pyramidal cells in IL/PL/ACd projected to MD. Data for other projection pathways are given. Multiple dual retrograde fluorescent tracing studies indicated that moderate populations (<9%) of layer 5 mPFC neurons projected to LH/VS, LH/SC, or VS/BLA. The data provide new quantitative information concerning the density and distribution of neurons involved in identified projection pathways from defined areas of the rat PFC to specific subcortical targets involved in dynamic goal-directed behavior.
16196033	Chemokines and their receptors are well described in the immune system, where they promote cell migration and activation. In the central nervous system, chemokine has been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes. However, an increasing number of evidence suggests that they have regulatory functions in the normal nervous system, where they could participate in cell communication. In this work, using a semiquantitative immunohistochemistry approach, we provide the first neuroanatomical mapping of constitutive neuronal CCR2 localization. Neuronal expression of CCR2 was observed in the anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and in the brainstem and cerebellum. These data are largely in accordance with results obtained using quantitative autoradiography with [(125)I]MCP-1/CCL2 and RT-PCR CCR2 mRNA analysis. Furthermore, using dual fluorescent immunohistochemistry we studied the chemical phenotype of labeled neurons and demonstrated the coexistence of CCR2 with classical neurotransmitters. Indeed, localization of CCR2 immunostaining is observed in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area as well as in cholinergic neurons in the substantia innominata and caudate putamen. Finally, we show that the preferential CCR2 ligand, MCP-1/CCL2, elicits Ca(2+) transients in primary cultured neurons from various rat brain regions including the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon. In conclusion, the constitutive neuronal CCR2 expression in selective brain structures suggests that this receptor could be involved in neuronal communication and possibly associated with cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and related disorders.
16197579	The present study examined: (i) age-induced regional changes in fatty acid composition of brain phospholipids; (ii) alpha-linolenic acid deficiency-induced regional depletion and recovery of DHA in the brain. DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) did not distribute evenly in the brain. In weaning and adult rats, the region with the highest DHA percentage was the cortex whereas the medulla had the lowest DHA percentage. In the aged rats, both the cortex and cerebellum were the regions with the highest DHA percentage whereas in the neonatal rats, the striatum had the greatest percentage of DHA, and the hypothalamus and hippocampus had the least percentage of DHA. Regarding AA, the hippocampus was the region that had the highest percentage whereas the medulla was the region with the lowest percentage except for the neonatal rats, whose cerebellum, hypothalamus, striatum and midbrain had AA percentage lower than hippocampus and cortex. DHA was not proportionally depleted in various regions of brain when the rats were maintained on an n-3-deficient diet for two generations. The results demonstrated that the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum and hypothalamus had DHA depleted by >71 %, whereas the midbrain and medulla had only 64 and 57 % DHA depleted, respectively. The most important observation was that the diet reversal for 12 weeks resulted in complete DHA recovery in all regions except for the medulla where the recovery was only 62 %. It was concluded that the location of DHA, n-3 deficiency-induced DHA depletion and reversibility of DHA deficiency across the brain were region-specific.
16213061	Subthreshold electrical stimulation of the amygdala (kindling) activates neuronal pathways increasing the expression of several neuropeptides including thyrotropin releasing-hormone (TRH). Partial kindling enhances TRH expression and the activity or its inactivating ectoenzyme; once kindling is established (stage V), TRH and its mRNA levels are further increased but TRH-binding and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase II (PPII) activity decreased in epileptogenic areas. To determine whether variations in TRH receptor binding or PPII activity are due to regulation of their synthesis, mRNA levels of TRH receptors (R1, R2) and PPII were semi-quantified by RT-PCR in amygdala, frontal cortex and hippocampus of kindled rats sacrificed at stage II or V. Increased mRNA levels of PPII were found at stage II in amygdala and frontal cortex, and of pro-TRH and TRH-R2, in amygdala and hippocampus. At stage V, pro-TRH mRNA levels increased and those of PPII, decreased in the three regions; TRH-R2 mRNA levels diminished in amygdala and frontal cortex and of TRH-R1 only in amygdala. In situ hybridization analyses revealed, at stage II, enhanced TRH-R1 mRNA levels in dentate gyrus and amygdala while decreased in piriform cortex; those of TRH-R2 increased in amygdala, CA2, dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, thalamus and subiculum and of PPII, in CAs and piriform cortex. In contrast, at stage V decreased expression of TRH-R1 occurred in amygdala, CA2/3, dentate gyrus and piriform cortex; of TRH-R2 in CA2, thalamus and piriform cortex, and of PPII in CA2, and amygdala. The magnitude of changes differed between ipsi and contralateral side. These results support a trans-synaptic modulation of all elements involved in TRH transmission in conditions that stimulate the activity of TRHergic neurons. They show that reported changes in PPII activity or TRH-binding caused by kindling relate to regulation of the expression of TRH receptors and degrading enzyme.
16237362	The clinical value of MR spectroscopy is now well established and this technique has been added to the current French classification of medical acts (CCAM). This paper presents a set of normal control values for 3 metabolite ratios obtained using a PRESS sequence with a TE of 135 ms at 1.5T: NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr and Cho/CR. Spectroscopy data acquisition were obtained from the following 12 anatomical regions: parieto-occipital white matter, centrum semiovale, frontal white matter, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum (hemisphere, including dentate nucleus), brain stem (including pons, medulla and midbrain), anterior and posterior temporal lobe, parietal, occipital and pre-frontal cortices. The presented data allow radiologists equipped with a similar MR system to implement a clinical spectroscopy program without undergoing research protocols in order to obtain control values.
16255003	This article discusses the neuroanatomical systems involved in the related functions of fear and discernment of the consequences of one's actions, two internal constraints on free will and action. Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the spinal cord to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the PAG and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The amygdala interacts with the cortical sensory systems in the assessment of fear-related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, especially the "medial prefrontal network," is connected to the amygdala, hypothalamus, and PAG, and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex. The overall function of this circuit is unclear, but may be involved in introspective monitoring of the individual.
16255031	The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha2 subunit was the first neuronal nAChR to be cloned. However, data for the distribution of alpha2 mRNA in the rodent exists in only a few studies. Therefore, we investigated the expression of alpha2 mRNA in the rat and mouse central nervous systems using nonradioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry. We detected strong hybridization signals in cell bodies located in the internal plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, the interpeduncular nucleus of the midbrain, the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei, the median raphe nucleus of the pons, the ventral part of the medullary reticular nucleus, the ventral horn in the spinal cord of both rats and mice, and in a few Purkinje cells of rats, but not of mice. Cells that moderately express alpha2 mRNA were localized to the cerebral cortex layers V and VI, the subiculum, the oriens layer of CA1, the medial septum, the diagonal band complex, the substantia innominata, and the amygdala of both animals. They were also located in a few midbrain nuclei of rats, whereas in mice they were either few or absent in these areas. However, in the upper medulla oblongata alpha2 mRNA was expressed in several large neurons of the gigantocellular reticular nucleus and the raphe magnus nucleus of mice, but not of rats. The data obtained show that a similar pattern of alpha2 mRNA expression exists in both rats and mice, with the exception of a few regions, and provide the basis for cellular level analysis.
16289278	Agonist stimulation of opioid receptors increases feeding in rodents, while opioid antagonists inhibit food intake. The pan-opioid antagonist, LY255582, produces a sustained reduction in food intake and body weight in rodent models of obesity. However, the specific receptor subtype(s) responsible for this activity is unknown. To better characterize the pharmacology of LY255582, we examined the binding of a radiolabeled version of the molecule, [(3)H]-LY255582, in mouse brain using autoradiography. In mouse brain homogenates, the K(d) and B(max) for [(3)H]-LY255582 were 0.156 +/- 0.07 nM and 249 +/- 14 fmol/mg protein, respectively. [(3)H]-LY255582 bound to slide mounted sections of mouse brain with high affinity and low non-specific binding. High levels of binding were seen in areas consistent with the known localization of opioid receptors. These areas included the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, claustrum, medial habenula, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus and ventral tegmental area. We compared the binding distribution of [(3)H]-LY255582 to the opioid receptor antagonist radioligands [(3)H]-naloxone (mu), [(3)H]-naltrindole (delta) and [(3)H]-norBNI (kappa). The overall distribution of [(3)H]-LY255582 binding sites was similar to that of the other ligands. No specific [(3)H]-LY255582 binding was noted in sections of mu-, delta- and kappa-receptor combinatorial knockout mice. Therefore, it is likely that LY255582 produces its effects on feeding and body weight gain through a combination of mu-, delta- and kappa-receptor activity.
16292643	In four squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), the tracer biotin dextranamine (BDA) was injected into the ventrolateral pons at a site at which injection of the glutamate antagonist kynurenic acid blocked vocalization electrically elicited from the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Anterograde projections could be traced into all cranial motor and sensory nuclei involved in phonation, that is, the nucleus ambiguus, facial, hypoglossal and trigeminal motor nuclei, the motorneuron column in the ventral gray substance innervating the extrinsic laryngeal muscles, the nucleus retroambiguus, solitary tract and spinal trigeminal nuclei. Projections were also found into a number of auditory nuclei, namely the nucleus cochlearis-complex, superior olive, ventral and dorsal nuclei of the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus. Furthermore, there were projections into the reticular formation of the lateral and dorsocaudal medulla and lateral pons, into nucleus gracilis, inferior and medial vestibular nuclei, lateral reticular nucleus, ventral raphe, pontine gray, superior colliculus, PAG and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Injection of the tracer wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase into the ventrolateral pontine vocalization-blocking area in one animal yielded retrograde labeling throughout the PAG. Injection of BDA into a vocalization-eliciting site of the PAG in another animal yielded projections into the ventrolateral pontine vocalization-blocking area. It is concluded that the ventral paralemniscal area in the ventrolateral pons represents a relay station of the descending periaqueductal vocalization-controlling pathway.
16304681	The overall projection pattern of a tiny bed nuclei of the stria terminalis anteromedial group differentiation, the dorsomedial nucleus (BSTdm), was analyzed with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin anterograde pathway tracing method in rats. Many brain regions receive a relatively moderate to strong input from the BSTdm. They fall into eight general categories: humeral sensory-related (subfornical organ and median preoptic nucleus, involved in initiating drinking behavior and salt appetite), neuroendocrine system (magnocellular: oxytocin, vasopressin; parvicellular: gonadotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone), central autonomic control network (central amygdalar nucleus, BST anterolateral group, descending paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, retrochiasmatic area, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus), hypothalamic visceromotor pattern-generator network (five of six known components), behavior control column (ingestive: descending paraventricular nucleus; reproductive: lateral medial preoptic nucleus; defensive: anterior hypothalamic nucleus; foraging: ventral tegmental area, along with interconnected nucleus accumbens and substantia innominata), orofacial motor control (retrorubral area), thalamocortical feedback loops (paraventricular, central medial, intermediodorsal, and medial mediodorsal nuclei; nucleus reuniens), and behavioral state control (subparaventricular zone, ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, lateral habenula, and raphé nuclei). This pattern of axonal projections, and what little is known of its inputs suggest that the BSTdm is part of a striatopallidal differentiation involved in coordinating the homeostatic and behavioral responses associated thirst and salt appetite, although clearly it may relate them to other functions as well. The BSTdm generates the densest known inputs directly to the neuroendocrine system from any part of the cerebral hemispheres.
16306323	Repetitive bimanual finger-tapping movements tend toward mirror symmetry: There is a spontaneous transition from less stable asymmetrical movement patterns to more stable symmetrical ones under frequency stress but not vice versa. During this phase transition, the interaction between the signals controlling each hand (cross talk) is expected to be prominent. To depict the regions of the brain in which cortical cross talk occurs during bimanual coordination, we conducted event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging using a bimanual repetitive-tapping task. Transition-related activity was found in the following areas: the bilateral ventral premotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, insula, and thalamus; the right rostral portion of the dorsal premotor cortex and midbrain; the left cerebellum; and the presupplementary motor area, rostral cingulate zone, and corpus callosum. These regions were discrete from those activated by bimanual movement execution. The phase-transition-related activation was right lateralized in the prefrontal, premotor, and parietal regions. These findings suggest that the cortical neural cross talk occurs in the distributed networks upstream of the primary motor cortex through asymmetric interhemispheric interaction.
16318368	A 55-year-old right-handed male patient with atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital because of a sudden disturbance of consciousness and right hemiparesis. Neurological examinations revealed left conjugate deviation of the eyes, aphasia, right hemianopsia without macula sparing using a Goldmann perimeter, right hemianesthesia, and right hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed low intensity areas (left posterior limb of internal capsule, left cerebral peduncle of middle brain, a part of left substantia nigra, left amygdala, ventral posterior lateral nucleus and ventral anterior nucleus of left thalamus, left lateral geniculate body, and left occipital lobe) in T1 weighted image, due to the infarct in the left anterior choroidal artery territory. Aphasia in this case was accompanied with non-fluent speech, good repetition, naming deficits, and perseveration. We suggest that aphasia with anterior choroidal artery syndrome cannot be classified using the conventional system, and emphasize the importance of accurate descriptions of the symptoms characteristic of aphasia with anterior choroidal artery.
16325349	The rodent olfactory bulb sends direct projections to the piriform cortex and to two structures intimately implicated in memory processes, the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala. The piriform cortex has monosynaptic projections with the amygdala and the piriform cortex and is therefore in a position to modulate olfactory input either directly in the piriform cortex, or via the amygdala. In order to investigate this hypothesis, field potential signals induced in anesthetized rats by electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb or the entorhinal cortex were recorded simultaneously in the piriform cortex (anterior part and posterior part) and the amygdala (basolateral nucleus and cortical nucleus). Single-site paired-pulse stimulation was used to assess the time courses of short-term inhibition and facilitation in each recording site in response to electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb and entorhinal cortex. Paired-pulse stimulation of the olfactory bulb induced homosynaptic inhibition for short interpulse interpulse intervals (20-30 ms) in all the recording sites, with a significantly lower degree of inhibition in the anterior piriform cortex than in the other structures. At longer intervals (40-80 ms), paired-pulse facilitation was observed in all the structures. Paired-pulse stimulation of the entorhinal cortex mainly resulted in inhibition for the shortest interval duration (20 ms) in anterior piriform cortex, posterior piriform cortex and amygdala basolateral but not cortical nucleus. Double-site paired-pulse stimulation was then applied to determine if stimulation of the entorhinal cortex can modulate responses to olfactory bulb stimulation. For short interpulse intervals (20 ms) heterosynaptic inhibition was observed in anterior piriform cortex, posterior piriform cortex and amygdala basolateral but not cortical nucleus. The level of inhibition was greater in the basolateral nucleus than in the other structures. Taken together these data suggest that the entorhinal cortex exerts a main inhibitory effect on the olfactory input via the amygdala basolateral nucleus and to a lesser extent the piriform cortex. The potential role of these effects on the processing of olfactory information is discussed.
16337817	To determine how opiate receptor distribution is co-localized with the distribution of nociceptive areas in the human brain, eleven male healthy volunteers underwent one PET scan with the subtype-nonselective opioidergic radioligand [(18)F]fluoroethyl-diprenorphine under resting conditions. The binding potential (BP), a parameter for the regional cerebral opioid receptor availability, was computed using the occipital cortex as reference region. The following regions of interest (ROIs) were defined on individual MR images: thalamus, sensory motor strip (SI/MI area), frontal operculum, parietal operculum, anterior insular cortex, posterior insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; peri- and subgenual part of "classical ACC" only), midcingulate cortex (MCC, posterior part of "classical ACC"), putamen, caudate nucleus and the amygdala. BP for [(18)F]fluoroethyl-diprenorphine was lowest in the sensory motor strip (0.30). Highest BP was found in thalamus (1.36), basal ganglia (putamen 1.22, caudate 1.16) and amygdala (1.21). In the cingulate cortex, ACC (1.11) had higher BP than MCC (0.86). In the operculo-insular region, we found high BPs in all ROIs: anterior insula (1.16), posterior insula (1.05), frontal operculum (0.99) and parietal operculum (0.77). Factor analysis of interindividual variability of opiate receptor BP revealed four factors (95% explained variance): (1) operculo-insular areas, ACC, MCC and putamen, (2) amygdala and thalamus, (3) caudate and thalamus, (4) SI/MI and MCC. Nociceptive areas of the lateral pain system (frontoparietal operculum and insula) have opiate receptor BPs significantly higher than SI/MI, comparable to anterior and midcingulate areas of the medial pain system. These findings suggest that the cortical anti-nociceptive effects of opiates are not only mediated by ACC and MCC, but also by the operculo-insular cortex, if it can be assumed that opioid binding mediates anti-nociception in those structures.
16361065	The subparafascicular nucleus and the subparafascicular area are the major sites of synthesis of the recently discovered neuropeptide, tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39). Better knowledge of the neuronal inputs to the subparafascicular area and nucleus will facilitate investigation of the functions of TIP39. Thus, we have injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit into the rostral, middle, and caudal parts of the rat subparafascicular nucleus. We report that the afferent projections to the subparafascicular nucleus and area include the medial prefrontal, insular, and ectorhinal cortex, the subiculum, the lateral septum, the anterior amygdaloid area, the medial amygdaloid nucleus, the caudal paralaminar area of the thalamus, the lateral preoptic area, the anterior, ventromedial, and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, the dorsal premamillary nucleus, the zona incerta and Forel's fields, the periaqueductal gray, the deep layers of the superior colliculus, cortical layers of the inferior colliculus, the cuneiform nucleus, the medial paralemniscal nucleus, and the parabrachial nuclei. Most of these regions project to all parts of the subparafascicular nucleus. However, the magnocellular subparafascicular neurons, which occupy the middle part of the subparafascicular nucleus, may not receive projections from the medial prefrontal and insular cortex, the medial amygdaloid nucleus, the lateral preoptic area, and the parabrachial nuclei. In addition, double labeling of cholera toxin B subunit and TIP39 revealed a remarkable similarity between input regions of the subparafascicular area and the brain TIP39 system. Neurons within regions that contain TIP39 cell bodies as well as regions that contain TIP39 fibers project to the subparafascicular area. Overall, the afferent connections of the subparafascicular nucleus and area suggest its involvement in central reproductive, visceral, nociceptive, and auditory regulation.
16362839	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4), also known as 'hereditary ataxia with sensory neuropathy', represents a very rare, progressive and untreatable form of an autosomal dominant inherited cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Due to a lack of autopsy cases, no neuropathological or clinicopathological studies had yet been performed in SCA4. In the present study, the first available cerebellar and brainstem tissue of a clinically diagnosed and genetically-confirmed German SCA4 patient was pathoanatomically studied using serial thick sections. During this systematic postmortem investigation, along with an obvious demyelinization of cerebellar and brainstem fiber tracts we observed widespread cerebellar and brainstem neurodegeneration with marked neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, central raphe and pontine nuclei, all auditory brainstem nuclei, in the abducens, principal trigeminal, spinal trigeminal, facial, superior vestibular, medial vestibular, interstitial vestibular, dorsal motor vagal, hypoglossal, and prepositus hypoglossal nuclei, as well as in the nucleus raphe interpositus, all dorsal column nuclei, and in the principal and medial subnuclei of the inferior olive. Severe neuronal loss was seen in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, in the cerebellar fastigial nucleus, in the red, trochlear, lateral vestibular, and lateral reticular nuclei, the reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons, and the nucleus of Roller. In addition, immunocytochemical analysis using the anti-polyglutamine antibody 1C2 failed to detect any polyglutamine-related immunoreactivity in the central nervous regions of this SCA4 patient studied. In view of the known functional role of affected nuclei and related fiber tracts, the present findings not only offer explanations for the well-known disease symptoms of SCA4 patients (i.e. ataxic symptoms, dysarthria and somatosensory deficits), but for the first time help to explain why diplopia, gaze-evoked nystagmus, auditory impairments and pathologically altered brainstem auditory evoked potentials, saccadic smooth pursuits, impaired somatosensory functions in the face, and dysphagia may occur during the course of SCA4. Finally, the results of our immunocytochemical studies support the concept that SCA4 is not a member of the CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases.
16407530	Previous work has identified axonal outgrowth and/or guidance defects in the brain and spinal cord of prenatal Frizzled3 (Fz3)(-/-) mice. To systematically explore the axonal defects in Fz3(-/-) mice and to compare techniques for the global assessment of axon tracts in the developing mouse, we have analyzed wild-type and Fz3(-/-) brains using (1) diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (muDTI), (2) neurofilament staining, and (3) two genetically directed neuronal labeling methods. Confirming and extending the previous work of Wang et al. (2002), we find that the following structures/tracts are absent or greatly reduced in the Fz3(-/-) brain: the anterior commissure, cerebral peduncle (corticospinal tract), corpus callosum, fornix, internal capsule (thalamocortical and corticothalamic tracts), stria medullaris, stria terminalis, and hippocampal commissure. An aberrant U-shaped fiber bundle immediately caudal to the optic tract connects the left and right sides of the Fz3(-/-) thalamus and likely represents a default pathway for thalamic axons that failed to enter the internal capsule. At embryonic day 18, labeling of cortical pyramidal cells with a yellow fluorescent protein reporter reveals widespread fragmentation of axons with no apparent loss of pyramidal cell bodies. Fragmentation likely represents one stage in the process that normally eliminates stalled or mistargeted axons. This work demonstrates the usefulness of muDTI and genetically directed neuronal labeling for the analysis of nervous system defects in the mouse.
16432902	The vasoactive peptide urotensin II (UII) is primarily expressed in motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. Intracerebroventricular injection of UII provokes various behavioral, cardiovascular, motor, and endocrine responses in the rat, but the distribution of the UII receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) has not yet been determined. In the present study, we have investigated the localization of UII receptor (GPR14) mRNA and UII binding sites in the rat CNS. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the highest density of GPR14 mRNA occurred in the pontine nuclei. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that the GPR14 gene is widely expressed in the brain and spinal cord. In particular, a strong hybridization signal was observed in the olfactory system, hippocampus, olfactory and medial amygdala, hypothalamus, epithalamus, several tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus, pontine nuclei, motor nuclei, nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, inferior olive, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Autoradiographic labeling of brain slices with radioiodinated UII showed the presence of UII-binding sites in the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdaloid nucleus, anteroventral thalamus, anterior pretectal nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, pontine nuclei, geniculate nuclei, parabigeminal nucleus, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, and cerebellar cortex. Intense expression of the GPR14 gene in some hypothalamic nuclei (supraoptic, paraventricular, ventromedian, and arcuate nuclei), in limbic structures (amygdala and hippocampus), in medullary nuclei (solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus), and in motor control regions (cerebral and cerebellar cortex, substantia nigra, pontine nuclei) provides the anatomical substrate for the central effects of UII on behavioral, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and motor functions. The occurrence of GPR14 mRNA in cranial and spinal motoneurons is consistent with the reported autocrine/paracrine action of UII on motoneurons.
16439015	Using radioactive in situ hybridisation, the distribution of prodynorphin mRNA in the brains of C57Bl/6 mice was systemically investigated, and double-labelling in situ hybridisation was used to determine the extent to which neuropeptide Y (NPY) and prodynorphin mRNAs were co-expressed. Our results demonstrate that prodynorphin mRNA expression in the mouse brain is localised at specific subregions of the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Among the regions displaying the most intense labelling were the olfactory tubercle, lateral septum (LS), caudate putamen (Cpu), central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SO), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), lateral reticular nucleus (LRt) and solitary tract nucleus (NTS). In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Arc), double-labelling in situ hybridisation revealed that prodynorphin expressing neurons also contained NPY mRNA, with a co-localisation rate of approximately 88% in the lateral part of the Arc, and 79% in the dorsal part of the Arc, respectively, suggesting potential overlapping functions of these two neurotransmitters in feeding type behaviour.
16440293	Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) from the brain controls reproduction in vertebrates via a GnRH-specific receptor in the pituitary; however, other forms of GnRH are found in all species, suggesting additional roles for this family of peptides. GnRH action depends critically on the location of its cognate receptors in the brain. To understand the potential roles of additional GnRH forms, we localized two known GnRH receptor types in a cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, in which GnRH1 is socially regulated. Using in situ hybridization, we describe the mRNA expression pattern of these GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) subtypes in the brain, specifically with respect to GnRH-producing neurons. Our data suggest that following a gene duplication, the two GnRH receptors have evolved to serve different functions. The type 1 receptor (GnRH-R1) is expressed less widely than the type 2 receptor (GnRH-R2). Specifically, GnRH-R1 is expressed in groups of neurons in the telencephalon, preoptic area, ventral hypothalamus, thalamus, and pituitary. In contrast, GnRH-R2 is expressed in many more brain areas, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, optic tectum, cerebellum, hindbrain, and pituitary. The specific distribution of GnRH-R2 suggests that the GnRH ligands may act via this receptor to influence behavior in A. burtoni. Moreover, only GnRH-R2 mRNA is colocalized in the three known groups of GnRH-containing neurons, suggesting that any direct feedback regulation of GnRH by itself must act through this receptor type. Taken together, these data suggest that the two GnRH receptor types serve different functional roles in A. burtoni.
16457790	Even though animal and human studies show alterations in dopamine transporter (DAT) sites after alcohol withdrawal, the role of DAT in influencing either alcoholic or depressive behavior has not been examined extensively. Given that the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat is a putative animal model of depressive behavior, the present study examined the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on DAT sites in WKY versus Wistar (WIS) rats. Brains from both strains were sectioned for autoradiographic analysis of [3H]-GBR12935 binding to DAT sites after 24 days of alcohol exposure. The results indicated that WKY rats consumed a greater amount of alcohol (P < 0.001) than WIS rats did throughout the experiment. Autoradiographic analyses of discrete brain regions indicated that alcohol consumption increased DAT sites in a greater number of brain areas in WKY compared to WIS rats. In WKY rats, the binding of [3H]-GBR12935 to DAT sites was increased in the basolateral, central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala, lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, olfactory tubercle, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra (P < 0.05) and decreased in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In WIS rats, alcohol consumption increased DAT sites in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, and decreased DAT sites in the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus and dentate gyrus. These results indicate a strain dependent alteration in DAT sites which may be related to altered dopamine neurotransmission in select brain regions following alcohol consumption.
16458435	Neurons containing tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) constitute a rostro-caudally elongated group of cells in the posterior thalamus. These neurons are located in the rostral part of the subparafascicular nucleus and in the subparafascicular area, caudally. Projections of the caudally located TIP39 neurons have been previously identified by their disappearance following lesions. We have now mapped the projections of the rat rostral subparafascicular neurons using injections of the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine and the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit, and confirmed the projections from more caudal areas previously inferred from lesion studies. Neurons from both the rostral subparafascicular nucleus and the subparafascicular area project to the medial prefrontal, insular, ecto- and perirhinal cortex, nucleus of the diagonal band, septum, central and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei, fundus striati, basal forebrain, midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, hypothalamus, subthalamus and the periaqueductal gray. The subparafascicular area projects more densely to the amygdala and the hypothalamus. In contrast, only the rostral part of the subparafascicular nucleus projects significantly to the superficial layers of prefrontal, insular, ectorhinal and somatosensory cortical areas. Double labeling showed that anterogradely labeled fibers from the rostral part of the subparafascicular nucleus contain TIP39 in many forebrain areas, but do not in hypothalamic areas. Injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit into the lateral septum and the fundus striati confirmed that they were indeed target regions of both the rostral subparafascicular nucleus and the subparafascicular area. In contrast, TIP39 neurons did not project to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus. Our data provide an anatomical basis for the potential involvement of rostral subparafascicular neurons in limbic and autonomic regulation, with TIP39 cells being major subparafascicular output neurons projecting to forebrain regions.
16466814	Brain abnormalities are found in association with antisocial personality disorder and schizophrenia, the two mental disorders most implicated in violent behaviour. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the whole brain, cerebellum, temporal lobe, lateral ventricles, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and the prefrontal, pre-motor, sensorimotor, occipito-parietal regions in 13 men with antisocial personality disorder, 13 men with schizophrenia and a history of violence, 15 men with schizophrenia without violent history and 15 healthy non-violent men. Compared to controls, the antisocial personality disorder group displayed reductions in whole brain volume and temporal lobe as well as increases in putamen volume. Both schizophrenia groups regardless of violence history exhibited increased lateral ventricle volume, while the schizophrenia group with violent history showed further abnormalities including reduced whole brain and hippocampal volumes and increased putamen size. The findings suggest that individuals with antisocial personality disorder as well as those with schizophrenia and a history of violence have common neural abnormalities, but also show neuro-anatomical differences. The processes by which they came to apparently common ground may, however, differ. The finding of temporal lobe reductions prevalent among those with antisocial personality disorder and hippocampal reduction in the violent men with schizophrenia contributes support for the importance of this region in mediating violent behaviour.
16472786	Brain expression of CB2 cannabinoid receptors has been much less well established and characterized in comparison to the expression of brain CB1 receptors. Since CB2 receptors are intensely expressed in peripheral and immune tissues, expression in brain microglia has been anticipated. Nevertheless, we now describe expression of CB2-receptor-like immunoreactivity in brain in neuronal patterns that support broader CNS roles for this receptor. Two anti-CB2 affinity purified polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized with peptide conjugates that corresponded to amino acids 1-33 and 20-33. Western blot analyses revealed specific bands that were identified using these sera and were absent when the sera were preadsorbed with 8.3 mug/ml of the immunizing peptides. These studies, and initial RT-PCR analyses of brain CB1 and CB2 mRNAs, also support the expression of brain CB2 receptor transcripts at levels much lower than those of CB1 receptors. CB2 cannabinoid receptor mRNA was clearly expressed in the cerebellum of wild type but not in CB2 knockout mice. CB2 immunostaining was detected in the interpolar part of spinal 5th nucleus of wild type but not in CB2 knockout mice, using a mouse C-terminal CB2 receptor antibody. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed abundant immunostaining for CB2 receptors in apparent neuronal and glial processes in a number of rat brain areas. Cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells revealed substantial immunoreactivity that was absent when sections were stained with preadsorbed sera. CB2 immunoreactivity was also observed in olfactory tubercle, islands of Calleja, cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamic nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, paratrochlear nucleus, paralemniscal nucleus, red nucleus, pontine nuclei, inferior colliculus and the parvocellular portion of the medial vestibular nucleus. In-vitro, CB2 immunoreactivity was also present in hippocampal cell cultures. The multifocal expression of CB2 immunoreactivity in glial and neuronal patterns in a number of brain regions suggests reevaluation of the possible roles that CB2 receptors may play in the brain.
16487147	The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene was recently found to have multiple mutations that are causative for autosomal dominant inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). Previously, we used Northern blot analysis to show that this gene was expressed in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, medulla, spinal cord, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal lobe and caudate putamen. However, a more comprehensive map of LRRK2 mRNA localization in the central nervous system is still lacking. In this study we have mapped the distribution of the mRNA encoding for LRRK2 using nonradioactive in situ hybridization. We detected a moderate expression of this PD-related gene throughout the adult B2B6 mouse brain. A stronger hybridization signal was observed in deep cerebral cortex layers, superficial cingulate cortex layers, the piriform cortex, hippocampal formation, caudate putamen, substantia nigra, the basolateral and basomedial anterior amygdala nuclei, reticular thalamic nucleus and also in the cerebellar granular cell layer. Given that LRRK2 mRNA is highly enriched in motor systems and also is expressed in other systems, we may conclude that mutations in LRRK2 may affect several motor and nonmotor structures that may play an important role in the development of PD.
16515890	We have inoculated a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector into a variety of sites in the mouse brain and assayed the regions of latency and expression of a beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) cDNA from the latency-associated transcript promoter. Injection sites used were somatosensory cortex, visual cortex, striatum, dorsal hippocampus, and CSF spaces. Latent vector was detected in regions at a distance from the respective injection sites, consistent with axonal transport of vector. Regions of GUSB activity varied by injection site and included cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, midbrain, pons, medulla, cerebellum, and spinal cord. After a single injection, GUSB enzymatic activity reached wild-type levels in several brain regions. GUSB was found in some areas without any detectable vector, indicative of axonal transport of GUSB enzyme. GUSB-deficient mice, which have the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VII, have lysosomal storage lesions in cells throughout the brain. Adult MPS VII mice treated by injection of vector into a single site on each side of the brain had correction of storage lesions in a large volume of brain. The potential for long-term, widespread correction of lysosomal storage diseases with HSV-1 vectors is discussed.
16520329	Cognitive function requires a high level of functional interaction between regions of a network supporting cognition. Assuming that brain activation changes denote an advanced state of disease progression, changes in functional connectivity may precede changes in brain activation. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in functional connectivity of the right middle fusiform gyrus (FG) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during performance of a face-matching task. The right middle FG is a key area for processing face stimuli. Brain activity was measured using functional MRI. There were 16 MCI subjects and 19 age-matched healthy controls. The linear correlation coefficient was utilized as a measure of functional connectivity between the right middle FG and all other voxels in the brain. There were no statistical differences found in task performance or activation between groups. The right middle FG of the healthy control and MCI groups showed strong bilateral positive linear correlation with the visual cortex, inferior and superior parietal lobules, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate. The healthy controls showed higher positive linear correlation of the right middle FG to the visual cortex, parietal lobes and right DLPFC than the MCI group, whereas the latter had higher positive linear correlation in the left cuneus. In the healthy controls, the right middle FG had negative linear correlation with right medial frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus and with left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), angular gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, but the MCI group had negative linear correlation with the left IPL, angular gyrus, precuneus, anterior cingulate, and to right middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate gyrus. In the negatively linearly correlated regions, the MCI group had reduced functional connectivity to the frontal areas, right superior temporal gyrus and left IPL. Different regions of the cuneus and IPL had increased functional connectivity in either group. The putative presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in MCI affects functional connectivity from the right middle FG to the visual areas and medial frontal areas. In addition, higher linear correlation in the MCI group in the parietal lobe may indicate the initial appearance of compensatory processes. The results demonstrate that functional connectivity can be an effective marker for the detection of changes in brain function in MCI subjects.
16545785	Estrogen receptors are widely expressed in the brain, where estrogen modulates central nervous function. In this study, we investigated the effect of estrogen on the emotional stress response in the brain by comparing the CNS patterns of c-Fos expression in response to immobilization stress (IMO) in ovariectomized rats with placebo treatment (OVX + Pla) vs. ovariectomized rats supplemented with 17beta-estradiol (OVX + E2). Increased c-Fos immunoreactive neurons in response to IMO were observed in cerebral cortex, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata in accordance with previous findings. When OVX + E2/Stress were compared with OVX + Pla/Stress, the numbers of c-Fos immunoreactive cells were significantly lower in the lateral septum, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, lateral periaqueductal gray, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and locus coeruleus, while they were significantly higher in paraventricular thalamic nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. These data suggest that neuronal activities in these areas are influenced bidirectionally by systemic estrogen level.
16556899	One important function of endocannabinoids and related lipid mediators in mammalian central nervous system is modulation of pain. Evidence obtained during the last decade shows that altered levels of these compounds in the brain accompany decreases in pain sensitivity. Such changes, if sexually dimorphic, could account for sex differences in pain and differences that occur during different phases of the hormonal cycle in females. To examine this possibility, we measured the levels of the pain-modulatory lipids anandamide, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, N-arachidonoyl glycine, N-arachidonoyl gamma amino butyric acid, and N-arachidonoyl dopamine in seven different brain areas (pituitary, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, and cerebellum) in male rats, and in female rats at five different points in the estrous cycle. The cerebellum did not demonstrate a change in endocannabinoid production across the estrous cycle, whereas all other areas tested showed significant differences in at least one of the compounds measured. These changes in levels occurred predominantly within the 36-h time period surrounding ovulation and behavioral estrus. Differences between males and females were measured as either estrous cycle-independent (all estrous cycles combined) or cycle-dependent (comparisons of males to each estrous cycle). In cycle-independent analyses, small sex differences were observed in the pituitary, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and striatum, whereas no differences were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus. In cycle-dependent analyses, the hypothalamus and pituitary showed largest sex differences followed by the striatum, midbrain, and hippocampus, whereas no sex differences were measured in thalamus and cerebellum. These data provide a basis for investigations into how differences in sex and hormonal status play a role in mechanisms regulating endocannabinoid production and pain.
16563637	In the last 15 years a role has been ascribed for the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus as a supraspinal pain modulating area. The medullary dorsal reticular nucleus is reciprocally connected with the spinal dorsal horn, is populated mainly by nociceptive neurons and regulates spinal nociceptive processing. Here we analyze the distribution of brain projections from the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus using the iontophoretic administration of the anterograde tracer biotinylated-dextran amine and the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B. Fibers and terminal boutons labeled from the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus were located predominately in the brainstem, although extending also to the forebrain. In the medulla oblongata, anterograde labeling was observed in the orofacial motor nuclei, inferior olive, caudal ventrolateral medulla, rostral ventromedial medulla, nucleus tractus solitarius and most of the reticular formation. Labeling at the pons-cerebellum level was present in the locus coeruleus, A5 and A7 noradrenergic cell groups, parabrachial and deep cerebellar nuclei, whereas in the mesencephalon it was located in the periaqueductal gray matter, deep mesencephalic, oculomotor and anterior pretectal nuclei, and substantia nigra. In the diencephalon, fibers and terminal boutons were found mainly in the parafascicular, ventromedial, and posterior thalamic nuclei and in the arcuate, lateral, posterior, peri- and paraventricular hypothalamic areas. Telencephalic labeling was consistent but less intense and concentrated in the septal nuclei, globus pallidus and amygdala. The well-known role of the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus in nociception and its pattern of brain projections in rats suggests that the nucleus is possibly implicated in the modulation of: (i) the ascending nociceptive transmission involved in the motivational-affective dimension of pain; (ii) the endogenous supraspinal pain control system centered in the periaqueductal gray matter-rostral ventromedial medulla-spinal cord circuitry; (iii) the motor reactions associated with pain.
16571375	The mesial premotor cortex (pre-supplementary motor area and supplementary motor area proper), lateral premotor cortex (dorsal premotor cortex and ventral premotor cortex), and primary sensorimotor cortex (primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex) have been identified as key cortical areas for sensorimotor function. However, the three-dimensional (3-D) anatomic boundaries between these regions remain unclear. In order to clarify the locations and boundaries for these six sensorimotor regions, we surveyed 126 articles describing pre-supplementary motor area, supplementary motor area proper, dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and primary somatosensory cortex. Using strict inclusion criteria, we recorded the reported normalized stereotaxic coordinates (Talairach and Tournoux or MNI) from each experiment. We then computed the probability distributions describing the likelihood of activation, and characterized the shape, extent, and area of each sensorimotor region in 3-D. Additionally, we evaluated the nature of the overlap between the six sensorimotor regions. Using the findings from this meta-analysis, along with suggestions and guidelines of previous researchers, we developed the Human Motor Area Template (HMAT) that can be used for ROI analysis. HMAT is available through e-mail from the corresponding author.
16580023	Loss of dopamine synthesis in the striatum with normal human aging has been observed in the postmortem brain. To investigate whether there is age-associated change in dopamine synthesis in the extrastriatal brain regions similar to that in the striatum, positron emission tomography studies with (11)C-labelled l-DOPA were performed on 21 normal healthy male subjects (age range 20-67 years). Decline in the tissue fraction of gray matter per region of interest was also investigated. The overall uptake rate constant for each region of interest was quantified by the Patlak plot method using the occipital cortex as reference region. Regions of interest were set on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, medial temporal cortex, occipital cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, midbrain, caudate nucleus, and putamen. Test-retest analysis indicated good reproducibility of the overall uptake rate constant. Significant age-related declines of dopamine synthesis were observed in the striatum and extrastriatal regions except midbrain. The decline in the overall uptake rate constant was more prominent than in the tissue fraction of gray matter. These results indicate that the previously demonstrated age-related decline in striatal dopamine synthesis extends to several extrastriatal regions in normal human brain.
16624330	The distribution of thiamine-immunoreactive structures was studied in the brain of the monkey using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Fibers containing thiamine, but no thiamine-immunoreactive cell bodies, were found. The highest density of fibers containing thiamine was observed in the pulvinar nucleus and in the region extending from the pulvinar nucleus to the caudate nucleus. In the mesencephalon, immunoreactive fibers containing thiamine were only found at rostral level close to the medial lemniscus (at the mesencephalic-diencephalic junction). In the thalamus, the distribution of thiamine-immunoreactive structures was more widespread. Thus, immunoreactive fibers were found in nuclei close to the midline (centrum medianum/parafascicular complex), in the ventrolateral thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus, inferior pulvinar nucleus), and in the dorsolateral thalamus (lateral posterior nucleus, pulvinar nucleus). Finally, in the anterior commissure and in the cerebral cortex a low density immunoreactive fibers was visualized. Thus, in the brainstem, no immunoreactive structures were visualized in the medulla oblongata, pons, or in the medial-caudal mesencephalon, and no immunoreactive fibers were observed in the cerebellum, hypothalamus and in the basal ganglia. The present report describes the first visualization and the morphological characteristics (thick, smooth and short, medium or long in length) of the thiamine-immunoreactive fibers in the primate central nervous system using an antiserum directed against this vitamin. The distribution of thiamine-immunoreactive structures in the monkey brain suggests that this vitamin could be involved in several physiological mechanisms.
16641244	Peer-reared (PR) rhesus monkeys with early maternal separation later exhibit aggressiveness, impaired impulse control, alcohol abuse, and low CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. This study compared regional brain serotonin transporter (SERT) binding between nine PR and seven mother-reared rhesus monkeys with [11C]DASB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Parametric images of binding potential (BP) (which is proportional to Bmax/KD, in which Bmax is transporter density and KD is dissociation constant) and relative blood flow (R1) were generated by the two-parameter multilinear reference tissue model. R1 images were used for coregistration and normalization of PET parametric data to the magnetic resonance imaging template space. Group BP differences were analyzed voxelwise by Student's t test in SPM2. Region of interest-based parameter values were also calculated to obtain the magnitude of regional BP differences between the two groups. For the PR group, SERT BP was decreased by 10-23% across a range of brain areas consisting of the raphe, thalamus, hypothalamus, caudate and putamen, globus pallidum, anterior cingulate gyrus, and medial temporal regions, including amygdala and hippocampus (cluster-level corrected p = 0.002). For the latter three regions, BP was decreased in the right hemisphere. These results agree with the hypothesis that early maternal deprivation affects the development of the serotonergic system and suggest that decreased serotonergic innervations in the critical brain regions may explain some of the behavioral and biochemical abnormalities in PR monkeys.
16677768	Cyclooxygenase-2 is expressed at low levels in a subset of neurons in CNS and is rapidly induced by a multiplicity of factors including seizure activity. A putative relationship exists between cyclooxygenase-2 induction and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Cyclooxygenase-1 is constitutively expressed in glial cells and has been specifically linked to microglia. In this study we evaluated cyclooxygenase-2 protein immunocytochemically and found markedly enhanced immunostaining primarily in olfactory-limbic regions at 2, 6 and 24 h following kainate-induced status epilepticus. Impressive enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity was localized in anterior olfactory nucleus, tenia tecta, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, piriform cortex, lateral and basolateral amygdala, orbital frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens (shell) and associated areas of ventral striatum, entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus granule cells and hilar neurons, hippocampal CA subfields and subiculum. Alternate sections were processed for dual immunocytochemical analysis utilizing c-Fos and cyclooxygenase-2 antiserum to examine the possibility that the neuronal induction of cyclooxygenase-2 was associated with seizure activity. Neurons that showed a timeline of cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation were found to possess c-Fos immunopositive nuclei. Additional results from all seizure groups showed cyclooxygenase-1 induction in microglia, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis of hippocampus. Western blot and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed significant upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression, confirming its induction in neurons. These data indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 induction in a neuronal network can be a useful marker for pathways associated with seizure activity.
16697979	Neuropeptide W (NPW) is a recently identified neuropeptide that binds to G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 7, which is highly expressed in several discrete regions of the rodent brain including the central amygdaloid nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Although several reports suggested that NPW is implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and nociception, the precise physiological role of NPW has remained unclear. In this study, we examined distribution of NPW messenger RNA and NPW immunoreactivity in the adult rat brain. NPW-immunoreactive (ir) cells were detected in the ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, and Edinger-Westphal nucleus. NPW-ir fibers were observed in several brain regions, including the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsomedial and posterior hypothalamus, central amygdaloid nucleus, CA1 field of hippocampus, interpeduncular nucleus, inferior colliculus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, facial nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus. NPW-ir fibers were most abundantly observed in the central amygdaloid nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which are regions implicated in fear and anxiety. These results suggest that NPW might be involved in the regulation of stress and emotive responses, especially in fear and anxiety-related physiological and behavioral functions.
16736466	In the rat, the neuropeptide B/neuropeptide W (NPB/NPW) system is composed of two ligands, neuropeptide B (NPB) and neuropeptide W (NPW), and one receptor, GPR7. Although preliminary analyses show roles in feeding, hormone secretion, and analgesia, the lack of a detailed anatomical map impairs our understanding of the NPB/NPW system. We demonstrate in this report the expression patterns of GPR7, NPB, and NPW precursor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the rat brain by using in situ hybridization and in situ binding experiments. The amygdala expresses the highest levels of GPR7 mRNA and binding signals. Other nuclei with high levels of expression and binding are the suprachiasmatic and the ventral tuberomamillary nuclei. Moderate levels are seen in the dorsal endopiriform, dorsal tenia tecta, bed nucleus, and the red nucleus. Low levels are in the olfactory bulb, parastrial nucleus, hypothalamus, laterodorsal tegmentum, superior colliculus, locus coeruleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Although the NPB precursor is mostly expressed at low levels in the brain, moderate expression is seen in anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, median preoptic nucleus, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, medial tuberal nucleus, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe nucleus, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and the locus coeruleus. To our surprise, the expression of NPW precursor was not detected. Our study greatly expands the preliminary in situ data previously reported. With this map of the NPB/NPW system in the rat brain, a better understanding of the functional implications of the system in various behavioral paradigms is now possible.
16757844	Although manganese (Mn) is an essential element, exposure to excessive levels of Mn and its accumulation in the brain can cause neurotoxicity and extrapyramidal syndrome. We have investigated the differences in the accumulated levels of Mn, the degree of lipid peroxidation, and its effects on the levels of trace elements (Fe, Cu, and Zn) in various regions in the brain of rats having undergone acute Mn exposure. The rats in the dose-effect group were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with MnCl2 (25, 50, or 100 mg MnCl2/kg ) once a day for 24 h. The Mn significantly accumulated (p<0.05) in the frontal cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, medulla, cerebellum, and spinal cord in each case. The rats in the time-course group were ip injected with MnCl2 (50 mg MnCl2/kg) and then monitored 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after exposure. The Mn accumulated in the frontal cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, striatum hypothalamus, medulla, cerebellum, and spinal cord after these periods of time, In both the dose-effect and time-course studies, we observed that the concentration of malondialdehyde, an end product of lipid peroxidation, increased significantly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, medulla, and cerebellum. However, no relationship between the concentrations of Mn in the brain and the extent of lipid peroxidation was observed. In addition, we found that there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the level of Fe in the hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, medulla, and cerebellum, but the Cu and Zn levels had not changed significantly. These findings indicated that Mn induces an increase in the iron level, which provides direct evidence for Fe-mediated lipid peroxidation in the rats' brains; these phenomena might play important roles in the mechanisms of Mn-induced neurotoxicology.
16763808	A recently revealed important function of the amygdala (Am) is that it acts as the brain's "lighthouse", which constantly monitors the environment for stimuli which signal a threat to the organism. The data from patients with extensive lesions of the striate cortex indicate that "unseen" fearful and fear-conditioned faces elicit increased Am responses. Thus, also extrageniculostriate pathways are involved. A multisynaptic pathway from the retina to the Am via the superior colliculus (SC) and the pulvinar was recently suggested. We here present data based on retrograde neuronal labeling following injection of the fluorescent tracer Fluoro-Gold in the rat Am that the parabigeminal nucleus (Pbg) emits a substantial, bilateral projection to the Am. This small cholinergic nucleus (Ch8 group) in the midbrain tegmentum is a subcortical relay visual center that is reciprocally connected with the SC. We suggest the existence of a second extrageniculostriate multisynaptic connection to Am: retina-SC-Pbg-Am, that might be very effective since all tracts listed above are bilateral. In addition, we present hodological details on other brainstem afferent connections of the Am, some of which are only recently described, and some others that still remain equivocal. Following selective injections of Fluoro-Gold in the Am, retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in parasubthalamic nucleus, peripeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, dopaminergic nuclear complex (substantia nigra pars lateralis and pars compacta, paranigral, parabrachial pigmented and interfascicular nuclei, rostral and caudal linear nuclei, retrorubral area), deep mesencephalic nucleus, serotoninergic structures (dorsal, median and pontine raphe nuclei), laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (Ch6 and Ch5 groups), parabrachial nuclear complex, locus coeruleus, nucleus incertus, ventrolateral pontine tegmentum (A5 group), dorsomedial medulla (nucleus of the solitary tract, A2 group), ventrolateral medulla (A1/C1 group), and pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. A bilateral labeling of the upper cervical spinal cord was also observed.
16766128	The magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus plays a crucial role in the regulation of male sexual behavior in Syrian hamsters. Histological and behavioral studies suggest that the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus regulates male mating behavior by integrating chemosensory and hormonal signals. The present study is the first to systematically identify the afferent connections of the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus by tracing the uptake of cholera toxin B from deposits in the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus of adult male Syrian hamsters. Our findings indicate that the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus receives 1) chemosensory input from areas in the main and accessory olfactory pathways including the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior medial, anterior cortical and posterior cortical nuclei of the amygdala; 2) input from steroid responsive structures such as the posterior medial nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, anteroventral periventricular nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus; 3) input from structures in the brainstem such as the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus, peripeduncular nucleus and the premamillary nucleus in the hypothalamus that carry sensory information from the genitalia. The major afferent input to the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus was confirmed by injecting anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine into the anterior medical nucleus of the amygdala, the posterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, the posteromedial part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the posterointermediate part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Our results support the hypothesis that the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus is part of the chemosensory pathway that receives chemosensory and hormonal input to regulate mating behavior and suggest that the magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus may utilize information from the genitalia to regulate male mating behavior.
16768379	The traditional philosophical doctrines of Consequentialism, Doing and Allowing, and Double Effect prescribe that moral judgments and decisions should be based on consequences, action (as opposed to inaction), and intention. This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how these three factors affect brain processes associated with moral judgments. We find the following: (1) Moral scenarios involving only a choice between consequences with different amounts of harm elicit activity in similar areas of the brain as analogous non-moral scenarios; (2) Compared to analogous non-moral scenarios, moral scenarios in which action and inaction result in the same amount of harm elicit more activity in areas associated with cognition (such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and less activity in areas associated with emotion (such as the orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole); (3) Compared to analogous non-moral scenarios, conflicts between goals of minimizing harm and of refraining from harmful action elicit more activity in areas associated with emotion (orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole) and less activity in areas associated with cognition (including the angular gyrus and superior frontal gyrus); (4) Compared to moral scenarios involving only unintentional harm, moral scenarios involving intentional harm elicit more activity in areas associated with emotion (orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole) and less activity in areas associated with cognition (including the angular gyrus and superior frontal gyrus). These findings suggest that different kinds of moral judgment are preferentially supported by distinguishable brain systems.
16793025	The mu opioid receptor gene Oprm is alternatively spliced into many variants, providing for the multiplicity of mu opioid receptor subtypes. One of the mouse variants, mMOR-1B4, is unique in that it displays high affinity towards a wide range of mu opioid receptor antagonists, but poor affinity towards most classical mu opioid agonists. The present study examined the immunohistochemical distribution of the mMOR-1B4 variant in mouse brain and spinal cord. mMOR-1B4-like immunoreactivity (mMOR-1B4-LI) was enriched in many regions of the brain, spinal cord and in the dorsal root ganglia. Some of the structures showing prominent mMOR-1B4-LI include the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, hippocampus, habenular nucleus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, medium eminence, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, oculomotor nucleus, red nucleus, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, trigeminal nucleus, reticular formation, area postrema and Purkinje cell layer and deep nuclei of cerebellum. mMOR-1B4-LI was present in afferent neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and their projecting fibers into the superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn. Some motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord also were immunopositive. The overall distribution of mMOR-1B4-LI in the central nervous system is distinguishable from previously characterized variants such as MOR-1-LI, MOR-1C-LI and exon-11-LI. These studies provide evidence for the region- and neuron-specific processing of the Oprm gene and support the possibility of functional differences among the variants.
16796134	The complex structures in the cerebral hemispheres is included under one term, the limbic system. Our conception of this system and its special functions rises from the comparative neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies. The components of the limbic system are the hippocampus, gyrus parahippocampalis, gyrus dentatus, gyrus cinguli, corpus amygdaloideum, nuclei anteriores thalami, hypothalamus and gyrus paraterminalis Because of its unique macroscopic and microscopic structure, the hippocampus is a conspicuous part of the limbic system. During phylogenetic development, the hippocampus developed from a simple cortical plate in amphibians into complex three-dimensional convoluted structure in mammals. In the last few decades, structures of the limbic system were extensively studied. Attention was directed to the physiological functions and pathological changes of the hippocampus. Experimental studies proved that the hippocampus has a very important role in the process of learning and memory. Another important functions of the hippocampus as a part of the limbic system is its role in regulation of sexual and emotional behaviour. The term "hippocampal formation" is defined as the complex of six structures: gyrus dentatus, hippocampus proprius, subiculum proprium, presubiculum, parasubiculum and area entorhinalis In this work we attempt to present a brief review of knowledge about the hippocampus from the point of view of history, anatomical nomenclature, comparative anatomy and functions (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 33).
16828199	In the present in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical studies in the mouse central nervous system (CNS), a strong expression of spastin mRNA and protein was found in Purkinje cells and dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, in hippocampal principal cells and hilar neurons, in amygdala, substantia nigra, striatum, in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and in different layers of the cerebral cortex except piriform and entorhinal cortices where only neurons in layer II were strongly stained. Spastin protein and mRNA were weakly expressed in most of the thalamic nuclei. In selected human brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, substania nigra and striatum, similar results were obtained. Electron microscopy showed spastin immunopositive staining in the cytoplasma, dendrites, axon terminals and nucleus. In the mouse pilocarpine model of status epilepticus and subsequent temporal lobe epilepsy, spastin expression disappeared in hilar neurons as early as at 2h during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus, and never recovered. At 7 days and 2 months after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus, spastin expression was down-regulated in granule cells in the dentate gyrus, but induced expression was found in reactive astrocytes. The demonstration of widespread distribution of spastin in functionally different brain regions in the present study may provide neuroanatomical basis to explain why different neurological, psychological disorders and cognitive impairment occur in patients with spastin mutation. Down-regulation or loss of spastin expression in hilar neurons may be related to their degeneration and may therefore initiate epileptogenetic events, leading to temporal lobe epilepsy.
16847947	Proechimys guyannensis rodents present resistance to epilepsy. Autoradiography was used to map GABA(A) ((3)H-Muscimol), benzodiazepine ((3)H-Flunitrazepam), mu ((3)H-DAMGO), and delta ((3)H-DPDPE) opioid receptor binding in adult Proechimys guyannensis brain under normal conditions. Results were compared with values obtained from adult Wistar rats. Proechimys presented reduced (3)H-Muscimol binding in several cortices, thalamus, medial amygdala nucleus, and dorsal dentate gyrus. (3)H-Flunitrazepam binding was reduced in periaqueductal gray, frontal and entorhinal cortices, and enhanced in piriform cortex and ventral CA2 field of Ammons horn. Concerning (3)H-DAMGO binding, high values were found in several cortices, medial amygdala nucleus, dorsal dentate gyrus, and periaqueductal gray, whereas reduced binding was detected in anterior olfactory tubercle, cingulated cortex, thalamus, basolateral amygdala, substantia nigra, and dorsal and ventral CA fields. High (3)H-DPDPE binding was noticed in CA1 field from dorsal hippocampus, while reduced values were found in cingulate cortex, olfactory tubercle, thalamus, and substantia nigra. These findings provide the first description of receptor binding distribution of the Proechimys brain and suggest natural endogenous anticonvulsant mechanisms of theses rodents under normal conditions.
16854384	The specific brain regions that contribute to behavioral changes produced by ethanol are not clearly understood. We know that cAMP-PKA signaling has been strongly implicated in the CNS effects of ethanol. Ethanol promotes activation and translocation of the PKA catalytic subunit (Calpha) into the nucleus in cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. PKA Calpha translocation to the nucleus is followed by cAMP Response Element protein phosphorylation (pCREB) and cAMP Response Element (CRE)-mediated gene expression. Here, we use X-gal histochemistry to map CRE-mediated gene transcription in the brain of CRE-lacZ transgenic mice following ethanol injection. RESULTS: 3 h after i.p. ethanol injection (3.2 g/kg, 16% wt/vol.), the number of X-gal positive cells was increased in the nucleus accumbens (202 +/- 63 cells/field compared to 71 +/- 47 cells/field in saline injected controls, P < 0.05 by paired t-test, n = 10). Similar increases were found in other mesolimbic areas and brain regions associated with rewarding and addictive responses. These include: prefrontal cortex, lateral and medial septum, basolateral amygdala, paraventricular and anterior hypothalamus, centromedial thalamus, CA1 region of hippocampus and dentate gyrus, substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus. CONCLUSION: these results confirm and extend current concepts that ethanol stimulates cAMP-PKA signaling in brain regions involved in CNS responses to ethanol.
16857388	In the neonate, regional growth trajectories provide information about the coordinated development of cerebral substructures and help identify regional vulnerability by identifying times of faster growth. Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) has provided detailed information for the myelinated brain but few reports of regional neonatal brain growth exist. We report the method and preliminary results of detailed semiautomated segmentation of 12 normative neonatal brains (gestational age 31.1-42.6 weeks at time of MRI) using volumetric T1-weighted images. Accuracy was confirmed by expert review of every segmented image. In 5 brains, repeat segmentation resulted in intraclass correlation coefficients >0.9 (except for the right amygdala) and an average percent voxel overlap of 90.0%. Artifacts or image quality limited the number of regions segmented in 9/12 data sets and 1/12 was excluded from volumetric analysis due to ventriculomegaly. Brains were segmented into cerebral exterior (N = 8), cerebral lobes (N = 5), lateral ventricles (N = 8), cerebral cortex (N = 6), white matter (N = 6), corpus callosum (N = 7), deep central gray (N = 8), hippocampi (N = 8), amygdalae (N = 8), cerebellar hemispheres (N = 8), vermis (N = 8), midbrain (N = 8), pons (N = 8) and medulla (N = 8). Linear growth (P < 0.05) was identified in all regions except the cerebral white matter, medulla and ventricles. Striking differences in regional growth rates were noted. These preliminary results are consistent with the heterochronous nature of cerebral development and provide initial estimates of regional brain growth and therefore regional vulnerability in the perinatal time period.
16859656	We assessed the presence and the degree of alteration of the regional blood flow (rCBF) as visualized by Tc-99m HMPAO brain rest SPECT in the sensory motor cortex and subcortical structure in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, who suffered from various levels of motor and sensory function loss. Twenty-two patients (mean age: 42.1+/-13.4 years, 18 M, 4 F) and 11 control subjects (mean age: 32.2+/-6.4 years, 8 M, 3 F) participated in this study. The spinal cord injury group was consisted of 2 groups (14 paraplegic and 8 tetraplegic patients). The corticocortical rCBF ratios were calculated by using region of interests obtained from 34 cortical areas on coronal slices. Significantly reduced rCBF were measured from 11 cortical areas in tetraplegic patients and 11 cortical areas in paraplegic patients. Some of these areas were different in each group. In the tetraplegic group, significant reduction was observed in the following rCBF areas: left anterior cingulate gyrus, left medial supplementary motor area, bilateral front and back aspects of posterior cingulate gyrus, right lateral primary motor area, right medial primary sensory area, bilateral putamen, and right cerebellum. In the paraplegic group, reduced rCBF areas were as follows: bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, right lateral supplementary motor area, left front aspect of posterior cingulate gyrus, left lateral primary motor area, bilateral back aspects of posterior cingulate gyrus, right medial primary sensory area, left lateral primary sensory area and bilateral putamen. In conclusion, in some of the movement-cortical and subcortical areas having significantly reduced blood flow in SCI may be helpful to demonstrate the disrupted areas of rCBF by SPECT. We believe that it may be useful if these findings should be considered during the evaluations related to the reorganization in SCI cases.
16884454	Interferon-alpha therapy is associated with a high rate of depression, but the pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of i.p. administered interferon-alpha on monoaminergic neurotransmission in the brain. The levels of monoamines and associated metabolites were measured in various regions of the rat brain using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection system. The serotonin transporter mRNA levels were also measured using in situ hybridization. After 1 day, dopamine turnover was diminished in the cortex. Norepinephrine turnover was decreased in most regions tested after 4 days. However, these changes were transient. After 14 days, serotonin turnover was increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in rats given a dose of 20 000 IU/kg; in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem in those on 200 000 IU/kg; and in the thalamus and hypothalamus in those on 2 000 000 IU/kg (all P < 0.05). However, 14-day treatment did not significantly change serotonin transporter mRNA levels. Next, the question of whether interferon-alpha affects monoamine levels via induction of nitric oxide (NO), was investigated. However, there were no changes in either NO2- or NO3-, as markers of NO production, in any brain regions after 14-day treatment. These results suggest that chronic peripheral administration of interferon-alpha induces metabolic changes in the central serotonin system. Further investigation is needed to determine exactly how this cytokine affects the central serotonin system and to assess whether a central serotonin abnormality is involved in interferon-induced depression.
16901643	By fluorescent differential display, we identified six transcripts (CAPS2/Cadps2, Cdh22, b1402, c1502, d1401, and d1501) that showed the differential expression patterns during the postnatal development of the mouse cerebellum. We further analyzed the latter four transcripts whose cellular localizations in developing mouse brains have not been studied. In the postnatal cerebellum, clones c1502 and d1501 were transiently up-regulated; clone b1402 was up-regulated; and clone d1401 remained relatively constant. Sequence analysis revealed that d1401 and c1502 were derivatives of Ogdh (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) and QP-C (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex ubiquinone-binding protein), respectively. Moreover, b1402 and d1501 were identified as transcripts of a predicted gene (4933409K07Rik) and a novel EST, respectively. b1402 and d1501 were abundantly present in the cerebellum, whereas c1502/QP-C and d1401/Ogdh were widely distributed in various mouse tissues. In the postnatal mouse brain, moderately high mRNA levels of b1402 were restricted to the olfactory bulb, striatum, cerebral cortex (layers II-III and VI), hippocampus (dentate granule cells), and cerebellum (granule cells). c1502/QP-C mRNA was localized at high levels in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus (anterodorsal nucleus, parafacicularis nucleus), tegmentum (red nucleus), cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells), and pons (pontine nucleus, reticulotegmental nucleus, trapezoid body, vestibular nucleus). High mRNA levels of d1401/Ogdh were observed in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebellum, and pons, whereas those of d1501 were detected in the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus, and cerebellum.
16902765	The present study was carried out to elucidate the distribution of calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) in the normal monkey brain. iPLA(2) immunoreactivity was observed in structures derived from the telencephalon, including the cerebral neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens, whereas structures derived from the diencephalon, including the thalamus, hypothalamus and globus pallidus were lightly labeled. The midbrain, vestibular, trigeminal and inferior olivary nuclei, and the cerebellar cortex were densely labeled. Immunoreactivity was observed on the nuclear envelope of neurons, and dendrites and axon terminals at electron microscopy. Western blot analysis showed higher levels of iPLA(2) protein in the cytosolic, than the nuclear fraction, but little or no protein in the membrane fraction. Similarly, subcellular fractionation studies of iPLA(2) activity in rat brain cortical cell cultures showed greater enzymatic activity in the cytosolic, than the nuclear fraction, and the least activity in non-nuclear membranes. The association of iPLA(2) with the nuclear envelope suggests a role of the enzyme in nuclear signaling, such as during neuronal proliferation and differentiation or death. In addition, the localization of iPLA(2) in dendrites and axon terminals suggests a role of the enzyme in neuronal signaling.
16913288	Women diagnosed with complete spinal cord injury (SCI) at T10 or higher report sensations generated by vaginal-cervical mechanical self-stimulation (CSS). In this paper we review brain responses to sexual arousal and orgasm in such women, and further hypothesize that the afferent pathway for this unexpected perception is provided by the Vagus nerves, which bypass the spinal cord. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we ascertained that the region of the medulla oblongata to which the Vagus nerves project (the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract or NTS) is activated by CSS. We also used an objective measure, CSS-induced analgesia response to experimentally induced finger pain, to ascertain the functionality of this pathway. During CSS, several women experienced orgasms. Brain regions activated during orgasm included the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, amygdala, accumbens-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis-preoptic area, hippocampus, basal ganglia (especially putamen), cerebellum, and anterior cingulate, insular, parietal and frontal cortices, and lower brainstem (central gray, mesencephalic reticular formation, and NTS). We conclude that the Vagus nerves provide a spinal cord-bypass pathway for vaginal-cervical sensibility and that activation of this pathway can produce analgesia and orgasm.
16927269	Prokineticins are a pair of regulatory peptides that have been shown to play important roles in gastrointestinal motility, angiogenesis, circadian rhythms, and, recently, olfactory bulb neurogenesis. Prokineticins exert their functions via activation of two closely related G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we report a comprehensive mRNA distribution for both prokineticins (PK1 and PK2) and their receptors (PKR1 and PKR2) in the adult mouse brain with the use of in situ hybridization. PK2 mRNA is expressed in discrete regions of the brain, including suprachiasmatic nucleus, islands of Calleja and medial preoptic area, olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens shell, hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, and amygdala. PK1 mRNA is expressed exclusively in the brainstem, with high abundance in the nucleus tractus solitarius. PKR2 mRNA is detected throughout the brain, with prominent expression in olfactory regions, cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus, septum and hippocampus, habenula, amygdala, nucleus tractus solitarius, and circumventricular organs such as subfornical organ, median eminence, and area postrema. PKR2 mRNA is also detected in mammillary nuclei, periaqueductal gray, and dorsal raphe. In contrast, PKR1 mRNA is found in fewer brain regions, with moderate expression in the olfactory regions, dentate gyrus, zona incerta, and dorsal motor vagal nucleus. Both PKR1 and PKR2 are also detected in olfactory ventricle and subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, both of which are rich sources of neuronal precursors. These extensive expression patterns suggest that prokineticins may have a broad array of functions in the central nervous system, including circadian rhythm, neurogenesis, ingestive behavior, reproduction, and autonomic function.
16933319	Iron serves as an essential trace element for all body tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Because iron deficiency as well as iron overload is known to cause damage to the mammalian brain, the maintenance of iron homeostasis is crucial. It has been discovered recently that hepcidin plays an essential role in iron metabolism outside the CNS. A defect in hepcidin expression is responsible for iron accumulation and mice over-expressing hepcidin die postnatally by a severe anemia. We have used RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry to investigate the cellular distribution of hepcidin mRNA and protein in brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Our results show a wide-spread distribution of hepcidin in different brain areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, cerebellum, pons, spinal cord, as well as in dorsal root ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. Hepcidin immunoreactivity is not restricted to neurons, but can be detected in both neurons and GFAP-positive glia cells. Because hepcidin action in organs outside the CNS is linked to iron homeostasis, we speculate that it is also involved in such processes in the CNS, putatively together with other iron regulating proteins. Cellular mechanisms and functions of hepcidin in the CNS remain to be elucidated.
16998904	Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-amino-acid peptide, mediates biological effects by activating Y1, Y2, Y5, and y6 receptors. NPY neurons innervate many brain regions, including the hypothalamus, where NPY is involved in regulation of a broad range of homeostatic functions. We examined, by immunohistochemistry with tyramide signal amplification, the expression of the NPY Y2 receptor (Y2R) in the mouse brain with a newly developed rabbit polyclonal antibody. Y2R immunoreactivity was specific with its absence in Y2R knockout (KO) mice and in adjacent sections following preadsorption with the immunogenic peptide (10(-5) M). Y2R-positive processes were located in many brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, some cortical areas, septum, basal forebrain, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra compacta, locus coeruleus, and solitary tract nucleus. However, colchicine treatment was needed to detect Y2R-like immunoreactivity in cell bodies in many, but not all, areas. The densest distributions of cell bodies were located in the septum basal forebrain, including the bed nucleus, and amygdala, with lower density in the anterior olfactory nucleus, nucleus accumbens, caudal striatum, CA1, CA2, and CA3 hippocampal fields, preoptic nuclei lateral hypothalamus, and A13 DA cells. The widespread distribution of Y2R-positive cell bodies and fibers suggests that NPY signaling through the Y2R is common in the mouse brain. Localization of the Y2R suggests that it is mostly presynaptic, a view supported by its frequent absence in cell bodies in the normal mouse and its dramatic increase in cell bodies of colchicine-treated mice.
17029258	We performed in situ hybridization histochemistry on the monkey basal ganglia to investigate the mRNA localization of three protein kinase C substrates (GAP-43, MARCKS, and neurogranin), of which expression plays a role in structural changes in neurites and synapses. Weak hybridization signals for GAP-43 mRNA and intense signals for both MARCKS and neurogranin mRNAs were observed in the adult neostriatum. All three of the mRNAs were expressed in both substance P-positive direct pathway neurons and enkephalin-positive indirect pathway neurons. In the nucleus accumbens, the hybridization signals for the three mRNAs were weaker than those in the neostriatum. Double-label in situ hybridization histochemistry in the neostriatum revealed that GAP-43 and neurogranin mRNAs were expressed in a subset of MARCKS-positive neurons. While intense hybridization signals for MARCKS mRNA were observed in all of the other basal ganglia regions such as the globus pallidus, substantia innominata, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra, intense signals for GAP-43 mRNA were restricted to the substantia innominata and substantia nigra pars compacta. No signal for neurogranin mRNA was observed in the basal ganglia regions outside the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that the protein kinase C substrates are abundant in some specific connections in cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Developmental analysis showed that the expression level in the putamen and nucleus accumbens, but not in the caudate nucleus, was higher in the infant than in the adult, suggesting that synaptic maturation in the caudate nucleus occurs earlier than that in the putamen and nucleus accumbens.
17037089	Physical exercise influences the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. A number of studies have examined brain noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) and dopamine (DA) with exercise. Although there are great discrepansies in experimental protocols, the results indicate that there is evidence in favour of changes in synthesis and metabolism of monoamines during exercise. The last five to ten years the microdialysis technique is used to explore neurotransmitter release during exercise. Microdialysis can collect virtually any substance from the brains of freely moving animals with a limited amount of tissue trauma. It allows the measurement of local neurotransmitter release in combination with on-going behavioral changes such as exercise. Microdialysis probes were implanted in different brain areas to monitor diverse aspects of locomotion (striatum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, spinal cord), food reward (hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex), thermoregulation (hypothalamus),... Although the relationship between physical activity and mood has long been recognized, the use of exercise training as a treatment for clinical depression has been the focus of rigourous study only recently. The available evidence provides considerable support for the value of exercise in reducing depressive symptoms both in healthy and clinical populations. Subsequently, many studies have shown that environmental stimulation such as 'enriched environment' and spontaneous activity elicits various plastic responses in the adult brain of rats. Several molecular systems such as neurotrophic factors, could potentially participate in the benefits of exercise on the brain. Several experiments indicate that voluntary wheel running in rats increases both cell proliferation and recruitment of new neurons in several brain areas. Exercise is a powerful tool to stimulate several brain processes, and it is becoming clear that therapeutic effects of exercise are not only good for cardiovascular and other diseases, but that exercise is also good for the brain.
17055664	Connections of motor areas in the frontal cortex of prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) were determined by injecting tracers into sites identified by microstimulation in the primary motor area (M1), dorsal premotor area (PMD), ventral premotor area (PMV), supplementary motor area (SMA), frontal eye field (FEF), and granular frontal cortex. Retrogradely labeled neurons for each injection were related to architectonically defined thalamic nuclei. Nissl, acetylcholinesterase, cytochrome oxidase, myelin, parvalbumin, calbindin, and Cat 301 preparations allowed the ventral anterior and ventral lateral thalamic regions, parvocellular and magnocellular subdivisions of ventral anterior nucleus, and anterior and posterior subdivisions of ventral lateral nucleus of monkeys to be identified. The results indicate that each cortical area receives inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the proportions differ. M1 receives major inputs from the posterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus while premotor areas receive major inputs from anterior parts of ventral lateral nucleus (the anterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus and the anterior portion of posterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus). PMD and SMA have connections with more dorsal parts of the ventral lateral nucleus than PMV. The results suggest that galagos share many subdivisions of the motor thalamus and thalamocortical connection patterns with simian primates, while having less clearly differentiated subdivisions of the motor thalamus.
17071007	Relaxin-3 (RLX3) is a newly identified member of the relaxin/insulin peptide family that is highly conserved across a range of species from fish to mammals and is highly expressed in rat, mouse and human brain. Extensive pharmacological studies have demonstrated that RLX3 is a high affinity, selective ligand for G-protein-coupled receptor-135 (GPCR135, now classified as relaxin family peptide-3 receptor; RXFP3). In ongoing studies to understand the physiological functions of RLX3, the distribution of RLX3-containing neuronal elements in rat brain was determined by immunohistochemistry, using an affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum raised against a conserved segment of the RLX3 C-peptide (AS-R3(85-101)). Consistent with the distribution of RLX3 mRNA, neurons containing RLX3-like immunoreactivity (LI) were observed in the pontine nucleus incertus and the majority of these cells, which are known to express corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1, were shown to express glutamic acid decarboxylase-65-immunoreactivity, suggesting a GABA phenotype. Nerve fibers and terminals containing RLX3-LI were observed adjacent to cells in the nucleus incertus and in various forebrain regions known to receive afferents from the nucleus incertus, including cortex, septum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain. Regions that contained highest densities of RLX3-positive fibers included the medial septum, lateral preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus/medial forebrain bundle and ventral hippocampus; and additional fibers were observed in olfactory bulb and olfactory and frontal/cingulate cortices, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal endopiriform, intergeniculate, and supramammillary nuclei, and the periaqueductal gray and dorsal raphe. The RLX3-positive network overlapped the regional distribution of GPCR135 mRNA and specific binding sites for an [125I]-GPCR135-selective, chimeric peptide. These anatomical findings further support the proposition that RLX3 is the endogenous ligand for GPCR135 in rat brain and provide evidence for broad modulatory activity of RLX3 in behavioral activation relating to autonomic and neuroendocrine control of metabolism and reproduction and higher-order processes such as stress and cognition.
17072644	This study aimed to clarify the development of sulci and gyri on the external surface of the cerebrum of cynomolgus monkeys. Sulcus formation began with the appearance of the lateral fissure on embryonic day (ED) 70, followed by delineations of four cerebral lobes by the emergence of the parietooccipital sulcus, central sulcus, and preoccipital notch on EDs 80-90. The following primary sulci were then visible until ED 120: the superior temporal sulcus on ED 90; the intraparietal sulcus, lunate sulcus, inferior occipital sulcus, and arcuate sulcus on ED 100; and the principle sulcus on ED 110; the occipitotemporal sulcus, anterior middle temporal sulcus, and superior postcentral dimple on ED 120. These sulci demarcated the superior temporal gyrus on ED 90, the precentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus on ED 100, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri, postocentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, and inferior occipital gyrus on ED 120. Except for the intermediate and lateral orbitofrontal sulci, the sulci that appeared on ED 130 and thereafter were not related to the gyrus demarcations. Intriguingly, the brain markedly gained weight on EDs 100 and 120, corresponding to the embryonic ages when almost all gyri were visible. The results suggest that a rapid growth of the cerebrum involves convolutions of the gyri by a regular sequence of the sulcus formation in cynomolgus monkeys. This study further provides a standard of reference for normal development in the cerebral cortical morphology of cynomolgus monkeys.
17085784	Synucleins are proteins known for their malfunction in a group of illnesses called synucleopathies, which includes Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. To learn more about the role of synucleins in the CNS, we have studied levels of message coding for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-synuclein using quantitative RT-PCR. Levels of synuclein mRNAs were studied in the cerebral cortex (left and right, anterior and posterior), hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum, obtained from 5-d-old (newborn), 1-mo (juvenile)-, and 6-, and 9-mo (adult)-old rats. The mRNA levels for all synucleins varied significantly among structures. The rank order of mRNA levels in different structures was cortex = hippocampus > striatum > cerebellum for alpha-synuclein; cortex > hippocampus = cerebellum > striatum for beta-synuclein; and hippocampus = striatum > cortex = cerebellum for gamma-synuclein. There was significant effect of age for mRNA levels for all synucleins. The dynamics of these changes were different depending on type of synuclein and brain structure. Levels of mRNA for alpha-synuclein were significantly reduced with age in all structures except hippocampus. For beta- and gamma-synuclein, levels increased significantly only in the cerebral cortex and only from 5 d to 1 mo of age. In contrast, gamma-synuclein levels in the cerebellum were very high at 5 d and significantly reduced at 1 mo of age. The revealed pattern and dynamics of changes in the levels of mRNA coding for synucleins would support the conclusion for an important role of these molecules during development and the aging process.
17089396	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and the parkinsonian variant of multiple-system atrophy (MSA-P) may present with a similar phenotype. Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be a sensitive discriminator of MSA-P from Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied 20 PSP, 11 MSA-P, 12 PD patients and 7 healthy controls in order to investigate whether regional apparent diffusion coefficients (rADCs) help distinguish PSP and MSA-P; whether rADCs are correlated with clinical disease severity scores; and the relationship between brainstem and cerebellar volumes and rADCs in PSP and MSA-P. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr score, Mini Mental State Examination, and frontal assessment battery were recorded in all patients. Regional ADCs were measured in the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), caudal and rostral pons, midbrain, decussating fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, frontal and parietal white matter, as well as the centrum semiovale. In MSA-P, rADCs in the MCP and rostral pons were significantly greater than in PSP (P < 0.001 and 0.009) and PD (P < 0.001 and = 0.002). Stepwise logistic regression revealed that the MCP rADC distinguishes MSA-P from PSP with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 84%. Increased brainstem rADCs were associated with motor deficit in MSA-P and PSP. Increased rADCs in the pons and MCP were associated with smaller pontine and cerebellar volumes in MSA-P. rADCs distinguish MSA-P from PSP. These have a clinical correlate and are associated with reduced brainstem and cerebellar volumes.
17097068	Central alpha(1)-adrenoceptors are activated by norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI) and possibly dopamine (DA), and function in two fundamental and opposed types of behavior: (1) positively motivated exploratory and approach activities, and (2) stress reactions and behavioral inhibition. Brain microinjection studies have revealed that the positive-linked receptors are located in eight to nine brain regions spanning the neuraxis including the secondary motor cortex, piriform cortex, nucleus accumbens, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic area, vermis cerebellum, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe and possibly the C1 nucleus of the ventrolateral medulla, whereas the stress-linked receptors are present in at least three areas including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Recent studies utilizing c-fos expression and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation have shown that various diverse models of depression in mice produce decreases in positive region-neural activity elicited by motivating stimuli along with increases in neural activity of stress areas. Both types of change are attenuated by various antidepressant agents. This has suggested that the balance of the two networks determines whether an animal displays depressive behavior. A central unresolved question concerns how the alpha(1)-receptors in the positive-activity and stress systems are differentially activated during the appropriate behavioral conditions and to what extent this is related to differences in endogenous ligands or receptor subtype distributions.
17110526	Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is acquired when the ingestion of a food is followed by malaise. CTA is a kind of fear learning making animals avoid subsequent intake of the food and show aversive behavior to the taste of the food. To elucidate the brain regions responsible for the expression of CTA, our previous electrophysiological and recent c-fos immunohistochemical studies have been reviewed. Among a variety of brain regions including the parabrachial nucleus, amygdala, insular cortex, supramammillary nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and ventral pallidum that are involved in different phases of CTA expression, the enhanced taste sensitivity to facilitate detection of the conditioned stimulus may originate in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the hedonic shift, from positive to negative, may originate in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala.
17245707	The cytoarchitecture and axonal projection pattern of pallial areas was studied in the fire-bellied toad Bombina orientalis by intracellular injection of biocytin into a total of 326 neurons forming 204 clusters. Five pallial regions were identified, differing in morphology and projection pattern of neurons. The rostral pallium receiving the bulk of dorsal thalamic afferents has reciprocal connections with all other pallial areas and projects to the septum, nucleus accumbens, and anterior dorsal striatum. The medial pallium projects bilaterally to the medial pallium, septum, nucleus accumbens, mediocentral amygdala, and hypothalamus and ipsilaterally to the rostral, dorsal, and lateral pallium. The ventral part of the medial pallium is distinguished by efferents to the eminentia thalami and the absence of contralateral projections. The dorsal pallium has only ipsilateral projections running to the rostral, medial, and lateral pallium; septum; nucleus accumbens; and eminentia thalami. The lateral pallium has ipsilateral projections to the olfactory bulbs and to the rostral, medial, dorsal, and ventral pallium. The ventral pallium including the striatopallial transition area (SPTA) has ipsilateral projections to the olfactory bulbs, rostral and lateral pallium, dorsal striatopallidum, vomeronasal amygdala, and hypothalamus. The medial pallium can be tentatively homologized with the mammalian hippocampal formation, the dorsal pallium with allocortical areas, the lateral pallium rostrally with the piriform and caudally with the entorhinal cortex, the ventral pallium with the accessory olfactory amygdala. The rostral pallium, with its projections to the dorsal and ventral striatopallidum, resembles the mammalian frontal cortex.
17293051	Natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) mediates the biological effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and is involved in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. In this immunohistochemical study we examined the distribution of NPR-A in the brainstem of the cynomolgus monkey. NPR-A immunoreactivity was localized to neurons in specific brainstem regions. NPR-A-immunoreactive perikarya were found in the red nucleus and the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain, the parabrachial nucleus and the locus coeruleus in the pons, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the hypoglossal nucleus, the cuneate nucleus, the gracile nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus, the lateral reticular nucleus, the reticular formation, and the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla oblongata. Extensive networks of immunoreactive fibers were apparent in the red nucleus, the oculomotor nucleus, the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, and the parabrachial nucleus. Double immunostaining revealed NPR-A immunoreactivity in cholinergic neurons of the parabrachial nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, the hypoglossal nucleus, and the nucleus ambiguus. However, there was no colocalization of NPR-A and tyrosine hydroxylase in the locus coeruleus. The wide anatomical distribution of NPR-A-immunoreactive structures suggests that natriuretic peptides, besides having a role in the central regulation of endocrine and cardiovascular homeostasis, may also mediate diverse physiological functions.
17307323	Sarcoidosis is uncommon in children. Although isolated neurosarcoidosis has been seen in 15% adults with sarcoidosis, pediatric neurosarcoidosis is rarely reported. Neurosarcoidosis may present with cranial neuropathy, including facial palsy, optic nerve or other cranial nerve involvement, peripheral neuropathy, or manifestations of the central nervous system affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, meninges, and spinal cord. The useful diagnostic investigations include magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid studies, brain and meningeal biopsy if feasible, chest radiography to reveal sarcoidosis, angiotensin-converting enzyme level in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid, and Kveim test when available. We herein report a case of isolated brain biopsy-confirmed neurosarcoidosis in a 17-year-old boy presenting with severe unilateral headache and multiple brain and spinal cord MRI lesions mimicking central nervous system metastases.
17321114	A longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in schizophrenia is reported to lead to a poorer clinical outcome, possibly reflecting a neurodegenerative process after the onset of overt psychosis. However, the effect of DUP on brain morphology in schizophrenia is still poorly understood. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the relation between DUP and volumetric measurements for the superior temporal sub-regions (Heschl's gyrus, planum temporale, and caudal superior temporal gyrus), the medial temporal lobe structures (hippocampus and amygdala), and the frontal lobe regions (prefrontal area and anterior cingulate gyrus) in a sample of 38 schizophrenia patients (20 males and 18 females) whose illness duration was less than five years. We found a significant negative correlation between DUP and the volume of gray matter in the left planum temporale even after controlling for age, age at illness onset, and duration and dosage of neuroleptic medication. There was no such correlation for the other brain regions including each sub-region of the prefrontal cortex (the superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and straight gyrus). When subjects were divided into two groups around the median DUP, the long-DUP group had a significantly smaller planum temporale gray matter than the short-DUP group. These findings may reflect a progressive pathological process in the gray matter of the left planum temporale during the initial untreated phase of schizophrenia, whereas abnormalities in the medial temporal regions might be, as has been suggested from previous longitudinal findings, relatively static at least during the early course of the illness.
17321504	A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) form large macromolecular signaling complexes that specifically target cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to unique subcellular compartments and thus, provide high specificity to PKA signaling. For example, the AKAP79/150 family tethers PKA, PKC and PP2B to neuronal membranes and postsynaptic densities and plays an important role in synaptic function. Several studies suggested that AKAP79/150 anchored PKA contributes to mechanisms associated with synaptic plasticity and memory processes, but the precise role of AKAPs in these processes is still unknown. In this study we established the mouse brain distribution of AKAP150 using two well-characterized AKAP150 antibodies. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry we showed that AKAP150 is widely distributed throughout the mouse brain. The highest AKAP150 expression levels were observed in striatum, cerebral cortex and several other forebrain regions (e.g. olfactory tubercle), relatively high expression was found in hippocampus and olfactory bulb and low/no expression in cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus and brain stem. Although there were some minor differences in mouse AKAP150 brain distribution compared to the distribution in rat brain, our data suggested that rodents have a characteristic AKAP150 brain distribution pattern. In general we observed that AKAP150 is strongly expressed in mouse brain regions involved in learning and memory. These data support its suggested role in synaptic plasticity and memory processes.
17334661	In this study, we aimed to determine the progression of brain atrophy in the parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P). Voxel-based morphometry was applied to two consecutive high resolution MR images of 14 patients with probable MSA-P in comparison to 14 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The time interval between baseline and follow-up investigations (1.0 +/- 0.5 SD years in MSAP and 1.4 +/- 0.6 SD years in PD patients) was introduced as covariate in the statistical analysis. Additionally, correlation analyses were performed between the progression maps and clinical data. We observed marked progression of brain atrophy in the MSA-P cohort, the regions including striatum, mesencephalon, thalamus and cerebellum, but also cortical regions such as the primary sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, lateral premotor cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, orbito-frontal cortex,insula, posterior parietal cortex and hippocampus. Short disease duration was correlated with progression of atrophy in the striatum whereas longer disease duration was correlated with increasing atrophy in the cortical areas and cerebellar hemispheres. The UPDRS-III score was not significantly correlated with any brain region. Our data suggest that cortical atrophy is prominent in MSA-P and early degeneration of the basal ganglia drives late onset cortical atrophy.
17343294	We performed a comparison study focusing on differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between 3-T and 1.5-T diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with parallel imaging. Thirty healthy volunteers underwent DTI with an eight-channel phased-array coil at both 3 T and 1.5 T. Histogram and region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed. Paired t tests were applied for statistical analysis. Signal-to-noise ratios of these regions were also measured. For histogram analysis, peak location of FA was significantly lower at 3 T than at 1.5 T (P = 0.04). Mean FA was significantly higher at 3 T than at 1.5 T (P = 0.002). Peak location of MD was significantly lower at 3 T than at 1.5 T (P < 0.001). Mean MD was significantly lower at 3 T than at 1.5 T (P < 0.001). In ROI analysis, FA was significantly larger at 3 T than at 1.5 T in the centrum semiovale (P < 0.001), middle cerebellar peduncle (P < 0.001), cerebral peduncle (P = 0.006), posterior limb of the internal capsule (P = 0.007), genu (P < 0.001) and splenium (P < 0.001). FA was significantly lower at 3 T than at 1.5 T in the globus pallidus (P < 0.001). MD was significantly smaller at 3 T than at 1.5 T in the globus pallidus (P = 0.007), thalamus (P < 0.001), centrum semiovale (P < 0.001), middle cerebellar peduncle (P < 0.001), cerebral peduncle (P = 0.01), posterior limb of the internal capsule (P < 0.001), genu (P = 0.01) and splenium (P < 0.001). Significant differences in FA and MD exist between 3 T and 1.5 T for whole-brain histogram analysis and ROI analysis.
17359363	Immunohistochemistry staining for beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) is a sensitive method to detect early axonal damage in traumatic brain injury, which was previously estimated to be of minimum 60-90 min after head injury. We present seven cases of well-documented posttraumatic survival of 35-60 min where beta-APP detects early axonal damage. Cases were selected from routine work where documentation about survival is judged to be accurate. These are divided into three groups: group 1: severe head injury (n = 7) with documented survival between 35 and 60 min. Group 2: severe head injury (n = 4) with documented survival of less than 30 min. Group 3: cases (n = 4) where death was not due to head injury but survival is documented between 45 and 109 min. The brains were fixed in formalin for 4 weeks and six regions (frontal lobe with anterior corpus callosum, parietal lobe with deep white matter, basal ganglia with posterior limb of internal capsule, cerebellum with white matter and middle cerebellar peduncle and pons with basis pontis and superior cerebellar peduncle) were sampled. All blocks were stained for haematoxylin and eosin and beta-APP and selected ones for CD68, using antigen retrieval method. In group 1 sections revealed beta-APP immunoreactivity in forms of small globules and granules and occasionally as thin and short filaments. These were detected in the pons, corpus callosum, internal capsule and cerebral white matter, with some variation in localization and intensity. In groups 2 and 3 all the sections were negative for beta-APP staining. None of the cases showed evidence of severe brain swelling, increased intracranial pressure, ischaemia or infection. Using the antigen retrieval method, beta-APP immunohistochemistry can detect axonal damage within 35 min after severe head injury. These results may have an implication in the consideration of minimal survival time after traumatic head injury in medico-legal practice.
17372974	The distribution of neurons contributing to the fornix was mapped by placing the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in polyacrylamide gels in different medial to lateral locations within the fornix of three rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The HRP was placed from 3 to 5 mm caudal to the descending columns of the fornix. Additional information came from a series of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasciculata) with anterograde tracer injections in the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and presubiculum, together with the entorhinal cortex (EC) and perirhinal cortex (area 35) contribute numerous axons to the fornix in a topographical manner. In contrast, the lateral perirhinal cortex (area 36) and parahippocampal cortical areas TF and TH only contained a handful of cells labeled via the fornix. The medial fornix originates from cells in the caudal half of the subiculum, the lamina principalis interna of the caudal half of the presubiculum, and from the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The intermediate portion of the fornix (i.e., that part midway between the midline and most lateral parts of the fornix) originates from cells in the rostral half of the subiculum and prosubiculum, the anterior presubiculum (only from the lamina principalis externa), the caudal presubiculum (primarily from lamina principalis interna), the rostral half of CA3, the EC (primarily 28I and 28M), and the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The lateral parts of the fornix arise from the rostral EC (28L only) and the most rostral portion of CA3. Subcortically, the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, supramammillary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the thalamic nucleus reuniens all send projections through the fornix, which presumably terminate in the hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal region. These results not only help to define those regions that project via the fornix, but also reveal those subcortical projections to the hippocampal formation most likely to rely entirely on nonfornical pathways.
17376410	The subthalamic nucleus receives serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus. However, the role of serotonergic innervation in the activity of subthalamic neurons in vivo is unknown. The aim of the present work is to study the changes in the firing of subthalamic neurons in rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus and rats with combined 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions in the dorsal raphe nucleus and 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta by using single-unit extracellular recordings. In rats with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus, the firing rate of subthalamic neurons increased significantly compared with normal rats and the firing pattern changed significantly towards a more bursting firing in the majority of the neurons observed. In rats with combined dorsal raphe nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta lesions, the firing rate and firing pattern of subthalamic neurons did not show a significant difference compared to rats with lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, dorsal raphe nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta lesions combined increased significantly the percentage of subthalamic neurons with burst-firing pattern compared to normal rats, while having no effect on their firing rate. These results show that the serotonergic efferent projections of the dorsal raphe nucleus significantly influence on the activity of subthalamic neurons and that the loss of dopaminergic projection by substantia nigra pars compacta lesion decreases the effect of the lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus on subthalamic nucleus neuronal activity, suggesting that the role of the dorsal raphe nucleus may be exerted by the dorsal raphe nucleus-substantia nigra pars compacta-subthalamic nucleus pathway.
17382501	The pathophysiology of tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is largely unknown, although several lines of research implicate long-term neuroplastic loss of inhibition. The evidence to date suggests that the neuroplastic alterations are likely to be found in multiple brain structures. The present study used manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory pathway of rats with psychophysical evidence of chronic acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. Manganese, an activity-dependent paramagnetic contrast agent, accumulates in active neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels, primarily at synapses, and serves as both a structural and functional indicator. Comparison images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external tinnitus-like sound, and from tinnitus subjects treated with vigabatrin, a GABA agonist shown to eliminate the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus in rats. MEMRI indicated: (1) In rats with evidence of tinnitus, activity was generally elevated in the auditory brainstem, with significant elevation in the cerebellar paraflocculus, the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus, and the inferior colliculus; in general forebrain structures showed decreased activity, although MEMRI may be a less sensitive indicator of forebrain activity than brainstem activity; (2) in normal rats exposed to a tinnitus-like sound, a similar pattern of elevated brainstem activity and decreased forebrain activity was evident, with the notable exception of the paraflocculus, where artificial tinnitus had no effect and (3) vigabatrin, decreased brainstem activity to control levels, in rats with prior evidence of tinnitus, and decreased forebrain activity to below control levels. It was concluded that chronic tinnitus in rats is associated with focal activity elevation in the auditory brainstem and increased activity in the paraflocculus that may be unique to tinnitus.
17394159	Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) was identified as a potent parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R) agonist. Existing anatomical data also support the suggestion that TIP39 is the PTH2R's endogenous ligand, but a comprehensive comparison of TIP39 and PTH2R distributions has not been performed. In the present study, we compared the distributions of TIP39 and PTH2R on adjacent mouse brain sections. In addition, we determined the locations of PTH2R-expressing cell bodies by in situ hybridization histochemistry and by labeling beta-galactosidase driven by the PTH2R promoter in knockin mice. An excellent correlation was found between the distributions of TIP39-containing fibers and PTH2R-containing cell bodies and fibers throughout the brain. TIP39 and the PTH2R are abundant in medial prefrontal, insular, and ectorhinal cortices, the lateral septal nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the fundus striati, the amygdala, the ventral subiculum, the hypothalamus, midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the medial geniculate body, the periaqueductal gray, the ventral tegmental area, the superior and inferior colliculi, the parabrachial nuclei, the locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus and periolivary areas, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Furthermore, even the subregional distribution of TIP39- and PTH2R-immunoreactive fibers in these regions showed remarkable similarities, providing anatomical evidence that TIP39 may act on the PTH2R. Based on these observations and on previous pharmacological data, we propose that TIP39 is an endogenous ligand of the PTH2R and that they form a neuromodulator system, which is optimally positioned to regulate limbic, endocrine, and auditory brain functions.

17416488	The insular cortex is located in the centre of the cerebral hemisphere, having connections with the primary and secondary somatosensory areas, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdaloid body, prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal and parietal opercula, primary and association auditory cortices, visual association cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and motor cortex. Accordingly, dense connections exist among insular cortex neurons. The insular cortex is involved in the processing of visceral sensory, visceral motor, vestibular, attention, pain, emotion, verbal, motor information, inputs related to music and eating, in addition to gustatory, olfactory, visual, auditory, and tactile data. In this article, the literature on the relationship between the insular cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders was summarized following a computer search of the Pub-Med database. Recent neuroimaging data, including voxel based morphometry, PET and fMRI, revealed that the insular cortex was involved in various neuropsychiatric diseases such as mood disorders, panic disorders, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Investigations of functions and connections of the insular cortex suggest that sensory information including gustatory, olfactory, visual, auditory, and tactile inputs converge on the insular cortex, and that these multimodal sensory information may be integrated there.
17435932	Considering the most recent contributions, the limbic cortical areas, originally known as the greater limbic lobe, besides the cingulated and the parahippocampal gyri also includes the insula and the posterior orbital cortex. In contrast to the nonlimbic cortical areas that project to the basal ganglia (particularly over the dorsal aspects of the striatum, constituted by the caudate nucleus and by the putamen), the limbic cortical areas are characterized by projecting to the hypothalamus and also to the ventral striatum (particularly to the nucleus accumbens). Once all the striatum projects to the globus pallidus which projects to the thalamus and then to the cortex, generating cortical-subcortical reentrant circuits, while the dorsal striatum and pallidum related cortico-subcortical loops are involved with motor activities, the ventral cortical-striatal-pallidal system is particularly related with behavior functions. The extended amygdala (central medial amygdala, stria terminalis or dorsal component, ventral component, and bed nucleus of stria terminalis) receives inputs primarily from the limbic cortical areas, is particularly modulated by the prefrontal cortex, and receives also direct connections from the thalamus that enables the amygdala to generate nonspecific and quick responses through its projections to the hypothalamus and to the brainstem. The ventral striatal-pallidal and the extended amygdala are then two basal forebrain macro-anatomical systems, that together with the basal nucleus of Meynert and with the septal-diagonal band system, constitute the main structures that are particularly connected with the limbic cortical areas, and that altogether project to the hypothalamus and to the brainstem which give rise to the autonomic, endocrine and somatosensory components of the emotional experiences, and that regulate the basic activities of drinking, eating, and related to the sexual behavior.
17480011	The localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been well described in most classes of vertebrates but not in adult lampreys. The question if the GABA distribution is similar throughout the vertebrate subphylum is therefore still to be addressed. We here investigate two lamprey species, the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, and the river lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis, and compare the GABA pattern with that of other vertebrates. The present immunohistochemical study provides an anatomical basis for the general distribution and precise localization of GABAergic neurons in the adult lamprey forebrain and brainstem. GABA-immunoreactive cells were organized in a virtually identical manner in the two species. They were found throughout the brain, with the following regions being of particular interest: the granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the nucleus of the anterior commissure, the septum, the lateral and medial pallia, the striatum, the nucleus of the postoptic commissure, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and pretectal areas, the optic tectum, the torus semicircularis, the mesencephalic tegmentum, restricted regions of the rhombencephalic tegmentum, the octavolateral area, and the dorsal column nucleus. The GABA distribution found in cyclostomes is very similar to that of other classes of vertebrates, including mammals. Since the lamprey diverged from the main vertebrate line around 450 million years ago, this implies that already at that time the basic vertebrate plan for the GABA innervation in different parts of the brain had been developed.
17485168	Anatomical studies in animals have described multiple striatal circuits and suggested that sub-components of the striatum, although functionally related, project to distinct cortical areas. To date, anatomical investigations in humans have been limited by methodological constraints such that most of our knowledge of fronto-striatal networks relies on nonhuman primate studies. To better identify the fronto-striatal pathways in the human brain, we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography to reconstruct neural connections between the frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus and putamen in vivo. We demonstrate that the human caudate nucleus is interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, frontal eye fields, cerebellum and thalamus; the putamen is interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, primary motor area, primary somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, cerebellum and thalamus. A connectivity-based seed classification analysis identified connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal areas (DLPFC) and the dorsal-posterior caudate nucleus and between the ventrolateral prefrontal areas (VLPFC) and the ventral-anterior caudate nucleus. For the putamen, connections exist between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal-posterior putamen while the premotor area projects to medial putamen, and the primary motor area to the lateral putamen. Identifying the anatomical organization of the fronto-striatal network has important implications for understanding basal ganglia function and associated disease processes.
17513131	Morphometric cerebral characteristics were studied in children with prenatal poly-substance exposure (n=14) compared to controls (n=14) without such exposure. Ten of the substance-exposed children were born to mothers who used opiates (heroin) throughout the pregnancy. Groups were compared across 16 brain measures: cortical gray matter, cerebral white matter, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, accumbens area, caudate, putamen, pallidum, brainstem, cerebellar cortex, cerebellar white matter, lateral ventricles, inferior lateral ventricles, and the 3rd and 4th ventricles. In addition, continuous measurement of thickness across the entire cortical mantle was performed. Volumetric characteristics were correlated with ability and questionnaire assessments 2 years prior to scan. Compared to controls, the substance-exposed children had smaller intracranial and brain volumes, including smaller cerebral cortex, amygdala, accumbens area, putamen, pallidum, brainstem, cerebellar cortex, cerebellar white matter, and inferior lateral ventricles, and thinner cortex of the right anterior cingulate and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Pallidum and putamen appeared especially reduced in the subgroup exposed to opiates. Only volumes of the right anterior cingulate, the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the accumbens area, showed some association with ability and questionnaire measures. The sample studied is rare and hence small, so conclusions cannot be drawn with certainty. Morphometric group differences were observed, but associations with previous behavioral assessment were generally weak. Some of the volumetric differences, particularly thinner cortex in part of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, may be moderately involved in cognitive and behavioral difficulties more frequently experienced by opiate and poly-substance-exposed children.
17568431	Adenosine A(2A) receptor (A2AR) is thought to interact with dopamine D(2) receptor. Selective A2AR antagonists have attracted attention as the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated the distribution of the A2ARs in the living human brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and [7-methyl-(11)C]-(E)-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-1,3,7-trimethylxanthine ([(11)C]TMSX). We recruited five normal male subjects. A dynamic series of PET scans was performed for 60 min, and the arterial blood was sampled during the scan to measure radioactivity of the parent compound and labeled metabolites. Circular regions of interest of 10-mm diameter were placed in the PET images over the cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, head of caudate nucleus, anterior and posterior putamen, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and posterior cingulate gyrus for each subject. A two-tissue, three-compartment model was used to estimate K(1), k(2), k(3), and k(4) between metabolite-corrected plasma and tissue time activity of [(11)C]TMSX. The binding potential (BP) was the largest in the anterior (1.25) and posterior putamen (1.20), was next largest in the head of caudate nucleus (1.05) and thalamus (1.03), and was small in the cerebral cortex, especially frontal lobe (0.46). [(11)C]TMSX PET showed the largest BP in the striatum in which A2ARs were enriched as in postmortem and nonhuman studies reported, but that the binding of [(11)C]TMSX was relatively larger in the thalamus to compare with other mammals. To date, [(11)C]TMSX is the only promising PET ligand, which is available to clinical use for mapping the A2ARs in the living human brain.
17587876	We acquired diffusion tensor images on 33 normal adults aged 22-64 and 15 adolescents aged 14-21. We assessed relative anisotropy in stereotaxically located regions of interest in the internal capsule, corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiations, frontal anterior fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, temporal lobe white matter, cingulum bundle, frontal inferior longitudinal fasciculus, frontal superior longitudinal fasciculus, and optic radiations. All of these structures except the optic radiations, corpus callosum, and frontal inferior longitudinal fasciculus exhibited differences in anisotropy between adolescents and adults. Areas with anisotropy increasing with age included the anterior limb of the internal capsule, superior levels of the frontal superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior portion of the temporal white matter. Areas with anisotropy decreasing with age included the posterior limb of the internal capsule, anterior thalamic radiations, fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior portion of the frontal anterior fasciculus, inferior portion of the frontal superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle and superior portion of the temporal axis. Sex differences were found in the majority of areas but were most marked in the cingulum bundle and internal capsule. These results suggest continuing white matter development between adolescence and adulthood.
17595535	The gas nitric oxide (NO) is emerging as an important regulator of normal physiology and pathophysiology in the central nervous system (CNS). The distribution of cells releasing NO is poorly understood in non-mammalian vertebrates. Nitric oxide synthase immunocytochemistry (NOS ICC) was thus used to identify neuronal cells that contain the enzyme required for NO production in the amphibian brain and spinal cord. NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd) histochemistry was also used because the presence of NADPHd serves as a reliable indicator of nitrergic cells. Both techniques revealed stained cells in all major structures and pathways in the bullfrog brain. Staining was identified in the olfactory glomeruli, pallium and subpallium of the telencephalon; epithalamus, thalamus, preoptic area, and hypothalamus of the diencephalon; pretectal area, optic tectum, torus semicircularis, and tegmentum of the mesencephalon; all layers of the cerebellum; reticular formation; nucleus of the solitary tract, octaval nuclei, and dorsal column nuclei of the medulla; and dorsal and motor fields of the spinal cord. In general, NADPHd histochemistry provided better staining quality, especially in subpallial regions, although NOS ICC tended to detect more cells in the olfactory bulb, pallium, ventromedial thalamus, and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. NOS ICC was also more sensitive for motor neurons and consistently labeled them in the vagus nucleus and along the length of the rostral spinal cord. Thus, nitrergic cells were ubiquitously distributed throughout the bullfrog brain and likely serve an essential regulatory function.
17604949	The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the deletion of the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) gene on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuronal activation in central nervous structures. The mPGES-1 catalyses the conversion of COX-derived PGH(2) to PGE(2) and has been described as a regulated enzyme whose expression is stimulated by proinflammatory agents. Using the immediate-early gene c-fos as a marker of neuronal activation, we determined whether deletion of the mPGES-1 gene altered the neuronal activation induced by LPS in structures classically recognized as immunosensitive regions. No significant difference in the c-Fos immunostaining was observed in the brain of saline-treated mPGES-1+/+, mPGES-1+/- and mPGES-1-/- mice. However, we observed that LPS-induced neuronal activation was reduced in most of the centres known as immunosensitive nuclei in mPGES-1-/- mice compared with heterozygous and wild-type mice. The decrease in the number of c-Fos positive nuclei occurred particularly in the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the medial, intermediate and central parts of the nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, ventromedial preoptic area, central amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and to a lesser extent in the ventrolateral part of the nucleus tractus solitarius and rostral ventrolateral medulla. These results suggest that the mPGES-1 enzyme is strongly needed to provide sufficient PGE(2) production required to stimulate immunosensitive brain regions and they are discussed with regard to the recent works reporting impaired sickness behavior in mPGES-1-/- mice.
17613711	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enters the central nervous system shortly after the infection and becomes localized in different regions of the brain, leading to various neurological abnormalities including motor disorders and neurocognitive deficits. Although HIV-1-associated functional abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) can be evaluated during life by using various test batteries, HIV-1 virus concentration in different brain regions can be measured only after death. The tissues obtained at autopsy provide a valuable source for determining the role of various factors, including that of HIV-1 viral load in the CNS, that may contribute to the regional CNS neuropathogenesis. For this study, we obtained from the National Institutes of Health-sponsored National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) the tissues from different brain regions collected at autopsy of HIV-1-positive (N = 38) and HIV-negative (N = 11) individuals, with postmortem intervals of 2 to 29 h, and measured HIV-1 RNA concentration in the frontal cortex, frontal cortex area 4, frontal cortex area 6, basal ganglia, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and cerebrospinal fluid. Because HIV-1+ individuals were infected with the virus for up to 21 years and the majority of them had used highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we used highly sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in order to detect a wide dynamic range of HIV-1 RNA with lower detection limit of a single copy. The primers and probes were from the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of HIV genome for achieving higher specificity and sensitivity of detection and amplification. Our results demonstrate a wide variation in the concentration of HIV-1 RNA in different brain regions (5.51 and 8,144,073; log(10) 0.74 and 6.91 copies/g tissue), and despite the high specificity and sensitivity of this method, viral RNA was not detected in 50% of all the samples, and in 30% to 64% of samples of each region of HIV-1+ individuals. However, the highest concentration of viral RNA was found in the caudate nucleus and the lowest concentration in the frontal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid. The viral RNA was undetectable in all samples of HIV-negative individuals.
17653300	From the perspective of comparative morphology, the distribution of non-monoaminergic neurons in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was investigated using an immunohistochemical method with specific antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).TH-immunoreactive (IR) neurons (but not AADC-IR) neurons were observed in the olfactory tubercle, preoptic suprachiasmatic nucleus, periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal gray matter, medial longitudinal fasciculus, substantia nigra, and nucleus solitaris. In contrast, AADC-IR (but not TH-IR), small, oval and spindle-shaped neurons were sparsely distributed in the following areas: the hypothalamus from the anterior nucleus to the lateral nucleus, the dorsomedial nucleus, the dorsomedial area of the medial mammillary nucleus and the arcuate nucleus; the midbrain, including the stria medullaris and substantia nigra; and the medulla oblongata, including the dorsal area of the nucleus solitaris and the medullary reticular nucleus. The distribution of AADC-IR neurons was not as extensive in the marmoset as it is in rats. However, these neurons were located in the marmoset, but not the rat substantia nigra. Furthermore, AADC-IR neurons that are present in the human striatum were absent in that of the marmoset. The present results indicate that the distribution of non-monoaminergic neurons in the brain of the common marmoset is unique and different from that in humans and rodents.
17659349	The circumventricular organs are small sized structures lining the cavity of the third ventricle (neurohypophysis, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, subfornical organ, pineal gland and subcommissural organ) and of the fourth ventricle (area postrema). Their particular location in relation to the ventricular cavities is to be noted: the subfornical organ, the subcommissural organ and the area postrema are situated at the confluence between ventricles while the neurohypophysis, the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis and the pineal gland line ventricular recesses. The main object of this work is to study the specific characteristics of the vascular architecture of these organs: their capillaries have a wall devoid of blood-brain barrier, as opposed to central capillaries. This particular arrangement allows direct exchange between the blood and the nervous tissue of these organs. This work is based on a unique set of histological preparations from 12 species of mammals and 5 species of birds, and is taking the form of an atlas.
17664006	Oxytocin has been demonstrated to be involved in pain modulation. Acupuncture analgesia is a very useful clinical tool for pain relief, which has over 2500-year history in China. The present study investigated the role of oxytocin in acupuncture analgesia in the rat through oxytocin administration and measurement. Central administration of oxytocin (intraventricular injection or intrathecal injection) enhanced acupuncture analgesia, while central administration of anti-oxytocin serum weakened acupuncture analgesia in a dose-dependent manner. However, intravenous injection of oxytocin or anti-oxytocin serum did not influence acupuncture analgesia. Electrical acupuncture of "Zusanli" (St. 36) reduced oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, and elevated oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, thalamic ventral nucleus, periaqueductal gray, raphe magnus nucleus, caudate nucleus, thoracic spinal cord and lumbar spinal cord, but did not alter oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, anterior pituitary, posterior pituitary and plasma. The data suggested that oxytocin in central nervous system rather than in peripheral organs is involved in acupuncture analgesia.
17714817	Immunocytochemical techniques were used to investigate the distribution of calretinin in the brain and pituitary gland of the hardhead catfish Arius felis. Calretinin immunoreactive neurons were found in the telencephalon (lateral nucleus of ventral telencephalic area), diencephalon (around the medial forebrain bundle, lateral tuberal nucleus, central pretectal nucleus, posterior periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, medial preglomerular nucleus, diffuse nucleus of the inferior lobe), mesencephalon (nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, ventral nucleus of the semicircular torus), cerebellum (valvula cerebelli, eurydendroid cells) and rhombencephalon (secondary gustatory nucleus, isthmic nucleus, trigeminal motor nucleus, medial auditory nucleus of the medulla, medial and inferior reticular formation, anterior, descending, posterior and tangential octaval nuclei). Calretinin-labeled fibers were observed in the optic nerve and at the levels of the central pretectal nucleus, the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, the ventral nucleus of the semicircular torus, the secondary gustatory nucleus, the trigeminal motor nucleus, the eurydendroid cells, the medial auditory nucleus of the medulla and the octaval nucleus. For the first time, we are reporting on calretinin-positive cells in the rostral and proximal pars distalis of the adenohypophysis. Although, it seems speculatory, calretinin-expressing cells in the pituitary gland may be involved in hormonal regulation and hence, calretinin might play a significant role in governing hypophysial functions in fishes. Our results suggest that calretinin shows species-specific variations also among the teleost fish, similar to mammals.
17964556	In the present study, we will provide further anatomical evidence that the primary auditory cortex (field AI) is not only involved in sensory processing of its own modality, but also in complex bottom-up and top-down processing of multimodal information. We have recently shown that AI in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) has substantial connections with non-auditory sensory and multisensory brain structures [Budinger, E., Heil, P., Hess, A., Scheich, H., 2006. Multisensory processing via early cortical stages: Connections of the primary auditory cortical field with other sensory systems. Neuroscience 143, 1065-1083]. Here we will report about the direct connections of AI with non-sensory cortical areas and subcortical structures. We approached this issue by means of the axonal transport of the sensitive bidirectional neuronal tracers fluorescein-labelled (FD) and tetramethylrhodamine-labelled dextran (TMRD), which were simultaneously injected into different frequency regions of the gerbil's AI. Of the total number of retrogradely labelled cell bodies found in non-sensory brain areas, which identify cells of origin of direct projections to AI, approximately 24% were in cortical areas and 76% in subcortical structures. Of the cell bodies in the cortical areas, about 4.4% were located in the orbital, 11.1% in the infralimbic medial prefrontal (areas DPC, IL), 18.2% in the cingulate (3.2% in CG1, 2.9% in CG2, 12.1% in CG3), 9.5% in the frontal association (area Fr2), 12.0% in the insular (areas AI, DI), 10.8% in the retrosplenial, and 34.0% in the perirhinal cortex. The cortical regions with retrogradely labelled cells, as well as the entorhinal cortex, also contained anterogradely labelled axons and their terminations, which means that they are also target areas of direct projections from AI. The laminar pattern of corticocortical connections indicates that AI receives primarily cortical feedback-type inputs and projects in a feedforward manner to its target areas. The high number of double-labelled somata, the non-topographic distribution of single FD- and TMRD-labelled somata, and the overlapping spatial distribution of FD- and TMRD-labelled axonal elements suggest rather non-tonotopic connections between AI and the multimodal cortices. Of the labelled cell bodies in the subcortical structures, about 38.8% were located in the ipsilateral basal forebrain (10.6% in the lateral amygdala LA, 11.5% in the globus pallidus GP, 3.7% in the ventral pallidum VPa, 13.0% in the nucleus basalis NB), 13.1% in the ipsi- and contralateral diencephalon (6.4% in the posterior paraventricular thalamic nuclei, 6.7% in the hypothalamic area), and 48.1% in the midbrain (20.0% in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, 9.8% in the ipsi- and contralateral ventral tegmental area, 5.0% in the ipsi- and contralateral locus coeruleus, 13.3% the ipsi- and contralateral dorsal raphe nuclei). Thus, the majority of subcortical inputs to AI was related to different neurotransmitter systems. Anterograde labelling was only found in some ipsilateral basal forebrain structures, namely, the LA, basolateral amygdala, GP, VPa, and NB. As for the cortex, the proportion and spatial distribution of single FD-, TMRD-, and double-labelled neuronal elements suggests rather non-tonotopic connections between AI and the neuromodulatory subcortical structures.
18048962	Glucose is the main source of energy for the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we examined the effects of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH) and the neuronal mediator nitric oxide (NO) on [3H]glucose uptake in the brain of adult rats that had been prenatally exposed to lead. Lead [Pb(CH3COO)2 . 3H2O; 250 ppm] was added to the drinking water of pregnant Wistar rats for the duration of pregnancy. On the day of parturition, lead was discontinued as an additive in the drinking water. Offspring remained ith dams for 21 days. The control group consisted of rats that consumed water without lead. In adulthood, male offspring from both groups (lead-exposed and control) were pretreated with 7-nitroindazole (nNOS blocking agent) (10.0 mg/kg ip) or saline (1.0 ml/kg ip), 30 min before AMPH (1.0 mg/kg ip). After another 30 min, and 15 min before termination, all rats were injected with 6-[3H]-D-glucose (500 muCi/kg ip). Brain specimens were taken (striatum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus with hypothalamus, and pons with medulla oblongata) for determination of radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. We found that lead did not alter [3H]glucose uptake in brain regions studied (with exception of frontal cortex) but that AMPH increased [3H]glucose uptake in the striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus, and that the AMPH effect was lessened in the hippocampus of lead-exposed rats. Moreover, the AMPH effect on [3H]glucose uptake in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus with hypothalamus and pons of control rats was potentiated by 7-NI pretreatment. Similar effect was observed in lead-intoxicated rats (striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus). These results indicate that NO modulates AMPH-induced [3H]glucose uptake in the brain of rats prenatally exposed to lead.
18067148	The regional, laminar, and longitudinal organization of intrinsic projections in the presubiculum was examined in the rat with the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin and the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. Cells of origin of intrinsic projections in the presubiculum were distributed in layers II and V, with almost none in layers III and VI. Projections from layer II cells were bilateral and confined to layers II and V and also to the deep portion of layer I, whereas projections from layer V cells were ipsilateral and confined largely to layer V, with fewer projections to layer II. Septotemporal and proximodistal differences in both the projection and the distribution of layer II cells were found: layer II cells in the septal and mid presubiculum, especially those located in the distal part, provided long projections to the temporal presubiculum, whereas layer II cells in the temporal presubiculum provided slightly shorter projections almost entirely within the mid and temporal presubiculum. Layer II cells aggregated massively in the distal portions of the septal and mid presubiculum, but very few layer II cells were found in the most proximal part, especially in the temporal presubiculum. On the other hand, in layer V, cells of origin and their terminals were diffusely and equally distributed throughout the entire proximodistal extent of the presubiculum. Layer V cells did not project longitudinally as far as layer II cells. These longitudinal connections, in layers II and V, make it possible to merge information conveyed by parallel pathways in the presubiculum.
18080129	While both neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD) show frontotemporal lobar degeneration and/or motor neuron disease, it remains unclear whether, and how, these diseases differ from each other. Here, we compared the clinicopathological characteristics of four BIBD and two NIFID cases. Atypical initial symptoms included weakness, dysarthria, and memory impairment in BIBD, and dysarthria in NIFID. Dementia developed more than 1 year after the onset in some BIBD and NIFID cases. Upper and lower motor neuron signs, parkinsonism, and parietal symptoms were noted in both diseases, and involuntary movements in BIBD. Pathologically, severe caudate atrophy was consistently found in both diseases. Cerebral atrophy was distributed in the convexity of the fronto-parietal region in NIFID cases. In both BIBD and NIFID, the frontotemporal cortex including the precentral gyrus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus including the dentate gyrus, substantia nigra, and pyramidal tract were severely affected, whereas lower motor neuron degeneration was minimal. While alpha-internexin-positive inclusions without cores were found in both NIFID cases, one NIFID case also had alpha-internexin- and neurofilament-negative, but p62-positive, cytoplasmic spherical inclusions with eosinophilic p62-negative cores. These two types of inclusions frequently coexisted in the same neuron. In three BIBD cases, inclusions were tau-, alpha-synuclein-, alpha-internexin-, and neurofilament-negative, but occasionally p62-positive. These findings suggest that: (1) the clinical features and distribution of neuronal loss are similar in BIBD and NIFID, and (2) an unknown protein besides alpha-internexin and neurofilament may play a pivotal pathogenetic role in at least some NIFID cases.
18085890	Past work has demonstrated robust brain changes in cholecystokinin (CCK-8) following social defeat. Here the authors analyzed brain regional, CCK-8, substance P, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), and neuropeptide Y levels in adult male Long-Evans rats defeated in a resident-intruder social aggression paradigm, as indexed by elevated bites received, freezing, and emission of 20-kHz calls. Brains harvested 6 hr after social defeat were dissected into 12 regions (olfactory bulbs, 3 cortical regions [frontal cortex, cortex above the basal ganglia, cortex above the diencephalon], caudate-putamen, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, tectum, tegmentum, and lower brain stem). Neuropeptide radioimmunoassays demonstrated the following statistically significant regional changes in defeated rats as compared with nondefeated rats: CCK-8 was reduced in frontal cortex and cortex overlying diencephalon, the olfactory bulbs, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, tectum, and lower brainstem. Neuropeptide Y was elevated in the caudate-putamen. Substance P was elevated in the cortex over the basal ganglia and decreased in basal forebrain. CRF was diminished in the hippocampus. The results highlight more robust CCK modulation by social defeat as compared with 3 other neuropeptide systems involved in brain emotional regulation.
18177631	P2X7 receptor is a member of the P2X family of ATP-gated ion channels. The cellular localization of P2X7 receptors in the central nervous system remains controversial because immunohistochemical staining patterns are inconsistent among antibodies. Here we examined the precise distribution of P2X7 mRNAs in the rat brain using isotopic in situ hybridization. P2X7-positive glial-like small cells were sporadically scattered in almost all areas of the brain. P2X7-positive glial-like small cells were also observed in nerve fiber tracts such as the anterior commissure, corpus callosum (CC), optic tract, and internal capsule. P2X7-positive neurons were found in the anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral cortex, piriform cortex (Pir), lateral septal nucleus (LS), hippocampal pyramidal cell layers of CA1, CA3, CA4, pontine nuclei, external cuneate nucleus, and medial vestibular nucleus. P2X7 hybridization signals were also observed in the motor neurons of the trigeminal motor nucleus, facial nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, and the anterior horn of the spinal cord. P2X7 mRNA was expressed in the ependymal cells around the olfactory ventricle, lateral ventricles (LV), third ventricle (3V), cerebral aqueduct (Aq), fourth ventricle (4V), and central canal. The P2X7 hybridization signal was also very strong in the area postrema (AP). The double staining experiments demonstrate that neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia expressed P2X7 receptor mRNAs. These findings suggest that P2X7 receptors may play a variety of roles in a wide range of cell types in the brain.
18196529	Transforming growth factor-betas are expressed in the brain, have neuroprotective functions, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Their intracellular processing, secretion, and extracellular activation requires latent transforming growth factor-beta binding proteins (LTBPs) as demonstrated in peripheral organs. Here, we first report that the four types of LTBPs are expressed in the rat brain based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and that the subtypes have different topographical distributions based on in situ hybridization histochemistry. LTBP-1 has a high expression level in several brain regions including choroid plexus, cerebral cortex, medial amygdaloid nucleus, anteromedial and midline thalamic nuclei, medial preoptic area, arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, superior olive, and area postrema. LTBP-3 and -4 are the most widely distributed LTBPs. Both are abundant in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, amygdala, brainstem motor nuclei, and area postrema. In addition, LTBP-3 mRNA is also abundant in the choroid plexus, globus pallidus, anterior and reticular thalamic nuclei, mamillary body, substantia nigra, red nucleus, pontine nuclei, some brainstem sensory nuclei, and reticular formation, while LTBP-4 is more abundant in the hippocampus and the parabrachial nuclei. In contrast, the expression of LTBP-2 is restricted to cerebral cortex, CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, and perifornical/lateral hypothalamic areas. The hypothalamic cells were identified by double in situ hybridization histochemistry as orexin-synthesizing neurons, demonstrating that LTBP expression can be very specifically regulated. Our data demonstrate that each type of LTBPs have highly distinct distributional patterns suggesting that the expression of LTBPs are specifically regulated in the brain.
18220255	We tested the hypothesis that, in the amphibian Xenopus laevis, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) not only has widespread actions in the brain but also acts as a local factor in endocrine pituitary cells and/or is neurohemally secreted into the circulation to control peripheral targets. CARTp-immunoreactive cells occur in the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, septum, striatum, nucleus of Bellonci, ventrolateral nucleus, central thalamic nucleus, preoptic nuclei, and suprachiasmatic nucleus, and particularly in the medial pallium, ventromedial nucleus, hypothalamus, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, optic tectum, raphe nuclei, central gray, nucleus of the solitary tract, and spinal cord. From the hypothalamic magnocellular nucleus, CARTp-containing axons run to the neurohemal median eminence, and to the neural pituitary lobe to form neurohemal terminals, as shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Starvation increases the number of CARTp-cells in the optic tectum by 46% but has no effect on such cells in the torus semicircularis. CARTp does not affect in vitro release of alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone from pituitary melanotrope cells. Our results support the hypothesis that in X. laevis, CARTp not only has multiple and not exclusively feeding-related actions in the brain but is also secreted as a neurohormone 1) into the portal system to control endocrine targets in the pituitary distal lobe and 2) from neurohemal axon terminals in the neural pituitary lobe to act peripherally. The differences in CARTp distribution between X. laevis and Rana esculenta may be related to different environmental and physiological conditions such as feeding, sensory information processing, and locomotion.
18224455	The present study examined the effects of paradoxical sleep (PS) deprivation on the oxidative stress parameters: lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione in brain regions: cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brain stem of adult (8 months) and old (24 months) rats. PS deprivation (96 h) was performed by the classical flower pot technique. PS deprivation did not affect oxidative stress parameters in the striatum of both age groups; and the activity of glutathione peroxidase was not affected in any of the studied brain regions in both age groups. PS deprivation decreased the levels of glutathione only in the hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus; the magnitude of decrease was higher in the old than in the adult age group. PS deprivation increased the superoxide dismutase activity in the cerebral cortex and brain stem but reduced it in the hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus in both age groups. Increases in the activity were greater in adult animals than in old ones; the decline in the activity was greater in the hippocampus of old animals than in that of the adult ones. Lipid peroxidation was reduced by PS deprivation in the cerebral cortex and brain stem but was elevated in the hypothalamus and thalamus: the magnitude of alteration in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, hippocampus and hypothalamus was higher in adult animals than in old ones. The results showed that oxidative stress was not uniformly affected in all the brain regions. The cerebral cortex and brain stem showed a fall in oxidative stress after PS deprivation; the fall was greater in the adult than in the old animals. However, the oxidative stress was elevated in the hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, and old animals were more severely affected than the adult ones.
18311787	The paraventricular (PV) and paratenial (PT) nuclei are prominent cell groups of the midline thalamus. To our knowledge, only a single early report has examined PV projections and no previous study has comprehensively analyzed PT projections. By using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, and the retrograde tracer, FluoroGold, we examined the efferent projections of PV and PT. We showed that the output of PV is virtually directed to a discrete set of limbic forebrain structures, including 'limbic' regions of the cortex. These include the infralimbic, prelimbic, dorsal agranular insular, and entorhinal cortices, the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus, dorsal tenia tecta, claustrum, lateral septum, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens (core and shell), olfactory tubercle, bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST), medial, central, cortical, and basal nuclei of amygdala, and the suprachiasmatic, arcuate, and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. The posterior PV distributes more heavily than the anterior PV to the dorsal striatum and to the central and basal nuclei of amygdala. PT projections significantly overlap with those of PV, with some important differences. PT distributes less heavily than PV to BST and to the amygdala, but much more densely to the medial prefrontal and entorhinal cortices and to the ventral subiculum of hippocampus. As described herein, PV/PT receive a vast array of afferents from the brainstem, hypothalamus, and limbic forebrain, related to arousal and attentive states of the animal, and would appear to channel that information to structures of the limbic forebrain in the selection of appropriate responses to changing environmental conditions. Depending on the specific complement of emotionally associated information reaching PV/PT at any one time, PV/PT would appear positioned, by actions on the limbic forebrain, to direct behavior toward a particular outcome over a range of outcomes.
18325670	Magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the relation between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism and volumetric measurements for the medial temporal lobe structures (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus) and prefrontal sub-regions (the superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and straight gyrus) in a Japanese sample of 33 schizophrenia patients and 29 healthy subjects. For the controls, the Met carriers had significantly smaller parahippocampal and left superior frontal gyri than the Val homozygotes. The schizophrenia patients carrying the Met allele had a significantly smaller right parahippocampal gyrus than those with the Val/Val genotype, but the genotype did not affect the prefrontal regions in schizophrenia patients. These findings might reflect different genotypic effects of BDNF on brain morphology in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, implicating the possible role of the brain morphology as an endophenotype for future genetic studies in schizophrenia.
18356632	After 10-minute incubation of [3H]-tyrosine methionine-enkephalin (MET) with 100,000 x g supernatant from select brain regions of patients with chronic schizophrenia (n = 3), essentially all of the labeled tyrosine was recovered as the free amino acid. Initial velocity and half-life of MET degradation obtained from different brain areas (limbic system, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cortex) of individual brains or from equivalent sections from different brains were scattered and considerable spread out (brains A, B, and C: 21.7-60.2 and 2.1-14.3, 25.6-88.7 and 1.6-14.1, 24.5-56.1 and 2.6-14.3 pg MET/mg brain tissue/min and min, respectively; brains A-C range, 21.7-88.7 pg MET/mg brain tissue/min and 1.6-14.3 min, respectively). These results failed to identify consistent differences in peptide degradation kinetics between the various brains areas studied from the same individual or from equivalent section from different subjects. MET metabolic rate was pH and temperature-dependent (optimum 7.4 degrees C and 37 degrees C), reduced by the aminopeptidase inhibitors puromycin, bacitracin, and bestatin, and to a lesser extent by thioridazine. However, peptide metabolism was not significantly affected by differences in tissue storage time or repeated freezing and thawing; by preincubation with N-carboxymethyl phenyl leucine, captopril, or thiorphan (dipeptidyl peptidase[s] or peptidyl dipeptidase[s] inhibitors, respectively); or by the many different drugs used by the patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our findings, although of a preliminary nature and generally similar to those recently reported for comparable studies on nonneuropsychiatric patients, provide a much needed understanding of the mechanisms regulating brain MET metabolism. Whether these results may contribute to the rational design of pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of pathologies associated with alterations in the enkephalinergic system needs further research.
18399546	Glucocorticoids (GCs) play essential roles in physiology, development, and behavior that are mediated largely by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Although the GR has been intensively studied in mammals, very little is known about the GR in nonmammalian tetrapods. We analyzed the distribution and GC regulation of GR in the brain of the frog Xenopus laevis by immunohistochemistry. GR-immunoreactive (GR-ir) cells were widely distributed, with the highest densities in the medial pallium (mp; homolog of the mammalian hippocampus), accumbens, anterior preoptic area (POA; homolog of the mammalian paraventricular nucleus), Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and rostral anterior pituitary gland (location of corticotropes). Lower but distinct GR-ir was observed in the internal granule cell layer of the olfactory bulbs, dorsal and lateral pallium, striatum, various subfields of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), optic tectum, various tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, reticular nuclei, and the nuclei of the trigeminal motor nerves. Treatment with corticosterone (CORT) for 4 days significantly decreased GR-ir in the POA, mp, medial amygdala (MeA), BNST, and rostral pars distalis. Treatment with the corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (MTP) also significantly reduced GR-ir in the POA, mp, MeA and BNST, but not in the rostral pars distalis. Replacement with a low dose of CORT in MTP-treated animals reversed these effects in brain. Thus, chronic increase or decrease in circulating corticosteroids reduces GR-ir in regions of the frog brain. Our results show that the central distribution of GR-ir and regulation by corticosteroids are highly conserved among vertebrates.
18410507	Aminopeptidase A (APA) generated brain angiotensin III, one of the main effector peptides of the brain renin angiotensin system, exerting a tonic stimulatory effect on the control of blood pressure in hypertensive rats. The distribution of APA in human brain has not been yet studied. We first biochemically characterized human brain APA (apparent molecular mass of 165 and 130 kDa) and we showed that the human enzyme exhibited similar enzymatic characteristics to recombinant mouse APA. Both enzymes had similar sensitivity to Ca(2+). Kinetic studies showed that the K(m) (190 mumol/L) of the human enzyme for the synthetic substrate-l-glutamyl-beta-naphthylamide was close from that of the mouse enzyme (256 mumol/L). Moreover, various classes of inhibitors including the specific and selective APA inhibitor, (S)-3-amino-4-mercapto-butyl sulfonic acid, had similar inhibitory potencies toward both enzymes. Using (S)-3-amino-4-mercapto-butyl sulfonic acid, we then specifically measured the activity of APA in 40 microdissected areas of the adult human brain. Significant heterogeneity was found in the activity of APA in the various analyzed regions. The highest activity was measured in the choroids plexus and the pineal gland. High activity was also detected in the dorsomedial medulla oblongata, in the septum, the prefrontal cortex, the olfactory bulb, the nucleus accumbens, and the hypothalamus, especially in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Immunostaining of human brain sections at the level of the medulla oblongata strengthened these data, showing for the first time a high density of immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies and fibers in the motor hypoglossal nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the Roller nucleus, the ambiguus nucleus, the inferior olivary complex, and in the external cuneate nucleus. APA immunoreactivity was also visualized in vessels and capillaries in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the inferior olivary complex. The presence of APA in several human brain nuclei sensitive to angiotensins and involved in blood pressure regulation suggests that APA in humans is an integral component of the brain renin angiotensin system and strengthens the idea that APA inhibitors could be clinically tested as an additional therapy for the treatment of certain forms of hypertension.
18420379	In this study, we demonstrate the presence of immunoreactive structures containing calcitonin gene-related peptide in the alpaca brainstem. This is the first time that a detailed mapping of the cell bodies and fibers containing this neuropeptide in the alpaca brainstem has been carried out using an immunocytochemical technique. Immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were widely distributed throughout the alpaca brainstem. A high density of calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive perikarya was found in the superior colliculus, the dorsal nucleus of the raphe, the trochlear nucleus, the lateral division of the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, the motor trigeminal nucleus, the facial nucleus, the pons reticular formation, the retrofacial nucleus, the rostral hypoglossal nucleus, and in the motor dorsal nucleus of the vagus, whereas a high density of fibers containing calcitonin gene-related peptide was observed in the lateral division of the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, the parvocellular division of the alaminar spinal trigeminal nucleus, the external cuneate nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the laminar spinal trigeminal nucleus, and in the area postrema. This widespread distribution indicates that the neuropeptide studied might be involved in multiple functions in the alpaca brainstem.
18446384	A possible association between congenital scoliosis and low mental status has been recognized, but there are no reports describing the mental status or cerebral metabolism in patients with congenital scoliosis in detail. We investigated the mental status using a mini-mental status exam as well as the cerebral glucose metabolism using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose brain positron emission tomography in 12 patients with congenital scoliosis and compared them with those of 14 age-matched patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The mean mini-mental status exam score in the congenital scoliosis group was significantly lower than that in the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis group. Group analysis found that various brain areas of patients with congenital scoliosis showed glucose hypometabolisms in the left prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10), right orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann area 11), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9), left anterior cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 24) and pulvinar of the left thalamus. From this study, we could find the metabolic abnormalities of brain in patients with congenital scoliosis and suggest the possible role of voxel-based analysis of brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.
18478176	The Cavalieri estimator using a point grid is used to estimate the volume of three-dimensional structures based on two-dimensional slices of the object. The size of the components of intracranial neural structures should have proportional relations among them. The volume fraction approach of stereological methods provides information about volumetric relations of the components of structures. The purpose of our study is to estimate the volume and volume fraction data related to the cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem. In this study, volume of the total brain, cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem were estimated in 24 young Turkish volunteers (12 males and 12 females) who are free of any neurological symptoms and signs. The volume and volume fraction of the total brain, cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem were determined on magnetic resonance (MR) images using the point-counting approach of stereological methods. The mean (+/-SD) total brain, cerebrum and cerebellum volumes were 1,202.05 +/- 103.51, 1,143.65 +/- 106.25 cm3 in males and females, 1,060.0 +/- 94.6, 1,008.9 +/- 104.3 cm3 in males and females, 117.75 +/- 10.7, 111.83 +/- 8.0 cm3 in males and females, respectively. The mean brain stem volumes were 24.3 +/- 2.89, 22.9 +/- 4.49 cm3 in males and females, respectively. Our results revealed that female subjects have less cerebral, cerebellar and brain stem volumes compared to males, although there was no statistically significant difference between genders (P > 0.05). The volume ratio of the cerebrum to total brain volume (TBV), cerebellum to TBV and brain stem to TBV were 88.16 and 88.13% in males and females, 9.8 and 9.8% in males and females, 2.03 and 2.03% in males and females, respectively. The volume ratio of the cerebellum to cerebrum, brain stem to cerebrum and brain stem to cerebellum were 11.12 and 11.16% in males and females, 2.30 and 2.31% in males and females, 20.7 and 20.6% in males and females, respectively. The difference between the genders was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Our results revealed that the volumetric composition of the cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem does not show sexual dimorphism.
18502045	Psychological factors are known to play an extremely important role in the maintenance and development of chronic pain conditions. However, it is unclear how such factors relate to the central neural processing of nociceptive transmission in healthy individuals. To investigate this issue, the activation of the brain was studied in 30 healthy volunteers responding to virtual pain stimuli by fMRI. In the first series of the study (non-preconditioned study), 15 participants were shown a digital video demonstrating an injection needle puncturing the right palm. In the second series of the study (pre-conditioned study), same-task paradigms were used for another 15 participants. Prior to the fMRI session, real needle punctuate stimuli were applied to the right palm of participants for pre-conditioning. fMRI analysis revealed that bilateral activations in anterior insula (BA45), parietal operculum (S2: BA40), premotor area, medial globus pallidus, inferior occipital gyrus (BA18), left temporal association cortex, right fusiform gyrus, right parietal association cortex and cerebellum occurred due to the task in the preconditioned group. On the other hand, right parietal operculum (S2: BA40), premotor area, parietal association cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal association cortex were activated in the non-preconditioned group. In addition, activation of anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cerebellum significantly increased in the preconditioned group compared with the non-preconditioned group. These results suggest that the virtual needle puncture task caused memory retrieval of unpleasant experiences which is possibly related to empathy for pain, resulting in the activation of specific brain areas.
18508098	Neonatal manipulation of oxytocin (OT) has long-term effects on behavior and physiology. Here we test the hypothesis that neonatal OT treatment can affect the subsequent expression of intrasexual aggression partly by reprogramming the neural activities of relevant brain regions. To test this hypothesis, mandarin voles (Lasiopodomys mandarinus) received OT or isotonic saline treatment within 24 h of birth. At about 75 days of age, aggressive behaviors and Fos expression in different brain regions were tested. The results indicate that the (1) level of intrasexual aggression was higher and other social contact was lower in SAL-treated sexually naïve males than in females and; (2) OT-treated females showed a greater increase in aggressive behaviors and Fos expression only after exposure to a male than SAL-treated females, but there were no significant changes in aggressive behaviors in males. These results demonstrate a sexual difference in aggression, and that neonatal exposure to OT may increase aggression in female mandarin voles. These effects may be based on changes in neural activities of relevant brain regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral septal nucleus (LS), medial preoptic area (MPOA), the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamic (VMH), the medial amygdala (MeA) and central amygdala (CeA).
18534256	The olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat is an extensively investigated animal model of depression. In the present study the effects of olfactory bulbectomy in drug-naive adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-240 g) on global (gCGU) and regional cerebral glucose (rCGU) utilization was evaluated. Two weeks following surgery, the autoradiographic measurement of CGU using [14C]-2-deoxyglucose was employed. The levels of CGU in the OBX and sham-operated rats were compared in 40 brain regions. Statistical methods indicate significantly lower levels of global (overall) CGU in the OBX group than in the sham group. Discriminant analysis was done on the z-scores to remove animal to animal variability. The following thirteen regions were identified by the stepwise discriminant analysis of the z-scores as significantly contributing to the differences between the sham and OBX: amygdala, cingulate cortex, caudate putamen at the level of globus pallidus, caudate putamen-lateral part, dorsal subiculum, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, median raphe, somatosensory cortex, substantia nigra, ventral hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and the ventral thalamus. The pattern of changes in the rCGU following OBX does not completely correlate with the pattern of connectivity of the olfactory bulbs, however, many regions with direct connection to the olfactory bulbs (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area) were found to be important for differentiation. No left to right asymmetries in the rCGU were found. The data suggest that there are very important regional differences in glucose utilization between the OBX and sham operated rats, which points to the need to study antidepressants in an animal model of depression rather than in normal animals.
18543291	To study the regional and cellular distribution of xeroderma pigmentosum group A and B (XPA and XPB) proteins, two nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors, in the mammalian brain we used immunohistochemistry and triple fluorescent immunostaining combined with confocal microscope scanning in brain slices of adult rat brain, including the cerebral cortex, striatum, substantia nigra compacta, ventral tegmental area, red nucleus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Both XPA and XPB proteins were mainly expressed in neurons, because the XPA- or XPB-immunopositive cells were only costained with NeuN, a specific neuronal marker, but not with glial fibrillary acidic acid, a specific astrocyte marker, in the striatum. Furthermore, XPA- and XPB-positive staining were observed in the neuronal nuclei. Such subcellular distribution was consistent with the location of the NER in the cells. This study provides the first evidence that NER factors XPA and XPB exist in the nuclei of neurons in the brain, suggesting that the NER may play important roles in the process of DNA repair in adult brain neurons.
18547640	Neuromedin U (NMU), a neuropeptide implicated in feeding, inflammation, pain control and anxiety-related behaviours, is widely distributed in peripheral organs and the CNS. These effects are thought to be mediated by its receptors NMU(1) and NMU(2). Since its precise sites of interaction in the CNS were to date unknown, we studied the distribution of in vitro binding sites for (125)I-NMU-23 in the rat CNS by receptor autoradiography. High-density specific binding was found in discrete areas of the brain and spinal cord, namely in the limbic system (hippocampal formation, septohippocampal nucleus, indusium griseum, hypothalamus, amygdaloid nuclei), superior colliculus, dorsal raphé, and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Our findings provide further supportive evidence for a multifunctional role for the peptide in the brain and spinal cord.
18551525	Mutations in the coding region of the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome, a rare multisystem neurodegenerative disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance. Patients with Wolfram syndrome display considerable clinical pleiomorphism, and symptoms such as neurological complications and psychiatric disorders are common. In the present study we have characterized Wfs1 expression pattern in the mouse central nervous system by using a combination of immunohistochemistry on wild-type mice and X-Gal staining of Wfs1 knockout mice with targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter. We identified a robust enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala and ventral striatum. Prominent Wfs1 expression was seen in the hippocampal CA1 region, parasubiculum, superficial part of the second and third layers of the prefrontal cortex and proisocortical areas, hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory system, and central auditory pathway. Wfs1 expression was also detected in numerous brainstem nuclei and in laminae VIII and IX of the spinal cord. Wfs1-positive nerve fibers were found in the medial forebrain bundle, reticular part of the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, posterior caudate putamen, lateral lemniscus, alveus, fimbria, dorsal hippocampal commissure, subiculum, and to a lesser extent in the central sublenticular extended amygdala, compact part of substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. The neuroanatomical findings suggest that the lack of Wfs1 protein function can be related to several neurological and psychiatric symptoms found in Wolfram syndrome. Enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala suggests a role in the modulation of anxiety and fear.
18560626	The aim of the present study was to improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs by choosing on the basis of the polyamine level induced by the drug in each host cancer-bearing tissue. We propose an "organ-specific therapy" in the article. The polyamines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine are strongly associated with tumor cell growth. The effects of ranimustine (MCNU) and nimustine (ACNU) on body weight, regional brain weights and concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in the cerebellum, hippocampus, corpus striatum, cortex, combined thalamus and hypothalamus and diencephalon of the brain were examined in rats. MCNU and ACNU reduced spermidine and spermine in the corpus striatum, and spermine in the diencephalon, but increased putrescine in the corpus striatum and combined thalamus and hypothalamus. These results indicate that both MCNU and ACNU are suitable for the treatment of cancers of the corpus striatum, but ACNU is not suitable for cancers of the corpus striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus.
18571869	The natriuretic peptide receptor type C (NPR-C) binds all natriuretic peptides. It is thought to be involved in the clearance of natriuretic peptides and more recently has been defined as essential for the neuromodulatory effects of natriuretic peptides. Although the distribution of NPR-C mRNA has been reported in the rat forebrain, there are no data on the distribution of NPR-C in the brainstem. We report an immunofluorescence study on the distribution of NPR-C immunoreactivity in the rat brainstem, and its presence in cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons. NPR-C immunoreactivity was detected in several regions, including the periaqueductal gray, oculomotor nucleus, red nucleus and trochlear nucleus of the midbrain; the pontine nucleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, vestibular nucleus, locus coeruleus, trigeminal motor nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body, abducens nucleus and facial nucleus of the pons; and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, hypoglossal nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus, nucleus ambiguus and inferior olivary nucleus of the medulla oblongata. Interestingly, NPR-C immunoreactivity was detected in the cholinergic neurons of the oculomotor nucleus, trochlear nucleus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, facial nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus ambiguus and hypoglossal nucleus. Furthermore, NPR-C immunoreactivity was detected in several catecholaminergic neuronal groups including the A6, A5, A1, C3 and C1 cell groups. These results are consistent with an important role for natriuretic peptides in neuroendocrine regulation and central cardiovascular integration. The extensive distribution of NPR-C in the brainstem supports the hypothesis that NPR-C is involved in the neuromodulatory effect of natriuretic peptides.
18585058	Ascl1 (previously Mash1) is a bHLH transcription factor essential for neuronal differentiation and specification in the nervous system. Although it has been studied for its role in several neural lineages, the full complement of lineages arising from Ascl1 progenitor cells remains unknown. Using an inducible Cre-flox genetic fate-mapping strategy, Ascl1 lineages were determined throughout the brain. Ascl1 is present in proliferating progenitor cells but these cells are actively differentiating as evidenced by rapid migration out of germinal zones. Ascl1 lineage cells contribute to distinct cell types in each major brain division: the forebrain including the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamic nuclei, the midbrain including superior and inferior colliculi, and the hindbrain including Purkinje and deep cerebellar nuclei cells and cells in the trigeminal sensory system. Ascl1 progenitor cells at early stages in each CNS region preferentially become neurons, and at late stages they become oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, Ascl1-expressing progenitor cells in the brain give rise to multiple, but not all, neuronal subtypes and oligodendrocytes depending on the temporal and spatial context, consistent with a broad role in neural differentiation with some subtype specification.
18585429	The world-wide and rapidly growing use of mobile phones has raised serious concerns about the biological and health-related effects of radio frequency (RF) radiation, particularly concerns about the effects of RFs upon the nervous system. The goal of this study was conducted to measure cytochrome oxidase (CO) levels using histochemical methods in order to evaluate regional brain metabolic activity in rat brain after exposure to a GSM 900 MHz signal for 45 min/day at a brain-averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 1.5 W/Kg or for 15 min/day at a SAR of 6 W/Kg over seven days. Compared to the sham and control cage groups, rats exposed to a GSM signal at 6 W/Kg showed decreased CO activity in some areas of the prefrontal and frontal cortex (infralimbic cortex, prelimbic cortex, primary motor cortex, secondary motor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex areas 1 and 2 (Cg1 and Cg2)), the septum (dorsal and ventral parts of the lateral septal nucleus), the hippocampus (dorsal field CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus and dental gyrus) and the posterior cortex (retrosplenial agranular cortex, primary and secondary visual cortex, perirhinal cortex and lateral entorhinal cortex). However, the exposure to GSM at 1.5 W/Kg did not affect brain activity. Our results indicate that 6 W/Kg GSM 900 MHz microwaves may affect brain metabolism and neuronal activity in rats.
18597961	Noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HA), serotonin (5HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) content of five brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, striatum and frontal cortex) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in adult (three months old) male and female rats treated neonatally with a single dose of 10 microg nociceptin (NC) or 10 microg nocistatin (NS) for hormonal imprinting. The biogenic amine and metabolite content of cerebrospinal fluid was also determined. In NC treated animals the serotonergic, dopaminergic as well as noradrenergic systems were influenced by the imprinting. The 5HT level increased in hypothalamus, the 5HIAA tissue levels were found increased in hypothalamus. Hippocampus and striatum and the HVA levels increased highly significantly in brainstem. Dopamine level decreased significantly in striatum, however in frontal cortex both noradrenalin and 5HIAA level decreased. Nevertheless, in NS-treated rats decreased NA tissue levels were found in hypothalamus, brainstem and frontal cortex. Decreased DA levels were found in the hypothalamus, brainstem and striatum. NS imprinting resulted in decreased HVA level, but increased one in the brainstem. The 5HT levels decreased in the hypothalamus, brainstem, striatum and frontal cortex, while 5HIAA content of CSF, and frontal cortex decreased, and that of hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum increased. There was no significant difference between genders except in the 5HT tissue levels of NC treated rats. Data presented show that neonatal imprinting both by NC and NS have long-lasting and brain area specific effects. In earlier experiments endorphin imprinting also influenced the serotonergic system suggesting that during labour release of pain-related substances may durably affect the serotonergic (dopaminergic, adrenergic) system which can impress the animals' later behavior.
18634853	Although diagnostic procedures have been developed for detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer dementia (AD), more valid noninvasive tools are needed. In this work, we apply a procedure based on the evidences that different evoked frequency band responses may emerge from different sources during early-stage visual processing in a mental state-specific manner, while subjects were passively viewing a visual stimulus. In this case, spatial differences should arise across mental conditions such as mild Alzheimer dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and normal aging. With the use of EEG source image we found three different neural patterns in aged individuals: (1) left hippocampus and midbrain in mild AD, (2) left lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, left nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, thalamus, posterior cinguli, right precuneous, right superior parietal lobe in MCI, and (3) right lateral-medial orbitofrontal gyrus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, right lateral occipitotemporal gyrus in elderly controls. Although preliminary, these results show remarkably robust differences that distinguish between an age-matched control group, a group with MCI, and a group with mild AD. Because the method applied in this work differentiates among clinical entities with varying severity of cognitive decline, it may eventually serve as an electrophysiological marker in the early detection of neurodegeneration.
18666447	ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) is a membrane-associated GTPase, which inhibits the Arf/Sec7-dependent activation of phospholipase D and belongs to the Arf-like (Arl) GTPases. Although ARFRP1 is involved in post-Golgi membrane trafficking and its lack leads to embryonic lethality, little is known about its possible function in the central nervous system. To obtain more knowledge about ARFRP1, we have characterized its mRNA distribution in adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR. We observed a widespread distribution of ARFRP1-mRNA, with the highest levels in cerebral cortex, thalamic nuclei, colliculus, substantia nigra and granule cell layer of cerebellum. Moderate levels were observed in some amygdaloid nuclei, CA2 area and dentate gyrus of hippocampus, endopiriform nuclei, globus pallidus, striatum, molecular layer of cerebellum, and locus coeruleus, whereas no expression was detected in hypothalamic nuclei, CA1 and CA3 areas of hippocampus, zona incerta. A significant decrease of ARFRP1-mRNA was observed in cerebral cortex following sleep deprivation, whereas no change was observed in cerebellar cortex, locus courelus, brainstem, hippocampus and pontine nuclei. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the regional distribution of ARFRP1 in the mouse brain and a quantitative view of its changes following sleep deprivation.
18691703	The interaction of information derived from the voice and facial expression of a speaker contributes to the interpretation of the emotional state of the speaker and to the formation of inferences about information that may have been merely implied in the verbal communication. Therefore, we investigated the brain processes responsible for the integration of emotional information originating from different sources. Although several studies have reported possible sites for integration, further investigation using a neutral emotional condition is required to locate emotion-specific networks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we explored the brain regions involved in the integration of emotional information from different modalities in comparison to those involved in integrating emotionally neutral information. There was significant activation in the superior temporal gyrus (STG); inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); and parahippocampal gyrus, including the amygdala, under the bimodal versus the unimodal condition, irrespective of the emotional content. We confirmed the results of previous studies by finding that the bimodal emotional condition elicited strong activation in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and we extended this finding to locate the effects of emotional factors by using a neutral condition in the experimental design. We found anger-specific activation in the posterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum, whereas we found happiness-specific activation in the MTG, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, claustrum, inferior parietal lobule, cuneus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), IFG, and anterior cingulate. These emotion-specific activations suggest that each emotion uses a separate network to integrate bimodal information and shares a common network for cross-modal integration.
18770870	Previously, we described a cell group expressing tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) in the lateral pontomesencephalic tegmentum, and referred to it as the medial paralemniscal nucleus (MPL). To identify this nucleus further in rat, we have now characterized the MPL cytoarchitectonically on coronal, sagittal, and horizontal serial sections. Neurons in the MPL have a columnar arrangement distinct from adjacent areas. The MPL is bordered by the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus nucleus laterally, the oral pontine reticular formation medially, and the rubrospinal tract ventrally, whereas the A7 noradrenergic cell group is located immediately mediocaudal to the MPL. TIP39-immunoreactive neurons are distributed throughout the cytoarchitectonically defined MPL and constitute 75% of its neurons as assessed by double labeling of TIP39 with a fluorescent Nissl dye or NeuN. Furthermore, we investigated the neuronal inputs to the MPL by using the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit. The MPL has afferent neuronal connections distinct from adjacent brain regions including major inputs from the auditory cortex, medial part of the medial geniculate body, superior colliculus, external and dorsal cortices of the inferior colliculus, periolivary area, lateral preoptic area, hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, lateral and dorsal hypothalamic areas, subparafascicular and posterior intralaminar thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray, and cuneiform nucleus. In addition, injection of the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine into the auditory cortex and the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus confirmed projections from these areas to the distinct MPL. The afferent neuronal connections of the MPL suggest its involvement in auditory and reproductive functions.
18773945	P2X receptors are ATP-gated cationic channels composed of seven known subunits (P2X1-7) which are involved in different functions in neural tissue. The present study investigates the P2X5 receptor expression pattern in the mouse CNS using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry. The specificity of the immunostaining has been verified by pre-absorption, Western blot and in situ hybridization methods. Heavy P2X5 receptor immunostaining was observed in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb; cerebral cortex; globus pallidum, anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, amygdalohippocampal area of subcortical telencephalon; anterior nuclei, anteroventral nucleus, ventrolateral nucleus of thalamus; supraoptic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus; substantia nigra of midbrain; pontine nuclei, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, ambiguous nucleus, inferior olive, hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor vagus nucleus, area postrema of hindbrain; Purkinje cells of cerebellum; and spinal cord. The identification of extensive P2X5 receptor immunoreactivity and mRNA distribution within the CNS of the mouse demonstrated here is consistent with a role for extracellular ATP acting as a fast neurotransmitter.
18802918	HTR2C is one of the most relevant and investigated serotonin receptors. Its role in important brain structures such as the midbrain, the lateral septal complex, the hypothalamus, the olfactory bulb, the pons, the choroid plexus, the nucleus pallidus, the striatum and the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens and the anterior cingulated gyrus candidate it as a promising target for genetic association studies. The biological relevance of these brain structures is reviewed by way of the focus on HTR2C activity, with a special attention paid to psychiatric disorders. Evidence from the genetic association studies that dealt with HTR2C is reviewed and discussed alongside the findings derived from the neuronatmic investigations. The reasons for the discrepancies between these two sets of reports are discussed. As a result, HTR2C is shown to play a pivotal role in many different psychiatric behaviors or psychiatric related disrupted molecular balances, nevertheless, genetic association studies brought inconsistent results so far. The most replicated association involve the feeding behavior and antipsychotic induced side effects, both weight gain and motor related: Cys23Ser (rs6318) and -759C/T (rs3813929) report the most consistent results. The lack of association found in other independent studies dampens the clinical impact of these reports. Here, we report a possible explanation for discrepant findings that is poorly or not at all usually considered, that is that HTR2C may exert different or even opposite activities in the brain depending on the structure analyzed and that mRNA editing activity may compensate possible genetically controlled functional effects. The incomplete coverage of the HTR2C variants is proposed as the best cost-benefit ratio bias to fix. The evidence of brain area specific HTR2C mRNA editing opens a debate about how the brain can differently modulate stress events, and process antidepressant treatments, in different brain areas. The mRNA editing activity on HTR2C may play a major role for the negative association results.
18804528	This work investigates the nitrergic and cholinergic systems in the brain and spinal cord of the goldfish (Carassius auratus). We studied the immunohistochemical localization of antibodies against the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) by bright-field and confocal microscopy. Nitrergic and cholinergic cells were segregated within the telencephalon, in both dorsal and ventral areas, and co-distributed in some nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon, rhombencephalon, and spinal cord. Double-labeling experiments revealed nNOS/ChAT-positive cells in (1) the diencephalon: the preoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, the habenula, the dorsal thalamus, and the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus; (2) the mesencephalon: the optic tectum, the mesencephalic portion of the trigeminal nucleus, the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus; and (3) the rhombencephalon: the secondary gustatory nucleus, the nucleus isthmi, the lateral lemniscus nucleus, the cerebellum, the reticular formation, different nuclei of the octaval column, the motor zone of the vagal lobe, and the trigeminal, facial, abducens, glosso-pharyngeal, vagal, and hypobranchial motor nuclei. Double-labeled cells were also observed in the spinal motor column. The percentage of double-labeled cells was different in each studied nucleus, indicating a selective distribution pattern. Because double-labeled cells were more abundant in those nuclei involved with sensory and motor physiological processes, we suggest the involvement of both nitric oxide and acetylcholine in these neural functions in fish.
18853414	The ventrolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTvl) receives direct input from two specific subpopulations of neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). It is heavily innervated by aldosterone-sensitive NTS neurons, which are selectively activated by sodium depletion, and by the A2 noradrenergic neurons, which are activated by visceral and immune- and stress-related stimuli. Here, we used a retrograde neuronal tracer to identify other brain sites that innervate the BSTvl. Five general brain regions contained retrogradely labeled neurons: cerebral cortex (infralimbic and insular regions), rostral forebrain structures (subfornical organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, taenia tecta, nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, endopiriform nucleus, dorsal BST, substantia innominata, and, most prominently the amygdala--primarily its basomedial and central subnuclei), thalamus (central medial, intermediodorsal, reuniens, and, most prominently the paraventricular thalamic nucleus), hypothalamus (medial preoptic area, perifornical, arcuate, dorsomedial, parasubthalamic, and posterior hypothalamic nuclei), and brainstem (periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal and central superior raphe nuclei, parabrachial nucleus, pre-locus coeruleus region, NTS, and A1 noradrenergic neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla). In the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, some retrogradely labeled neurons contained either agouti-related peptide or cocaine/amphetamine-regulated transcript. Of the numerous retrogradely labeled neurons in the perifornical hypothalamic area, few contained melanin-concentrating hormone or orexin. In the brainstem, many retrogradely labeled neurons were either serotoninergic or catecholaminergic. In summary, the BSTvl receives inputs from a variety of brain sites implicated in hunger, salt and water intake, stress, arousal, and reward.
18855881	Glutamate acts as the excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and is mediated largely by the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) types of glutamate receptors (GluR1-4) in mammals. In the present study, we determined the cDNA sequences of pigeon VGLUT2 and GluR1 and mapped the distribution of their mRNA in the pigeon CNS. The predicted amino acids of pigeon VGLUT2 and GluR1 showed a 93% identity to human VGLUT2 and GluR1 both. In situ hybridization autoradiograms showed VGLUT2 mRNA expression exclusively in the pallium of the telencephalon, and no expression in the subpallium. Within the diencephalon, VGLUT2 mRNA was more abundant in the thalamus than in the hypothalamus. Rich VGLUT2 mRNA expression was found in the optic tectum, nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis, nucleus isthmi, pars parvocellularis, isthmo-optic nucleus, pontine nuclei, and granular layer of the cerebellum. Moderate expression was noted in the cerebellar nuclei, vestibular nuclei, cochlear nuclei, inferior olivary nucleus, and gray matter of the spinal cord. GluR1 mRNA was expressed abundantly in the pallium and subpallium of the telencephalon, but it was poor in the diencephalon, midbrain, medulla, cerebellar cortex, and gray matter of the spinal cord. These results suggest that the cDNA sequences of VGLUT2 and GluR1 in the pigeon are comparable to those of VGLUT2 and GluR1 in mammals, respectively. The distribution of pigeon GluR1 mRNA resembles that of mammals, but the distribution of VGLUT2 mRNA resembles that of both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in mammals.
18952070	This neuroimaging study investigated the neural mechanisms of the effect of conversation on visual event detection during a driving-like scenario. The static load paradigm, established as predictive of visual reaction time in on-road driving, measured reaction times to visual events while subjects watched a real-world driving video. Behavioral testing with twenty-eight healthy volunteers determined the reaction time effects from overt and covert conversation tasks in this paradigm. Overt and covert conversation gave rise to longer visual event reaction times in the surrogate driving paradigm compared to just driving with no conversation, with negligible effect on miss rates. The covert conversation task was then undertaken by ten right-handed healthy adults in a 4-Tesla fMRI magnet. We identified a frontal-parietal network that maintained event detection performance during the conversation task while watching the driving video. Increased brain activations for conversation vs. no conversation during such simulated driving was found not only in language regions (Broca's and Wernicke's areas), but also specific regions in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral lateral prefrontal cortex (right middle frontal gyrus and left frontal eye field), supplementary motor cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, right superior parietal lobe, right intraparietal sulcus, right precuneus, and right cuneus. We propose an Asynchrony Model in which the frontal regions have a top-down influence on the synchrony of neural processes within the superior parietal lobe and extrastriate visual cortex that in turn modulate the reaction time to visual events during conversation while driving.
18977214	We have recently identified three splice isoforms of the histamine H(3) receptor in multiple brain regions of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Two of the novel isoforms displayed a deletion in the third intracellular loop (H(3)(413) and H(3)(410)), the third isoform H(3)(335) displayed a deletion in the i3 intracellular loop and a complete deletion of the putative fifth transmembrane domain TM5. We have confirmed by RT-PCR the expression of full-length H(3)(445) mRNA as well as H(3)(413), H(3)(410), and H(3)(335) splice isoform mRNA in multiple monkey brain regions including the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. The full-length isoform H(3)(445) was predominant in all of the regions tested, followed by H(3)(335), with the H(3)(413) and H(3)(410) being of low abundance. When expressed in C6 cells, H(3)(445), H(3)(413), and H(3)(410) exhibit high affinity binding to the agonist ligand [(3)H]-(N)-alpha-methylhistamine with respective pK(D) values of 9.7, 9.7, and 9.6. As expected, the H(3)(335) isoform did not display any saturable binding with [(3)H]-(N)-alpha-methylhistamine. The histamine H(3) receptor agonists histamine, (R)-alpha-methylhistamine, imetit and proxyfan were able to activate calcium mobilization responses through H(3)(445), H(3)(413) and H(3)(410) receptors when they were co-expressed with the chimeric G alpha(qi5)-protein in HEK293 cells, while no response was elicited in cells expressing the H(3)(335) isoform. The existence of multiple H(3) receptor splice isoforms across species raises the possibility that isoform specific properties including ligand affinity, signal transduction coupling, and brain localization may differentially contribute to observed in vivo effects of histamine H(3) receptor antagonists.
18985147	The facial expression of contempt has been regarded to communicate feelings of moral superiority. Contempt is an emotion that is closely related to disgust, but in contrast to disgust, contempt is inherently interpersonal and hierarchical. The aim of this study was twofold. First, to investigate the hypothesis of preferential amygdala responses to contempt expressions versus disgust. Second, to investigate whether, at a neural level, men would respond stronger to biological signals of interpersonal superiority (e.g., contempt) than women. We performed an experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in which participants watched facial expressions of contempt and disgust in addition to neutral expressions. The faces were presented as distractors in an oddball task in which participants had to react to one target face. Facial expressions of contempt and disgust activated a network of brain regions, including prefrontal areas (superior, middle and medial prefrontal gyrus), anterior cingulate, insula, amygdala, parietal cortex, fusiform gyrus, occipital cortex, putamen and thalamus. Contemptuous faces did not elicit stronger amygdala activation than did disgusted expressions. To limit the number of statistical comparisons, we confined our analyses of sex differences to the frontal and temporal lobes. Men displayed stronger brain activation than women to facial expressions of contempt in the medial frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, women showed stronger neural responses than men to facial expressions of disgust. In addition, the effect of stimulus sex differed for men versus women. Specifically, women showed stronger responses to male contemptuous faces (as compared to female expressions), in the insula and middle frontal gyrus. Contempt has been conceptualized as signaling perceived moral violations of social hierarchy, whereas disgust would signal violations of physical purity. Thus, our results suggest a neural basis for sex differences in moral sensitivity regarding hierarchy on the one hand and physical purity on the other.
18992298	Choline (Ch) plays an important role in brain neurotransmission, while Ch-deprivation (CD) has been linked to various pathophysiological states. Prolonged ingestion of Ch-deficient diet (CDD) is known to produce CD causing a reduction of rat brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels, as well as memory and growth disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 2-month adult-onset CD on the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), (Na+,K+)- and Mg2+-ATPase in crucial brain regions of male rats. Adult rats were divided into two groups (control and CD). The CD group was fed with CDD for 2-months. At the end of the second month, rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the brain regions were rapidly removed. Enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically in the homogenated frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and pons. In CD rats, AChE activity was found statistically significantly increased in the hippocampus and the cerebellum (+28%, P<0.001 and +46%, P<0.001, respectively, as compared to control), while it was found unaltered in the other three regions (frontal cortex, hypothalamus and pons). (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity was found increased by CD in the frontal cortex (+30%, P<0.001), decreased in both hippocampus and hypothalamus (-68%, P<0.001 and -51%, P<0.001, respectively), and unaltered in both cerebellum and pons. No statistically significant changes were observed in the activities of Mg2+-ATPase in the frontal cortex and the hypothalamus, while statistically significant increases were recorded in the hippocampus (+21%, P<0.01), the cerebellum (+85%, P<0.001) and the pons (+19%, P<0.05), as compared to control levels. Our data suggest that adult-onset CD can have significant effects on the examined brain parameters in the examined crucial brain regions, as well as that CD is a metabolic disorder towards which different and brain region specific neurophysiological responses seem to occur. Following a 2-month adult-onset CD, the activity of AChE was found to be increased in the hippocampus and the cerebellum and unaltered in the other three regions (frontal cortex, hypothalamus and pons), while Na+,K+-ATPase activity was found to be increased in the frontal cortex, decreased in both hippocampus and hypothalamus, and unaltered in both cerebellum and pons. Moreover, Mg2+-ATPase activity was found to be unaltered in the frontal cortex and the hypothalamus, and increased in the hippocampus, the cerebellum and the pons. The observed differentially affected activities of AChE, (Na+,K+)-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase (induced by CD) could result in modulations of cholinergic neurotransmission, neural excitability, metabolic energy production, Mg2+ homeostasis and protein synthesis (that might have a variety of neurophysiological consequences depending on the brain region in which they seem to occur).
18996442	The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of delivering VEGF directly into the central nervous system (CNS) following intranasal administration. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups, given [(125)I]-VEGF intranasally or intravenously. VEGF was intranasally administered in both nares alternately, the single dose is 10 microl with time interval of 2 min for about 18.5 min. The intravenous (IV) group was treated with 100 microl [(125)I]-VEGF intravenously. Thirty minutes after administration, rats were killed following blood sample collections, then the brains were removed, and olfactory bulb, striatum corpora, cortex, thalamus, pons, cerebella, medulla, hippocampus, cervical cord and other tissues were collected, weighted, under auto gamma counting and autoradiography analysis. Cisternal sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed in an additional group of animals. Both gamma counting and high resolution phosphor imaging of tissue sections showed that intranasal administration of [(125)I]-VEGF resulted in substantial delivery throughout the CNS. The highest CNS tissue concentration following IN delivery was found in the trigeminal nerve, followed by the optic nerve, olfactory bulbs, olfactory tubercle, striatum, medulla, frontal cortex, midbrain, pons, appendix cerebri, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum. Intranasal administration of [(125)I]-VEGF also targeted the deep cervical lymph nodes. CSF did not contain [(125)I]-VEGF following intranasal administration. Intravenous [(125)I]-VEGF resulted in blood and peripheral tissue exposure higher concentrations than that intranasal administration, but CNS concentrations were significantly lower. The results suggest intranasally delivered VEGF can bypass the blood-brain barrier via olfactory- and trigeminal-associated extracellular pathways to directly entry into the CNS. Intranasal administration of VEGF may provide an effective way for the treatments of CNS diseases.
18996447	gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a euphoric, prosocial and sleep inducing drug that binds with high affinity to its own GHB receptor site and also more weakly to GABA(B) receptors. GHB is efficacious in the treatment of narcolepsy and alcoholism, but heavy use can lead to dependence and withdrawal. Many effects of GHB (sedation, hypothermia, catalepsy) are mimicked by GABA(B) receptor agonists (e.g. baclofen). However other effects (euphoric and prosocial effects and a therapeutic effect in narcolepsy) are not. The present study used Fos immunohistochemistry to assess the neural activation produced in rat brain by medium to high doses of GHB (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) and a high dose of baclofen (10 mg/kg) that produced similar sedation to 500 mg/kg GHB. Results showed many common regions of activation with these two drugs including the supraoptic, paraventricular, median preoptic and ventral premammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus, the central nucleus of the amygdala, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. GHB (500 mg/kg), but not baclofen (10 mg/kg), induced significant Fos expression in the median raphe nucleus and lateral habenula, while a higher dose of GHB (1000 mg/kg) induced additional Fos expression in the islands of Calleja, dentate gyrus (polymorphic layer) and arcuate nucleus, and in various regions implicated in rapid and non-rapid eye movement sleep (laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus and the ventrolateral and anterodorsal preoptic nuclei). Surprisingly, Fos immunoreactivity was not observed with either GHB or baclofen in reward-relevant regions such as the nucleus accumbens, striatum and ventral tegmental area. Overall these results indicate a distinctive signature of brain activation with GHB that may be only partly due to GABA(B) receptor effects. This confirms a unique neuropharmacological profile for GHB and indicates key neural substrates that may underlie its characteristic influence on sleep, body temperature, sociability and endocrine function.
19007358	The first NPY-immunoreactivity (ir) in the central nervous system of Rhinella arenarum was obtained just after hatching in the pre-optic area, ventral thalamus and rostral rhombencephalon. During pre-metamorphosis, new NPY-ir cells were observed in other brain areas such as pallium, septum and striatum, infundibulum and pars intermedia of the pituitary. Further maturation continued through pro-metamorphosis with the appearance of cell groups in the diagonal band, amygdala, pre-optic nucleus, dorsal nucleus of the habenula, anterior ventral and dorsal thalamus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, tuberculum posterior, tectum, torus semicircularis, inter-peduncular nucleus and median eminence. During the metamorphic climax and soon after, the relative abundance of NPY-ir fibres decreased in all hypothalamic areas and the staining intensity and number of NPY-ir cells in the pallium also decreased, whereas no cells were found in the striatum, dorsal nucleus of the habenula and tectum. In the olfactory epithelium, nerve or bulb, neither cells nor NPY-ir fibres were found during the stages of development analysed. The ontogeny pattern of the NPY-ir neuronal system in the brain of Rh. arenarum is more similar to the spatiotemporal appearance reported for Rana esculenta than to that reported for Xenopus laevis. Many NPY-ir fibres were found in the median eminence and in the pars intermedia of the pituitary, supporting the idea that this neuropeptide may play a role in the modulation of hypophyseal secretion during development.
19010392	We studied Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the precuneus and surrounding brain areas. Anatomically, the precuneus corresponds to the medial portion of human cerebral cortical Brodmann Area 7. This study utilized patients from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center autopsy cohort. Data from 47 brains were used comprising patients of differing antemortem cognitive impairment severities, each with longitudinal clinical data and extensive neuropathological data. We assessed whether the precuneus and surrounding areas are differentially vulnerable to AD-type pathological lesions (diffuse amyloid plaques, neuritic amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles). Eleven areas of brain were evaluated for each case: amygdala, hippocampal CA1, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, superior and middle temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, occipital cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, Brodmann Area 31, and the precuneus proper. Like other areas of neocortex, the precuneus demonstrated increased diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques early in the evolution in AD, and increased neurofibrillary tangles late in AD. Correcting for the antemortem cognitive status of the patients, there was no evidence of an increase in the density of AD-type pathology in the precuneus or neighboring areas relative to other areas of cerebral neocortex. Our results are not consistent with the idea that the precuneus is involved in a special way with plaques or tangles relative to other areas of neocortex.
19015212	Biased recruitment and sample selection may cause variability in neuroimaging studies. Epidemiologically principled population-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of schizophrenia are very rare. We gathered structural MRI data on 154 subjects from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort, aged 33-35 (100 controls, 54 schizophrenia patients). Regional differences in density of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were identified between groups using nonparametric statistical analysis, and the relationship of the regional differences to duration of illness was explored. Gray matter reductions were found bilaterally in the cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, insula, superior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, cuneus, and lingual gyrus; in the left posterior cingulate, superior frontal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, and precuneus; and in the right postcentral gyrus. Gray matter excesses were observed bilaterally in the basal ganglia, anterior cingulate, and medial orbitofrontal cortices. There were white matter deficits in an extensive network including inter- and intrahemispheric tracts bilaterally in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, subcortical structures, cerebellum, and brain stem. CSF excesses were found bilaterally in the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, interhemispheric, and left Sylvian fissure. We replicated the previous findings of structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia on a general population level. Gray and white matter deficits were associated with duration of illness suggesting either that developmental brain deficits relate to an earlier age of onset or that brain abnormalities in schizophrenia are progressive in nature.
19028593	Whilst the act of sniffing can provide us with an indirect method to study the central mechanisms of respiratory control, functional neuroimaging now provides us with a tool to directly visualise the activity of the human brain during this voluntary action using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We performed fMRI during sniffing in 11 healthy volunteers where all subjects executed single, brisk sniffs of around 60% of their maximum sniff pressure at intervals of approximately every 20s. Simultaneous nasal pressure and chest movements were also measured during the task and a statistical parametric map of activation correlating with the sniff manoeuvre was calculated. A bilateral cortical and subcortical sensorimotor network was activated. The activations were localised within the primary sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, insula, basal ganglia, thalami, mesencephalon, upper pons, cerebellar vermis, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. The activated brain areas identified, i.e. the cortical and subcortical respiratory network, are similar to those described in other neuroimaging studies of voluntary inspiration. Sniffing is a component of olfactory processing and activations of the olfaction-related cortical areas were also observed in our study. The results of our study show that event-related fMRI can be successfully used to study sniffing. This provides a novel approach to our study of the central neural control of respiration.
19052227	Previous studies suggest that nocebo effects, sometimes termed "negative placebo effects," can contribute appreciably to a variety of medical symptoms and adverse events in clinical trials and medical care. In this study, using a within-subject design, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an expectation/conditioning manipulation model to investigate the neural substrates of nocebo hyperalgesia using heat pain on the right forearm. Thirteen subjects completed the study. Results showed that, after administering inert treatment, subjective pain intensity ratings increased significantly more on nocebo regions compared with the control regions in which no expectancy/conditioning manipulation was performed. fMRI analysis of hyperalgesic nocebo responses to identical calibrated noxious stimuli showed signal increases in brain regions including bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, superior temporal gyrus; left frontal and parietal operculum, medial frontal gyrus, orbital prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule, and hippocampus; right claustrum/putamen, lateral prefrontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Functional connectivity analysis of spontaneous resting-state fMRI data from the same cohort of subjects showed a correlation between two seed regions (left frontal operculum and hippocampus) and pain network including bilateral insula, operculum, ACC, and left S1/M1. In conclusion, we found evidence that nocebo hyperalgesia may be predominantly produced through an affective-cognitive pain pathway (medial pain system), and the left hippocampus may play an important role in this process.
19085968	The development of glycine immunoreactivity in the brain of the sea lamprey was studied by use of immunofluorescence techniques at embryonic to larval stages. Glycine distribution was also compared with that of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by use of double immunofluorescence. The first glycine-immunoreactive (ir) cells appeared in the caudal rhombencephalon of late embryos, diencephalon of early prolarvae, and mesencephalon of late prolarvae, in which glycine-ir cells were observed in several prosencephalic regions (preoptic nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral thalamus, dorsal thalamus, pretectum, and nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle), mesencephalon (M5), isthmus, and rhombencephalon. In larvae, glycine-ir populations were observed in the olfactory bulbs, preoptic nucleus and thalamus (prosencephalon), M5 and oculomotor nucleus (mesencephalon), dorsal isthmic gray, isthmic reticular formation, and various alar and basal plate rhombencephalic populations. No glycine-ir cells were observed in the larval optic tectum or torus semicircularis, which contain glycine-ir populations in adults. A wide distribution of glycine-ir fibers was observed, which suggests involvement of glycine in the function of most lamprey brain regions. Colocalization of GABA and glycine in prolarvae was found mainly in cell groups of the diencephalon, in the ventral isthmic group, and in trigeminal populations. In larvae, colocalization of GABA and glycine was principally observed in the M5 nucleus, the reticular formation, and the dorsal column nucleus. The present results reveal for the first time the complex developmental pattern of the glycinergic system in lamprey, including early glycine-ir populations, populations transiently expressing glycine, and late-appearing populations, in relation to maturation changes that occur during metamorphosis.
19172645	The accuracy of cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging in humans has been impeded by the partial volume effects (PVE), which are a consequence of the limited spatial resolution. Because of brain atrophy, PVE can be particularly problematic in imaging the elderly and can considerably overestimate the CBF difference with the young. The primary goal of this study was to separate the structural decline from the true CBF reduction in elderly. To this end, a PVE-correction algorithm was applied on the CBF images acquired with spin-echo EPI continuous arterial spin labeling MRI (voxel size = 3.4 x 3.4 x 8 mm(3)). Tissue-specific CBF images that were independent of voxels' tissue fractional volume were obtained in elderly (N = 30) and young (N = 26); mean age difference was 43 years. Globally, PVE-corrected gray matter CBF was 88.2 +/- 16.1 and 107.3 +/- 17.5 mL/100 g min(-1) in elderly and young, respectively. The largest PVE contribution was found in the frontal lobe and accounted for an additional 10% and 12% increase in the age-related CBF difference between men and women, respectively. The GM-to-WM CBF ratios were found to be on average 3.5 in elderly and 3.9 in young. Whole brain voxelwise comparisons showed marked CBF decrease in anterior cingulate (bilateral), caudate (bilateral), cingulate gyrus (bilateral), cuneus (left), inferior frontal gyrus (left), insula (left), middle frontal gyrus (left), precuneus (bilateral), prefrontal cortex (bilateral), and superior frontal gyrus (bilateral) in men and amygdala (bilateral), hypothalamus (left), hippocampus (bilateral), and middle frontal gyrus (right) in women.
19180812	The efferent projections of the neocortex on the lateral convexity of the inferior parietal lobe (area 7 of Brodmann) were examined using the anterograde transport of tritiated amino acids. Multiple injections of 3H-leucine and 3H-proline were placed within the three cytoarchitecturally distinct zones that lie along the exposed surface of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). The subcortical projections resulting from these injections were studied. Prominent projections were seen in the thalamus (medial and lateral pulvinar), brainstem (dorsolateral and ventral pontine nuclei), and basal ganglia (caudate and putamen) with less dense label over the thalamic intralaminar nuclei, pretectal complex, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, suprageniculate nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus, oral pulvinar, and claustrum. In many of these cases there was a topographical relationship apparent with regard to the injections placed along the rostral-caudal dimension of the IPL. There is a striking reciprocal arrangement in the afferent and efferent projection systems of the IPL. The functional relevance of both the topography and the efferent projections of the IPL is discussed.
19189086	We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to characterize the integrative neural mechanisms during viewing and subsequently copying nine geometrical shapes. Human subjects initially looked at a central fixation point ("rest" period), then looked at a geometrical shape ("visual" period) which they copied without visual feedback ("copying" period). BOLD signal was recorded from voxels in 28 cortical areas (14 from each hemisphere) using a 4 Tesla magnet. For each voxel, signal ratios of "Visual versus Rest" (VR), and "Copy versus Visual" (CV) were calculated and used to construct two sets of Euclidean distance dissimilarity matrices for the nine shapes, with separate matrices defined for each region of interest (ROI) across subjects. The relations of perceptual and motor aspects of the shapes to MDS dimensions and specific ROIs were assessed using stepwise multiple regressions. The optimal individually scaled (INDSCAL) solutions were 2-dimensional. For the VR condition, MDS dimensions were significantly associated with the presence of crossing in a shape (Dimension 1), and with perimeter, height, cycles, peak segment speed, and horizontal symmetry (Dimension 2). ROIs most prominently associated with these dimensions essentially comprised the medial frontal lobe bilaterally, the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, and the left intraparietal sulcus (Dimension 1), and visual areas, including the calcarine sulcus and cuneus bilaterally (Dimension 2). These results document the expected involvement of visual areas and support the hypothesis advanced on the basis of previous findings (Lewis et al. 2003a) that a motor rehearsal of the upcoming shape copying is occurring during this visual presentation period. For the CV condition, practically one motor feature (number of segments drawn) dominated both dimensions, with a secondary engagement of horizontal symmetry in Dimension 1. The right postcentral gyrus, right intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobule and right inferior parietal lobule contributed mostly to Dimension 1; the superior frontal gyrus bilaterally, right middle frontal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule contributed mostly to Dimension 2; and the left superior parietal lobule and left intraparietal sulcus contributed to both dimensions approximately equally. CV BOLD activation of ROIs contributing to Dimension 1 (or to both dimensions) was significantly associated with the number of shape segments drawn. Since the direction of movement differs in successively drawn shape segments, the number of segments (minus one) equals the number of changes in the direction of movement. We conclude that this fundamental spatial motor aspect of drawing geometrical shapes is the critical variable, independent of the particular shape drawn, that dominates cortical activation during copying.
19189718	In macaques, the frontal eye field and the recently defined supplementary eye field play a role in the production of eye movements. Whereas the structure and function of the frontal eye field are well understood, little is known about the supplementary eye field. The goal of this study was to determine the connections of the physiologically defined supplementary eye field. In each case, the location of the supplementary eye field was determined by using intracortical microstimulation, the borders were marked with small electrolytic lesions, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the supplementary eye field. After the tissue was incubated with tetramethyl benzidine, it was determined that in three cases the injection site was confined to the physiologically defined supplementary eye field. The present results indicate that the supplementary eye field is reciprocally connected with the claustrum, ventral anterior nucleus, including pars magnocellularis, nucleus X, posterior subdivision of the ventral lateral nucleus, multiform, parvocellular, magnocellular, and densocellular subdivisions of the medial dorsal nucleus, central lateral nucleus, parafascicular nucleus, and suprageniculate-limitans complex. The supplementary eye field projects to the putamen, caudate, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, central densocellular nucleus, zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, parvocellular part of the red nucleus, intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus, central gray, cuneiform nucleus, mesencephalic reticular formation, pontine gray, nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and nucleus reticularis pontis oralis. The supplementary eye field is reciprocally and bilaterally connected with periprincipal and inferior prefrontal cortex, with periarcuate cortex, including the frontal eye field, the frontal ventral region, and with postarcuate premotor cortex, and cortex surrounding the supplementary eye field, including the supplementary motor area. The supplementary eye field is also reciprocally connected ipsilaterally with cortex in and around the cingulate sulcus and the intraparietal sulcus, whereas cortex within the superior temporal sulcus projects to the supplementary eye field. The connections of the physiologically defined supplementary eye field are compared to previously demonstrated connections of the supplementary motor region and of the physiologically defined frontal eye field. Comparisons between the connections of the frontal and supplementary eye fields reveal that both regions are connected with structures related to visuomotor functions, but the frontal eye field has more extensive connections with vision-related structures, and the supplementary eye field has more extensive connections with structures related to prefrontal and skeletomotor functions. Such connectional differences suggest functional differences between these two sensorimotor regions of the frontal lobe.
19198099	In terms of practical view, the type of aphasia can be classified by four elementary symptoms: anarthria (apraxia of speech), phonemic paraphasia, word comprehension impairment, word finding difficulty. Each elementary symptom has been established by causative lesion: anarthria for lowed posterior part of the left precentral gyrus, phonemic paraphasia for the left marginal gyrus and underlying white matter, word comprehension impairment for the left middle frontal gyrus or the posterior part of superior and middle temporal gyrus (the area called Wernickle's area), word finding difficulty for the left inferior frontal gyrus or the left angular gyrus or the left posterior part of the inferior temporal gyrus. In addition to ordinary estimation of language some devised examination enables distinction of the symptoms due to frontal lesion and the symptom due to the posterior lesion. This methods taking advantage of the symptoms related apahasia is also useful for making diagnosis and knowing prognosis of progressive aphasia.
19235216	Prior studies revealed that aversive stimuli and psychostimulant drugs elicit Fos expression in neurons clustered above and behind the interpeduncular nucleus that project strongly to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) compacta (C). Other reports suggest that these neurons modulate responses to aversive stimuli. We now designate the region containing them as the "mesopontine rostromedial tegmental nucleus" (RMTg) and report herein on its neuroanatomy. Dense micro-opioid receptor and somatostatin immunoreactivity characterize the RMTg, as do neurons projecting to the VTA/SNC that are enriched in GAD67 mRNA. Strong inputs to the RMTg arise in the lateral habenula (LHb) and, to a lesser extent, the SN. Other inputs come from the frontal cortex, ventral striatopallidum, extended amygdala, septum, preoptic region, lateral, paraventricular and posterior hypothalamus, zona incerta, periaqueductal gray, intermediate layers of the contralateral superior colliculus, dorsal raphe, mesencephalic, pontine and medullary reticular formation, and the following nuclei: parafascicular, supramammillary, mammillary, ventral lateral geniculate, deep mesencephalic, red, pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental, cuneiform, parabrachial, and deep cerebellar. The RMTg has meager outputs to the forebrain, mainly to the ventral pallidum, preoptic-lateral hypothalamic continuum, and midline-intralaminar thalamus, but much heavier outputs to the brainstem, including, most prominently, the VTA/SNC, as noted above, and to medial tegmentum, pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, dorsal raphe, and locus ceruleus and subceruleus. The RMTg may integrate multiple forebrain and brainstem inputs in relation to a dominant LHb input. Its outputs to neuromodulatory projection systems likely converge with direct LHb projections to those structures.
19235223	We previously showed that chronic psychostimulant exposure induces the transcription factor DeltaFosB in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons of the caudal tier of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This subregion was defined as the tail of the VTA (tVTA). In the present study, we showed that tVTA can also be visualized by analyzing FosB/DeltaFosB response following acute cocaine injection. This induction occurs in GABAergic neurons, as identified by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression. To characterize tVTA further, we mapped its inputs by using the retrograde tracers Fluoro-Gold or cholera toxin B subunit. Retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex, the lateral septum, the ventral pallidum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the substantia innominata, the medial and lateral preoptic areas, the lateral and dorsal hypothalamic areas, the lateral habenula, the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the dorsal raphe, the periaqueductal gray, and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation. Projections from the prefrontal cortex, the hypothalamus, and the lateral habenula to the tVTA were also shown by using the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). We showed that the central nucleus of the amygdala innervates the anterior extent of the VTA but not the tVTA. Moreover, the tVTA mainly receives non-aminergic inputs from the dorsal raphe and the locus coeruleus. Although the tVTA has a low density of dopaminergic neurons, its afferents are mostly similar to those targeting the rest of the VTA. This suggests that the tVTA can be considered as a VTA subregion despite its caudal location.
19271107	Kinematic and functional magnetic resonance imaging were combined to investigate how movement complexity (in-phase vs. anti-phase) and rate (maximum rate vs. 1 Hz) influence the brain sensorimotor network of relapsing- remitting fatigued (F) and not-fatigued (NF) MS patients during the performance of coordinated hand and foot movements.Kinematic measures did not differ between F and NF patients. Task and disease showed an interaction in the right precuneus and posterior lobe of the cerebellum during in-phase/anti-phase conditions and in the right precuneus and posterior and anterior lobes of the cerebellum during maximum vs. 1 Hz rate. Task, disease and fatigue showed an interaction in the right precentral gyrus, the left postcentral gyrus, the left SII, the right precuneus, the right basal ganglia, the left lingual gyrus, and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, bilaterally, during in-phase/ anti-phase conditions and the left postcentral gyrus, the left SII, the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum, and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, bilaterally during maximum vs. 1 Hz rate.Investigations of motor task performance in MS patients require careful control of several variables, including task complexity, movement rate, and the presence of "subtle" clinical disturbances, such as fatigue, which might be underestimated at a standard neurological assessment.
19326470	The EphA5 receptor tyrosine kinase plays key roles in axon guidance during development. However, the presence of EphA5 protein in the nervous system has not been fully characterized. To examine EphA5 localization better, mutant mice, in which the EphA5 cytoplasmic domain was replaced with beta-galactosidase, were analyzed for both temporal and regional changes in the distribution of EphA5 protein in the developing and adult nervous system. During embryonic development, high levels of EphA5 protein were found in the retina, olfactory bulb, cerebral neocortex, hippocampus, pretectum, tectum, cranial nerve nuclei, and spinal cord. Variations in intensity were observed as development proceeded. Staining of pretectal nuclei, tectal nuclei, and other areas of the mesencephalon became more diffuse after maturity, whereas the cerebral neocortex gained more robust intensity. In the adult, receptor protein continued to be detected in many areas including the olfactory nuclei, neocortex, piriform cortex, induseum griseum, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and septum. In addition, EphA5 protein was found in the claustrum, stria terminalis, barrel cortex, and striatal patches, and along discrete axon tracts within the corpus callosum of the adult. We conclude that EphA5 function is not limited to the developing mouse brain and may play a role in synaptic plasticity in the adult.
19327389	Although the mouse is an experimental model with an increasing importance in various fields of neuroscience, the characteristics of its central gustatory pathways have not yet been well documented. Recent electrophysiological studies using the rat and hamster have revealed that taste processing in the brainstem gustatory relays is under the strong influence of inputs from forebrain gustatory structures. In the present study, we investigated the organization of afferent projections to the mouse parabrachial nucleus (PbN), which is located at a key site between the brainstem and gustatory, viscerosensory and autonomic centers in the forebrain. We made injections of the retrograde tracer fluorogold centered around the "waist" area of the PbN, whose neurons are known to be highly responsive to taste stimuli. Retrogradely labeled neurons were found in the infralimbic, dysgranular and agranular insular cortex as well as the claustrum; the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the substantia innominata; the central nucleus of the amygdala; the lateral and medial preoptic areas, the paraventricular, the dorsomedial, the ventromedial, the arcuate, and the lateral hypothalamic areas; the periaqueductal gray, the substantia nigra pars compacta, and the ventral tegmental area; the supratrigeminal nucleus, rostral and caudal nucleus of the solitary tract; the parvicellular intermediate and gigantocellular reticular nucleus; the caudal and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the area postrema. Numbers of labeled neurons in the main components of the gustatory system including the insular cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and rostral nucleus of the solitary tract were quantified. These results are basically consistent with those of the previous rat and hamster studies, but some species differences were found. Functional implications of these afferent inputs are discussed with an emphasis on their role in taste.
19348732	Nesfatin-1 is one of the peptide products of posttranslational processing of the nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) gene, suggested to have physiological relevance to suppress food intake and body weight gain in rats. Nesfatin-1-immunoreactive cells have been found in distinct nuclei in the rat brain related to circuitries regulating food intake. Here, we report novel yet undescribed localization of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 at the mRNA and protein level in the rat central nervous system. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the localization of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 in the piriform and insular cortex, endopiriform nucleus, nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, dorsal raphe nucleus, ambiguus nucleus, ventrolateral medulla and gigantocellular reticular nucleus, as well as Purkinje-cells of the cerebellum. In the spinal cord, nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity (IR) was found in both sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neuronal groups and in the dorsal area X from lower thoracic to sacral segments. The immunohistochemical results were confirmed by RT-PCR in the central amygdaloid nucleus, nucleus accumbens, cerebellum and lumbar spinal cord microdissected by punch technique. The features and distributions of nesfatin-1 IR and mRNA expression in the brain and spinal cord suggest that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 could play a wider role in autonomic regulation of visceral-endocrine functions besides food intake.
19362152	Using functional neuroimaging techniques (PET and fMRI), various cortical, limbic, and paralimbic structures have been identified in the last decade as neural substrates of human emotion. In this study we used a novel approach (intracerebral recordings of event-related potentials) to add to our knowledge of specific brain regions involved in affective picture processing. Ten intractable epileptic patients undergoing pre-surgical depth electrode recording viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures and intracerebral event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. A total of 752 cortical and subcortical sites were investigated. Significant differences in ERPs to unpleasant as compared to neutral or pleasant pictures were frequently and consistently observed in recordings from various brain areas--the mesial temporal cortex (the amygdala, the hippocampus, the temporal pole), the lateral temporal cortex, the mesial prefrontal cortex (ACC and the medial frontal gyrus), and the lateral prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, the mean latencies of responses to emotional stimuli were somewhat shorter in the frontal lobe structures (with evidently earlier activation within lateral prefrontal areas when compared to mesial prefrontal cortex) and longer in the temporal lobe regions. These differences, however, were not significant. Additional clearly positive findings were observed in some rarely investigated regions--in the posterior parietal cortex, the precuneus, and the insula. An approximately equivalent number of positive findings was revealed in the left and right hemisphere structures. These results are in agreement with a multisystem model of human emotion, distributed far beyond the typical limbic system and substantially comprising lateral aspects of both frontal lobes as well.
19369561	In addition to reward- and craving-related processes, habitual mechanisms play an important role in addiction. While the dorsal striatum has been proposed to code for the motivational state of habitual drug-seeking actions, the neural underpinnings of the corresponding drug-taking skills and action knowledge remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a behavioral orientation affordance paradigm to investigate the neural and behavioral correlates of automatized drug-taking actions in nicotine dependence. Smokers exhibited higher fMRI activations than nonsmokers when viewing smoking-related but not when viewing control images. These group differences in fMRI activations were located not only in brain regions associated with craving and habitual learning (left ventral and dorsal striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, uncus, medial frontal gyrus, right subcallosal gyrus, and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus), but also in a network of brain regions which has been strongly implicated in the encoding of action knowledge and tool use skills (bilateral premotor cortex, left superior parietal lobule, and right lateral cerebellum). A behavioral affordance reaction-time task indicated that smokers, but not nonsmokers, showed an automatized responsiveness to smoking paraphernalia similar to everyday objects. Moreover, smokers showed strong intercorrelations between fMRI activations in tool use-related brain regions, behavioral responsiveness to smoking-related cues, and severity of nicotine dependence. Apparently smoking-related action representations in smokers are stored in brain regions typically representing tool use skills and action knowledge. Most importantly, cortical and behavioral correlates of the respective drug-taking skills vary with the individual degree of nicotine dependence.
19401215	Parathyroid hormone receptor 2 (PTH2R) and its ligand, tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) constitute a neuromodulator system implicated in endocrine and nociceptive regulation. We now describe the presence and distribution of the PTH2R and TIP39 in the brain of primates using a range of tissues and ages from macaque and human brain. In situ hybridization histochemistry of TIP39 mRNA, studied in young macaque brain, due to its possible decline beyond late postnatal ages, was present only in the thalamic subparafascicular area and the pontine medial paralemniscal nucleus. In contrast, in situ hybridization histochemistry in macaque identified high levels of PTH2R expression in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, medial geniculate, and the pontine tegmentum. PTH2R mRNA was also detected in several human brain areas by RT-PCR. The distribution of PTH2R-immunoreactive fibers in human, determined by immunocytochemistry, was similar to that in rodents, including dense fiber networks in the medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular, periventricular and infundibular (arcuate) nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, median eminence, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nuclei, medullary dorsal reticular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Co-localization suggested that PTH2R fibers are glutamatergic, and that TIP39 may directly influence hypophysiotropic somatostatin containing and indirectly influence corticotropin releasing-hormone containing neurons. The results demonstrate that TIP39 and the PTH2R are expressed in the brain of primates in locations that suggest involvement in regulation of fear, anxiety, reproductive behaviors, release of pituitary hormones, and nociception.
19420011	Recently, the G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 has been identified as a novel oestrogen receptor (ER). The distribution of the receptor has been thus far mapped only in the rat central nervous system. This study was undertaken to map the distribution of GPR30 in the mouse brain and rodent peripheral tissues. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against GPR30 revealed high levels of GPR30 immunoreactivity (ir) in the forebrain (e.g. cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus), specific nuclei of the midbrain (e.g. the pontine nuclei and locus coeruleus) and the trigeminal nuclei and cerebellum Purkinje layer of the hindbrain in the adult mouse brain. In the rat and mouse periphery, GPR30-ir was detected in the anterior, intermediate and neural lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary. In situ hybridisation histochemistry using GPR30 riboprobes, revealed intense hybridisation signal for GPR30 in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus, anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary of both rat and mouse. Double immunofluorescence revealed GPR30 was present in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurones of the paraventricular nucleus and SON of the rat and mouse brain. The distribution of GPR30 is distinct from the other traditional ERs and offers an additional way in which oestrogen may mediate its effects in numerous brain regions and endocrine systems in the rodent.
19426785	The present study investigated the central connections of motor neurons innervating the thyroarytenoid laryngeal muscle that is active in swallowing, respiration and vocalization. In both intact and sympathectomized rats, the pseudorabies virus (PRV) was inoculated into the muscle. After initial infection of laryngomotor neurons in the ipsilateral loose division of the nucleus ambiguus (NA) by 3 days post-inoculation, PRV spread to the ipsilateral compact portion of the NA, the central and intermediate divisions of the nucleus tractus solitarii, the Botzinger complex, and the parvicellular reticular formation by 4 days. Infection was subsequently expanded to include the ipsilateral granular and dysgranular parietal insular cortex, the ipsilateral medial division of the central nucleus of the amygdala, the lateral, paraventricular, ventrolateral and medial preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus (generally bilaterally), the lateral periaqueductal gray, the A7 and oral and caudal pontine nuclei. At the latest time points sampled post-inoculation (5 days), infected neurons were identified in the ipsilateral agranular insular cortex, the caudal parietal insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the contralateral motor cortex. In the amygdala, infection had spread to the lateral central nucleus and the parvicellular portion of the basolateral nucleus. Hypothalamic infection was largely characterized by an increase in the number of infected cells in earlier infected regions though the posterior, dorsomedial, tuberomammillary and mammillary nuclei contained infected cells. Comparison with previous connectional data suggests PRV followed three interconnected systems originating in the forebrain; a bilateral system including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray and ventral respiratory group; an ipsilateral system involving the parietal insular cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and parvicellular reticular formation, and a minor contralateral system originating in motor cortex. Hypothalamic innervation involved several functionally specific nuclei. Overall, the data imply complex CNS control over the multi-functional thyroarytenoid muscle.
19428764	The orexins (hypocretins) are peptides found primarily in neurons of the hypothalamus of all vertebrates. Many differences were reported about the precise location of orexin containing cells and their projections throughout the brain in different species. However, there are few direct cross-species comparisons. Previous studies in anuran amphibians have also reported notable species differences. We examined and directly compared the distribution of orexinergic neurons and fibers within the brains of representatives of the three amphibian orders, anurans, urodeles and gymnophionans. Simultaneous detection of orexins and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to assess the precise location of the orexins in the brain and to evaluate the possible influence of the orexin system on the catecholaminergic cell groups. Although some differences were noted, a common pattern for the distribution of orexins in amphibians was observed. In all species, most immunoreactive neurons were observed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, whereas the cells in the preoptic area and the tuberal region were more variable. Orexin immunoreactive fibers in the brain of all species included abundant fibers throughout the preoptic area and hypothalamus, whereas moderate amounts of fibers were present in the pallium, striatum, septum, thalamus, optic tectum, torus semicircularis, rhombencephalon and spinal cord. The use of double immunohistochemistry in amphibians revealed orexinergic innervation in dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups, such as the midbrain tegmentum, locus coeruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract, as was previously reported in mammals.
19506723	The locus coeruleus (LC) is the major noradrenergic nucleus of the brain, giving rise to fibres innervating extensive areas throughout the neuraxis. Recent advances in neuroscience have resulted in the unravelling of the neuronal circuits controlling a number of physiological functions in which the LC plays a central role. Two such functions are the regulation of arousal and autonomic activity, which are inseparably linked largely via the involvement of the LC. The LC is a major wakefulness-promoting nucleus, resulting from dense excitatory projections to the majority of the cerebral cortex, cholinergic neurones of the basal forebrain, cortically-projecting neurones of the thalamus, serotoninergic neurones of the dorsal raphe and cholinergic neurones of the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and substantial inhibitory projections to sleep-promoting GABAergic neurones of the basal forebrain and ventrolateral preoptic area. Activation of the LC thus results in the enhancement of alertness through the innervation of these varied nuclei. The importance of the LC in controlling autonomic function results from both direct projections to the spinal cord and projections to autonomic nuclei including the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus ambiguus, the rostroventrolateral medulla, the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the caudal raphe, the salivatory nuclei, the paraventricular nucleus, and the amygdala. LC activation produces an increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in parasympathetic activity via these projections. Alterations in LC activity therefore result in complex patterns of neuronal activity throughout the brain, observed as changes in measures of arousal and autonomic function.
19580854	Creatine (Cr) is required to maintain ATP levels in the brain. The transport of Cr across the blood-brain barrier and into neurones requires a specific creatine transporter (CRT). Mutations in the CRT gene (SLC6A8) result in a novel form of X-linked mental retardation, characterised by developmental delays, seizures and a complete absence of Cr from the brain. To identify cell types and regions that depend on Cr for energy metabolism we have determined the regional and cellular localisation of CRT protein in the rat brain using immunohistochemical techniques with a highly specific, affinity-purified, CRT antibody. The results show high levels of CRT localisation is associated with specific brain regions and certain cell types. The CRT is predominantly found in neurones. CRT immunoreactivity is particularly abundant in the olfactory bulb, granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, pyramidal neurones of the cerebral cortex, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, motor and sensory cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem and the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord. Low levels of CRT were seen in the basal ganglia and white matter. Overall, CRT was found to show high intensities of labelling in the major motor and sensory regions of the forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord and forebrain regions associated with learning, memory and limbic functions. It is hypothesised that regions with high CRT expression are likely to have high metabolic ATP requirements and that areas with low CRT levels are those regions which are particularly vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases.
19710631	Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder that has been characterized by (1) compulsion to seek and take the drug, (2) loss of control in limiting intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (eg, dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) reflecting a motivational withdrawal syndrome when access to the drug is prevented. Drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder that involves elements of both impulsivity and compulsivity that yield a composite addiction cycle composed of three stages: 'binge/intoxication', 'withdrawal/negative affect', and 'preoccupation/anticipation' (craving). Animal and human imaging studies have revealed discrete circuits that mediate the three stages of the addiction cycle with key elements of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum as a focal point for the binge/intoxication stage, a key role for the extended amygdala in the withdrawal/negative affect stage, and a key role in the preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex-dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control. The transition to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these structures that may begin with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system and a cascade of neuroadaptations from the ventral striatum to dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex and eventually dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and extended amygdala. The delineation of the neurocircuitry of the evolving stages of the addiction syndrome forms a heuristic basis for the search for the molecular, genetic, and neuropharmacological neuroadaptations that are key to vulnerability for developing and maintaining addiction.
19713157	c-Fos protein immunocytochemistry was used to map the brain structures recruited during the evolution of seizures that follows repeated administration of a subconvulsive dose (35mg/kg, ip) of pentylenetetrazol in rats. c-Fos appeared earliest in nucleus accumbens shell, piriform cortex, prefrontal cortex, and striatum (stages 1 and 2 of kindling in comparison to control, saline-treated animals). At the third stage of kindling, central amygdala nuclei, entorhinal cortex, and lateral septal nuclei had enhanced concentrations of c-Fos. At the fourth stage of kindling, c-Fos expression was increased in basolateral amygdala and CA1 area of the hippocampus. Finally, c-Fos labeling was enhanced in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus only when tonic-clonic convulsions were fully developed. The most potent changes in c-Fos were observed in dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, CA1, lateral septal nuclei, basolateral amygdala, central amygdala nuclei, and prefrontal cortex. Piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, lateral septal nuclei, and CA3 area of the hippocampus appeared to be the brain structures selectively involved in the process of chemically induced kindling of seizures.
19741099	The functions of the lower urinary tract are controlled by complex pathways in the brain that act like switching circuits to voluntarily or reflexly shift the activity of various pelvic organs (bladder, urethra, urethral sphincter, and pelvic floor muscles) from urine storage to micturition. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to visualize the brain switching circuits controlling reflex micturition in anesthetized rats. The fMRI images confirmed the hypothesis based on previous neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies that the brain stem switch for reflex micturition control involves both the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the pontine micturition center (PMC). During storage, the PAG was activated by afferent input from the urinary bladder while the PMC was inactive. When bladder volume increased to the micturition threshold, the switch from storage to micturition was associated with PMC activation and enhanced PAG activity. A complex brain network that may regulate the brain stem micturition switch and control storage and voiding was also identified. Storage was accompanied by activation of the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, putamen, insula, and septal nucleus. On the other hand, micturition was associated with: 1) increased activity of the motor cortex, thalamus, and putamen; 2) a shift in the locus of activity in the cingulate and insula; and 3) the emergence of activity in the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and inferior colliculus. Understanding brain control of reflex micturition is important for elucidating the mechanisms underlying neurogenic bladder dysfunctions including frequency, urgency, and incontinence.
19776264	Brain development during late childhood and adolescence is characterized by decreases in gray matter (GM) and increases in white matter (WM) and ventricular volume. The dynamic nature of development across different structures is, however, not well understood, and the present magnetic resonance imaging study took advantage of a whole-brain segmentation approach to describe the developmental trajectories of 16 neuroanatomical volumes in the same sample of children, adolescents, and young adults (n = 171; range, 8-30 years). The cerebral cortex, cerebral WM, caudate, putamen, pallidum, accumbens area, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellar GM, cerebellar WM, lateral ventricles, inferior lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle were studied. The cerebral cortex was further analyzed in terms of lobar thickness and surface area. The results revealed substantial heterogeneity in developmental trajectories. GM decreased nonlinearly in the cerebral cortex and linearly in the caudate, putamen, pallidum, accumbens, and cerebellar GM, whereas the amygdala and hippocampus showed slight, nonlinear increases in GM volume. WM increased nonlinearly in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, with an earlier maturation in cerebellar WM. In addition to similarities in developmental trajectories within subcortical regions, our results also point to differences between structures within the same regions: among the basal ganglia, the caudate showed a weaker relationship with age than the putamen and pallidum, and in the cerebellum, differences were found between GM and WM development. These results emphasize the importance of studying a wide range of structural variables in the same sample, for a broader understanding of brain developmental principles.
19823988	Whether innocuous heat (IH)-exclusive brain regions exist and whether patterns of cerebral responses to IH and noxious heat (NH) stimulations are similar remain elusive. We hypothesized that distinct and shared cerebral networks were evoked by each type of stimulus. Twelve normal subjects participated in a functional MRI study with rapidly ramped IH (38 degrees C) and NH (44 degrees C) applied to the foot. Group activation maps demonstrated three patterns of cerebral activation: (1) IH-responsive only in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL); (2) NH-responsive only in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), posterior insular cortex (IC), and premotor area (PMA); and (3) both IH- and NH-responsive in the middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior IC, cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lentiform nucleus (LN), and midbrain. According to the temporal analysis of regions of interest, the IPL exclusively responded to IH, and the S2, posterior IC, and PMA were exclusively activated by NH throughout the entire period of stimulation. The IFG, thalamus, ACC, and LN responded differently during different phases of IH versus NH stimulation, and the NH-responsive-only S1 responded transiently during the early phase of IH stimulation. BOLD signals in bilateral IPLs were specifically correlated with the ratings of IH sensation, while responses in the contralateral S1 and S2 were correlated with pain intensity. These results suggest that distinct and shared spatial and temporal patterns of cerebral networks are responsible for the perception of IH and NH.
19844991	Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that modulates the reproductive physiology of birds and mammals by inhibiting gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. GnIH can also directly inhibit reproductive behaviors, possibly via action within the brain. Identification of the distribution of GnIH neurons and fibers may provide us with clues to how the brain controls reproductive activities of the animal. Here, we characterized the location and connectivity of GnIH neurons in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) brain. We determined the macaque GnIH precursor mRNA, and further identified a mature GnIH peptide (SGRNMEVSLVRQVLNLPQRF-NH(2)) by mass spectrometry combined with immunoaffinity purification. The majority of GnIH precursor mRNA-positive and GnIH-immunoreactive (GnIH-ir) cell bodies were localized in the intermediate periventricular nucleus (IPe) in the hypothalamus, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Abundant GnIH-ir fibers were observed in the nucleus of the stria terminalis in the telencephalon; habenular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, IPe, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, median eminence and dorsal hypothalamic area in the diencephalon; medial region of the superior colliculus, central gray substance of the midbrain and dorsal raphe nucleus in the midbrain; and parabrachial nucleus in the pons. GnIH-ir fibers were observed in close proximity to gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I, dopamine, beta-endorphin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-II neurons in the preoptic area, IPe, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, and central gray substance of midbrain, respectively. GnIH neurons might thus regulate several neural systems in addition to pituitary gonadotropin release.
19847359	Memory encoding and memory retrieval are two important processes of the memory. The main results of studies on the neural basis of the memory encoding and memory retrieval by functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) technique were summarized in this review. The neural basis of memory encoding and retrieval phases varies with different materials, memory types, and age stages. It means that the neural networks of these memory activities are separate. The functional locations of the activated brain areas during memory encoding and during memory retrieval phases are overlapped with distinction. The activated brain areas of memory encoding mainly locate in the prefrontal lobe, the temporal lobe, the parietal lobe, the anterior hippocampus, the thalamus, and the basal ganglia (including the striatum and the marginal division of the striatum). The activated brain areas of memory retrieval mainly locate in the prefrontal lobe, the temporal lobe, the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, the posterior hippocampus, the thalamus, and the basal ganglia. The anterior hippocampus is mainly activated during the encoding phase, whereas posterior hippocampus is mainly activated during the retrieval phase. The intensity of the activated cerebral cortex regions during the encoding phase is stronger than that during the retrieval phase, whereas the opposite activated pattern is found in the subcortical structures, mainly the basal ganglia and thalamus, during the two phases. It seems that the stimulation might activate certain cerebral cortex areas during the memory encoding phase, then the information is transported to the subcortical structures and comes back to the cerebral cortex to complete the memory retrieval phase. The encoding and retrieval phases of the memory are supposed to be accomplished by a neural circuit among the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex, rather than the cerebral cortex only.
19853585	In daily communication, we sometimes use ironic expressions to convey the opposite meaning. To understand these contradictory statements, we have to infer contextual implications and the speaker's mental state. However, little is known about how our brains carry out these complex processes. In this study, we investigated the neural substrates involved in irony comprehension using echoic utterance (Sperber and Wilson, 1986, 1995). Participants read a short scenario that consisted of five sentences. The first four sentences explained the situation of the protagonists. The fifth connoted either an ironic, literal, or unconnected meaning. The participants had to press a button to indicate whether or not the final sentence expressed irony. In the ironic sentence condition, the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, caudate, thalamus, the left insula, and amygdala were activated. In the literal sentence condition, the right superior frontal gyrus, the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, caudate, the left insula, the right thalamus, and the left amygdala were activated. However, in the ironic sentence condition minus the literal sentence condition, we observed higher activation in the right medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10), the right precentral (BA 6), and the left superior temporal sulcus (BA 21). Our results suggest that irony comprehension is strongly related to mentalizing processes and that activation in these regions might be affected by higher-order cognitive operations.
19880036	The neural network associated with idiopathic hyperacusis is still not well known. We studied the brain activation of 3 middle-aged patients with mild to moderate hyperacusis by functional magnetic resonance imaging while they were listening to white noise binaurally. In addition to the temporal lobes, in all patients, sound elicited activation in the frontal lobes (superior, middle, or inferior frontal gyri) and occipital lobes (precuneus, cuneus, superior occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, or fusiform gyrus). The parahippocampus was activated in 2 of 3 patients. Furthermore, the precentral and postcentral gyri, superior and inferior parietal lobules, thalamus, midbrain, claustrum, insula, posterior cingulated gyrus, and orbital and rectal gyrus were also activated in one patient. The neural network associated with idiopathic hyperacusis might be associated with the frontal lobes and parahippocampus.
19940104	sigma-1 Receptors are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones that are implicated in the neuroplasticity associated with psychostimulant abuse. We immunocytochemically examined the distribution of sigma-1 receptors in the brain of drug-naive rats and then examined the dynamics of sigma-1 receptors and other ER chaperones in specific brain subregions of rats that self-administered methamphetamine, received methamphetamine passively, or received only saline injections. sigma-1 Receptors were found to be expressed in moderate to high levels in the olfactory bulb, striatum, nucleus accumbens shell, olfactory tubercle, amygdala, hippocampus, red nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, and locus ceruleus. Methamphetamine, whether self-administered or passively received, significantly elevated ER chaperones including the sigma-1 receptor, BiP, and calreticulin in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. In the olfactory bulb, however, only the sigma-1 receptor chaperone was increased, and this increase occurred only in rats that actively self-administered methamphetamine. Consistent with an increase in sigma-1 receptors, extracellular signal-regulated kinase was found to be activated and protein kinase A attenuated in the olfactory bulb of methamphetamine self-administering rats. sigma-1 Receptors in the olfactory bulb were found to be colocalized with dopamine D1 receptors. These results indicate that methamphetamine induces ER stress in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra in rats whether the drug is received actively or passively. However, the changes seen only in rats that actively self-administered methamphetamine suggest that D1 and sigma-1 receptors in the olfactory bulb might play an important role in the motivational conditioning/learning aspects of methamphetamine self-administration in the rat.
20090314	Lungfishes are currently considered the closest living relatives of tetrapods and represent an interesting group for the study of evolutionary traits in the transition from fishes to tetrapods. The brains of lungfishes have received little attention in comparative studies probably due to the difficulty of obtaining these unique animals. In the present study the distribution of orexin (hypocretin)-like immunoreactivity was studied in the brain of the African lungfish Protopterus dolloi and the Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri by using antibodies directed against the mammalian orexin-A and orexin-B peptides. Simultaneous detection of orexins and tyrosine hydroxylase or serotonin was used to assess the precise location of the orexins in the brain and to evaluate the possible influence of the orexin system on the monoaminergic cell groups. Although some differences were noted, a common pattern for the distribution of orexins in the two lungfishes studied was observed. In both species, most immunoreactive neurons were observed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and dorsal hypothalamus. Only in Neoceratodus, however, were important cell populations found in the preoptic area and infundibular hypothalamus, whereas small numbers of faintly reactive neurons were present in the lateral septum and ventral striatum. Fiber labeling was widely distributed in all main brain subdivisions, but was more abundant in regions such as the septum, preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, thalamus, pretectum and tegmentum. Less conspicuous was the innervation of the pallial regions, habenula, optic tectum, rhombencephalic reticular formation and spinal cord. Orexinergic innervation was found in close contact with dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic cell groups, homologous to the substantia nigra in the midbrain tegmentum, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the raphe nuclei. Although unique features have been found for lungfishes, the location of orexin immunoreactive elements is largely consistent with that recently reported following a similar approach in amphibians and amniotes, suggesting that the general organization of this peptidergic system occurred in the common ancestor of lungfishes and tetrapods.
20138265	Human exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) has been associated with cancer and serious injury to various internal organs, as well as peripheral neuropathy, endocrine disruption and diverse effects in the central nervous system (CNS). Using rodent models, it is possible to demonstrate As accumulation in the brain that leads to defects in operant learning, behavioral changes, and affect pituitary gonadotrophins. iAs biomethylation in the CNS is a significant process, yielding products that are more reactive and toxic than the parent compound. Mice received 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day sodium arsenite orally for 9 days. We investigated the distribution of iAs and its metabolites as well as the mRNA and protein expression of arsenic (III) methyltransferase (AS3MT), which encodes the key enzyme in iAs metabolism, in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, mesencephalon, thalamus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, pons, medulla oblongata, and pituitary of mouse brain. Our findings show that methylated As metabolites are present in all brain regions studied suggesting that AS3MT is ubiquitously expressed in the brain and it is not inducible by dose of arsenite. There is also a dose-related accumulation of As species in all brain regions, with the highest accumulation observed in the pituitary. The higher distribution of arsenicals in pituitary can help to explain the neuroendocrine effects associated with iAs exposure.
20157252	Although it is established that Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to cerebral macrostructural atrophy, microstructural diffusion changes have also been observed, but it is not yet known whether these changes offer unique information about the disease pathology. Thus, a multi-modal imaging study was conducted to determine the independent contribution of each modality in moderate to severe AD. Seventeen patients with moderate-severe AD and 13 healthy volunteers underwent diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted MR scanning. Images were processed to obtain measures of macrostructural atrophy (gray and white matter volumes) and microstructural damage (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity). Microstructural diffusion changes independent of macrostructural loss were investigated using an ANCOVA where macrostructural maps were used as voxel-wise covariates. The reverse ANCOVA model was also assessed, where macrostructural loss was the dependent variable and microstructural diffusion tensor imaging maps were the imaging covariates. Diffusion differences between patients and controls were observed after controlling for volumetric differences in medial temporal, retrosplenial regions, anterior commissure, corona radiata, internal capsule, thalamus, corticopontine tracts, cerebral peduncle, striatum, and precentral gyrus. Independent volumetric differences were observed in the entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex, splenium and cerebellum. While it is well known that AD is associated with pronounced volumetric change, this study suggests that measures of microstructure provide unique information not obtainable with volumetric mapping in regions known to be pivotal in AD and in those thought to be spared. As such this work provides great understanding of the topography of pathological changes in AD that can be captured with imaging.
20331985	The present study aimed at characterizing the anatomical and subcellular localization of cytoglobin (Cygb) and neuroglobin (Ngb) in the mouse brain by use of in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Cygb and Ngb were only found in distinct brain areas and often in the same areas. We found intense staining in the piriform cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus (medial preoptic area, supra chiasmatic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus (LH), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and the arcuate nucleus, habenular nuclei, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), locus coeruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In addition Cygb is found in the hippocampus, the reticular thalamic nucleus, and the dorsal raphe nucleus; Ngb is found in the sub parabrachial nucleus. Co-localization of Cygb and Ngb is mainly observed in the LDTg and PPTg. Cygb and Ngb were found in cytoplasm, along neurotubuli, in mitochondria and in the nucleus by use of immunoelectron microscopy. Most neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-positive neurons were found to co-localize Cygb, although not all nNOS neurones contain Cygb. Ngb co-localize with almost all orexin neurons in the LH. In conclusion the distribution of Cygb and Ngb seems much more restricted and coherent than previously reported. We believe other functions than pure oxygen buffers and neuroprotectants should be considered. The anatomical data indicate a role in NO signalling for Cygb and involvement in sleep-wake cycling for Cygb and Ngb.
20399839	Serotonin modulates the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis particularly via the serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT(1A)). Therefore, the rationale of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to investigate the influence of the 5-HT(1A) receptor distribution in the human brain on plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and cortisol in vivo. Eighteen healthy female were measured with PET and the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor radioligand [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635. Nine a priori defined brain regions (hypothalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, dorsal raphe nucleus, retrosplenial cortex, and insula) and the cerebellum (reference region) were delineated on coregistered MR images. DHEAS and cortisol plasma levels were collected by blood sampling in the morning of the PET day. Linear regression analysis of DHEAS plasma level as dependent variable and hypothalamic 5-HT(1A) receptor binding potential (BP) as independent variable showed a highly significant association (r=.691, p=.002). The hypothalamic 5-HT(1A) BP predicted 47.7% of the variability in DHEAS plasma levels. Regressions were borderline significant (p<.01, Bonferroni corrected threshold <.0056) between 5-HT(1A) BP in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices and free cortisol levels. No significant associations between DHEAS or cortisol and the 5-HT(1A) receptor BP in other investigated brain regions were found. In conclusion, the serotonergic system may influence the DHEAS plasma level by modulating CRH and ACTH release via hypothalamic 5-HT(1A) receptors as reported for cortisol before. As disturbances of the HPA axis as well as changes of the 5-HT(1A) receptor distribution have been reported in affective disorders, future studies should focus on these interactions.
20437527	Cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone) was previously shown to induce demyelination in white matter enriched brain structures. In the present study we used the cuprizone demyelination model in transgenic mice expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the 2'-3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) promoter. The use of these particular transgenic mice allows easy detection of cells belonging to the entire oligodendroglial (OLG) lineage, ranging from OLG precursors to mature myelinating OLGs. We were able to evaluate the precise extent of oligodendroglial cell damage and recovery within the murine adult central nervous system (CNS) after inducing demyelination by acute cuprizone intoxication. A generalized loss of GFP+ cells was observed after cuprizone exposure and correlated with a decline in myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. OLGs were depleted in many brain areas that were previously thought to be unaffected by cuprizone treatment. Thus, in addition to the well-known cuprizone effects on the medial corpus callosum, we also found a loss of GFP+ cells in most brain structures, particularly in the caudatus putamen, cortex, anterior commissure, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, optic chiasm, brainstem, and cingulum. Loss of GFP+ cells was accompanied by extensive astrogliosis and microglial activation, although neurons were not affected. Interestingly, cuprizone-treated animals showed both activation of GFAP expression and a higher proliferation rate in subventricular zone cells. A week after cuprizone removal from the diet, GFP+ oligodendroglial cells began repopulating the damaged structures. GFP expression precedes that of MBP and allows OLG detection before myelin restoration.
20445065	Although normal dopaminergic tone has been shown to be essential for the induction of cortico-striatal and mesolimbic theta oscillatory activity, the influence of norepinephrine on these brain networks remains relatively unknown. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials and single-neuron activity across 10 interconnected brain areas (ventral striatum, frontal association cortex, hippocampus, primary motor cortex, orbital frontal cortex, prelimbic cortex, dorsal lateral striatum, medial dorsal nucleus of thalamus, substantia nigra pars reticularis, and ventral tegmental area) in a combined genetically and pharmacologically induced mouse model of hyponoradrenergia. Our results show that norepinephrine (NE) depletion induces a novel state in male mice characterized by a profound disruption of coherence across multiple cortico-striatal circuits and an increase in mesolimbic cross-structural coherence. Moreover, this brain state is accompanied by a complex behavioral phenotype consisting of transient hyperactivity, stereotypic behaviors, and an acute 12-fold increase in grooming. Notably, treatment with a norepinephrine precursors (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine at 100 mg/kg or l-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine at 5 mg/kg) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine at 20 mg/kg) attenuates the abnormal behaviors and selectively reverses the circuit changes observed in NE-depleted mice. Together, our results demonstrate that norepinephrine modulates the dynamic tuning of coherence across cortico-striato-thalamic circuits, and they suggest that changes in coherence across these circuits mediate the abnormal generation of hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors.
20493176	The roles of supramedullary brain mechanisms involved in the control of jaw movements are not fully understood. To address this issue, a series of retrograde (Fluorogold, FG) and anterograde (biotinylated dextran amine, BDA) tract-tracing studies were done in rats. At first, we identified projection patterns from defined sensorimotor cortical areas to subgroups of trigeminal premotoneurons that are located in defined brainstem areas. Focal injections of FG into these brainstem areas revealed that the rostralmost part of lateral agranular cortex (rmost-Agl), the rostralmost part of medial agranular cortex (rmost-Agm), and the rostralmost part of primary somatosensory cortex (rmost-S1) preferentially project to brainstem areas containing jaw-closing premotoneurons, jaw-opening premotoneurons and a mixture of both types of premotoneurons, respectively. The thalamic reciprocal connectivities to rmost-Agl, rmost-Agm, and rmost-S1 were then investigated following cortical injections of FG or BDA. We found many retrogradely FG-labeled neurons and large numbers of axons and terminals labeled anterogradely with BDA in the dorsal thalamus mainly on the side ipsilateral to the injection sites. The rmost-Agl had strong connections with the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), ventromedial nucleus (VM), parafascicular nucleus, and posterior nucleus (Po); the rmost-Agm with the ventral anterior nucleus, VL, VM, central lateral nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, mediodorsal nucleus and Po; and the rmost-S1 with the ventral posteromedial nucleus and Po. The present results suggest that the descending multiple pathways from the cerebral cortex to jaw-closing and jaw-opening premotoneurons have unique functional roles in jaw movement motor control.
20546704	Leptin is not only a feedback modulator of feeding and energy expenditure but also regulates reproductive functions, CNS development and mood. Obesity and major depression are growing public health concerns which may derive, in part, from disregulation of leptin feedback at the level of the hypothalamic feeding centers and mood regulators within the limbic system. Identifying downstream mediators of leptin action may provide therapeutic opportunities. We and others have previously reported that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, pGlu-His-Pro-NH(2)) and TRH-like peptides (pGlu-X-Pro-NH(2), where "X" can be any amino acid residue) have neuroprotective, antidepressant, anti-epileptic, analeptic, anti-ataxic, and anorectic properties. For this reason, young, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected ip with 1mg/kg rat leptin and peptide and protein levels were measured in brain and peripheral tissues at 0, 0.5, 1 and 2h later. Eleven brain regions: pyriform cortex (PYR), entorhinal cortex (ENT), cerebellum (CBL), nucleus accumbens (NA), frontal cortex (FCX), amygdala (AY), posterior cingulate (PCNG), striatum (STR), hippocampus (HC), medulla oblongata (MED) and anterior cingulate (ACNG) and five peripheral tissues (adrenals, testes, epididymis, pancreas and prostate) were analyzed. TRH and six TRH-like peptide levels in STR fell by 0.5h consistent with leptin-induced release of these peptides: STR (7 downward arrow). Significant changes in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels for other brain regions were: CBL (5 downward arrow), ENT (5 downward arrow), HC (4 downward arrow), AY (4 downward arrow), FCX (3 downward arrow), and ACNG (1 downward arrow). The rapid modulation of TRH and TRH-like peptide release combined with their similarity in behavioral, neuroendocrine, immunomodulatory, metabolic and steroidogenic effects to that of leptin is consistent with these peptides participating in downstream signaling.
20566485	Patients with Parkinson's disease have great difficulty in performing bimanual movements; this problem is more obvious when they perform bimanual anti-phase movements. The underlying mechanism of this problem remains unclear. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the bimanual coordination associated changes of brain activity and inter-regional interactions in Parkinson's disease. Subjects were asked to perform right-handed, bimanual in-phase and bimanual anti-phase movements. After practice, normal subjects performed all tasks correctly. Patients with Parkinson's disease performed in-phase movements correctly. However, some patients still made infrequent errors during anti-phase movements; they tended to revert to in-phase movement. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the supplementary motor area was more activated during anti-phase movement than in-phase movement in controls, but not in patients. In performing anti-phase movements, patients with Parkinson's disease showed less activity in the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area, and had more activation in the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus and cerebellum compared with normal subjects. The basal ganglia and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were less connected with the supplementary motor area, whereas the primary motor cortex, parietal cortex, precuneus and cerebellum were more strongly connected with the supplementary motor area in patients with Parkinson's disease than in controls. Our findings suggest that dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia, abnormal interactions of brain networks and disrupted attentional networks are probably important reasons contributing to the difficulty of the patients in performing bimanual anti-phase movements. The patients require more brain activity and stronger connectivity in some brain regions to compensate for dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia in order to perform bimanual movements correctly.
20653032	Transforming growth factors-beta1 (TGF-beta1), -2, and -3 form a small group of related proteins involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and survival of various cell types. Recently, TGF-betas were also demonstrated to be neuroprotective. In the present study, we investigated their distribution in the rat brain as well as their expression following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Probes were produced for all types of TGF-betas, and in situ hybridization was performed. We demonstrated high TGF-beta1 expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, substantia nigra, brainstem reticular formation and motoneurons, and area postrema. In contrast, TGF-beta2 was abundantly expressed in deep cortical layers, dentate gyrus, midline thalamic nuclei, posterior hypothalamic area and mamillary body, superior olive, areas of monoaminergic neurons, spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsal vagal complex, cerebellum, and choroid plexus, and a high level of TGF-beta3 mRNA was found in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal amygdaloid nuclei, lateral septal nucleus, several thalamic nuclei, arcuate and supramamillary nuclei, superior colliculus, superior olive, brainstem reticular formation and motoneurons, area postrema, and inferior olive. Focal brain ischemia induced TGF-betas with markedly different expression patterns. TGF-beta1 was induced in the penumbral region of cortex and striatum, whereas TGF-beta2 and -beta3 were induced in different layers of the ipsilateral cortex. The expression of the subtypes of TGF-betas in different brain regions suggests that they are involved in the regulation of different neurons and bind to different latent TGF-beta binding proteins. Furthermore, they might have subtype-specific functions following ischemic attack.
21180406	Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity plays a significant role in cell function. There are limited studies with regard to the role of DNA damage in bipolar affective disorder (BP). In the present study, we have assessed DNA integrity, conformation, and stability in the brain region of bipolar depression (BD) patients (n=10) compared to age-matched controls (n=8). Genomic DNA was isolated from 10 postmortem BD patients' brain regions (frontal cortex, Pons, medulla, thalamus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, Parietal, temporal, occipital lobe, and hippocampus) and from the age-matched control subjects. DNA from the frontal cortex, pons, medulla, and thalamus showed significantly higher number of strand breaks in BD (P<0.01) compared to the age-matched controls. However, DNA from the hippocampus region was intact and did not show any strand breaks. The stability studies also indicated that the melting temperature and ethidium bromide binding pattern were altered in the DNA of BD patients' brain regions, except in the hippocampus. The conformation studies showed B-A or secondary B-DNA conformation (instead of the normal B-DNA) in BD patients' brain regions, with the exception of the hippocampus. The levels of redox metals such as Copper (Cu) and Iron (Fe) were significantly elevated in the brain regions of the sufferers of BD, while the Zinc (Zn) level was decreased. In the hippocampus, there was no change in the Fe or Cu levels, whereas, the Zn level was elevated. There was a clear correlation between Cu and Fe levels versus strand breaks in the brain regions of the BD. To date, as far as we are aware, this is a new comprehensive database on stability and conformations of DNA in different brain regions of patients affected with BD. The biological significance of these findings is discussed here.
21208991	The present study examined the neural correlates of long-term intense romantic love using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ten women and 7 men married an average of 21.4 years underwent fMRI while viewing facial images of their partner. Control images included a highly familiar acquaintance; a close, long-term friend; and a low-familiar person. Effects specific to the intensely loved, long-term partner were found in: (i) areas of the dopamine-rich reward and basal ganglia system, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsal striatum, consistent with results from early-stage romantic love studies; and (ii) several regions implicated in maternal attachment, such as the globus pallidus (GP), substantia nigra, Raphe nucleus, thalamus, insular cortex, anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate. Correlations of neural activity in regions of interest with widely used questionnaires showed: (i) VTA and caudate responses correlated with romantic love scores and inclusion of other in the self; (ii) GP responses correlated with friendship-based love scores; (iii) hypothalamus and posterior hippocampus responses correlated with sexual frequency; and (iv) caudate, septum/fornix, posterior cingulate and posterior hippocampus responses correlated with obsession. Overall, results suggest that for some individuals the reward-value associated with a long-term partner may be sustained, similar to new love, but also involves brain systems implicated in attachment and pair-bonding.
21823025	Brain iron deposition has been proposed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of brain iron accumulation with the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with AD by using quantitative MR relaxation rate R2' measurements. Fifteen patients with AD, 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and 30 healthy volunteers underwent 1.5T MR multi-echo T2 mapping and T2* mapping for the measurement of transverse relaxation rate R2' (R2'=R2*-R2). We statistically analyzed the R2' and iron concentrations of bilateral hippocampus (HP), parietal cortex (PC), frontal white matter (FWM), putamen (PU), caudate nucleus (CN), thalamus (TH), red nucleus (RN), substantia nigra (SN), and dentate nucleus (DN) of the cerebellum for the correlation with the severity of dementia. Two-tailed t-test, Student-Newman-Keuls test (ANOVA) and linear correlation test were used for statistical analysis. In 30 healthy volunteers, the R2' values of bilateral SN, RN, PU, CN, globus pallidus (GP), TH, and FWM were measured. The correlation with the postmortem iron concentration in normal adults was analyzed in order to establish a formula on the relationship between regional R2' and brain iron concentration. The iron concentration of regions of interest (ROI) in AD patients and controls was calculated by this formula and its correlation with the severity of AD was analyzed. Regional R2' was positively correlated with regional brain iron concentration in normal adults (r=0.977, P<0.01). Iron concentrations in bilateral HP, PC, PU, CN, and DN of patients with AD were significantly higher than those of the controls (P<0.05); Moreover, the brain iron concentrations, especially in parietal cortex and hippocampus at the early stage of AD, were positively correlated with the severity of patients' cognitive impairment (P<0.05). The higher the R2' and iron concentrations were, the more severe the cognitive impairment was. Regional R2' and iron concentration in parietal cortex and hippocampus were positively correlated with the severity of AD patients' cognitive impairment, indicating that it may be used as a biomarker to evaluate the progression of AD.
21850525	In this study, we used manual delineation of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the cerebellar atrophy in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Ten subjects with SCA2 were compared to ten controls. The volume of the pons, the total cerebellum, and the individual cerebellar lobules were calculated via manual delineation of structural MRI. SCA2 showed substantial global atrophy of the cerebellum. Furthermore, the degeneration was lobule specific, selectively affecting the anterior lobe, VI, Crus I, Crus II, VIII, uvula, corpus medullare, and pons, while sparing VIIB, tonsil/paraflocculus, flocculus, declive, tuber/folium, pyramis, and nodulus. The temporal characteristics differed in each cerebellar subregion: (1) duration of disease: Crus I, VIIB, VIII, uvula, corpus medullare, pons, and the total cerebellar volume correlated with the duration of disease; (2) age: VI, Crus II, and flocculus correlated with age in control subjects; and (3) clinical scores: VI, Crus I, VIIB, VIII, corpus medullare, pons, and the total cerebellar volume correlated with clinical scores in SCA2. No correlations were found with the age of onset. Our extrapolated volumes at the onset of symptoms suggest that neurodegeneration may be present even during the presymptomatic stages of disease. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the cerebellar degeneration in SCA2 are region specific. Furthermore, our findings suggest the presence of presymptomatic atrophy and a possible developmental component to the mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying SCA2. Our findings further suggest that volumetric analysis may aid in the development of a non-invasive, quantitative biomarker.
21861050	To investigate the neuronal mechanism of retrieval of long-term digital memory in healthy volunteers, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was used in the study. Twenty-two right-handed volunteers were subjected to a long-term digital memory test with block-design. The memory task and control task were adopted in the experiment alternatively. The fMRI data were recorded by a Siemens 1.5T MR machine and analyzed by SPM99. The activated brain regions were shown in the Talairach coordinate. The results showed that the Brodmann's area (BA) 9 region in left middle frontal gyrus was the most activated cortex during the long-term digital memory task. The left medial frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, left superior parietal lobule, right superior parietal lobule, right middle temporal gyrus, left lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, right middle brain, cerebellum and right caudate nucleus tail were also involved. The activation in cortices showed obvious left predominance. It is suggested that a series of brain regions with left predominance are involved in long-term digital memory. Left lateral frontal cortex would be the most important structure for information extraction, while the other cortices and their connections may be important for processing and long-term storage of digital information.
21902800	Neuroimaging is becoming increasingly common in obesity research as investigators try to understand the neurological underpinnings of appetite and body weight in humans. Positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies examining responses to food intake and food cues, dopamine function and brain volume in lean vs. obese individuals are now beginning to coalesce in identifying irregularities in a range of regions implicated in reward (e.g. striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, insula), emotion and memory (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus), homeostatic regulation of intake (e.g. hypothalamus), sensory and motor processing (e.g. insula, precentral gyrus), and cognitive control and attention (e.g. prefrontal cortex, cingulate). Studies of weight change in children and adolescents, and those at high genetic risk for obesity, promise to illuminate causal processes. Studies examining specific eating behaviours (e.g. external eating, emotional eating, dietary restraint) are teaching us about the distinct neural networks that drive components of appetite, and contribute to the phenotype of body weight. Finally, innovative investigations of appetite-related hormones, including studies of abnormalities (e.g. leptin deficiency) and interventions (e.g. leptin replacement, bariatric surgery), are shedding light on the interactive relationship between gut and brain. The dynamic distributed vulnerability model of eating behaviour in obesity that we propose has scientific and practical implications.
22120186	Recent evidence indicates that the administration of inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) induces antidepressant-like effects in animal models such as the forced swimming test (FST). However, the neural circuits involved in these effects are not yet known. Therefore, this study investigated the expression of Fos protein, a marker of neuronal activity, in the brain of rats submitted to FST and treated with the preferential nNOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), or with classical antidepressant drugs (Venlafaxine and Fluoxetine). Male Wistar rats were submitted to a forced swimming pretest (PT) and, immediately after, started receiving a sequence of three ip injections (0, 5, and 23 h after PT) of Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), Venlafaxine (10 mg/kg), 7-NI (30 mg/kg) or respective vehicles. One hour after the last drug injection the animals were submitted to the test session, when immobility time was recorded. After the FST they were sacrificed and had their brains removed and processed for Fos immunohistochemistry. Independent group of non-stressed animals received the same drug treatments, or no treatment (naïve). 7-NI, Venlafaxine or Fluoxetine reduced immobility time in the FST, an antidepressant-like effect. None of the treatments induce significant changes in Fos expression per se. However, swimming stress induced significant increases in Fos expression in the following brain regions: medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, striatum, hypothalamic nucleus, periaqueductal grey, amygdala, habenula, paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, and bed nucleus of stria terminalis. This effect was attenuated by 7-NI, Venlafaxine or Fluoxetine. These results show that 7-NI produces similar behavioral and neuronal activation effects to those of typical antidepressants, suggesting that these drugs share common neurobiological substrates.
22125184	Placebo analgesia (PA) is one of the most studied placebo effects. Brain imaging studies published over the last decade, using either positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), suggest that multiple brain regions may play a pivotal role in this process. However, there continues to be much debate as to which areas consistently contribute to placebo analgesia-related networks. In the present study, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis, a state-of-the-art approach, to search for the cortical areas involved in PA in human experimental pain models. Nine fMRI studies and two PET studies investigating cerebral hemodynamic changes were included in the analysis. During expectation of analgesia, activated foci were found in the left anterior cingulate, right precentral, and lateral prefrontal cortex and in the left periaqueductal gray (PAG). During noxious stimulation, placebo-related activations were detected in the anterior cingulate and medial and lateral prefrontal cortices, in the left inferior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus, anterior insula, thalamus, hypothalamus, PAG, and pons; deactivations were found in the left mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal and precentral gyri, in the left anterior and right posterior insula, in the claustrum and putamen, and in the right thalamus and caudate body. Our results suggest on one hand that the modulatory cortical networks involved in PA largely overlap those involved in the regulation of emotional processes, on the other that brain nociceptive networks are downregulated in parallel with behavioral analgesia.

22139325	Given that a number of recent studies have shown attenuated brain activation in prefrontal regions in children with ADHD, it has been recognized as a disorder in executive function. However, fewer studies have focused exclusively on the compensatory brain activation in ADHD. The present study objective was to investigate the compensatory brain activation patterns during response inhibition (RI) processing in ADHD children. In this study, 15 ADHD children and 15 sex-, age-, and IQ-matched control children were scanned with a 3-T MRI equipment while performing a simplified letter Go/No-go task. The results showed more brain activation in the ADHD group compared with the control group, whereas the accuracy and reaction time of behavioral performance were the same. Children with ADHD did not activate the normal RI brain circuits, which are thought to be predominantly located in the right middle/inferior frontal gyrus (BA46/44), right inferior parietal regions (BA40), and pre-SMA(BA6), but instead, activated brain regions, such as the left inferior frontal cortex, the right inferior temporal cortex, the right precentral gyrus, the left postcentral gyrus, the inferior occipital cortex, the middle occipital cortex, the right calcarine, the right hippocampus, the right midbrain, and the cerebellum. Our conclusion is that children with ADHD tend to compensatorily use more posterior and diffusive brain regions to sustain normal RI function.
22219130	The pathophysiological mechanism(s) underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) still remain unclear, and no disease-modifying or prophylactic therapies are currently available. Unraveling the fundamental neuropathogenesis of AD is an important challenge. Several studies on AD have suggested lesions in a number of CNS areas including the basal forebrain, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdale/insula, and the locus coeruleus. However, plausible unifying studies on the upstream factors that involve these heterogeneous regions and herald the onset of AD pathogenesis are not available. The current article presents a novel nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) vector hypothesis that underpins several disparate biological mechanisms and neural circuits, and identifies relevant hallmarks of major presumptive causative factor(s) linked to the NTS, in older/aging individuals. Aging, obesity, infection, sleep apnea, smoking, neuropsychological states, and hypothermia-all activate inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. The synergistic impact of systemic proinflammatory mediators activates microglia and promotes neuroinflammation. Acutely, the innate immune response is protective defending against pathogens/toxins; however, when chronic, it causes neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction, particularly in brainstem and neocortex. The NTS in the brainstem is an essential multiple signaling hub, and an extremely important central integration site of baroreceptor, chemoreceptor, and a multitude of sensory afferents from gustatory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, pulmonary, and upper airway systems. Owing to persistent neuroinflammation, the dysfunctional NTS exerts deleterious impact on nucleus ambiguus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, hypoglossal, parabrachial, locus coeruleus and many key nuclei in the brainstem, and the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, and basal forebrain in the neocortex. The neuronal and synaptic dysfunction emanating from the inflamed NTS may affect its interconnected pathways impacting almost the entire CNS--which is already primed by neuroinflammation, thus promoting cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The upstream factors discussed here may underpin the neuropathopgenesis of AD. AD pathology is multifactorial; the current perspective underscores the value of attenuating disparate upstream factors--in conjunction with anticholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and anti-oxidant pharmacotherapy. Amelioration of the NTS pathology may be of central importance in countering the neuropathological cascade of AD. The NTS, therefore, may be a potential target of novel therapeutic strategies.
22306285	Sensory input from the airways to suprapontine brain regions contributes to respiratory sensations and the regulation of respiratory function. However, relatively little is known about the central organization of this higher brain circuitry. We exploited the properties of the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) to perform anterograde transneuronal tracing of the central projections of airway afferent nerve pathways. The extrathoracic trachea in Sprague-Dawley rats was inoculated with HSV-1 H129, and tissues along the neuraxis were processed for HSV-1 immunoreactivity. H129 infection appeared in the vagal sensory ganglia within 24 h and the number of infected cells peaked at 72 h. Brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus of the solitary tract and trigeminal sensory nuclei were infected within 48 h, and within 96 h infected cells were evident within the pons (lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei), thalamus (ventral posteromedial, ventral posterolateral, submedius, and reticular nuclei), hypothalamus (paraventricular and lateral nuclei), subthalamus (zona incerta), and amygdala (central and anterior amygdala area). At later times H129 was detected in cortical forebrain regions including the insular, orbital, cingulate, and somatosensory cortices. Vagotomy significantly reduced the number of infected cells within vagal sensory nuclei in the brainstem, confirming the main pathway of viral transport is through the vagus nerves. Sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the stellate and superior cervical ganglia were infected by 72 h, however, there was no evidence for retrograde transynaptic movement of the virus in sympathetic pathways in the central nervous system (CNS). These data demonstrate the organization of key structures within the CNS that receive afferent projections from the extrathoracic airways that likely play a role in the perception of airway sensations.
22541365	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to detect the alterations of spontaneous neuronal activity in various neuropsychiatric diseases, but rarely in low-grade hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a common neuropsychiatric complication of liver cirrhosis. We conducted a resting-state fMRI in 19 healthy controls, 18 cirrhotic patients without HE, and 22 cirrhotic patients with low-grade HE. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of fMRI signal was computed to measure the spontaneous neuronal activity. Several regions showing significant ALFF differences among three groups were the precuneus, occipital lobe, left frontal lobe and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, and left cerebellum posterior lobe. Compared to controls or patients without HE, patients with low-grade HE showed decreased ALFF in the precuneus and adjacent cuneus, visual cortex, and left cerebellum posterior lobe. Compared to controls, patients with low-grade HE showed higher ALFF in both cortical and subcortical regions, including the right middle cingulate gyrus, and left anterior/middle cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and lentiform nucleus; compared to patients without HE, patients with low-grade HE showed higher ALFF in the left medial frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus. Moreover, correlations between ALFF changes and poor neurocognitive performances were found in patients with low-grade HE. These results suggested the existence of aberrant brain activity at the baseline state in low-grade HE, which may be implicated in the neurological pathophysiology underlying HE.
22633752	We described the clinical course and pathological findings in a child with TUBA1A mutation. MRI revealed marked ventricular dilation with thin cortex, poorly differentiated basal ganglia, agenesis of corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia with preserved vermis at 2months of age. No gain of developmental milestones was observed until she died with respiratory failure at 23months of age. A de novo missense mutation of c.1096G>A (G366R) was identified in TUBA1A gene. Pathological findings included a lack in lamination in the cerebral cortex, absent corpus callosum without Probst bundle, blurred demarcation among the striatum, internal capsule and globus pallidus in association with irregular running of myelinated fibers, cerebellar hypoplasia with irregular undulation in the dentate nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus, absent olfactory bulbs and tracts, and pyramidal tract hypoplasia. These findings are consistent with previous reports and will be a clue to diagnosis of TUBA1A mutation.
22634385	Ghrelin is not only a modulator of feeding and energy expenditure but also regulates reproductive functions, CNS development and mood. Obesity and major depression are growing public health concerns which may derive, in part, from dysregulation of ghrelin feedback at brain regions regulating feeding and mood. We and others have previously reported that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, pGlu-His-Pro-NH(2)) and TRH-like peptides (pGlu-X-Pro-NH(2), where "X" can be any amino acid residue) have neuroprotective, antidepressant, anti-epileptic, analeptic, anti-ataxic, and anorectic properties. For this reason male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected ip with 0.1mg/kg rat ghrelin or 0.9mg/kg 3-Trp-rat ghrelin. Twelve brain regions: cerebellum, medulla oblongata, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, piriform cortex and 5 peripheral tissues (adrenals, testes, epididymis, pancreas and prostate) were analyzed. Rapid and profound decreases in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels (increased release) occurred throughout brain and peripheral tissues following ip ghrelin. Because ghrelin is rapidly deacylated in vivo we also studied 3-Trp-ghrelin which cannot be deacylated. Significant increases in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels following 3-Trp-ghrelin, relative to those after ghrelin were observed in all brain regions except posterior cingulate and all peripheral tissues except prostate and testis. The rapid stimulation of TRH and TRH-like peptide release by ghrelin in contrast with the inhibition of such release by 3-Trp-TRH is consistent with TRH and TRH-like peptides modulating the downstream effects of both ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin.
22710962	α-Synuclein pathology was examined in the brains and spinal cords of 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) in the Kii Peninsula, Japan. Various types of phosphorylated α-synuclein-positive structures including neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions were found in all ALS/PDC cases. There were phosphorylated α-synuclein-positive neurons in 8 cases (80%), and the amygdala was most severely affected. Phosphorylated α-synuclein was distributed mainly in the limbic system and brainstem; tau pathology was more prevalent than α-synuclein pathology in most affected areas. In the substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nucleus or ventral horn, and intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord, α-synuclein pathology was more predominant than tau pathology in only 1 or 2 patients. Phosphorylated α-synuclein- positive structures were not found in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Phosphorylated α-synuclein frequently colocalized with tau in neuron cell bodies, neurites, and glia. Immunoblots of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions extracted from the brain of 1 patient showed a triplet of α-synuclein-immunoreactive bands that were ubiquitinated. These results suggest that interaction between tau and α-synuclein be involved in the pathogenesis of Kii ALS/PDC.
22740031	The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) contains neurons critical for cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, and motor control. The activity of these neurons is controlled by inputs from multiple identified brain regions; however, the neurochemistry of these inputs is largely unknown. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and enkephalin tonically inhibit neurons within the RVLM. The aim of this study was to identify all brain regions that provide GABAergic or enkephalinergic input to the rat RVLM. Neurons immunoreactive for cholera toxin B (CTB-ir), retrogradely transported from the RVLM, were assessed for expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) or preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA using in situ hybridization. GAD67 mRNA was expressed in CTB-ir neurons in the following regions: the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS, 6% of CTB-ir neurons), area postrema (AP, 8%), caudal ventrolateral medulla (17%), midline raphe (40%), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG, 15%), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA, 25%), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA, 77%), sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA, 86%), interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure (IPAC, 56%), bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST, 59%), and medial preoptic area (MPA, 53%). PPE mRNA was expressed in CTB-ir neurons in the following regions: the NTS (14% of CTB-ir neurons), midline raphe (26%), LHA (22%), zona incerta (ZI, 15%), CeA (5%), paraventricular nucleus (PVN, 13%), SLEA (66%), and MPA (26%). Thus, limited brain regions contribute GABAergic and/or enkephalinergic input to the RVLM. Multiple neurochemically distinct pathways originate from these brain regions projecting to the RVLM. J.

22759909	Craving is an important factor in relapse to drug abuse, and cue-induced craving is an especially powerful form of this construct. Neuroimaging methods have been utilized to study drug cue-induced craving and neural correlates in the human brain. However, very few studies have focused on characterizing craving and the neural responses to heroin-related cues in short-term abstinent heroin-dependent patients. Twenty-four heroin-dependent subjects and 20 demographically matched drug-naïve subjects participated in this study. An event-related cue-reactivity paradigm was employed, while changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were acquired by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The heroin-dependent group reported significantly increased craving following exposure to heroin-related cues. Direct comparison between the two groups showed that brain activation to heroin-related minus neutral cues was significantly greater for the heroin-dependent group in the bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus/parahippocampus, midcingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial frontal gyrus (MeFG), midbrain, thalamus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and subcallosal gyrus. Changes in craving in the heroin-dependent group correlated positively with brain activation in the bilateral NAc, caudate, right putamen, and left ACC. The abstinence duration correlated positively with brain activation in the left caudate and right parahippocampal gyrus. In conclusion, the cue-reactivity paradigm significantly activated neural responses in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and induced increased craving in short-term abstinent heroin-dependent patients. We suggest that these response patterns characterize the high vulnerability of relapse in short-term abstinent heroin-dependent subjects.
22771856	Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common form of hereditary ataxia. In addition to proximal spinal cord and brain stem atrophy, mild to moderate atrophy of the cerebellum has been reported in advanced FRDA. The aim of this study was to examine dysfunction in motor-related areas involved in the execution of finger tapping tasks in individuals with FRDA, and to investigate functional re-organization of cortico-cerebellar, cortico-striatal and parieto-frontal loops as a result of the cerebellar pathology. Thirteen right-handed individuals with FRDA and fourteen right-handed controls participated. Functional MRI images were acquired during four different finger tapping tasks consisting of visually cued regular and irregular single finger tapping tasks, a self-paced regular finger tapping task, and a visually cued multi-finger tapping task. Both groups showed significant activation of the motor-related network including the pre-central cortex and supplementary motor area bilaterally; the left primary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex and putamen; and the right cerebellum. During the visually cued regular finger tapping task, the right hemisphere of the cerebellar cortex, bilateral supplementary motor areas and right inferior parietal cortex showed higher activation in the healthy control group, while in individuals with FRDA the left premotor cortex, left somatosensory cortex and left inferior parietal cortex were more active. In addition, during the visually cued irregular finger tapping task, the right middle temporal gyrus in the control group and the right superior parietal lobule and left superior and middle temporal gyri in the individuals with FRDA showed higher activation. During visually cued multi-finger tapping task, the control group showed higher activation in the bilateral middle frontal gyri, bilateral somatosensory cortices, bilateral inferior parietal lobules, left premotor cortex, left supplementary area, right superior frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, while individuals with FRDA showed increased activity in the left inferior parietal lobule, left primary motor cortex, left middle occipital gyrus, right somatosensory cortex and the left cerebellum. Only the right crus I/II of the cerebellum showed higher activation in individuals with FRDA during the self-paced regular finger tapping task, whereas wide-spread regions including the left superior frontal gyrus, left central opercular cortex, left somatosensory cortex, left putamen, right cerebellum, bilateral primary motor cortices, bilateral inferior parietal lobules and the left insula were more active in the control group. Although the pattern of the BOLD signal from the putamen was different during the self-paced regular finger tapping task to the other tasks in controls, in individuals with FRDA there was no distinction of the signal between the tasks suggesting that primary cerebellar pathology may cause secondary basal ganglia dysregulation. While individuals with FRDA tapped at a slightly lower rate (0.59Hz) compared with controls (0.74Hz) they showed significantly decreased activity of the SMA and the inferior parietal lobule, which may suggest disruption to the fronto-parietal connections. These findings suggest that the motor impairments in individuals with FRDA result from dysfunction extending beyond the spinal cord and cerebellum to include sub-cortical and cortical brain regions.
22813979	Functional changes in basal ganglia circuitry are responsible for the major clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Current models of basal ganglia circuitry can only partially explain the cardinal symptoms in PD. We used functional MRI to investigate the causal connectivity of basal ganglia networks from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in PD in the movement and resting state. In controls, SNc activity predicted increased activity in the supplementary motor area, the default mode network, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but, in patients, activity predicted decreases in the same structures. The SNc had decreased connectivity with the striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, default mode network, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and pons in patients compared to controls. Levodopa administration partially normalized the pattern of connectivity. Our findings show how the dopaminergic system exerts influences on widespread brain networks, including motor and cognitive networks. The pattern of basal ganglia network connectivity is abnormal in PD secondary to dopamine depletion, and is more deviant in more severe disease. Use of functional MRI with network analysis appears to be a useful method to demonstrate basal ganglia pathways in vivo in human subjects.
22855800	Alexander disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by dominant mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The disease is characterized by protein inclusions called Rosenthal fibers within astrocyte cell bodies and processes, and an antioxidant response mediated by the transcription factor Nrf2. We sought to test whether further elevation of Nrf2 would be beneficial in a mouse model of Alexander disease. Forcing overexpression of Nrf2 in astrocytes of R236H GFAP mutant mice decreased GFAP protein in all brain regions examined (olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord) and decreased Rosenthal fibers in olfactory bulb, hippocampus, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Nrf2 overexpression also restored body weights of R236H mice to near wild-type levels. Nrf2 regulates several genes involved in homeostasis of the antioxidant molecule glutathione, and the neuroprotective effects of Nrf2 in other neurological disorders may reflect restoration of glutathione to normal levels. However, glutathione levels in R236H mice were not decreased. Nrf2 overexpression did not change glutathione levels or ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (indicative of oxidative stress) in olfactory bulb, where Nrf2 dramatically reduced GFAP. Depletion of glutathione through knock-out of the GCLM (glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit) also did not affect GFAP levels or body weight of R236H mice. These data suggest that the beneficial effects of Nrf2 are not mediated through glutathione.
22937041	Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, usually occurs during early childhood and results in poor or blurred vision. Recent neuroimaging studies have found cortical structural/functional abnormalities in amblyopia. However, until now, it was still not known whether the spontaneous activity of the brain changes in amblyopia subjects. In the present study, regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of the homogeneity of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals, was used for the first time to investigate changes in resting-state local spontaneous brain activity in individuals with anisometropic amblyopia. Compared with age- and gender-matched subjects with normal vision, the anisometropic amblyopia subjects showed decreased ReHo of spontaneous brain activity in the right precuneus, the left medial prefrontal cortex, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left cerebellum, and increased ReHo of spontaneous brain activity was found in the bilateral conjunction area of the postcentral and precentral gyri, the left paracentral lobule, the left superior temporal gyrus, the left fusiform gyrus, the conjunction area of the right insula, putamen and the right middle occipital gyrus. The observed decreases in ReHo may reflect decreased visuo-motor processing ability, and the increases in ReHo in the somatosensory cortices, the motor areas and the auditory area may indicate compensatory plasticity in amblyopia.
22978651	The identification and functional understanding of the neurocircuitry that mediates alcohol and drug effects that are relevant for the development of addictive behavior is a fundamental challenge in addiction research. Here we introduce an assumption-free construction of a neurocircuitry that mediates acute and chronic drug effects on neurotransmitter dynamics that is solely based on rodent neuroanatomy. Two types of data were considered for constructing the neurocircuitry: (1) information on the cytoarchitecture and neurochemical connectivity of each brain region of interest obtained from different neuroanatomical techniques; (2) information on the functional relevance of each region of interest with respect to alcohol and drug effects. We used mathematical data mining and hierarchical clustering methods to achieve the highest standards in the preprocessing of these data. Using this approach, a dynamical network of high molecular and spatial resolution containing 19 brain regions and seven neurotransmitter systems was obtained. Further graph theoretical analysis suggests that the neurocircuitry is connected and cannot be separated into further components. Our analysis also reveals the existence of a principal core subcircuit comprised of nine brain regions: the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei. Finally, by means of algebraic criteria for synchronizability of the neurocircuitry, the suitability for in silico modeling of acute and chronic drug effects is indicated. Indeed, we introduced as an example a dynamical system for modeling the effects of acute ethanol administration in rats and obtained an increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens-a hallmark of drug reinforcement-to an extent similar to that seen in numerous microdialysis studies. We conclude that the present neurocircuitry provides a structural and dynamical framework for large-scale mathematical models and will help to predict chronic drug effects on brain function.
22982941	Objective The aim of the present work was to observe the activation/deactivation of cerebral functional regions after electroacupuncture (EA) at Yintang (EX-HN3) and GV20 by functional MRI (fMRI). Design A total of 12 healthy volunteers were stimulated by EA at Yintang and GV20 for 30 min. Resting-state fMRI scans were performed before EA, and at 5 and 15 min after needle removal. Statistical parametric mapping was used to preprocess initial data, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were analysed. Results ReHo at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the left temporal lobe and cerebellum and decreases in the left parietal lobe, occipital lobe and right precuneus. At 15 min post stimulation, ReHo showed increases in the left fusiform gyrus; lingual gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; postcentral gyrus; limbic lobe; cingulate gyrus; paracentral lobule; cerebellum, posterior lobe, declive; right cuneus and cerebellum, anterior lobe, culmen. It also showed decreases in the left frontal lobe, parietal lobe, right temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe and right cingulate gyrus. ALFF at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the right temporal lobe, but decreases in the right limbic lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus. At 15 min post stimulation ALFF showed increases in the left frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, right temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellum, but decreases in the left frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus, right frontal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus. Conclusions After EA stimulation at Yintang and GV20, which are associated with psychiatric disorder treatments, changes were localised in the frontal lobe, cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. Changes were higher in number and intensity at 15 min than at 5 min after needle removal, demonstrating lasting and strong after-effects of EA on cerebral functional regions.
22989895	The cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is widely distributed in the brains of adult vertebrates including amphibians. Several physiological roles of CART have been intensely investigated in mammals. Despite these studies, the expression of CART during development of brain has not been studied in amphibians. In the present study, distribution of CART was investigated during development in the post hatched stage 23 to premetamorphic stage 30 of frog Microhyla ornata. CART is expressed as early as in stage 23 in ventral thalamus and rhombencephalon. As development progressed, CART immunoreactivity was observed in the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, rhombencephalon and spinal cord in stage 24. At stage 25, the CART immunoreactivity was observed in the ventromedial thalamic nucleus, posterocentral thalamic nucleus, torus nucleus, central gray and inferior reticular nucleus. In stage 26, CART reactivity was seen in the medial septum, preoptic area, nucleus entopeduncularis, magnocellular nucleus, median eminence, optic tectum, hypophysis and cerebellum. Additionally, CART immunoreactivity was observed in the medial pallium, anterior commissure, nucleus infundibularis dorsalis, ventralis and raphe nucleus at stage 30. The occurrences of CART immunoreactivity at early stage of development suggest that the peptide may have a functional significance during development. The wider appearance of CART in the brain of tadpoles, M. ornata suggests that the peptide may act as a neurohormone during the ontogeny.
23056337	Levodopa (L-dopa) effects on the cardinal and axial symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) differ greatly, leading to therapeutic challenges for managing the disabilities in this patient's population. In this context, we studied the cerebral networks associated with the production of a unilateral hand movement, speech production, and a task combining both tasks in 12 individuals with PD, both off and on levodopa (L-dopa). Unilateral hand movements in the off medication state elicited brain activations in motor regions (primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, cerebellum), as well as additional areas (anterior cingulate, putamen, associative parietal areas); following L-dopa administration, the brain activation profile was globally reduced, highlighting activations in the parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. For the speech production task, brain activation patterns were similar with and without medication, including the orofacial primary motor cortex (M1), the primary somatosensory cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally, as well as the left- premotor, anterior cingulate and supramarginal cortices. For the combined task off L-dopa, the cerebral activation profile was restricted to the right cerebellum (hand movement), reflecting the difficulty in performing two movements simultaneously in PD. Under L-dopa, the brain activation profile of the combined task involved a larger pattern, including additional fronto-parietal activations, without reaching the sum of the areas activated during the simple hand and speech tasks separately. Our results question both the role of the basal ganglia system in speech production and the modulation of task-dependent cerebral networks by dopaminergic treatment.
23084984	Antidepressant treatments, including those that increase serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission, require several weeks or months until the onset of the therapeutic effect in depressed patients. The negative feedback on 5-HT transmission exhibited by the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors has been postulated as a possible delaying factor. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of the acute and subchronic treatment with pindolol, a 5-HT(1A/1B,) β(1) and β(2) adrenoceptor antagonist, on 5-HT synthesis, one of the key parameters of 5-HT neurotransmission. Male Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats (180-220g) were treated with pindolol or an adequate volume of saline, administered either acutely (15mg/kg i.p.; SPD-AC-SAL, SPD-AC-TR) or subchronically (15mg/kgday i.p. for 7days; SPD-SUBCHR-SAL, SPD-SUBCHR-TR). Thirty minutes following the single i.p. injection (acute experiment) or at the 8th day following the commencement of the subchronic treatment (subchronic experiment), 5-HT synthesis was measured using α-[(14)C]methyl-l-tryptophan autoradiography. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, revealed: (1) a significant increase of 5-HT synthesis in the SPD-AC-TR rats, relative to the SPD-AC-SAL rats in all brain regions examined except the substantia nigra - pars reticularis, dorsal subiculum, inferior olive, raphe magnus and raphe obscurus and (2) a significant increase of 5-HT synthesis in the SPD-SUBCHR-TR rats, relative to the SPD-SUBCHR-SAL rats in all brain regions except the median raphe, hypothalamus and raphe pontine. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that the antagonism of the 5-HT(1A/1B) receptors prevents the negative feedback mediated by these receptors on 5-HT synthesis, resulting in a persistent increase of 5-HT synthesis. The results accord with clinical reports on the utility of pindolol in the augmentation of antidepressant treatment.
23131737	Abstract The central mechanism of pain is influenced by multiple factors including the quality of stimulation, cognition, psychological status, environment, and genetics. The region of the brain modulated by painful sensation, taken together, are termed as "pain matrix," composing primary/secondary somatosensory area, thalamus, insula, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, limbic system, brainstem, and cerebellum. The degrees of noxious stimulation and chronic spontaneous pain are associated with activity in the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in the emotional dimension of pain. Brain activation by allodynia is observed in the thalamus, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula, and cerebellum and relates to attention and sensory-motor integration. Molecular neuroimaging studies indicate that the underlying pathophysiology of pain is related to the dopaminergic system, opioidergic system, and brain inflammation. Functional neuroimaging can elucidate the pathophysiology of acute and chronic pain syndromes, and thus objectively evaluate the degree of pain sensation, enabling us to plan pain control therapies for the future.
23133494	To investigate the release profile of met-enkephalin, β-endorphin, and dynorphin-A in ruminants' CNS, goats were stimulated by electroacupuncture of 0, 2, 40, 60, 80, or 100 Hz for 30 min. The pain threshold was measured using potassium iontophoresis. The peptide levels were determined with SABC immunohistochemisty. The results showed that 60 Hz increased pain threshold by 91%; its increasing rate was higher (P < 0.01) than any other frequency did. 2 Hz and 100 Hz increased met-enkephalin immunoactivities (P < 0.05) in nucleus accumbens, septal area, caudate nucleus, amygdala, paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe nucleus, and locus ceruleus. The two frequencies elicited β-endorphin release (P < 0.05) in nucleus accumbens, septal area, supraoptic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus ceruleus, solitary nucleus and amygdala. 60 Hz increased (P < 0.05) met-enkephalin or β-endorphin immunoactivities in the nuclei and areas mentioned above, and habenular nucleus, substantia nigra, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus raphe magnus. High frequencies increased dynorphin-A release (P < 0.05) in spinal cord dorsal horn and most analgesia-related nuclei. It suggested that 60 Hz induced the simultaneous release of the three peptides in extensive analgesia-related nuclei and areas of the CNS, which may be contributive to optimal analgesic effects and species variation.
23140215	Object   The surface of the developing fetal brain undergoes significant morphological changes during fetal growth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the morphological development of the brain sulci from the fetal to the early postnatal period.      Methods   Two hundred fourteen brain hemispheres from 107 human brain specimens were examined to evaluate the timing of sulcal formation, from its appearance to its complete development. These brains were obtained from cadavers ranging in age from 12 weeks of gestation to 8 months of postnatal life.      Results   The order of appearance of the cerebral sulci, and the number and percentages of specimens found in this study were as follows: longitudinal cerebral fissure at 12 weeks (10/10, 100%); callosal sulcus at 12 weeks (10/10, 100%); hippocampal sulcus at 15 weeks (7/10, 70%); lateral sulcus at 17 weeks (20/22, 90.9%); circular insular sulcus at 17 weeks (18/22, 81.8%); olfactory sulcus at 17 weeks (18/22, 81.8%); calcarine sulcus at 17 weeks (14/22, 63.6%); parietooccipital sulcus at 17 weeks (11/22, 50%); cingulate sulcus at 19 weeks (16/20, 80%); central sulcus at 21 weeks (22/38, 57.9%); orbital sulcus at 22 weeks (9/16, 56.2%); lunate sulcus at 24 ± 2 weeks (12/16, 75%); collateral sulcus at 24 ± 2 weeks (8/16, 50%); superior frontal sulcus at 25 ± 2 weeks (5/6, 83.3%); rhinal sulcus at 25 ± 2 weeks (3/6, 50%); precentral sulcus at 26 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); postcentral sulcus at 26 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); superior temporal sulcus at 26 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); central insular sulcus at 29 ± 2 weeks (4/4, 100%); intraparietal sulcus at 29 ± 2 weeks (2/4, 50%); paraolfactory sulcus at 29 ± 2 weeks (2/4, 50%); inferior frontal sulcus at 30 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); transverse occipital sulcus at 30 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); occipitotemporal sulcus at 30 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus at 30 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); paracentral sulcus at 30 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); subparietal sulcus at 30 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); inferior temporal sulcus at 31 ± 3 weeks (3/6, 50%); transverse temporal sulcus at 33 ± 3 weeks (6/8, 75%); and secondary sulcus at 38 ± 3 weeks (2/4, 50%).      Conclusions   The brain is subjected to considerable morphological changes throughout gestation. During fetal brain development the cortex begins to fold in, thereby increasing the cortical surface. All primary sulci are formed during fetal life. The appearance of each sulcus follows a characteristic timing pattern, which may be used as one of the reliable guides pertinent to gestational age and normal fetal development.
23145011	Neurobiological and neuroimaging studies have emphasized the structural and functional alterations in the striatum of cirrhotic patients, but alterations in the functional connections between the striatum and other brain regions have not yet been explored. Of note, manganese accumulation in the nervous system, frequently reflected by hyperintensity at the bilateral globus pallidus (GP) on T1-weighted imaging, has been considered a factor affecting the striatal and cortical functions in hepatic decompensation. We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the temporal correlation between the striatum and the remaining brain regions using seed-based correlation analyses. The two-sample t-test was conducted to detect the differences in corticostriatal connectivity between 44 cirrhotic patients with hyperintensity at the bilateral GP and 20 healthy controls. Decreased connectivity of the caudate was detected in the anterior/middle cingulate gyrus, and increased connectivity of the caudate was found in the left motor cortex. A reduction in functional connectivity was found between the putamen and several regions, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, right insular lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior lobe of the right cerebellum; increased connectivity was detected between the putamen and right middle temporal gyrus. There were significant correlations between the corticostriatal connectivity and neuropsychological performances in the patient group, but not between the striatal connectivity and GP signal intensity. These alterations in the corticostriatal functional connectivity suggested the abnormalities in the intrinsic brain functional organiztion among the cirrhotic patients with manganese deposition, and may be associated with development of metabolic encephalopathy. The manganese deposition in nervous system, however, can not be an independent factor predicting the resting-state brain dysfunction in real time.
23276479	Little is known about the neurobiology of hypokinesia in schizophrenia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate alterations of white matter motor pathways in schizophrenia and to relate our findings to objectively measured motor activity. We examined 21 schizophrenia patients and 21 healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging and actigraphy. We applied a probabilistic fibre tracking approach to investigate pathways connecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), the supplementary motor area proper (SMA-proper), the primary motor cortex (M1), the caudate nucleus, the striatum, the pallidum and the thalamus. Schizophrenia patients had lower activity levels than controls. In schizophrenia we found higher probability indices forming part of a bundle of interest (PIBI) in pathways connecting rACC, pre-SMA and SMA-proper as well as in pathways connecting M1 and pre-SMA with caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum and thalamus and a reduced spatial extension of motor pathways in schizophrenia. There was a positive correlation between PIBI and activity level in the right pre-SMA-pallidum and the left M1-thalamus connection in healthy controls, and in the left pre-SMA-SMA-proper pathway in schizophrenia. Our results point to reduced volitional motor activity and altered motor pathway organisation in schizophrenia. The identified associations between the amount of movement and structural connectivity of motor pathways suggest dysfunction of cortico-basal ganglia pathways in the pathophysiology of hypokinesia in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients may use cortical pathways involving the supplementary motor area to compensate for basal ganglia dysfunction.
23325329	Maternally deprived rats were treated with tianeptine (15 mg/kg) once a day for 14 days during their adult phase. Their behavior was then assessed using the forced swimming and open field tests. The BDNF, NGF and energy metabolism were assessed in the rat brain. Deprived rats increased the immobility time, but tianeptine reversed this effect and increased the swimming time; the BDNF levels were decreased in the amygdala of the deprived rats treated with saline and the BDNF levels were decreased in the nucleus accumbens within all groups; the NGF was found to have decreased in the hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens of the deprived rats; citrate synthase was increased in the hippocampus of non-deprived rats treated with tianeptine and the creatine kinase was decreased in the hippocampus and amygdala of the deprived rats; the mitochondrial complex I and II-III were inhibited, and tianeptine increased the mitochondrial complex II and IV in the hippocampus of the non-deprived rats; the succinate dehydrogenase was increased in the hippocampus of non-deprived rats treated with tianeptine. So, tianeptine showed antidepressant effects conducted on maternally deprived rats, and this can be attributed to its action on the neurochemical pathways related to depression.

<p>SUMMARY Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is es-sential for maintaining the balance between ex-citation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neo-cortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic in-hibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action poten-tials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a func-tion of rate and duration of presynaptic dis-charge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneu-rons combined with morphological reconstruc-tions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facili-tating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighbor-ing PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for reg-ulation of cortical activity. INTRODUCTION</p>

		<body>
<p>The neocortical microcircuit is characterized by a high degree of synaptic recurrence, in which excitatory, inhibitory, feed-forward, and feedback pathways are interweaved (Douglas and Martin, 1990; Markram et al., 2004; Miles, 1990; Szabadics et al., 2006; Thomson et al., 2002). Despite an overwhelming majority of excitatory synaptic connections, the balance between inhibition and excitation is dynamically maintained during cortical activity (Monier et al., 2003; Shu et al., 2003). Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for normal cortical activity , as excitation-inhibition imbalances are linked to various pathologies including epilepsy (Cobos et al., 2005;</p>
<p>Cossart et al., 2001; Marco et al., 1996), schizophrenia (Lewis et al., 2005), anxiety (Powell et al., 2003), and hypersensitivity (Homanics et al., 1997). Neocortical interneurons mediating this inhibition are anatomically and electrically highly diverse (Karube et al., 2004; Markram et al., 2004) and are specialized to target different elements of postsynaptic neurons (Somogyi et al., 1998). Despite the vast knowledge regarding neocortical neurons and their synaptic connections, little is known about the multisynaptic pathways that maintain the crucial balance between excitation and inhibition. The PCs in layer 5 constitute the main output layer of the neocortex, projecting to various subcortical brain areas including the striatum, brainstem nuclei, and spinal cord (Gao and Zheng, 2004; Killackey et al., 1989). The subpopulation of thick tufted PCs have dendrites that span across all cortical layers, enabling integration of activity from the entire width of the cortical sheet. The distal portions of their apical and tuft dendrites reside in layer 1, which is targeted by thalamic afferent input (Oda et al., 2004) and by top-down and multimodal afferents from other cortical areas (Cauller, 1995; Rockland and Pandya, 1979). Thicktufted layer 5 PCs thus integrate local and distal inputs across all cortical layers and convey the integrated information downstream to the rest of the nervous system. It is therefore important to understand the pathways and mechanisms that regulate the activity of these neurons and prevent their overexcitation that would result in excess activation of their subcortical targets. We describe here a prevalent disynaptic inhibitory feedback pathway between thick-tufted layer 5 neocortical PCs. This form of inhibition can be triggered by individual presynaptic neurons and displays unique spatial and temporal properties by affecting the dendrites of PCs in an activity-dependent manner. We characterize the electrophysiological , morphological and synaptic properties of this disynaptic inhibitory pathway and discuss its potential role in neocortical function.</p>

				<head>RESULTS</head>
<p>Disynaptic Inhibition between Layer 5 PCs We recorded from neighboring (lateral somatic distance less than 100 mm, mean, 46.6 mm) thick-tufted layer 5 PCs in slices of rat somatosensory cortex (see Experimental Procedures). When PCs were stimulated with trains of action potentials (APs), we often observed inhibitory responses on neighboring PCs (Figure 1). Responses occurred only after presynaptic AP bursts and were not precisely time locked to the presynaptic AP trains. They were completely abolished following bath application of 10 mM NBQX (n = 10/10), indicating the participation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Unitary connections between layer 5 PCs are strongly depressing (Markram et al., 1997) and cannot evoke postsynaptic PC discharge under our experimental conditions, indicating that the observed inhibitory events were disynaptically mediated by intermediate interneurons. Inhibitory responses were observed between neurons that were not directly connected by an excitatory connection (Figure 1A) as well as in monosynaptically connected pairs (Figure 1B). The probability for such inhibitory disynaptic connections was more than double that of excitatory monosynaptic connections between PCs (disynaptic inhibition, 27%, 392 of 1450 examined pairs; monosynaptic excitation, 12%, 173 of 1450 pairs), suggesting high connection probabilities between PCs and the mediating interneurons. The fraction of disynaptically connected pairs that also had a monosynaptic excitatory connection between them was similar to the fraction of connected pairs in the entire population (13%, 52 of 392), indicating that disynaptic connections were formed without an apparent bias toward the existence of direct excitatory connections. We observed similar disynaptic inhibitory events in older (PN 25–30) animals as well</p>
<p>(22%, 4 of 18 pairs), indicating that this pathway is not limited only to a narrow developmental period. Apart from this delayed inhibition, we found in very few cases (4 of 1450 pairs, 0.3%) a different type of disynaptic inhibition, where inhibitory responses were evoked at the onset of the presynaptic train (Figure 2A). These disynaptic responses could be evoked by a single AP and did not require a presynaptic train of APs. This type of fast inhibition is mediated by interneurons receiving depressing excitatory synapses, in which the first EPSP response to an AP train is much larger than the following EPSPs (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1998; Silberberg et al., 2004; Figure 2B). In this study, we focused on the delayed disynaptic inhibition, which was abundantly triggered by single presynaptic PCs. We used a presynaptic train of 15 APs at 70 Hz to characterize the inhibitory responses in 353 disynaptically connected PC (see Experimental Procedures). The peak amplitude of disynaptic responses was À0.8 ± 0.7 mV (values are all given in mean ± SD; range, À4.9 to +1.6 mV; Figure 1C), as measured in the soma at resting membrane potential (À60.5 ± 5.3 mV). The latency of the peak response relative to the onset of the presynaptic train was 241 ± 67 ms (94 to 410 ms; Figure 1D) and the width at half-amplitude of the response was 120 ± 46 ms (40 to 357 ms; Figure 1E). The dependence of the disynaptic inhibition on presynaptic PC activity was examined by changing the frequency and the number of APs in the presynaptic train. The</p>

<p>in the postsynaptic MC (Figures 2, 6, and S2). Increasing presynaptic stimulation frequency caused a decrease in the latency of discharge onset and an increase of discharge probability (Figure 6A), in agreement with the results describing frequency dependence of the disynaptic responses (Figure 3A). Increasing the number of APs in presynaptic trains also increased the probability for postsynaptic discharge and in some cases induced discharge of several APs (see example in Figure S2). All connections from PCs to MCs (36/36) were facilitating, with low initial release probabilities (0.09 ± 0.12, 0.003 to 0.439), long facilitation time constants (670 ± 830 ms; range, 130 to 3212 ms), and short depression time constants (138 ± 211 ms; range, 6 to 418 ms), as derived from a model for synaptic dynamics (Markram et al., 1998) using average traces of at least 30 repetitions (see Experimental Procedures). Unitary EPSPs in these synapses were relatively small (0.28 ± 0.30 mV; range, 0.09 to 0.62 mV), but in response to presynaptic AP trains they facilitated (290% ± 360% amplitude increase between the first and second EPSPs) and summated on the postsynaptic membrane to a degree that could evoke postsynaptic MC discharge (n = 19 pairs; see example in Figure 2). The average latency to MC discharge from resting potential following 70 Hz AP trains in presynaptic PCs was 152 ± 42 ms (range, 60 to 240 ms; n = 21 pairs) corresponding to 10 APs on average, and never occurred before three presynaptic APs (minimal number of all trials in all pairs). Discharge onset displayed large trial-to-trial jitter (CV 20% ± 8%), indicating the lower temporal precision in the activation of the rate-dependent pathway, in comparison to the immediate response observed in the fast pathway (see Figure 2B for comparison). The synaptic connections from MCs to PCs displayed synaptic depression (16/16 connections; Figure 6B), with higher release probabilities (0.30 ± 0.08; failure rate, 7.2% ± 9.4%; range, 0% to 30%), longer depression time constants (1250 ± 520 ms; range, 660 to 2480 ms), and very short facilitation (2 ± 4 ms; range, 1 to 14 ms). Monosynaptic IPSPs had small mean amplitudes (À0.5 ± 0.4 mV; range, À0.1 to À1.7 mV, recorded at a holding potential of À57.3 ± 3.2 mV), long rise times (16.1 ± 4.2 ms; range, 9.7 to 25.1 ms, measured between 10%–90% of the amplitude), and long peak latencies (27.4 ± 5.7 ms; range, 17 to 39 ms). These kinetics are longer than those we observed for synapses between basket cells and PCs (rise time, 6.3 ± 1.3 ms; peak latency, 15.9 ± 2.7 ms; n = 8), as expected for dendritic compared to perisomatic inhibition. The smaller amplitudes of monosynaptic IPSPs in comparison to the larger amplitudes of disynaptic events suggest the involvement of more than a single intermediate interneuron (see also Figure S2).

<p>(A) The PC to interneuron synapse. An example of an excitatory facilitating connection between a layer 5 PC (black traces) and MC (red traces). The presynaptic PC was stimulated with trains of eight APs at different frequencies (20, 40, and 70 Hz). Shown are examples of recordings from the postsynaptic MC (individual traces in red, average traces in black). Higher train frequency evoked postsynaptic APs with higher probability and shorter onset latency (indicated by red arrows), in agreement with the frequency dependence of disynaptic responses (Figures 3A and 3B). (B) The interneuron to PC synapse. Depressing inhibitory connections between a layer 5 MC (red traces) and two neighboring PCs (blue and black traces). The PC in black was reciprocally connected to the MC and could evoke postsynaptic discharge following an AP train. The single IPSPs were recorded at different somatic holding potentials of the postsynaptic PC (upper traces), demonstrating the hyperpolarized synaptic reversal potential, similar to the values obtained for disynaptic responses (see Figure 4B). The same synaptic connection was activated by a train of eight APs at 20 Hz (lower traces), showing activity-dependent synaptic depression. (C) The complete pathway. Example of a complete disynaptic connection, as recorded from two neighboring PCs and an intermediate MC. AP trains (70 Hz, 15 APs) evoked in the presynaptic PC (black) activated a facilitating connection in the postsynaptic MC (red traces). The synaptic activation was sufficient to evoke MC discharge, which resulted in IPSPs in the postsynaptic neighboring PC (blue traces, average of 30 sweeps in black).</p>
<p>reversal potentials of these connections were more negative than the GABAa reversal potentials of monosynaptic connections (À88 ± 14 mV; range, À65.4 to À103.8; n = 6; see Figure 6B), similar to the values observed for disynaptic pairs (Figure 4D).</p>
<p>A Spread of Postsynaptic Locations We investigated the synaptic contacts from MCs to PCs by performing 3D morphological reconstructions of MC-PC connected pairs (see Experimental Procedures). Putative synaptic contacts were defined according to the existence of axo-dendritic appositions and an axonal bouton swelling (Figure 7C). Putative synapses were found in all reconstructed MC-PC pairs (12 ± 3 contacts per pair, n = 4 pairs), located on apical (25%), oblique (31%), and tuft (44%) dendrites of PCs (Figures 7C and S3). These data are consistent with previous classifications of MCs as dendritic targeting interneurons (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997; Somogyi et al., 1998). The distance between putative synaptic contacts and somata of PCs ranged between 186 and 1146 mm (593 ± 296 mm) along the dendrite (Figure S3). These values are significantly larger than distances reported for contacts between layer</p>
<p>5 PCs (Markram et al., 1997) and from basket cells to PCs (Gupta et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2002). We calculated the electrotonic attenuation for 48 putative synaptic contacts using the 3D morphological reconstruction and computer simulations using the NEURON simulator (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S3). Voltage attenuation from the synaptic contact to the soma was calculated for steady state (DC) and for time-varying (AC) signals corresponding to PSPs at putative contacts (Figure S3). The DC attenuation (soma/dendrite voltage ratio) varied between 0.02 and 0.84 (0.30 ± 0.23, n = 48), and the AC signal attenuation was between 0.002 and 0.61 (0.11 ± 0.13). The attenuation for 21 synaptic contacts located on the dendritic tuft was 0.097 ± 0.076 and 0.014 ± 0.015 for DC and AC attenuation, respectively. The wide distribution of dendritic locations for the MC to PC putative synaptic contacts may account for the variability observed in amplitudes, latencies, and somatic reversal potentials of disynaptic responses, as all these values depend on the dendritic location of synaptic contacts. Synaptic connections between PCs and MCs were also characterized by multiple putative contacts (8.6 ± 2.1 contacts per synaptic connection, n = 15 pairs). Synaptic</p>

<p>contacts were located at 134 ± 84 mm from MC somata (range between 22 and 337 mm), and targeted mainly dendritic branches between the third and fifth orders (ranging between first and sixth order, 4%, 11%, 21%, 32%, 18%, and 14%, respectively). Interestingly, synaptic contacts were unevenly distributed and mainly located at descending dendritic branches, below MC somata (104/126, 83% of synaptic contacts; see examples in Figure S3).</p>
<p>High Recurrence of Disynaptic Connectivity We observed a high degree of divergence, convergence, and reciprocity in disynaptic connections recorded from clusters of 3 or more neighboring PCs (examples in Figure S4). Divergence in connectivity was observed in 61% of connections (n = 183/300), convergence in 50% (n = 150/300), and 33% (n = 98/300) of disynaptic connections were reciprocal. This dense disynaptic connectivity suggests a high probability for monosynaptic interconnectivity between PCs and MCs. We observed such a high degree of monosynaptic connectivity in connected clusters of PCs and MCs, in which 68% of neighboring PCs contacted the same MC, and an even higher rate of MC to PC divergence, where MCs contacted 79% of neighboring recorded PCs. Convergence of PC to MC connectivity was also suggested from the cooperative stimulation of several presynaptic PCs, resulting in combined responses that were in many cases larger or smaller than the sum of individual responses (supra-and sublinear summation, respectively, see example for supralinear summation in Figure S4B). If the different presynaptic PCs would only engage nonoverlapping sets of interneurons , the responses would be expected to summate almost linearly, assuming only little dendritic nonlinear amplification of IPSPs. Supralinear summation could occur when individual activation of presynaptic PCs evokes interneuron discharge only with low reliability, but when two presynaptic PCs are coactivated, the target interneuron will discharge reliably. The observed nonlinear responses strongly indicate that interneurons were excited by several presynaptic neighboring PCs even in the reduced connectivity of the slice preparation. When recording from complete pathways (presynaptic PC, discharging intermediate MC, and a postsynaptic PC), we observed inhibitory responses also (1) when the intermediate MCs failed to discharge, (2) when the intermediate MCs were actively prevented from discharging by injection of hyperpolarizing current (Figure S2), (3) in other PCs that did not receive direct inhibition from the recorded MC. These inhibitory responses demonstrate the parallel activation of several interneurons in mediating the response and not only the single recorded MC. The amplitude of monosynaptic MC-PC connections was smaller than the disynaptic responses, ranging from 22% to 98% (65% ± 27%, n = 7). In four cases, we also quantified the contribution of the recorded interneuron to the overall response by comparing the response evoked by a single MC to the overall disynaptic response (Figure S2). In these experiments, we alternately prevented the recorded MC from discharge by injection of a hyperpolarizing current step at every second trial. We then subtracted the average postsynaptic response from the control response, in which the interneuron was allowed to discharge. The comparison yielded ratios of 1.1, 1.7, 2.2, and 2.5 between the amplitudes of the total disynaptic response and the response evoked by the single MCs, corresponding to 40%–90% contribution of a single MC to the overall response. The above data shows that the disynaptic interaction between PC pairs is mediated by several interneurons in parallel as a result of PC-MC divergence and MC-PC convergence. We recorded only from groups of neighboring layer 5 PCs and interneurons; thus, it is possible that part of the disynaptic response is mediated by more distal interneurons, perhaps in other layers. Our data predicts that these interneurons also receive facilitating synapses from PCs and provide GABAa mediated inhibition to PC dendrites. In addition to the prevalent disynaptic connectivity between neighboring PCs, we also found a high prevalence of self-inhibition mediated by reciprocal PC-MC connections , with 77% of MCs in complete disynaptic clusters inhibiting also the presynaptic PCs (Figures 6B and 7C). In these cases, activation of the intermediate MC resulted in inhibition of the presynaptic PC as well as that of the neighboring PC. Disynaptic responses evoked in the presynaptic PC are not easily detected due to the large conductance accompanying the AP train, yet the reciprocal synaptic connections reveal the existence of such inhibitory feedback loops. Examples for MC inhibition of both the triggering (presynaptic) PC as well as a neighboring PC are shown in Figures 6 and 7 (electrophysiology and morphology, respectively). Our results show that MCs inhibit with high probability the same presynaptic PCs that initiate their activity, as well as closely neighboring PCs. This high degree of convergence, divergence, and reciprocity in the connectivity between PCs and MCs results in a widespread inhibitory impact following burst activation of a single layer 5 PC. In addition to the monosynaptic excitation of a small fraction of neighboring PCs, high frequency activation exerts inhibition in a significantly larger number of PCs by recruitment of interneurons via facilitating synapses, suggesting that under different activity states, the impact of an individual PC on its neighbors can functionally transform from excitation to inhibition.</p>
<p>Subcolumnar Feedback Inhibition The prevalence of disynaptic events is striking in view of the small numbers of MCs in the neocortical microcircuitry (less than 5% of all cortical neurons [Markram et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004]) and is due to the high degree of divergence and convergence in PC-MC interconnectivity (see previous section). The number of boutons on a layer 5 MC axon is roughly 3000, of which 90% are formed on PCs (Karube et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004), yielding only a few hundreds of postsynaptic PCs targeted by a single MC. The dense connectivity between MCs and neighboring PCs together with the high degree of self-inhibition,</p>
<p>suggest that despite the wide arborization of the axons and dendrites of both MCs and PCs, MCs effectively inhibit PCs within subcolumnar dimensions. This preference of close neighboring PCs is due to the ascending axons of MCs forming multiple synaptic contacts on the apical and oblique dendrites as well as the distal tuft dendrites (Figures 7 and S3). More distal PCs, however, are likely to receive inhibition only to the tuft dendrites in layer 1, reducing both probability for synaptic connections and their visibility in somatic recordings. Indeed, disynaptic connectivity between PCs drops by almost a ten-fold for intersomatic distances larger than 50 mm (Rinaldi et al., 2005), indicating that this form of disynaptic inhibition may act mainly within the dimensions of neocortical minicolumns.</p>

				<head>DISCUSSION</head>
<p>We described a novel disynaptic inhibitory feedback pathway between neocortical PCs. In short, PCs in layer 5 of rat neocortex evoked inhibitory responses in neighboring PCs via a disynaptic pathway, following high-frequency trains of APs. The amplitude and latency of inhibitory responses depended on the presynaptic AP train duration and frequency. The prevalence of these inhibitory responses was more than twice that of direct excitatory connections between these neurons, as revealed by recordings of more than 1400 neuron pairs. Interneurons participating in this rate-dependent feedback inhibition were MCs, characterized by ascending axons and arborization in cortical layer 1. These interneurons receive facilitating excitatory connections from PCs and provide reliable , depressing, GABAergic input onto PC apical and tuft dendrites. As revealed by anatomy, electrophysiology, and pharmacology, stimulation of a PC induces delayed inhibition of the same presynaptic PC as well as its close neighbors. This pathway is therefore a feedback pathway, providing rate dependent self-inhibition for populations of neighboring thick-tufted layer 5 PCs. Interestingly, the axonal arborization of MCs exhibits substantial morphological overlap with the apical and tuft dendrites of thicktufted PCs, ascending to layer 1 and spreading laterally therein. MCs are therefore not only involved in gain control of local PC populations, but provide a major source of inhibition to the tuft dendrites in layer 1, thus influencing dendritic integration. Fragments of this pathway have been described in previous studies, including the activation of interneurons by train stimulation of single presynaptic PCs (Kozloski et al., 2001; Markram et al., 1998) and GABAergic inhibition of distal dendrites of PCs (Larkum et al., 1999; Perez-Garci et al., 2006). In the hippocampus, disynaptic inhibition was observed between neighboring PCs (Miles, 1990) and dendritic inhibition was shown to affect the generation of dendritic calcium spikes (Miles et al., 1996). Hippocampal interneurons inhibiting distal dendrites of PCs are the oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells. These interneurons share numerous features with neocortical MCs, in that they receive facilitating excitatory connections (Ali and Thomson, 1998), express somatostatin (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996), display discharge frequency accommodation and Ih-mediated sag response to hyperpolarizing current step (Ali and Thomson, 1998), and importantly, target the distal dendritic portions of PCs (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996). Dendritic inhibition of hippocampal PCs has also been shown to be activated by high-frequency stimulation of neighboring PC axons (Pouille and Scanziani , 2004), suggesting that this type of feedback inhibition is a common feature in cortical microcircuits. Disynaptic inhibition was, however, not observed within the subpopulation of nontufted layer 5 PCs projecting to the contralateral hemisphere (Le Be et al., 2007), pointing toward a specialization of this disynaptic pathway within the microcircuitry. In our study, we focused on neighboring interneurons (within 100 mm somatic distance) and found only MCs as the interneurons participating in the described pathway. This does not rule out the possibility that other GABAergic neurons, perhaps neurons residing in other layers, that receive facilitating excitation (Kaiser et al., 2004; Reyes et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2002) and target PC dendrites are involved as well. The described disynaptic pathway conveys the firing rate as well as the number of spikes discharged by the presynaptic PC, in accordance with models of excitatory facilitating synapses (Tsodyks et al., 1998). This type of disynaptic inhibition is therefore proportional to the activity level of neighboring PC populations. Another type of disynaptic inhibition is activated by the onset of presynaptic discharge, involving depressing excitatory synapses onto other types of interneurons (Figure 2). Activation of this immediate inhibitory pathway by individual presynaptic PCs was much less frequent under our experimental conditions but was facilitated by coincident discharge of several presynaptic PCs (Figure S4A). The two pathways convey different features of PC activity, suggesting that they have different functions during cortical activity. The thick tufted PCs of layer 5 are the main source of cortical projections to the tectum, brainstem, and spinal cord, and this type of inhibition may ensure a controlled output even at high levels of excitation of the cortical column . The involvement in feedback self-inhibition rather than competitive processing suggests that this pathway is important in preventing overactivation of cortical PCs, which may be important in the prevention of epilepsy. Indeed , a correlation was described between selective loss of hippocampal somatostatin-positive dendritic-targeting interneurons and epileptic states (Buckmaster and Jongen-Relo , 1999; Cossart et al., 2001). Our results show that during low discharge rates, the main effect of PCs on neighboring PCs is excitatory via monosynaptic connections , but during high-frequency bursts, the impact switches and becomes predominantly inhibitory via the disynaptic pathway. Besides its function as a mechanism to self-regulate neocortical activity, the disynaptic Martinotti pathway provides inhibition to distal PC dendrites in layer 1. In</p>
<p>neocortical PCs, inhibitory inputs to distal apical and tuft dendrites are largely attenuated by the passive cable properties, making them significantly less effective than perisomatic IPSPs in controlling somatic potential and discharge (Williams and Stuart, 2003). Input from individual GABAergic interneurons to the distal portions of apical dendrites of layer 5 PCs can, however, prevent the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes (Larkum et al., 1999). The Martinotti pathway therefore serves as a negative feedback capable of preventing the prolonged regeneration of calcium spikes. This is further supported by the fact that dendritic calcium spikes cause high-frequency bursting of PCs (Larkum et al., 2001; Oakley et al., 2001; Stuart et al., 1997). The high-frequency discharge of PCs is effective in causing MC discharge, which in turn inhibit the source of the calcium spike at the distal PC dendrites. Such inhibition of calcium spikes was demonstrated in hippocampal PCs by extracellular stimulation of dendritic-targeting inhibitory afferents (Miles et al., 1996). Distal apical and tuft dendrites of PCs are the targets of &apos;&apos;topdown&apos;&apos; cortical excitatory input. Inhibition of the distal PC dendrites therefore provides a cellular and synaptic mechanism to control the integration of long-range afferent input with local microcircuit processing. To conclude, we reported here a prevalent inhibitory feedback pathway between neocortical pyramidal neurons and propose it as a key component in the neocortical microcircuit, affecting short-as well as long-range cortical processing.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Slice Preparation and Recordings Parasaggital slices (300 mm thick) were obtained from Wistar rats (PN 14–16) according to the Swiss guidelines for animal experiments. Slices were cut in ice-cold extracellular solution then kept in 33 C– 35 C for at least 30 min and then moved to room temperature (20 C–22 C) before recordings. Whole-cell patch recordings were performed at 35 C ± 0.5 C in layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex. Neurons were visualized using IR-DIC microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop). In order to preserve the entire span of dendritic and axonal trees of PCs and MCs, only parallel slices were used for experiments, as determined by the projection of PC apical dendrites. Recorded neurons were selected visually according to the somatic and dendritic morphology , and up to seven neighboring neurons with lateral somatic distances less than 100 mm (47 ± 35 mm) were simultaneously recorded (setup manufactured by Luigs &amp; Neumann). PCs were easily distinguished from interneurons by their pronounced apical dendrite and large soma. MCs, however, were not identifiable as such under infrared microscopy and were classified only after electrophysiological recordings and biocytin staining. The extracellular solution (both for cutting and recording) contained 125 mM NaCl, 25 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO 3 , 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 . Recordings were amplified using axopatch 200B amplifiers (Molecular Devices), filtered at 2 KHz, digitized (5–20 KHz) using ITC-18 (Instrutech), and acquired using PulseQ electrophysiology package (Funetics) running on Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Patch pipettes with resistances of 5–10 MU and 15–20 MU were used for somatic and dendritic recordings, respectively, containing 110 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM ATP, 0.3 mM GTP, 10 mM phosphocreatine , and 0.4%–0.5% biocytin. Access resistance was compensated throughout the experiments, and data were discarded when they increased beyond 30 MU or 60 MU for somatic and dendritic recordings, respectively. In most experiments, the chloride concentration in the recording pipette was 10 mM, predicting a GABAa reversal potential of $À59 mV. In some experiments, KCl in the pipette solution was increased to 100 mM and K-gluconate was reduced to 20 mM in order to obtain a depolarized reversal potential for GABAa ($À5mV). Synaptic responses (both mono-and disynaptic) were stable and could be recorded up to several hours after obtaining whole-cell recordings without any apparent rundown. An intertrial interval of 15 s was used for disynaptic protocols to enable sufficient recovery of the inhibitory response.</p>
<p>Electrophysiology Disynaptic connections were quantified by stimulation of single presynaptic PCs with trains of 15 APs with a frequency of 70 Hz, with 15 s intervals between stimulation trials. APs were evoked by injection of 3 ms square pulses to presynaptic neurons. The existence of disynaptic responses was determined by a deviation of at least 2.5-fold from the baseline standard deviation in average traces of 30 trials. Average postsynaptic traces of at least 30 trials were used to characterize the disynaptic events by fitting them with a Gaussian function enabling extraction of the peak amplitude, latency, and width at halfamplitude of disynaptic responses. Experiments that determined the frequency and AP number dependence (as in Figure 3) were performed by shuffling stimulations of different frequencies and train durations, in order not to introduce a systematic bias. In experiments that determined the somatic reversal potential (Figure 5), holding currents were injected manually, and access resistance was checked and compensated before recording at each holding potential. Dendritic recordings were obtained from apical dendrites at distances between 250 and 550 mm, after following the ascending apical dendrite by using the IR-DIC optics. Transition from on-cell to whole-cell configuration was achieved in most cases by application of a short (2 ms) pulse of negative current injection and not by negative pressure as used in somatic recordings. This method provided higher stability of the pipette tip on the dendrite, resulting in lower access-resistance and less failures in obtaining whole-cell dendritic recordings. Parameters describing the dynamics of recorded synapses included the synaptic utilization parameter, U (equivalent to the average release probability), the time constants of recovery from depression (D), and facilitation (F). These parameters were extracted by using the model for synaptic dynamics as previously described (Markram et al., 1998; Tsodyks et al., 1998).</p>
<p>Morphological Reconstruction and Analysis Recorded neurons were filled with biocytin and stained for lightmicroscopy morphological identification and 3D reconstruction, according to the detailed procedure described previously (Wang et al., 2004). MCs were identified by their typical axonal arborization, ascending vertically up to layer 1, and bifurcating therein (Wang et al., 2004). Neurons were 3D morphologically reconstructed using Neurolucida (Microbrightfield) under light microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope fitted with a 603/0.9 water-immersion objective (Olympus). Putative synaptic contacts were determined according to the existence of an axo-dendritic apposition and a presynaptic bouton swelling at the touch site (see Figure 7). Identification of synaptic contacts by light microscopy with biocytin staining has been used in previous studies of this kind and verified with electron microscopy (Lü bke et al., 2000; Markram et al., 1997; Silver et al., 2003; Tamas et al., 1997, 1998, 2004; Wang et al., 2002). The reported correlation between light and electron microscopy is high (Markram et al., 1997; Silver et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002), with light microscopy reported to typically underestimate contact numbers (Tamas et al., 1998, 2004). In order to extract the geometrical and electrotonic distances for the different synaptic location, we loaded the morphology file from Neurolucida into the NEURON simulator (Hines and Carnevale, 1997). Values for electrotonic attenuation and electrotonic distance, defined as the natural logarithm of the voltage attenuation (Carnevale et al., 1995), were extracted for all synaptic contacts (Figure S3) using the path impedance tool in NEURON. The parameters used for simulations were as follows: Rm (specific membrane resistance) of 25,000 Ucm 2 and Ra (specific axial resistance) of 155 Ucm.</p>
